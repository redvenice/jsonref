One answer to that is to classify certain citizens as “key workers”: people who work in health, food, transport, utilities, and so forth. Though this phrase has the doomy smell of modern bureaucratic jargon (as in key stakeholders, key performance indicators, and the like), it is actually more than a century old.Some years ago a Whitehall style guide tried to ban the adjectival use of “key” to mean “important” – rather quixotically, since this sense has been around since the mid-19th century. Within a few decades, the first “key workers” appeared: they were telegraph operators (who literally pressed keys in Morse code), or, more punningly, burglars who picked locks. In the mid-20th century “key worker” acquired its present, chiefly British, sense of people considered essential to maintaining the productive peace of entire communities.In modern times, though, “key worker” has often been used as a rhetorical pat on the head to those whom society nonetheless deems unworthy of pay commensurate with their social importance.

Banks have also been told that they can’t suspend cards during this period.If you have a personal loan, credit card, store card, catalogue credit, guarantor loan (such as Amigo), logbook loan or home collected credit (also known as doorstep lending) you can ask for a freeze on repayments for three months.Payday loans are not yet covered by the rules and neither are cars bought on hire purchase or through a leasing deal. But the FCA said: “We are looking at these areas, and other specialist types of lending, and expect to announce specific proposals in due course.”Peer-to-peer loans – such as those from Zopa and Ratesetter, do not come under the rules, although the FCA said it expects firms to help customers who are struggling. Business credit cards are also excluded from the rules.As with mortgage payment holidays, these payment freezes are not free. Customers will still have to pay the accrued interest once the deferral period ends.• OverdraftsAnyone with an arranged overdraft can ask for up to £500 of overdraft borrowing with no interest for three months. If your current arranged overdraft is below £500, you will not pay any interest on the amount of your current overdraft limit. If you don’t have an overdraft, or your limit is smaller than £500, you can request a new overdraft or an increased limit, but this will be subject to normal checks on affordability.• Credit recordsAnyone using these measures shouldn’t have their credit record affected. The FCA said firms will be expected to “ensure consumers using any of these temporary payment freeze measures will not have their credit file affected”.• When banks can refuseThe FCA has caveated its rules, saying there are situations where a lender can refuse a payment deferral. In its guidance, the FCA said: “A firm should grant the customer a payment deferral for three months unless the firm determines (acting reasonably) that it is obviously not in the customer’s interests to do so.”People with very high interest credit cards (usually those on the lowest incomes) who are suffering problems repaying may receive extra help. “Firms should review their prices to consider whether they are consistent with the obligation to treat customers fairly in the light of the exceptional circumstances arising out of coronavirus in order to ensure that they do not pose unjustifiable burdens on these customers who may be experiencing temporary payment difficulties,” said the FCA.• TimescalesCustomers who are struggling do not have to apply immediately – the FCA said they should be able to request a payment deferral at any point in the next three months."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6176ff7d96d52a650fe00f582b601da684cd5c03/0_186_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ed3333632f865017994fc784027fa1a4","title":"debenhams appoints administrators and liquidates irish chain","story":"Department store’s move axes 1,200 jobs in Ireland but buys time to save UK businessDebenhams has fallen into administration, casting fresh doubt over the future of the struggling chain, which has also said it will not reopen its Irish stores, resulting in 1,400 job losses.The company, which has around 20,000 employees and 142 stores, confirmed the appointment of restructuring firm FRP Advisory as administrators and said its first move would be to place its Irish chain into liquidation. Debenhams had said it would go into administration at the start of this week after it faced legal action that could have forced the closure of the whole business.Stefaan Vansteenkiste, chief executive of Debenhams, said: “We are desperately sorry not to be able to keep the Irish business operating but are faced with no alternative option in the current environment. This decision has not been taken lightly and is no way a reflection on our Irish colleagues, whose professionalism and commitment to serving our customers has never been in question.”The Irish chain has 11 stores, including four in Dublin and two in Cork. The workforce included 950 Debenhams staff and 450 people working for in-store concessions. The staff have already been stood down under the Irish government’s wage support scheme.Debenhams’ owners and lenders are expected to make additional funding available to fund the administration period, Vansteenkiste said. “In these unprecedented circumstances the appointment of the administrators will protect our business, our employees and other important stakeholders, so that we are in a position to resume trading from our stores when government restrictions are lifted.”The retailer’s stores are closed due to the government-mandated shutdown, although its website is still operating. The majority of its UK workforce has been furloughed.Debenhams, which is hobbled by a £600m debt pile, was listed on the stock exchange until last April, when its deteriorating finances resulted in an administration that wiped out shareholders and transferred ownership to a group of financial investors that includes the US hedge funds Silver Point and .Like other struggling chains, it has used an insolvency process known as a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) to cut rents and close unprofitable stores including a group of 19 shops in January. It is currently trying to negotiate a fresh round of rent reductions with landlords.Sofie Willmott, a retail analyst at consultancy firm GlobalData, said Debenhams’ second administration in 12 months was “stringing out its demise and its long-term future remains bleak”. “With significant further investment in the business now very unlikely, it is difficult to see what will attract shoppers back once its stores can reopen.“The department store chain was in already trouble before the Covid-19 pandemic hit and the sharp shift in consumer shopping habits will only speed up inevitable changes in the UK market. Weaker retailers without a unique selling point will be weeded out, with many unable to survive the year.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1211b57c2b1fb0d1a32298300ed360eb6f79bced/0_86_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8e02940d8551bc299cb84eada893a5f2","title":"imf chief flags up grim global economic forecast covid 19","story":"Kristalina Georgieva says Covid-19 pandemic has spawned ‘economic crisis like no other’The head of the International Monetary Fund has warned that all but a handful of the organisation’s 189 member states will suffer falling standards of living this year as a result of the worst global economic crisis since the 1930s.Kristalina Georgieva said the sudden onset of the Covid-19 pandemic meant the IMF’s new forecasts for the world economy were going to be grim when released next week – and there was a risk that the impact could be even worse than currently expected. She said more than 170 countries will suffer a reversal of living standards in 2020. “Today we are confronted with a crisis like no other,” Georgieva said in a speech designed to set the scene for next week’s spring meeting of the IMF, being held virtually this year as a result of the pandemic.The IMF managing director said there was still “extraordinary uncertainty” about the depth and duration of a crisis that began in the Chinese city of Wuhan in January. She added that it was already clear that global growth would turn sharply negative in 2020. “In fact, we anticipate the worst economic fallout since the Great Depression.“Just three months ago, we expected positive per capita income growth in over 160 of our member countries in 2020. Today, that number has been turned on its head: we now project that over 170 countries will experience negative per capita income growth this year.”Georgieva said the crisis knew no geographic boundaries and the “bleak outlook” applied to advanced and developing economies alike. “Everybody hurts. Given the necessary containment measures to slow the spread of the virus, the world economy is taking a substantial hit.”She added, however, that the pandemic was likely to hit vulnerable countries hardest, adding that more than 90 nations had now sought help from the IMF in recent weeks following a fall in demand, more expensive borrowing and a drop in commodity prices.Capital flight from emerging market economies – seen as risky by investors during crises – had amounted to about $100bn (£80bn) in the last two months – more than three times the outflows seen during the financial crisis of 2008.Georgieva stressed the need for next week’s spring meeting to offer debt relief and to agree an increase in the IMF’s financial firepower so it could help more poor countries through the crisis.“Emerging markets and low-income nations – across Africa, Latin America, and much of Asia – are at high risk. With weaker health systems to begin with, many face the dreadful challenge of fighting the virus in densely populated cities and poverty-stricken slums—where social distancing is hardly an option.”Despite the desire of governments to end the lockdown of their economies as quickly as possible, Georgieva said there was no trade-off between saving lives and saving livelihoods. Containment and the strengthening of health systems remained the first of the IMF’s four priorities.In addition, Georgieva said, governments needed to shield affected people and firms with large, timely, targeted fiscal and financial sector measures reduce stress to the financial system and avoid contagion and plan for recovery.The IMF boss said it was encouraging that governments had moved so quickly and that there had been significant co-ordination. Governments had agreed fiscal – tax and spending – measures amounting to $8tn, in addition to the massive stimulus provided by central banks.“There is no question that 2020 will be exceptionally difficult. If the pandemic fades in the second half of the year – thus allowing a gradual lifting of containment measures and reopening of the economy – our baseline assumption is for a partial recovery in 2021. But again, I stress there is tremendous uncertainty around the outlook: it could get worse depending on many variable factors, including the duration of the pandemic.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d3f8830fbfe7db85ca8fef5107eac364e65124d8/0_80_4973_2983/master/4973.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=121eed83c453b2449b457c7e18b75695","title":"uk economy already flatlining before coronavirus figures reveal","story":"Stagnation in services sector and winter drop in construction activity hit GDP growthGovernment to back £330bn of loans to support businesses through a Bank of England scheme for big firms.

This surplus was caused by a large fall in goods imported from EU countries,” he said.The general secretary of trade union body the TUC, Frances O’Grady, said: “Even before the coronavirus crisis hit, our economy needed a change of direction.“While the priority now is to contain the spread of the virus, today’s figures highlight the need for a robust recovery strategy. We must tackle longstanding economic inequalities, not reinforce them.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55c049506fca54cf8cf1d60a9e47f7d04f3cb979/0_167_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0726c63eacd9108088736d79f7184e18","title":"markets opec us jobless unemployment gdp economy covid 19 business live","story":"Rolling coverage of the latest economic and financial news as oil prices swing on production cut hopes and EU nears rescue dealRussia’s wealth fund head has told Reuters that Saudi Arabia and Russia have overcome their differences - but that it is very important that countries outside the Opec+ cartel (such as the US, Canada and Brazil) share the pain.The number being bandied about is edging back up to the 20m barrels per day mark that caused the spike in oil prices earlier this afternoon.OPEC, Russia and other allied producers, a grouping known as OPEC+, are considering cutting their oil output by more than 12m barrels per day and want other producers to contribute cuts of 5m, an OPEC+ source said on Thursday.Dominic Raab, standing in for Boris Johnson, is giving the government’s daily briefing.Johnson remains in intensive care.You can follow Raab here:There is a lot going on in markets today: while the Eurogroup wrangling nears its end and markets digest the Federal Reserve’s massive stimulus, the oil price surge has pretty much reversed.Take a look at the spike in the below graph. Opec meetings are always the occasion for oil price volatility, but with so many factors in play (Russia, the US, the coronavirus recession) there is a lot of scope for big swings.Opec sources told Reuters a production cut of 20m barrels per day could be in order - about a fifth of global supplies - but there are doubts as to whether that is achievable.EU finance leaders are “very close” to a deal, says Eurogroup president Mário Centeno.

It could defer another five in 2022 if demand does not pick back up. Within the next 16 months easyJet also has 24 operating leases due for renewal which it could delay or cancel.Airbus has cut back its plane production rate to cope with lower demand, with airlines trying to hoard cash as they go for months without revenues.And easyJet’s founder and largest shareholder, Stelios Haji-Ioannou, has repeatedly called (in very colourful terms) for the airline’s orders for new planes to be scrapped.Our industry is facing unprecedented challenges which require unprecedented action. As we have consistently said, we remain completely focused on improving short term liquidity and reducing expenditure across the business. Today I am pleased to announce that we have agreed with Airbus to amend our delivery schedule by deferring the purchase of 24 aircraft, providing a significant boost to our cash flow and a vast reduction to our near-term capex programme. In addition, we have 24 leases up for renewal over the next 16 months, which gives us another level of flexibility to respond to future demand.The euro has risen to its highest level today after Germany’s finance minister, Olaf Scholz, said it appeared that the EU would reach a deal on an economic support package.EU finance ministers had reconvened today after failing to agree a deal on Tuesday in 16-hour talks.

Here is a flavour of the big jump in oil prices in recent minutes.Brent crude futures prices, the North Sea oil benchmark, rose to almost $36 per barrel, slightly below their highest level since the crisis hit Europe in the middle of March.

Although the sudden switch to large-scale deficit spending has caused anxiety among some conservatives, so far the policies have enjoyed widespread support.However, government should not lose sight of the need for its policies to be seen to be fair. A good start would be to avoid handing out significant amounts of money to companies that simply don’t need the cash – especially when so many smaller firms are struggling to get access to government support and going out of business.No one can deny that the supermarkets are doing an amazing job of keeping the nation supplied. Their workers are putting themselves at risk every day, many earning less than those who are being paid to stay at home. The enormous shift in social habits that has taken place in a matter of days will be putting huge pressure on management, supply teams and other core functions. According to this week’s stock market update, Tesco has recruited 45,000 new staff in thepast two weeks. Rightly, we need to thank all working in the industry. Their work really is key.Last week people were outraged by the fact that businesses owned by billionaires such as Philip and Tina Green were seeking government support, even though they have been forced to reduce operations. A £3bn handout to companies seeing booming trade could be even harder to justify.To some extent, these kinds of outcomes will be unavoidable. The scale and speed of the response demanded by the crisis means that the government simply doesn’t have the time to think through all the consequences of its actions. But as the facts emerge, it should be able to refine policy choices to ensure fair outcomes.In Wales, where the administration does not have unlimited powers to borrow or print money, the government has reversed its decision to match business rates relief in England and is excluding the largest premises from accessing the relief. It plans to ert the savings (which it claims will amount to £120m) to help smaller businesses and charities. It has been reported that Tesco has launched a “huge lobbying operation” in order to get the Welsh government’s decision overturned – an effort described as “disproportionate” by officials.The government’s efforts to keep businesses afloat should be welcomed. But some of the oversights, such as handouts to companies who have not been detrimentally affected, should be addressed. At a minimum, companies that do well could be asked to do more to support their staff or their communities though erting any government support they receive to food banks or to increases in staff pay.An alternative approach could be for the government to introduce an excess profit tax to claw back any exceptional gains made by companies during the crisis.What businesses should not be doing is complaining about having support removed when there appears to be no reasonable justification for subsidy – particularly at a time that the public sector is experiencing a significant amount of pressure. Corporate lobbyists seeking handouts for the few companies set to do well from the crisis is one sector that could do with a period of furlough right now.• George Turner is director of the thinktank Tax Watch UK"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4250c5db41165ad76d99840125db10a3103a533f/0_56_4721_2833/master/4721.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b51c05782c0add6e24e00ef598aedf38","title":"corbyn keir starmer labour grassroots left momentum british","story":"Groups such as Momentum have helped shift the centre of British political gravity leftwards – and those gains will lastOn a bright autumn evening during last year’s Labour party conference, Concorde 2 – a well-known Brighton music venue – hosted a “Radical Variety Show” that brought party bigwigs together with younger activists, many of whom, until quite recently, had never been card-carrying Labour members. Under strobe lighting and plastic palm fronds, hundreds gathered to watch Diane Abbott make mojitos, a mock Blind Date contest (“Will you take my heart into private ownership,” asked one of the hopefuls), and John McDonnell spinning a wheel of fortune to find out what Labour would nationalise when it got the chance (options included BAE Systems, Greggs and Jeremy Corbyn’s cat).Over six months and a general election later, the scene feels almost impossibly quaint: a relic from an age when the boundaries between Labour’s highest echelons and a looser, leftist ecosystem were blurred, and many believed the end of Tory rule was nigh. Corbyn and McDonnell stepped down last weekend, and it is hard to imagine the latter’s replacement, Keir Starmer, spending much time on sticky floors rubbing shoulders with the likes of alternative media outlet Novara Media or political education initiative The World Transformed, the two organisations that co-staged the show. So what does the future now hold for the many different grassroots institutions that were semi-affiliated to the Corbyn project?There is certainly no shortage of commentators eager to pronounce the imminent death of the Labour left, and with it the array of movements, media platforms, factions and thinktanks that had entered its orbit since Corbyn’s ascendancy to the leadership in 2015 – some at the very heart of party operations, others several steps removed. It’s true that many of the formal changes Labour has undergone during the Corbyn era are unlikely to endure: a battle for open selections was lost and the trigger ballot mechanism that replaced it is weak meanwhile local councils and regional offices, traditional bastions of the old right tendency within the party that is most ideologically hostile to Corbyn’s politics, remain largely unreformed.Yet what came to be known as “Corbynism” – a generally unhelpful term, given how much of its vitality was drawn from far-flung people and spaces with few connections to the man himself – always encompassed more than a single leader or even party tendency. A fresh generation of leftist magazines, media personalities and organising forums has emerged in recent years – from websites such as New Socialist to research units like Common Wealth and new cultural programmes pioneered by socialist campaigners in Manchester, Bristol and other cities. Misunderstood by a great many pundits who found it easier to blame a sinister “cult of personality” around Corbyn than to think through the specific economic circumstances and social antagonisms that have been remaking our political landscape for over a decade, they have collectively helped shift the centre of British political gravity leftwards and drawn new groups of people into politics, following decades of professionalisation.These developments are not derivatives of the Corbyn leadership they are a product – as was the Corbyn leadership itself – of a new material reality in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, one in which widespread precariousness has been normalised and the nostrums of market-friendly managerialism no longer resonated with the lived experiences of millions. Corbyn may be exiting frontline politics, but that material reality persists.Momentum, the organisation most closely associated with the Corbyn era and also the one that has tried hardest to straddle both institutional, Westminster-oriented politics and the more nebulous realm of leftist social movements, is undergoing its own period of reflection and renewal, with potentially critical elections for its national coordinating group due later this spring, and a new campaign for internal democratisation launching this week. Sources suggest that despite the battle cries issued by eminent Blairites, an official crackdown on the group under Starmer’s leadership victory is unlikely. Instead, many inside Momentum envisage its future role as being both inside and outside the party hierarchy, putting pressure on Starmer to stick to his more radical pledges – without which, they point out, he would never have secured the backing of the wider party membership – while steering clear of the kind of internecine warfare that organisations such as Progress and Labour First on the other side of the party’s political spectrum waged against Corbyn throughout his tenure.That doesn’t mean, of course, that the dynamics of the left’s wider ecosystem will remain unchanged. “There might be a certain amount of movement away from the Labour party, in the immediate term, into things that are slightly more adjacent to the party,” one senior Momentum figure told me. “I don’t think that’s necessarily a bad thing. But just because our generation lost the election – and it is a generational loss – it’s not like everyone is simply going to give up and go away.”As the Corbyn period draws to a close, it’s vital to acknowledge the radical left’s limitations. For all the commendable talk of grounding Labour in communities up and down the country, and building a popular support base for genuinely transformative government policies that would not only propel the party into government but also insulate the wider socialist movement from changes in personnel at the top, few of those hopes have so far been realised. Machine politics and Labourism often won out at the expense of more pluralistic grassroots organising, leaving the top of the party adrift from its potential voters. As Ronan Burtenshaw, the editor of Tribune, puts it: “When the tide came back in, this left had been beached for a long time. Its contact with mass politics was minimal. It had to learn fast. It didn’t learn fast enough.”But it’s equally important to recognise the lasting gains made, too, many of which have been achieved independently of the party leadership. New movements representing those made most vulnerable by disaster capitalism – from trade unions representing precarious workers to renters’ collectives fighting landlord power in the streets – are growing by the day. Not only did every viable candidate to succeed Corbyn feel the need to pitch themselves considerably to the left of his predecessor, Ed Miliband, but even the Conservatives have been forced to adopt great swathes of Corbyn and McDonnell’s policies, once dismissed as “fantasy economics” by the same analysts now celebrating their downfall.While the official Labour party has been virtually invisible amid the coronavirus turmoil, and the new leadership has limited itself to a cautious and “constructive” engagement with the government, other parts of the “Corbynite” base have been playing a leading role in organising mutual aid efforts, instigating new resources for the movement, and holding the government to account. Starmer may not end up spinning wheels of fortune on the Brighton seafront, but both intellectually and organisationally, he will be dependent on the radical left.• Jack Shenker is a writer based in London and Cairo"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba02e226508ec7470cec9652c7b9203d901c5b1a/0_108_4381_2629/master/4381.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e4bd6bd10b4e8f1359baf7841a27c9f2","title":"coronavirus inequality managers zoom cleaners offices","story":"While managers conduct meetings on Zoom, their cleaners travel across cities on buses to clean half-empty offices• See all our coronavirus coverageIt gets worse. Rather than being paid for their outstanding holiday, the workers have been ordered to use it up during their notice period: a straightforward violation of the law. When their trade union, the Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain (IWGB), asked the pub’s owners why the workers were being dismissed “despite having the ability to pay the wages and its bills after the government’s help package” and announced legal action, the only reply they received was “Noted”.What does he feel when we’re told “we’re all in this together”, I ask him. “I feel angry, it’s just not true,” Jhon tells me through a translator: he is a migrant worker from Colombia. “The owners of the hotels and the other businesses are only looking for profit, leaving everyone else unprotected. They don’t care about us.” He’s always been a responsible, loyal employee, he says, since he started working at the pub seven months ago. Now he feels angry, helpless, “shocked at the lack of humanity by these people at the top”, worried about rent, bills, and “simple things like buying food”.Coronavirus is not some grand leveller: it is an amplifier of existing inequalities, injustices and insecurities. We hear the constant invoking of the second world war: but despite the horror of Nazi bombs, the living standards and health of poorer Britons benefited from rationing and full employment. In the age of Covid-19, the rubble of economic collapse will fall on those who suffered the most from the last crash: the young, the precarious, the low-paid.If you are wealthy, you have savings you may own your property outright, or at least have relief in the form of a mortgage holiday. Renters on the other hand, who even in normal times part with a huge portion of their wage bills, now have the National Residential Landlords Association wagging its fingers in their faces, telling them that the pandemic is not a “green light” for them not to pay their rent. Many find themselves asking what exactly they’re meant to pay their rent with.As the Institute for Fiscal Studies notes, the better-off may actually increase their savings as spending on forbidden activities falls but poorer households spend much more of their limited income on necessities, leaving them vulnerable to sudden falls in their incomings. Indeed, millions who spend their lives treading water now face being sucked under by strong currents.The wealthy are also more likely to be able to work from home. In the United States, a study of mobile data reveals that the wealthy are moving around less than the least well-off: they can afford to self-isolate and did so quicker than their poorer fellow citizens. As the New York Times headline aptly put it: “Location Data Say It All: Staying at Home During Coronavirus Is a Luxury”. It is no different here, of course: while managers conduct high-powered meetings on Zoom, their cleaners still travel across cities on early-morning buses to clean half-empty offices.Then there’s the issue of space. While many middle-class children play in expansive gardens, much of the urban poor find themselves locked away in overcrowded accommodation, risking a police reprimand if they loiter around parks. Those with violent partners or abusive parents, or, for LGBTQ youth, all too often hostile families, have nowhere to go. For some, home is a sanctuary for others, it was a place of fear before the pandemic, and now it is a prison.Finally, nurses, care workers, bus drivers, supermarket workers are rightly designated the title of “key worker”, but what compensation for years of being undervalued, underpaid and now at particular risk of exposure to a potentially lethal illness.So save us the platitudes of coronavirus as the great leveller abandon this sickly myth that we are all in this together. For some, this is a time of grand inconvenience, of undoubted stress, of a self-evident loss of freedom. For others, this is both a national and personal disaster, a present defined by turmoil and of futures snatched away. The BBC’s Emily Maitlis was rightly lauded last night for debunking the myth that coronavirus is a great leveller. That it went viral shows the popular appetite there is not to whitewash our grotesque social inequalities. As the IWGB’s general secretary Jason Moyer-Lee put it in a letter to Jhon’s employers at Golden Brick Pubs: “History will look back on this moment, and those who had the means but nevertheless failed to do everything possible to assist and protect the most vulnerable, will be judged harshly.”When the pandemic is over, when a vaccine shields us from this cruel disease, the rich will still prosper, while the struggling and insecure will be expected to pay: they already are."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e406af0300d7f535240bbfa7f8733f4e39a97e0b/0_11_4442_2666/master/4442.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3dd23b1d6e2beda2e9a131860f461b2d","title":"rupert murdoch open letter journalists coronavirus fox news","story":"In the name of both good reporting and public health, we call upon you to ensure that the information you deliver is based on scientific facts, journalists write in an open letterAmericans consistently rate the Fox News Channel as one of the most trusted TV channels. The average age of Fox News viewers is 65. It is well established that this population incurs the greatest risk from the Covid-19 pandemic. In other words, Fox News viewers are at special risk from the coronavirus.But viewers of Fox News, including the president of the United States, have been regularly subjected to misinformation relayed by the network – false statements downplaying the prevalence of Covid-19 and its harms misleading recommendations of activities that people should undertake to protect themselves and others, including casual recommendations of untested drugs false assessments of the value of measures urged upon the public by their elected political leadership and public health authorities.The misinformation that reaches the Fox News audience is a danger to public health. Indeed, it is not an overstatement to say that your misreporting endangers your own viewers – and not only them, for in a pandemic, inidual behavior affects significant numbers of other people as well.Yet by commission as well as omission – direct, uncontested misinformation as well as failure to report the true dimensions of the crisis – Fox News has been derelict in its duty to provide clear and accurate information about Covid-19. As the virus spread across the world, Fox News hosts and guests minimized the dangers, accusing Democrats and the media of inflating the dangers (in Sean Hannity’s words) to “bludgeon Trump with this new hoax”. Such commentary encouraged Donald Trump to trivialize the threat and helped obstruct national, state and local efforts to limit the coronavirus.Fox News reporters have done some solid reporting. And the network has recently given some screen time to medical and public health professionals. But Fox News does not clearly distinguish between the authority that should accrue to trained experts, on the one hand, and the authority viewers grant to pundits and politicians for reasons of ideological loyalty. There is a tendency to accept (or reject) them all indiscriminately, for after all, they are talking heads who appear on Fox News, a trusted source of news. When the statements of knowledgeable experts are surrounded by false claims made by pundits and politicians, including the president – claims that are not rebutted by knowledgeable people in real time – the overall effect is to mislead a vulnerable public about risks and harms. Misinformation furthers the reach and the dangers of the pandemic. For example, the day after Tucker Carlson touted a flimsy French study on the use of two drugs to treat Covid-19, Trump touted “very, very encouraging early results” from those drugs, and promoted a third as a possible “game-changer”.The basic purpose of news organizations is to discover and tell the truth. This is especially necessary, and obvious, amid a public health crisis. Television bears a particular responsibility because even more millions than usual look there for reliable information.Inexcusably, Fox News has violated elementary canons of journalism. In so doing, it has contributed to the spread of a grave pandemic. Urgently, therefore, in the name of both good journalism and public health, we call upon you to help protect the lives of all Americans – including your elderly viewers – by ensuring that the information you deliver is based on scientific facts."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac96d8471195bf44ce18d8ef955d21072685d210/0_89_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=058f345a3f144d5e57d2f0ac68393f6c","title":"the switch to cloud how public services are becoming more agile and innovative","story":"The cloud offers the scope for a more responsive, flexible approach to delivering online services – enabling government departments to innovate in ways that were once beyond their reachYou may have noticed it’s a lot easier these days to get things “done” online with government departments. After years of relying on the public to post forms or queue in an office to pick up the right documents, government bodies are now using the cloud to launch services which in the private sector would probably make headlines for being years ahead of their time.Whether it’s filing and paying taxes online, renewing a passport, booking a driving test or registering to vote, online services are instantly and seamlessly connecting citizens with the information and services they need in their daily lives. When they are accessed, users are also finding data is being freed from silos so the latest information is made available and acted on.The Driver and Vehicle Safety Agency (DVSA) is a good example. Deloitte has developed an innovative app for the organisation that allows assessors to check and record all aspects of a vehicle’s safety digitally, reducing processing times and removing the risk of lost paperwork. It can scan licence plates for immediate access to a vehicle’s test history and take and upload photos of any faults. When a vehicle passes, it is certified instantly.This is a classic use-case for cloud technology. Opening up access from any mobile device or location ensures the safe and efficient transfer and processing of safety information, and means enforcement teams out on the roads have up-to-date data at their fingertips, so they can more easily identify unsafe and non-compliant vehicles. And, using only serverless technologies means it’s infinitely scalable and cost effective.Mobile services such as this would not be possible without the cloud. It enables a new way of developing solutions to support business challenges and it frees up an organisation from traditional functions such as hosting and servicing data centres and patching software, allowing services to run via a third-party platform and empowering employees to focus on more value-added functions.According to Kerry Appleton-Norman, partner for public sector cloud at Deloitte, the appeal of this approach comes down mainly to speed, flexibility and, sometimes, cost.Moving to the cloud not only saves time on purchasing and managing physical environments, it also opens up access to a suite of software on the internet as a service. It is far quicker to amend these to an organisation’s requirements, rather than have software written from scratch. “Traditional procurement and development processes could take several months, by which time an organisation’s needs may have moved on,” Appleton-Norman explains.By moving to the cloud, Appleton-Norman has found that Deloitte’s public sector clients are able to embrace the pioneering attitude found at exciting startups where new ideas can be tested at breakneck speed.“The cloud empowers companies to be part of the new wave of fail-fast, agile development,” she says. “With the cloud you can leverage the necessary storage capacity very quickly and there are usually software packages you can try out and adapt that already work on that platform. The real beauty for organisations is that the technology enables them to get pilot projects set up really quickly. If they work, it’s great, if they don’t, they can be shut down immediately with no extra expense incurred.”This flexibility applies to the server space required, too. One of the drawbacks of traditional software development has always been that a server would be commissioned and set up to permanently handle the peak flow of traffic it needs to deal with.“You would typically end with situations where a computer system was set up to be able to permanently work at maximum performance, but that’s just not necessary all year round,” says Appleton-Norman.“It works out way too expensive to have that capability available to you all the time when, say, a tax authority only needs to handle their maximum level of traffic around particular deadlines at known times of the year. Most organisations will have peaks that are far more efficiently handled by moving to the cloud where capacity can be dialled up or down as needed, it doesn’t have to be permanently available.”Experience of working with public sector bodies has shown there is more to digital transformation than the project at hand. One of the biggest impacts is a change in how the organisation serves the public and this often changes the roles of employees. For this reason, Appleton-Norman believes they need to be aware of the need for strategy and to consider the knock-on effects of what they are trying to achieve.“Most organisations start out considering the cloud as part of their digital transformation work, they generally want to work more efficiently and provide new frictionless online service to the public,” she says.“The thing they don’t always realise, without guidance, is that the programme will impact their entire organisation, it’s not just about servers and software. If you’re rolling out new interfaces that staff or the public use, you will also need to look at how to best structure your organisation to do this and how to equip your staff with the right skills to execute. A move to the cloud is part of a broader organisational transformation, and organisations need to understand how this will often require a change to the culture of the organisation. How can you support increased collaboration, how do you deal with more focus on the citizen, what are the new roles and responsibilities that are going to be created?”This extra strategic perspective empowers public sector bodies to test and launch innovative services that make citizens’ lives much more convenient while also getting the most out of IT budgets. Forward planning also makes sure that the organisation’s employees are prepared for their changed roles in serving the public in a new way."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8506b029720fc360f691b5c6329591018916b3df/0_179_3997_2398/master/3997.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9fb9a94165e9bf49218a8c59bdee6408","title":"record size hole opens in ozone layer above the arctic","story":"Rare hole is result of low temperatures in atmosphere and is expected to disappear A rare hole has opened up in the ozone layer above the Arctic, in what scientists say is the result of unusually low temperatures in the atmosphere above the north pole.The hole, which has been tracked from space and the ground over the past few days, has reached record dimensions, but is not expected to pose any danger to humans unless it moves further south. If it extends further south over populated areas, such as southern Greenland, people would be at increased risk of sunburn. However, on current trends the hole is expected to disappear altogether in a few weeks.Low temperatures in the northern polar regions led to an unusual stable polar vortex, and the presence of ozone-destroying chemicals such as chlorine and bromine in the atmosphere – from human activities – caused the hole to form.The hole is not related to the Covid-19 shutdowns that have drastically cut air pollution and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. It is also too early to say whether the unusually stable Arctic polar vortex conditions are linked with the climate crisis, or part of normal stratospheric weather variability.Peuch said there were no direct implications for the climate crisis. Temperatures in the region are already increasing, slowing the depletion of ozone, and the hole will start to recede as polar air mixes with ozone-rich air from lower latitudes. The last time similar conditions were observed was in spring 2011.The hole was tracked by the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service, of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, based partly in Reading and funded by the European commission.While a hole over the Arctic is a rare event, the much larger hole in the ozone layer over the Antarctic has been a major cause for concern for more than four decades. The production of ozone-depleting chemicals has been drastically reduced, under the 1987 Montreal Protocol, but some sources appear still to be functioning – in 2018, unauthorised emissions were detected from eastern China.The Antarctic ozone hole was the smallest in 35 years last November, showing the success of efforts to cut the production of the harmful pollutants. The ozone layer protects the earth from harmful levels of ultraviolet radiation from the sun.New sources of ozone-depleting chemicals were not a factor in the hole observed in the Arctic, said Peuch. “However, this is a reminder that one should not take the Montreal Protocol measures for granted, and that observations from the ground and from satellites are pivotal to avoid a situation where the chlorine and bromine levels in the stratosphere could increase again.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/669d023f8a762c57e7bdb18b674a40a4db94d857/0_164_2496_1498/master/2496..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=49e9222928423a568112fe77e2fed41d","title":"bamboo rats left in limbo as breeders push back against china wildlife ban","story":"Farms forced to shut down operations as search continues for source of Covid-19 amid uncertainty over new industry rules Just a few months ago Cheng Yongcai ran a thriving farm that produced 20,000 bamboo rats a year in Qingyuan in northern Guangdong province.It was an operation that his local government actively encouraged with loans and other support, he says.But the Covid-19 outbreak, widely suspected of originating in China’s huge wildlife industry supply chain, has led to a complete halt in Yongcai’s operation, now shut indefinitely while he awaits final rules on what will be allowed once the crisis is over.China put in place a temporary ban on all wildlife trading and consumption in late February. But a final determination as to what will be legal or illegal after years of lacklustre regulation has been postponed until authorities in Beijing can get a handle on the human side of the outbreak.“We hope to transition to other types of business but until it’s clear what to do with the rats, it’s easier said than done,” he said. “We would need funding and the right facility for that.”Like Yongcai, many other wildlife farmers are increasingly irked by the bans on the trade, in place since late January. They argue that they are being unfairly blamed when no evidence has been provided by the Chinese government pinpointing the exact source of the outbreak.Certain types of bats and pangolins have been identified by epidemiological studies as natural carriers of the Sars-Cov-2 viruses that spawned Covid-19. But it is still unclear how likely either of these are to have been the source. Meanwhile, other animals such as civet cats, bamboo rats and several kinds of rodents have been shown to be carriers of coronaviruses.The problem is that the regulation and oversight of the sector has been confusing. The last updated catalogue of terrestrial wildlife approved for breeding by Chinese authorities that the  could find, which appears to be dated 2008, includes civet cats. But it does not include pangolins, bats, or bamboo rats.“Somehow these were still allowed by the forestry authorities,” Yin said.Recently, the industry association that lobbies for farming bamboo rats has called for the government to continue allowing the animals to be bred, arguing that they have been encouraged for years and have not been found to be the source of the Covid-19 outbreak.The group declined to comment about its appeal to lift the ban when contacted by the  on 3 April.“Of course, it’s a bit unfair, because for people in the rural areas, this is a very profitable business,” Yongcai said. “You don’t need to invest a lot, you don’t cause much pollution and you only have to feed them bamboo and grass.”Gao Guanxing, a farmer in a village near Heyuan, Guangdong, was one of thousands who went into wildlife breeding in recent years as part of China’s efforts to alleviate poverty by the end of 2020. In 2016 he started to rear bamboo rats, and he was among farmers feted by officials from nearby Shenzhen and the local government.But now those same local officials are attempting to persuade 230 families who went into breeding bamboo rats, wild boar, snakes, civet cats, frogs and Sika deer to turn to other forms of commerce: brewing, raising chickens, digging fish ponds, with compensation available of up to £23,000 per operation.Guanxing has been encouraged to go into mushroom farming. “After the two old bamboo rat houses are cleaned and disinfected, they will become a three-dimensional mushroom farm,” he told state-run financial newspaper Yicai, adding that once his mushrooms are planted and growing he’ll be able to produce 50kg per day. Attempts to reach Guanxing directly were not successful.Yongcai is in a more difficult position as his farm wasn’t officially part of a poverty alleviation programme, so it is uncertain whether he’ll qualify for compensation or additional assistance to switch to another form of production.“We’ve heard how the Heyuan government is helping breeders there to take up other business such as growing mushrooms and raising chickens, but that’s just for the impoverished household breeders,” Yongcai said. “For regular breeders, we’re still on our own and awaiting a decision.”What is unknown is what will happen once the government finally decides how to regulate the wildlife industry. Officials have discussed moving certain forms of wildlife that are not endangered or protected, nor known potential sources of zoonotic disease, to a list that would allow them to be bred under rules usually meant for poultry and livestock. No comprehensive list for those changes has been released.Theoretically, these rules from the ministry of agriculture and rural affairs would provide for safer operations, with those continuing in the business required to have larger-scale operations and biosecurity measures to prevent disease transfer.Yet, as has been seen in the outbreaks of African swine fever among China’s pig farms in recent years, which led to the deaths of millions of swine through the disease and culling, even those measures continue to fail to contain the spread of disease.“I don’t think bamboo rats pose that big a threat,” he said. “Plus, there’s no conclusion yet on where the new coronavirus is from.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b7f53031009cc0ea635fc37a53985ba90f7e53d4/0_231_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=8e5250b48074554448be7820275f9d9e","title":"coronavirus may prove boost for uks bees and rare wildflowers","story":"Populations could recover as verges are left uncut, setting what conservationists hope will be a long-term trendRare wildflowers and declining bee populations could start to recover during the coronavirus lockdown because many councils are leaving roadside verges uncut, according to Europe’s biggest conservation charity for wild plants.The respite for these mini-meadows is likely to lead to an explosion of colour in the countryside this summer and bring benefits to other pollinators, including butterflies, birds and bats, botanists at Plantlife said.Their potential role as conservation areas, however, is normally undermined each spring by local councils when they mow the roadsides. This cuts down many plants before they can flower and seed, leading to a steady decline of oxeye daisy, yellow rattle, wild carrot, meadow crane’s-bill, greater knapweed, white campion, burnet-saxifrage, betony, harebell and field scabious.Plantlife says this may be the best summer for years for these plants because several councils are redistributing resources to other activities as a result of the pandemic.Flintshire, Lincolnshire, Newcastle, Norfolk and Somerset are among the growing number of councils that are scaling back or delaying their verge mowing operations. Some local authorities, such as Devon, had already begun to accept that this should be done later and less frequently.Trevor Dines, Plantlife’s botanical specialist, said this could be a silver lining to the coronavirus crisis. “It’s a real opportunity for verges to flower again, some for the first time,” he said. “If the lockdown ends in late May, drivers will see great swaths of oxeye daisies and ladies bedstraw.”Grass near junctions and sight lines needs to be trimmed more regularly for safety reasons, but he said most stretches of road can be left until much later in the year so that motorists can see the benefits outweigh the risks. “Our message to councils is that if you haven’t cut verges until now then leave them until August and gauge the response from the public,” he said.Kate Petty, the group’s road verge campaign manager, said the extraordinary short-term circumstances of the pandemic could help to shift opinion and policies with long-term benefits for threatened species such as wood-calamint.“The fix is startlingly straightforward. Simply cutting verges less and later will save plants, money and reduce emissions. We need to rewild ourselves and accept nature’s wonderful ‘messiness’,” she said.Dines, who is also a beekeeper, said later and less frequent verge-mowing would help other species that depend on wildflowers.“This will certainly be good for pollinators. Last year, we already saw improvement in the areas where councils were cutting less. I had my best ever year for honey,” he said. “It’s also good for mental health. People are desperate for wildlife and colour right now. Let’s see what the public response is. For lots of commuters, myself included, verges are the only chance to see wild plants.”This year will almost certainly see much lower levels of wildlife roadkill. Past estimates suggest cars and trucks in the UK killed about 100,000 hedgehogs, 100,000 foxes, 50,000 badgers, 30,000 deer a year as well as barn owls and many other species of bird and insect."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af44f49e5d3d666b954b2598071afbe801f34779/0_0_5400_3240/master/5400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a4e7a5e698e5f816181631a5f0ecc65a","title":"the secret call of the wild how animals teach each other to survive aoe","story":"Cultural knowledge, passed from animal to animal, is key to how species adapt to change in the world around themSam Williams’ Macaw Recovery Network in Costa Rica rewilds captivity-hatched fledgling scarlet and great green macaws. But introducing young birds into a complex forest world – bereft of the cultural education normally provided by parents – is slow and risky.For 30 years or so scientists have referred to the ersity of life on Earth as “biological ersity”, or just “bioersity”. They usually define bioersity as operating at three levels: the ersity of genes within any particular species the ersity of species in a given place and the ersity of habitat types such as forests, coral reefs, and so on. But does that cover it? Not really. A fourth level has been almost entirely overlooked: cultural ersity.Culture is knowledge and skills that flow socially from inidual to inidual and generation to generation. It’s not in genes. Socially learned skills, traditions and dialects that answer the question of “how we live here” are crucial to helping many populations survive – or recover. Crucially, culturally learned skills vary from place to place. In the human family many cultures, underappreciated, have been lost. Culture in the other-than-human world has been almost entirely missed.We are just recognising that in many species, survival skills must be learned from elders who learned from their elders. Until now, culture has remained a largely hidden, unrecognised layer of wild lives. Yet for many species culture is both crucial and fragile. Long before a population declines to numbers low enough to seem threatened with extinction, their special cultural knowledge, earned and passed down over long generations, begins disappearing. Recovery of lost populations then becomes much more difficult than bringing in a few iniduals and turning them loose.Many young birds learn much by observing their parents, and parrots probably need to learn more than most. Survival of released iniduals is severely undermined if there are no free-living elder role models. Trying to restore parrot populations by captive breeding is not as easy as training young or orphaned creatures to recognise what is food while they’re in the safety of a cage – then simply opening the door. “In a cage,” Williams says, “you can’t train them to know where, when and how to find that food, or about trees with good nest sites.” Parents would normally have done exactly that.A generational break in cultural traditions hampered attempts to reintroduce thick-billed parrots to parts of south-west America, where they’d been wiped out. Conservation workers could not teach the captive-raised parrots to search for and find their traditional wild foods, skills they would have learned from parents.Landscapes, always complex, are under accelerated change. Culture enables adaptation far faster than genes alone can navigate hairpin turns in time. In some places, pigeons and sparrows have learned to use motion-sensors to get inside enclosed shopping malls and forage for crumbs. Crows have in some locales learned to drop nuts on the road for cars to crack. In at least one area they do this at intersections, so they can safely walk out and collect their cracked prizes when the light turns red and the cars stop. They’ve developed answers to the new question: “How can we survive here, in this never-before world?”Because the answers are local, and learned from elders, wild cultures can be lost faster than genetic ersity. When populations plummet, traditions that helped animals survive and adapt to a place begin to vanish.In a scientific article on the vocabulary of larks living in north Africa and Spain titled, “Erosion of animal cultures in fragmented landscapes”, researchers reported that as human development shrinks habitats into patches, “isolation is associated with impoverishment”. They write: “Song repertoires pass through a cultural bottleneck and significantly decline in variety.”Unfortunately, isolated larks are not an isolated case. Researchers studying South America’s orange-billed sparrow found that sparrow “song complexity” – the number of syllables per song and song length – deteriorated as humans continued whittling their forests into fragments. When a scientist replayed 24-year-old recordings of singing male white-crowned sparrows at the same location she’d recorded them, they elicited half the responses they had when first recorded. The birds’ responses show that changes in the dialect lead to changes in listener preference, a bit analogous to pop music. And as with humans, preferences can affect whether a particular bird will be accepted as a mate. White-crowned sparrows singing a local dialect become fathers of more offspring than do singers of unfamiliar dialects, indicating females prefer a familiar tune.I’m not just talking about a few songs. Survival of numerous species depends on cultural adaptation. How many? We’re just beginning to ask such questions. But the preliminary answers indicate surprising and widespread ways that animals survive by cultural learning. Regionally different vocalisations are sometimes called “song traditions” but the more commonly used word is “dialects”. More than a hundred studies have been published on dialects in birds. And it’s not just birds but a wide array of animals Including some fish.“Cod particularly,” said Steve Simpson of the University of Exeter, “have very elaborate calls compared with many fish.” You can easily hear differences in recorded calls of American and European Atlantic cod. “This species is highly vocal with traditional breeding grounds established over hundreds or even thousands of years.” Many fish follow elders to feeding, resting and breeding areas. In experiments, introduced outsiders who learned such preferred locales by following elders continued to use these traditional routes after all the original fish from whom they learned were gone.Cultural survival skills erode as habitats shrink. Maintaining genetic ersity is not enough. We’ve become accustomed to a perilous satisfaction with precariously minimal populations that not only risk genetic viability of populations but almost guarantee losing local cultural knowledge by which populations have lived and survived.In all free-living parrots that have been studied, nestlings develop inidually unique calls, learned from their parents. Researchers have described this as “an intriguing parallel with human parents naming infants”. Indeed, these vocal identities help iniduals distinguish neighbours, mates, sexes and iniduals the same functions that human names serve.Williams tells me that when he studied Amazon parrots, he could hear differences between them saying, essentially, “Let’s go”, “I’m here, where are you?” and “Darling, I just brought breakfast”. Researchers who develop really good ears for parrot vocalisation and use technology to study recordings show that parrot noise is more organised and meaningful than it sounds to beginners like me. In a study of budgerigars, for instance, birds who were unfamiliar with each other were placed together. Groups of unfamiliar females took a few weeks for their calls to converge and sound similar. Males copied the calls of females. Black-capped chickadees flock members’ calls converge, so they can distinguish members of their own flock from those of other flocks. The fact that this happens, and that it takes weeks, suggests that free-living groups must normally be stable, that groups have their own identity, and that the members identify with their group.Group identity, we see repeatedly, is not exclusively human. Sperm whales learn and announce their group identity. Young fruit bats learn the dialects of the crowds they’re in. Ravens know who’s in, who’s out. Too many animals to list know what group, troop, family or pack they belong with. In Brazil, some dolphins drive fish toward fishermen’s nets for a share of the catch. Other dolphins don’t. The ones who do, sound different from the ones who don’t. Various dolphin groups who specialise in a food-getting technique won’t socialise with other groups who use different techniques. And orca whales, the most socially complex non-humans, have layered societies of pods, clans and communities, with community members all knowing the members of all their constituent pods, but each community scrupulously avoiding contact with members of another community. All this social organisation is learned from elders.Elders appear important for social learning of migratory routes. Various storks, vultures, eagles and hawks all depend on following the cues of elders to locate strategic migration flyways or important stopover sites. These could be called their migration cultures. Famously, conservationists have raised young cranes, geese and swans to follow microlight aircraft as a surrogate parent on first migrations. Without such enculturation, they would not have known where to go. The young birds absorbed knowledge of routes, then used them in later seasons on their own self-guided migrations. Four thousand species of birds migrate, so Andrew Whiten of the University of St Andrews in Scotland speculates that following experienced birds may be an underappreciated but “very significant realm of cultural transmission”.When you look at free-living animals, you don’t usually see culture. Culture makes itself visible when it gets disrupted. Then we see that the road back to reestablishing cultures – the answers to the questions of “how we live in this place” – is difficult, often fatal.Young mammals too – moose, bison, deer, antelope, wild sheep, ibex and many others – learn crucial migration routes and destinations from elder keepers of traditional knowledge. Conservationists have recently reintroduced large mammals in a few areas where they’ve been wiped out, but because animals released into unfamiliar landscapes don’t know where food is, where dangers lurk, or where to go in changing seasons, many translocations have failed.Williams describes his procedure with the macaws as “very much a slow release”. First his team trains the birds to use a feeder. With that safety net, they can explore the forest, gain local knowledge, begin dispersing and using wild foods.Some rescue programmes declare success if a released animal survives one year. “A year is meaningless for a bird like a macaw that doesn’t mature until it’s eight years old,” says Williams.I ask what they’re doing for those eight long years.“Social learning,” Williams replies immediately. “Working out who’s who, how to interact, like kids in school.”To gain access to the future, to mate and to raise young, the birds Williams is releasing must enter into the culture of their kind. But from whom will they learn, if no one is out there? At the very least they must be socially oriented to one another. Ex-pets are the worst candidates for release they don’t interact appropriately with other macaws, and they want to hang around near humans. To assess the social abilities of 13 scarlet macaws who were scheduled for release, Williams and his crew documented how much time they spent close to another bird, how often they initiated aggression, things like that. When the bird scoring lowest for social skills was released, he flew out the door and was never seen again. The next-to-lowest didn’t adapt to the free-living life and had to be retrieved. The third-lowest social scorer remained at liberty but stayed alone a lot. The rest did well.All of the above adds up to this: a species isn’t just one big jar of jellybeans of the same colour. It’s different smaller jars with differing hues in different places. From region to region, genetics can vary. And cultural traditions can differ. Different populations might use different tools, different migration routes, different ways of calling, courting and being understood. All populations have their answers to the question of how to live where they live.“Sometimes a group will be foraging in a tree,” Williams says. “A pair will fly overhead on a straight path. Someone will make a contact call, and the flying birds will loop around and land with the callers. They seem to have their friends.” Bottom line, said Williams, there is much going on in the social and cultural lives of his macaws and other species, much that they understand – but we don’t. We have a lot of questions. The answers must lurk, somewhere, in their minds.As land, weather and climate change, some aspects of cultural knowledge will be the tickets necessary for boarding the future. Others will die out. Across the range of chimpanzees, cultures vary greatly, as do habitats. All populations but one use stick tools. Some use simple probes, others fashion multi-stick toolsets. Only one population makes pointed daggers for hunting small nocturnal primates called bush-babies hiding in tree holes. Only the westernmost chimpanzees crack nuts with stones.As researchers have noted, distinctive tool-using traditions at particular sites are defining features of unique chimpanzee cultures. Whiten wrote: “Chimpanzee communities resemble human cultures in possessing suites of local traditions that uniquely identify them … A complex social inheritance system that complements the genetic picture.”Some chimpanzee populations have learned to track the progress of dozens of specific trees ripening in their dense forests. Others live in open semi-savannah. Some are more aggressively male-dominated, some populations more egalitarian. Some almost never see people some live in sight of human settlements and have learned to crop-raid at night. For a long, long time chimpanzees have been works in progress. “We’ve learned,” writes Craig Stanford, “not to speak of ‘The Chimpanzee’.” Chimpanzees vary and chimpanzee culture is variable at every level.“It’s not just the loss of populations of chimps that worries me,” Cat Hobaiter emphasised when I spent several weeks with her studying chimpanzees in Uganda. “I find terrifying the possibility of losing each population’s unique culture. That’s permanent.”Diversity in cultural pools – perhaps more crucially than in gene pools – will make species survival more likely. If pressures cause regional populations to blink out, a species’ odds of persisting dim.Williams’ goal is to re-establish macaws where they range no longer, in hopes that they, and their forests, will recover. (Most of the central American forests that macaws need have been felled and burned, largely so fast-food burger chains can sell cheap beef.) It often takes a couple of generations for human immigrant families to learn how to function effectively in their new culture it may take two or three generations before an introduced population of macaws succeeds. In other words, macaws are born to be wild. But becoming wild requires an education.So what’s at stake is not just numbers. What’s at stake is: ways of knowing how to be in the world. Culture isn’t just a boutique concern. Cultural knowledge is what allows many populations to survive. Keeping the knowledge of how to live in a habitat can be almost as important to the persistence of a species as keeping the habitat both are needed. Cultural ersity itself is a source of resilience and adaptability to change. And change is accelerating.This is an edited extract from Becoming Wild: How Animals Learn to be Animals by Carl Safina, which published in the UK by Oneworld on 9 April and in the US by Henry Holt and Co on 14 April"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c8ff10f9d7b0ff0e4ecf76609426b990d5e767c/0_3_2616_1569/master/2616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=03fa8310984a2bb61e5afa34655196c5","title":"britney spears film critic dr dolittle","story":"The singer and sometime actor has embarked on a new lockdown career as a movie pundit. And, so far, she’s reading the public mood perfectlyThe coronavirus crisis hasn’t been kind to performers. On a practical scale, schedules have been wiped and income reduced to zero. But psychologically, it also means that the planet’s biggest extroverts have been robbed of an outlet. They have all this pent-up desire for approval, and nowhere to put it.Until now, this has largely manifested itself in slightly cringey iPhone videos uploaded to the internet. But now Britney Spears, that bold pioneer, has opened up a whole new avenue of quarantined expression. That’s right, she has become a film reviewer.The first fruits of Britney’s side-hustle appeared last night, as she posted her review of the Robert Downey Jr film Dolittle on Instagram. It reads:This movie is a must see !!! @RobertDowneyJr is so genuine you fall in love with him … the animal characters are hilarious and there seems to be a Special Tone throughout the whole movie which I find hard to find these days 🤔🤔🤔😘. So if you watch this movie and you’re as enamored as I was with his jackets and clothing … don’t get lost like I did 😂 just remember he’s a man who can speak to animals and he’s brilliant 🦜🐳🦁🐷🐻🦋💕 !!!!! Pss … how long has it been since you’ve seen what you’ve wanted to see … I can’t even count how many movies I’ve watched in this quarantine so far 🙄🙄🙄😅😅😅 !!!!!”Now, it’s easy to mock Spears for this. The capitalisation of “Special Tone”. The term “I find hard to find”. The implication that the plot was slightly too complex for her. The fact that she is posting a critical rave for a film that not only contains a climactic scene where Robert Downey Jr frantically pulls a bagpipe from a dragon’s bum, but is currently on schedule to be the biggest commercial flop of the year.After all, Britney’s assessment of the film is quite the outlier. Compare her Dolittle rave with the ’s Peter Bradshaw review, which called the film “horribly inert”. Or Empire, which deemed it “lacklustre”. Or Total Film, which described it as “lifeless and dead-eyed”. Or NPR, who decided it was less a film and more “a crime scene in need of forensic analysis”. Perhaps Britney was expecting less of Dolittle. Perhaps she uses a different set of criteria to evaluate cinema. Perhaps she watched the wrong film by accident. We may never know.And, don’t forget, Dolittle is a flop. Far fewer people went to see it than anticipated, so there’s a real chance that Spears’ praise will inspire hundreds of thousands to seek it out. It might even dig the film out of the mire a little. For a successful actor such as Spears (no, really her 2002 film Crossroads made its budget back five times over, making it a much hotter commercial property than Dolittle) to reach down and help an underdog like this shows a lot of class.Now we just have to sit back and wait to see what she reviews next. Will she continue to buck the critical trend, by slagging off Uncut Gems or embracing Playmobil: The Movie? Will she maintain her dedication to focusing on underperforming releases, by reviewing UglyDolls or The Goldfinch? How on earth will she use emojis to convey the Special Tone of Colour Out of Space or The Hunt? Either way, she has to review more films. Her public demands it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c3d1d8324ea3d9adb3ea91dd5a71c1760a948d6f/0_99_2861_1716/master/2861.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d0757300a759b3defbc4fee10e2e11b9","title":"superhero movies coronavirus marvel cinematic universe dc comics","story":"From Wonder Woman to Superman, Black Widow to Black Panther, superheroes can vanquish aliens, androids and Nazis. They’re less super in a pandemicAfter the massive 2019 hits Avengers: Endgame and Spider-Man: Far from Home, it seemed a safe bet that the Marvel Cinematic Universe would go on for ever. The high-flying blockbusters with their tight costumes, digital effects and insouciant quips could pack cinemas until the apocalypse. There would never again be a year without superheroes.Sadly, the apocalypse has come sooner than expected. Superheroes can fight secret quasi-Nazi conspiracies, invading aliens and android armies. But they are ill-equipped to fight the coronavirus. Superheroes on screen have saved the world repeatedly. But, in this real-life crisis, the MCU’s vision of empowerment via teaming up to blast things to smithereens seems woefully inadequate.The coronavirus has wreaked havoc on the film industry. Like most major releases, MCU films scheduled for spring and summer have been delayed until autumn, or pushed into next year. Black Widow has been moved from 1 May to 6 November, and the new date will mean the longest pause between MCU releases since The Incredible Hulk (2008) was followed two years later by Iron Man 2.The date changes reflect the logistical challenges of showing movies at the moment. Beyond that, though, the superhero genre feels irrelevant in a pandemic. Superheroes have always been given oomph and whoosh, not by disease but by war. The first huge success in the superhero genre came soon after the start of the second world war. In one of his early adventures, Superman, the first superhero, captured Hitler and Stalin to end the war. Other patriotic heroes such as the red-white-and-blue-clad Captain America and Wonder Woman regularly thumped Nazis and Japanese infiltrators on the home front.Superhero comics in the war years could sell hundreds of thousands of copies an issue – a level of popularity the genre didn’t see again until the post-911 “war on terror”. Iron Man (2008) showed Tony Stark blasting away evil terrorists in the for ever war in Afghanistan, while Spider-Man: Far From Home in 2019 imagined our hero gaining control of an army of drones more powerful even than America’s own deadly stockpile. Over the 11 years between those two films, the MCU franchise grossed $22.5bn.The appeal of superheroes in wartime is straightforward. They’re an empowerment fantasy of strength, violence and victory. MCU plots can be more or less clever, but the films rely on images of muscular men and women punching or blasting large numbers of bad guys until the bad guys fall over, or else stand up to be punched and blasted some more. The MCU narratives, with their incessant crossovers and team-ups, are about powerful people banding together to thump the snot out of their enemies. They’re popular at moments of militarism because their approach to problems is militaristic. There are enemies out there, and you beat them with a combination of unity and overwhelming force.But overwhelming force is little use against a virus, and teaming up physically is harmful. Invulnerable superheroes swoop across vast distances to confront their foes in endless, glorious battle. In contrast, our virus response involves immobilisation, isolation and enforced inactivity as the economy collapses and we wait anxiously to start coughing. Instead of empowering fisticuffs, we’re called to help others and ourselves through deliberate self-disempowerment.If there is heroism, it’s the heroism of enduring as everyone becomes less super. Disaster movies such as Contagion or zombie films are too eventful to capture our apocalypse of immobility. But they get a lot closer than superhero narratives. It’s hard to imagine yourself saving the world when you can barely imagine leaving the house to visit your loved ones.So will the virus finally take the wind out of the cape of the superhero genre? The answer is probably not. It’s true that, even before the virus hit, there were signs that the superhero craze might be slowing down – DC’s Birds of Prey, released earlier this year, for example, was a financial disappointment. But US wars in Afghanistan and the Middle East grind on, tentative peace proposals notwithstanding. And fans certainly remain excited about forthcoming MCU sequels.Coronavirus won’t end the MCU permanently. But the enforced pause is a reminder that superheroes as a genre frame problems and solutions in specific ways, responding to specific historical conditions. Iron Man can snap his fingers and eliminate Thanos’s invading army. But there’s not a lot he can do when a poor government response exposes the public to a dangerous pandemic. It’s fitting that superheroes have gone silent at the moment. They were never designed to save us from this."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21b13a121c23d47b80b42d14ec05d5a4ede7d79b/0_0_6570_3942/master/6570.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=db5abf852537356550167b63885925e0","title":"kim joys recipe for easter cheesecake eggs","story":"If you’ve never made Easter eggs, now is the time to start. It’s easier than you’d imagine – and this delicious recipe includes vegan and gluten-free optionsTiny cream ducklings nestled in cheesecake inside chocolate eggs – surely that’s worth having a quack at? These look a little challenging to make, but when you break down the steps, they are not too difficult. The hardest part is tempering the chocolate, but you can use compound chocolate to make things quicker and easier. And if you haven’t got the moulds mentioned below, you can always fill a shop-bought Easter egg. There’s nothing wrong with shortcuts, especially now. There are a few other options here to help you get round any shortages of ingredients.For the chocolate egg30g dark chocolate500g white chocolate, roughly chopped (or compound chocolate, eg, candy melts)Cocoa-butter-based or oil-based food dye of your choice (not water-based)For the biscuit base85g digestive biscuits (or any similar sweet, plain biscuit)35g melted butter (or 30g melted coconut oil)Alternative biscuit base (vegan and gluten-free)50g dates50g blanched almonds (you can substitute other nuts and adjust quantities to adjust sweetness)Pinch of salt5g melted coconut oil or melted coconut butter (optional)For the cheesecake200g cream cheese100g double cream (or condensed milk)100g mascarpone (or cream cheese)65g caster sugarGrated rind of 1 lemonAlternative cheesecake (vegan and gluten-free)180g cashewsJuice of 1 lemonZest of 1 lemon60g melted coconut oil or melted coconut butter150g coconut milk120g agave syrup (or golden syrup, or similar)For the cream ducklingsIf you’re short on ingredients or don’t trust your piping skills, make these using coloured fondant, or use any cute Easter ornaments. Just make sure you tell people to remove them before eating200g double cream20g icing sugarBlack, orange and yellow food dyeMelt the dark chocolate in a microwave, and use a stiff paintbrush to splatter specks into 16 silicone semi-sphere moulds (approx 7cm3in diameter). Next, melt 375g of the white chocolate in a bain marie. Take it to 43C, then remove from the heat and add the remaining chocolate chunks and chosen food colour. Stir until it comes down to 28-29C, then use a spoon to coat the silicone moulds with the chocolate. Place the moulds in the freezer for 10 minutes, then the chocolate should easily pop out of them. If you want to avoid tempering, use candy meltscompound chocolate instead. It doesn’t taste as amazing as real chocolate, but is worth using if you are short on time or are baking with kids.Use a warm plate to melt the base of two semi-spheres, then stick together. Repeat with all. Then use a spoon to crack away the top of each “egg”.To make the biscuit base, place the biscuits in a freezer bag and then bash into crumbs using a rolling pin. Stir the crumbs together with the melted butter. For the vegan and gluten-free version, place the dates in a food processor and process until sticky and forming a ball. Then add the almonds, salt and coconut oil, and process again until combined. Whichever base you have opted for, spoon it into the bottom of each chocolate egg. Use the back of the spoon to press it down gently.Next, make the cheesecake: put all the ingredients in a bowl and whisk together until smooth. For the vegan alternative, first soak the cashews by pouring boiling water over them and leaving for half an hour, then drain all the water. Place the cashews, lemon juice and lemon zest in a food processor and blend until smooth. Add the coconut oil, coconut milk and agave syrup, and process again until very smooth.Spoon the cheesecake over the biscuit base.For the ducklings, whip the cream with the icing sugar until it reaches soft peaks (ideally, underwhip as you will whip it further when adding dyes). Transfer a tablespoon to a separate bowl and colour with black gel food dye. Transfer to a piping bag and cut a small tip. Do the same again, but colour the cream orange this time. Lastly, add yellow food dye to the remaining cream, and combine. Transfer to a piping bag and cut a large opening. Use the yellow cream to pipe the main duckling shape, and then use the coloured creams for the details. To add the small tufts on top of the ducklings’ heads, place the large bag of yellow cream in another piping bag, cut a small tip, and use to pipe."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64ccee9a53be6a101143a43b964f645bbbe974a0/0_0_1451_871/master/1451.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c68d25e46777c871c803c519b8a471c","title":"a trick a day how football freestyler liv cooke is bringing light to the lockdown","story":"Four-times world record holder is posting tricks that others can follow indoors – hopefully without breaking anythingLiv Cooke recognises the peculiarity of her position during lockdown. Football as mass entertainment has ceased and yet, for one of the world’s leading professional freestylers, it is debatable whether the popularity and profile of her chosen sport has ever felt so high. The platform has enabled Cooke to provide education as well as offer escapism.“Freestyle football is a massively growing sport and right now it feels like every professional footballer is becoming a freestyler too,” says Cooke, the 2017 world champion, the UK’s first woman professional freestyler, and now a BBC presenter. “We’ve seen Paul Pogba doing around the worlds at home and many others too. It’s putting the sport in a positive light. It helped me physically and mentally and now I’m addicted to it. It changed my life and if it can help others at this time then that is a beautiful thing.”“I posted a video of me doing a trick in my kitchen and people were asking me how to do it,” Cooke explains. “So I thought this would be the perfect time to do it. People can go on a downward spiral when they’re stuck at home but this keeps you happy and fit.“The idea is to build up from beginners’ tricks to more difficult tricks. The hardest part has been thinking of a trick and then making sure it can be done indoors, otherwise people might end up breaking everything.“At first we scripted the tricks but that wasn’t working, it just wasn’t me, but when we started doing them off-the-cuff it allowed me to think in the moment and that was much better. We’re doing one trick a day during isolation and if we have to keep going then I’ll just have to be creative I am a professional freestyler after all.”Cooke had established a huge social media following before the lockdown – 4.1m followers and counting on TikTok, for example – with a role on MOTDx following on from her professional successes and commercial appearances. The reaction, therefore, has been less surprising than the public’s ability to copy the tricks.“What has surprised me is how many people have accomplished the tricks and how quickly they’ve picked it up,” Cooke says. “It just shows how important social media is. I was aware of its importance before the isolation. I had young girls coming up to me to say I had inspired them.“I’m a girl from a small town in Lancashire and if I can do it, so can they. But during this isolation I’ve noticed the power of social media to do something good.“If I have the power to make a difference then now is the time to show it. I think the benefits vary. Some people may have nothing to do and having a trick to try gives them a focus for an hour or two and stops them going into a downward spiral.“Others who are working from home may be sat in a chair all day so it gives them a break, a bit of exercise and refreshes them. It’s important to learn new skills constantly.”Cooke’s productivity during the lockdown does not end with teaching the reverse crossover, the side-of-the-head stall and ‘the Slap’ to a mass audience. She has also signed up for the Royal Voluntary Service since the crisis began although professional work – such as her role as a global ambassador for Euro 2020 – has naturally been affected, along with preparations to play in this summer’s Soccer Aid fundraiser at Old Trafford.“I was really looking forward to Soccer Aid, which was going to be my first proper match in six years,” says Cooke, who played for Preston’s junior sides and Blackburn’s centre of excellence before a recurring back injury erted her career towards freestyle. “It’s a real shame that has been postponed as it raises so much money for Unicef but nothing is more important than peoples’ health so I’m glad it has been postponed. I’m not seeing that as a negative.“NHS staff are working crazy hours. My sister-in-law Emma is working non-stop in the NHS.

In fact, one might say most of Europe does, with Portugal currently in a state of emergency due to the you-know-what. “House arrest?! Please, the judiciary system of Portugal! No more!” Pinto might have feigned as he was lead by guards – presumably not standing at a distance of two metres – away to the nearest Lisbon digs.There are a couple of catches. Pinto does potentially face 30 years in jail if found guilty of 90 charges, having been extradited from Hungary in March 2019 for allegedly attempting to blackmail an investment fund. And Pinto’s lawyers confirmed that the 31-year-old, whose website played a crucial part in providing evidence which led to Manchester City’s Champions League ban, as well as numerous investigations into tax evasion and corruption in football, is “banned from using the internet.”That leaves poor Pinto condemned to read things like Big Papers and the back of cereal packets during his house arrest. But maybe there is some light at the end of the plushly-carpeted corridor. “Rui Pinto’s defence welcomes this decision and trusts that further steps will be taken for the freedom of our client,” parped his lawyers. For now, though, the Fiver can only wish Pinto well in dealing with his particular lockdown with no internet.Think, reader, just how slow time would pass if you didn’t have any internet.

Here is the expert adviceYou will already be regularly washing your hands and social distancing, but many of us are still likely to become infected with coronavirus. Doing what you can now to improve your health and boost your immune system will help your body cope. Thankfully, the majority of cases are mild and you should recover within a week, though if your symptoms are persistent it is vital to seek medical advice from NHS 111 rather than try to continue to manage at home. With that in mind, here’s what you can do to put yourself in the best position to help your recovery.There is no magic supplement. The advice is as it’s always been: reduce your alcohol consumption, exercise, sleep well and reduce stress. A varied, balanced diet, with lots of vegetables and fruit, is important, but there is little evidence for most vitamin and mineral supplements. Getting out in the sun each day can also be beneficial, says the GP Amir Khan. “The majority of people have low vitamin D because we don’t have enough sunlight in the UK, and we are coming out of winter. Vitamin D levels will be depleted, so there’s no harm in taking a vitamin D tablet.”Many people who are suspected of having had the virus report at least one day of fatigue. Now is not the time to try to tough things out. “Your body is using all its energy to fight a virus that is infecting cell after cell,” says Khan. “Even with mild symptoms, you’ll have some days when you feel fine and other days when you are tired and achey. You can potter around the house and make food if you need to, but you shouldn’t be doing any more than that and, where possible, you should be on the sofa or in bed.”Khan says: “Everybody should be sticking to two to three litres of fluid a day” – as normal. When you have a fever, says Saira Ghafur, an honorary respiratory consultant at St Mary’s hospital in London, “you can become dehydrated, so you need to make sure that even if you don’t feel like it, you’re drinking as much as possible. If you feel you’re not peeing very much, that’s another sign you’re very dehydrated and should seek medical advice.”Take paracetamol, rather than ibuprofen. There has been concern that ibuprofen, an anti-inflammatory, could reduce immune function and make coronavirus symptoms worse, but there is not enough evidence to confirm this. Still, the advice is to take paracetamol for fever and muscle pain instead. “If you have been prescribed ibuprofen and develop symptoms of Covid-19 then discuss that with your medical practitioner,” says Wingfield.Khan has seen advice online about taking vitamin C to treat coronavirus – but that doesn’t mean you should be trying this at home. “It has been used intravenously in very, very high doses in hospitals in China. That’s a big difference to what you get in a tablet. The jury is still very much out in terms of using intravenous vitamin C for coronavirus.”Taking a vitamin C tablet from the chemist or supermarket “won’t stop you getting an infection and it won’t help treat the infection”, says Khan. And certainly don’t try to take very high doses.Don’t pin your hopes on “superfoods” or the social media posts about “alkaline” foods (a virus doesn’t have a pH level, and you can’t change the body’s pH level through diet). What about garlic? “It may help reduce the length of things like a cold, but won’t prevent it,” says Khan. And there’s no evidence it has any effect on coronavirus.It’s far from clear. On Monday, the author JK Rowling shared a video of Sarfaraz Munshi, the head of urgent care at Queen’s hospital in Romford, London, demonstrating breathing techniques that he said could relieve symptoms and prevent someone developing a secondary pneumonia infection. People with asthma and those recovering from pneumonia are often helped by respiratory physiotherapists, says Wingfield, “who can help support your breathing with exercises. The main thing you are trying to do is make patients’ lungs open as much as they can and try and get rid of some of the fluid and inflammatory material.”“What you’re really doing there is forcing air into the alveoli by taking big breaths in and holding the alveoli open, and that will help clear any excess mucus, pathogens, as well as stop them from becoming hardened, which can happen. This is with the caveat that you are safe to stay at home and you don’t need to be in hospital. If there’s any chance of pneumonia, you should be in hospital.”However, Laura Breach, a spokeswoman for the Association of Chartered Physiotherapists in Respiratory Care (ACPRC), says while the exercises should be harmless for healthy iniduals, she would not advise them, adding that they could make symptoms worse in someone suffering breathlessness. Although Munshi’s video was well-intentioned, the ACPRC says the techniques are not correct (it is preparing its own video). If you did try the exercise, you only need to take three or four breaths so as not to hyperventilate and become dizzy, and if you have coronavirus symptoms, there is no need to make yourself cough as part of the exercise. “We would always encourage nose-breathing rather than mouth-breathing, because your nose is really important in humidifying the air that you breathe in and catching any particles in the air,” says Breach.There is no evidence these exercises will help healthy people prepare for the illness, she says. “There are patients with longer-term respiratory conditions and we do teach them techniques to give them a better starting point. If it’s something you should be doing then your healthcare professional will have already advised that.” Instead, the ACPRC says: “Propping yourself up with pillows, or leaning forward onto the back of a chair” can be beneficial to breathlessness.Wingfield also questions whether the exercises can aid recovery from coronavirus – “it’s a slightly evidence-free zone” – and says if you are having trouble breathing, you should seek medical help rather than simply try to follow breathing exercises at home. “But they can keep your lungs moving, and some people might find these exercises meditative and stress-relieving,” says Wingfield. Ghafur agrees: “None of this is evidence-based.”One of the big things in intensive care that we’re seeing with a lot of patients,’ says Ghafur, “is you have to put them on a ventilator in what we call a prone position, which basically means you’re lying on your front. It’s not in any recommended guidance for patients who are not in intensive care, but if you’re able to lie on your front for a while that can help breathing.” There’s no harm in trying it, she says, but only if you’re generally fit and healthy. Do not try to lie on your front if you are older, infirm, have mobility problems or are pregnant.Lying continuously on your back is not ideal. “If you can sit and take deep breaths in and out, that will help any respiratory condition – you’re taking in a bigger lungful of air and that will help remove any mucus.” However, she adds that there is no evidence that this will improve your recovery."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/689dd88723bd801e8cc9aaf72efb3d7fb742637d/280_491_4558_2734/master/4558.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7a833b790baa5cb7a488d1603797aa0b","title":"have you and your uk neighbours become friendlier since the coronavirus lockdown","story":"We would like to hear about your neighbourly tales during the coronavirus lockdownHave you become more neighbourly?Do you have a new back (or front) garden community – all kept at a respectable social distance, of course?

Yet the virus, industry experts warn, will spell the end for “hundreds” of those organizations, laying off journalists and closing titles.Media outlets across the US have already responded to a huge drop in advertising triggered by the economic shutdown by sacking scores of employees. Some newspapers, just as demand is at its highest, have stopped printing – reverting to a digital-only operation that is just as vulnerable to the whims of advertisers.The decrease in advertising was swift, as businesses tightened spending due to the economic impact of Covid-19. For a journalism industry already barely scraping by, the impact was almost immediate.In Seattle, the weekly Stranger magazine said it was suspending publication, and temporarily laid off 18 employees. The Tampa Bay Times, Florida’s largest newspaper, has switched to a twice-weekly print edition after it lost $1m in advertising due to coronavirus. Paul Tash, the Times’ chairman and CEO, said he hoped to restore normal operations in the future, a message many news outlets have echoed.However, some experts aren’t sure that many places will ever return to normal.Penny Abernathy, the Knight chair in journalism and digital media economics at the University of North Carolina, predicts a swath of newspapers and websites will close.“I think there’ll be hundreds, not dozens,” Abernathy said. “An extinction-level event will probably hit the smaller ones really hard, as well as the ones that are part of the huge chains.”Even before the coronavirus, the industry was in a precarious position, with smaller citywide or statewide news outlets particularly vulnerable.About 1,800 newspapers closed between 2004 and 2018, as the number of people buying print editions dropped. As the journalism industry attempted to adapt to a world were people get their news online, Google and Facebook gobbled up the digital advertising that was barely keeping news organizations afloat.Yet as staff have been cut and advertising money dried up, news organizations across the country have reported a surge in readers. Doctor said there had been a doubling in readership – “almost wholly attributable to coronavirus” and record ratings for cable news.“For clear reasons,” Doctor said. “Given both that people are at home – and scared to death, trying to figure out something that none of us have ever lived through before.”The coronavirus is a global story, but it is inherently local, too. People want to know how many cases have been reported in their neighborhood, what the latest health advice might be, even which parks are closed or open – all classic local news territory.Many towns and cities in the US have already lost that resource. In 2018 a study by Abernathy, at the University of North Carolina, found that 1,300 US communities have completely lost news coverage, creating what Abernathy dubbed “news deserts” – where local information and scrutiny of elected officials is non-existent.As the journalism industry struggled, large media groups have swooped in to buy up local newspapers, laying off hundreds of journalists in the process. The newspapers owned by these big groups are just as vulnerable to the impact of the coronavirus – in some cases maybe more so.Lee Enterprises, which owns newspapers in 25 states, has announced across-the-board pay cuts, and said it would introduce furloughs.If there is one bright spot, it’s that people could finally realize the dire state of the journalism industry.“We can hope that it raises awareness and a willingness to pay for news,” Abernathy said. “And a willingness to think through new ways of paying for that news – whether it’s through your tax dollars that publicly fund things, or whether it’s actually understanding that newspapers need to charge you more than what they’ve charged you in the past. Because the for-profit model that supported local news for 200 years has collapsed.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd029733c01c470f94ee397dab39ea210dfa82b2/0_231_3500_2102/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=33c0933584ad9c628c4a9b9e6241a71f","title":"london live sparks inquiry david icke coronavirus conspiracy theories","story":"Local TV station showed clips of David Icke claiming coronavirus was part of plot by governmentsLocal television station London Live is facing an investigation by the media regulator after the channel broadcast an interview with the conspiracist David Icke in which he suggested the coronavirus pandemic was part of a plot by governments to destroy the economy and conduct mass surveillance.Ofcom said it was investigating the channel as a priority, having already received 19 complaints from members of the public. Last week it warned regulated radio and television stations to take extra care not to broadcast potentially damaging claims about the pandemic.London Live is controlled by the Russian Evgeny Lebedev and operates from the same offices as his newspaper titles Evening Standard and Independent.London Live defended the decision to broadcast the interview with Icke, which was edited down from an even longer online interview conducted last month by the unrelated YouTube channel London Real.They said those complaining were confusing the material they broadcast with a separate interview Icke conducted with London Real this week, which was banned from YouTube for spreading potentially damaging claims about 5G mobile networks.A spokesperson for London Live said: “We note that several commentators on social media have complained about our decision, however, we also note those complaints are about another interview with David Icke. We did not broadcast the interview which is the subject of the complaints on social media.“Commentators are confusing the interview broadcast last night with an interview with David Icke which was removed from YouTube. The interview London Live did broadcast is still available on YouTube. We regret if we have given any rise to this confusion.”In a minute-long clip of the broadcast uploaded to London Live’s Twitter account, Icke insinuates a connection between coronavirus research and the Israeli state, while also claiming any moves to require people to ultimately be vaccinated for coronavirus is “fascism”.The broadcast was prefaced with a warning from the channel that the “views contained in this programme are those of iniduals articulating them and are not necessarily those of London Live”.London Live is one of the local television stations introduced by the former culture secretary Jeremy Hunt almost a decade ago but has struggled to reach large audiences. Despite this it enjoys a prominent position on programme listings, which can help attract casual viewers.The culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that the material consisted of “lunatic conspiracy theories and no sensible person would give them a moment’s thought … Clearly that station is regulated by Ofcom and I would be expecting Ofcom to take appropriate action.”Icke is a former Hereford United goalkeeper who has long been of the most prominent figures in global conspiracist circles. One concern of factcheckers is that debunking baseless theories can ultimately elevate them, with Icke’s supporters holding up YouTube’s deletion of videos as a sign that he is right.While Ofcom can issue sanctions to regulated broadcast radio and television stations, there is currently no substantive regulation of social media output. Online broadcasts can reach a vast audience but oversight of content relies on the whims of private companies.The juxtaposition between regulation of online and broadcast media is stark. According to figures provided by overnights.tv, a peak audience of about 80,000 people watched Wednesday night’s edited David Icke interview on London Live, which has attracted comment from cabinet ministers and potential regulatory intervention.By comparison, 5.2m viewers watched the original unedited interview on YouTube without any government intervention or media questions."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/62f1cbc879085aa62153e76e6bfee4367e98515a/150_0_3200_1922/master/3200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b2f965db31bc0dea62fdc07169ddeb6e","title":"financial regulator steps in to support uk car loan market","story":"FCA reacts to surge in vehicle owners seeking help with repayments in £75bn marketThe financial regulator will add support for car financing to its temporary measures designed to help consumers facing financial difficulties due to the coronavirus crisis.There are growing concerns that some consumers in the UK’s £75bn car loan market will not be able to cover their monthly vehicle repayments, and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said it was aware more help is needed.“We know there is still more work to be done, and we will be announcing further measures to support consumers in other parts of the credit market in the future, including in the motor finance sector next week,” said Christopher Woolard, the interim FCA chief executive.The FCA confirmed proposals set out last week for a freeze on loan and credit card payments for up to three months as part of emergency measures for consumers hit by the coronavirus outbreak.The FCA said it is offering short-term financial support to consumers “through what could be a very difficult time”, which includes a temporary freeze on loan and credit card repayments, as well as a suspension of interest on arranged overdrafts up to £500, extending relief already announced by some banks including Barclays, HSBC and Lloyds.The credit ratings of consumers taking advantage of any of the emergency measures will not be affected.The support will come into effect on 14 April, although it will be available immediately at major banks and building societies.Such measures would usually have required a lengthy consultation process, but the FCA has brought them into effect in just a week.Car manufacturers including Volkswagen and Ford have already announced some emergency measures to help customers.The most common car purchase method is a personal contract plan, known as a PCP, where a buyer pays a deposit and then rents the vehicle for two to three years at a monthly cost, typically around £250."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c4ecf59551b612732c03b2aa730c69a4b3a44d06/0_1588_4912_2944/master/4912.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f72dc36ed4f766e699c4dcc183b3fe14","title":"laurel halos lockdown listening theres this element of human touch","story":"The electronic musician picks intimate and comforting music to get you through the coronavirus pandemicI was joking recently that electronic musicians have been self-isolating for years, so we are practiced at this. All my gigs were cancelled, and so time takes on a different quality. There’s something about all of this music I’m listening to that speaks to us slowing down – that speaks to this vacuum of urgency. It’s peaceful, serene, disembodied music to kind of get lost in.The Italian ambient composer Gigi Masin is music for any time. I love sweet music that isn’t saccharine. Most music is just corny, and this edges towards that – there’s this really amazing moment before something slips into being bad taste. To me there’s something a bit reserved and wistful about his music. It doesn’t do full throttle with emotion and it’s more powerful as a result. All the things that are left unsaid ... it has a wistful quality is really powerful. That’s completely subjective, though, someone might listen to Masin and think it’s corny as fuck.Playing Piano for Dad by H Hunt has this really beautiful cut-up feel, as if somebody was just sitting at the piano and trying to remember some jazz standards they learned as a teenager. They keep tripping, trying to figure it out over and over again. That process element is really nice – I love making recordings with audible damper pedal sounds, key sounds, the sounds of adjusting your chair. It’s very tactile, sensual music.Morton Feldman’s Triadic Memories, and Eliane Radigue’s Trilogie de la Mort – they’re so easy to fall into. It’s deceptively charming music, even though it has a lot of dissonance. I love the empty spaces in Triadic Memories. There’s something really powerful when the notes punctuate the space, and in how beautiful the decay of each of the notes can be. Trilogie de la Mort you can get lost in. It reminds me of David Lynch’s obsession with electricity, it has that kind of spiritualised voltage feeling.I’m also listening to Chee Shimizu and Charlie Bones’s NTS radio shows. I love the communal aspect of Charlie’s show, when people call in and have to sing the tune that they want to hear. I have my comfort albums, too: Newworldaquarium’s The Dead Bears Rhythm \u0026amp Sound’s With the Artists.The through line with all this stuff is that it’s intimate music it’s personal to me, or comforting. There’s this element of human touch, or that feeling of getting lost in time, and that is all super relatable to the current moment.• Laurel Halo’s score for the film Possession is released 10 April on The Vinyl Factory"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64da9e65147a06a46c179c1e902f6d034f82d3c4/0_246_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cea9f7afecdaf304eac6a44eff675e47","title":"labour corbynites seek to regroup after keir starmer victory","story":"Richard Burgon hopes to relaunch Campaign Group, potentially with John McDonnell’s supportThe Labour MP Richard Burgon hopes to relaunch the socialist Campaign Group as a leftwing rival to the Fabian Society, as Corbynites seek to regroup following Keir Starmer’s leadership victory.“It’s a platform which he will extend and build on, to keep putting those ideas forward,” said an ally, who underlined the comparison with the Fabians.Burgon’s most eye-catching policy was the idea that Labour members should be given a vote on whether the party’s leader should support any military action not backed by the UN. He called it a “peace pledge”.Allies say he and John McDonnell, the former shadow chancellor, are working to beef up the longstanding Campaign Group, the caucus of socialist MPs behind Corbyn’s candidacy for the leadership in 2015.The revamped organisation is expected to organise events and produce research and policy recommendations, as well as providing allied MPs with support. Burgon expects to play a leading role.The Fabian Society, founded in 1884 to “educate, agitate, organise”, was involved in the creation of the Labour party and has remained affiliated to it, publishing research papers and acting as what it calls a “pluralist, non-factional forum” for developing political ideas.Starmer’s shadow cabinet includes 15 Fabian members, according to the society.Momentum, the grassroots campaign group Jon Lansman set up to support Corbyn’s leadership, is also under pressure to reinvent itself after failing to propel its chosen candidate, Rebecca Long-Bailey, into Labour’s top job.Senior Momentum officials issued a statement on Tuesday saying the organisation could not continue as it had been, calling for “unity, reflection and comradely debate on the way forward”.“At the present moment, our movement is in great peril of making the same mistakes we did after our defeat in the 1980s. We risk retreating from the challenge of making our ideas mainstream, fighting between ourselves and allowing our party to be taken over once more by centrists,” the statement said.It appeared to be an attempt to pre-empt the launch the next day of a ginger group called Forward Momentum, which is calling for movement to be more grassroots-led and democratic, and less London-centric.The group is expected to stand candidates for election to Momentum’s national governing council in May, in what appears to be an attempt to dilute Lansman’s control.As well as failing to back the winner in the leadership race, Momentum’s candidates were defeated in parallel elections for two seats on Labour’s governing national executive committee (NEC).The NEC has sweeping powers over party processes and policies. It took Corbyn more than two years to achieve a consistent majority on it.A spokesperson for Momentum said: “We want to see a Labour government and we will use our campaigning tools to make that happen. We’ll continue to push big ideas. And we are going to work to ensure that Keir sticks to his promises.”His shadow cabinet reshuffle, however, involved a comprehensive clearout of close Corbyn allies, with Burgon joining Jon Trickett, Dan Carden and Ian Lavery on the backbenches. Diane Abbott and John McDonnell had already made clear they would step aside.Long-Bailey, who came second in the leadership contest, was one of the only survivors from the Campaign Group, and will now serve as shadow education secretary.Many Labour veterans see the hand of the canny political strategist McDonnell behind manoeuvres now taking place to ensure leftwing voices remain prominent.“John is mobilising on several fronts, and he’s adept at using proxies and ciphers,” said one senior party insider, joking that the shadow chancellor was “retiring to spend more time on politicking”.Another suggested McDonnell and Burgon were coordinating their efforts, and would take a “comradely” approach to Starmer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f588250368e92ebfa523cc52642da69d166e30d/0_0_3063_1838/master/3063.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02582ec35c4a061237de1761583b6c42","title":"april pink full moon readers photos of the supermoon","story":"A supermoon happens when the moon reaches the closest point to Earth in its 27-day orbit and it happens to be full, which usually occurs once a year.

English club owners from Bristol’s Steve Lansdown to London Irish’s Mick Crossan and unions from England to Australia all agree the suspension of the game as countries look to slow the spread of coronavirus has presented an opportunity to reset the professional game.“Club rugby has to change,” Crossan said. “Last season cost me £4m and I can’t afford that. It’s definitely not a sustainable business. We cannot keep relying on rich benefactors. This crisis may actually help club rugby if everyone cuts their cloth to suit their pockets and it brings back common sense.”The lockdown has exposed the sport’s parlous financial position, union and club, with increases in turnover tending to be spent on wages so they are no better off. Worcester’s last financial accounts showed a turnover of £12.1m that was eclipsed by a wage bill of £12.8m. No wonder the club was sold for £1.“We do not want to come back in and carry on with the same model that repeats the errors of the past,” said the RFU chief executive, Bill Sweeney. “When you have a crisis of this scale, and I do not think anyone predicted this magnitude, it highlights where there are fault lines. Some are being exposed now.”The game in Europe went into the professional era 25 years ago sleepwalking but the south was more alert. Wealthy entrepreneurs in England and France saw an opportunity and took over clubs, quickly finding themselves on a collision course with their unions when there was not even a distant prospect of turning a profit. All that has changed since are running costs owing to an explosion in wages.“We are all acutely aware that from present adversity new opportunity could, and very much should, be born,” said the Welsh Rugby Union chairman, Gareth Davies. “Streamlining our playing calendar and balancing up the need for revenue generation have long been issues facing our sport.“We need each other more than ever to resolve this conundrum and all rugby playing nations should now realise the extent to which we are interdependent. The end result should be a truly global international calendar. Unity is not only the key to survival but long-term prosperity.”Premiership Rugby this week repeated its desire to complete the season and fulfil commercial contracts but it will be a long time before normal life resumes. Even if the restrictions on large gatherings were relaxed sooner rather than later, would there be a demand for big-capacity sporting events amid fears of a renewed outbreak of Covid-19? Social distancing will take on a voluntary nature and there appears to be more chance of next season being affected than a resumption any time soon.The financial squeeze will become greater and when rugby is played again Test matches will have priority because they are the sport’s commercial driver. The south faces losing its incoming tours: if that happened, Europe’s autumn schedule would need to be revamped and revenue shared, a subject the north has consistently refused to address.As Davies said, all the unions are in it together and they have an opportunity to assert their authority together, as they should have done in 1995. This week the French Rugby Federation president, Bernard Laporte, floated the idea of a world club championship, a more exclusive version of the Champions Cup.It was not something he had suddenly dreamed up. Laporte is running on a ticket with the World Rugby chairman, Bill Beaumont, who is up for re-election next month. Laporte is bidding to become his deputy and the governing body’s plan for a nations league, which was scuppered by some of the Six Nations last year, still has legs.The nations league promised a substantial increase in turnover for unions with all the money raised going to the game and none to speculators whose concern was the bottom line. Put together with Laporte’s proposal, it would allow all the tier one unions to contract their leading players, relieving some of the financial burden on clubs in France and England.The clubs would resist the move. Owners have put a significant amount into the domestic game with a consequent rise in playing standards and facilities but wage inflation means the business as a whole is losing some £50m a year, a figure that will rise. The £7m salary cap will be reviewed after the start of the season but it will need to come down rather than go up.The playing calendar in Europe is a compromised mish-mash, a product of the drive for cash, which serves neither club nor country well. It cannot survive the current crisis and unions will never have a better opportunity to force change. The game needs them to seize the moment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c10303e1fc9f871ccc2ad0f81c920a1fcc79fb4/0_0_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=94e0c3280e5dd9b2286973f18d088589","title":"augusta masters golf lee bowyer kieron dyer john arlott commentary classic youtube","story":"This week’s roundup also features John Arlott’s Vintage Cricket, Zidane’s touch and more video game oddities1) Augusta is on our minds but there it’ll stay with the real thing postponed until later in the year… hopefully. We could cheer you up with glorious Masters moments of years gone by: Sandy Lyle’s stunning bunker shot from 1988 or Tiger’s “in your life” chip-in at 16 from 2005. But let’s also reflect the theme of crashing disappointment. So, here’s Larry Mize chipping in to break Greg Norman’s heart and win the 1987 Masters in a playoff and how about handy linksman Alan Hansen talking you through Norman’s infamous 1996 collapse against Nick Faldo. Then there’s the Masters’ excruciating equivalent of meeting the in-laws for the first time: here’s a Butler Cabin special from 2012 with Bubba Watson botching his handshake with Augusta National chairman Billy Payne. And a sliding doors moment. It could have been oh so different for Tiger last year had this security guard connected properly.2) It was 15 years ago last weekend that Lee Bowyer and Kieron Dyer put their dukes up against each while playing for the same Newcastle United team. Here’s Dyer’s take on the issue nine years later. That brought back memories of David Batty and Graeme Le Saux’s fisticuffs in Blackburn shirts at Spartak Moscow in 1995.3) Also due to start this week, the county cricket season, for which the weather would have been just fine, but instead there’s time to look back on Essex’s victory in last year’s County Championship. Essex were also victorious in the Vitality Blast Twenty20 finals. For those needing a cricket fix, how about John Arlott’s Vintage Cricket, a collection of some of the legendary commentator’s favourite moments, and featuring that much-missed Hampshire burr. Here’s Arlott’s commentary on Geoffrey Boycott’s maiden Test century, against Australia at The Oval in 1964.4) Zinedine Zidane had quite the first touch. In fact, apologies – that probably shouldn’t be in the past tense. Trevor Francis wasn’t exactly indelicate either.5) More from when sport and video games collide … Shaq Fu! And here he is in Ready 2 Rumble Boxing too (which also features Michael Jackson and – eh? – both Bill and Hillary Clinton) … and UFC Undisputed 2010. But Shaquille O’Neal is arguably not the weirdest cross-pollination of the beat ’em up genre: here’s Fighters Megamix, where one of the unlockable characters is an anthropomorphised stock car from Daytona USA. Bill Clinton, of course, also found his way into NBA Jam.1) Adriano Solano of Venezuela, possibly the world’s worst competitive cross-county skier.2) Speedball 2, an absolute classic, futuristic kick-ass Rollerball-style ruck on the Amiga, was a surprising nomination for a second-tier sport-related video game. Two from the BBC Micro are surer bets: Dare Devil Denis and the superbly primitive Graham Gooch’s Test Cricket, a game that could be played entirely with the space bar. The latter was perhaps outclassed by Brian Lara Cricket on the Mega-Drive.3) Leeds Rhino Adrian Morley gets KO-ed by Wigan Warriors’ Mick Cassidy in 1998, not that Morley couldn’t dish it out himself.Do subscribe, if you fancy.Do subscribe, if you fancy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3dd8f28b504cd21dbcafa2b075c2dfecc92848ec/1387_27_3723_2234/master/3723.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b7dab84ac31738c12fbec3432f87c41e","title":"comedy online coronavirus lockdown facebook whatsapp iain stirling jayde adams","story":"From Iain Stirling’s Fifa banter to Jayde Adams live from her lounge, comedians isolated by the lockdown are reaching audiences onlineFor Scottish comedian and Love Island narrator Iain Stirling, nothing compares to live standup comedy. “Telling the audience something that you find bizarre or idiosyncratic about your life and psyche, and having a roomful of people going: Ha ha ha! We’re like that as well!” He laughs at the relief it brings. “You go, thank God!”The coronavirus lockdown means it could be months until standups are able to hear the roar of laughter in comedy clubs again. Meanwhile, many are making the most of online platforms. Stirling, whose UK tour dates have been postponed, is live-streaming to his fans on Twitch, which principally involves chatting about gaming while he plays Fifa. Many of us are only just discovering networks such as Zoom and Houseparty during confinement, but Stirling was an early adopter and uses Twitch when working away from home on Love Island.“You know in the American local news there’s those articles about the guy from Arizona who has built a zombie apocalypse bunker and everyone’s like, ‘What have you built that for?’” When the worst happens, he says, everyone wants their own bunker. “That’s how I feel about comedy and Twitch.”Some have subscribed to his channel for so long that “you get to know people and what they’re up to”. He ends sessions with a raid, which sends his viewers to another live channel. “I’ll find someone with fewer than 10 viewers and a decent size webcam. Then I chuck 500-odd people into their chat. Sometimes they’re playing League of Legends with their mates and resent it.” He laughs. “Generally, it’s good.”It may not be the same as performing to a sold-out comedy crowd but Twitch “scratches the itch” when Stirling is missing standup. His partner, the presenter Laura Whitmore, “has noticed I’ve stopped doing material at her in the kitchen, which is good”.For some, online comedy offers escapism during confinement. Alexis Strum’s new podcast, The Funny Women Survival Guide, is specifically designed to uplift. Strum introduces herself as a writer and performer, then adds newly discovered roles as home-schooler and hairdresser that will be relatable for many. With subjects in the first episode including being upstaged by your pet on conference calls, she describes her podcast as an attempt “to cheer up the nation”.Taskmaster’s Alex Horne is challenging the nation with Home Tasking, a series of eccentric assignments – “Throw a piece of paper into a bin spectacularly”, “Make the best dancing elephant” – to keep families entertained. Participants share videos of their attempts and a modest prize is promised. (“Something nice,” says Horne. “Not a car.”)Standup Philip Simon had gigs and a TV commercial cancelled because of the crisis, so to give himself – and others with kids – “a little focus”, he established School’s Out Comedy Club. Simon invites children to submit jokes, which he says develops their creative writing skills, and he performs them to camera. Some children submit videos of themselves telling gags. The next episode is dedicated to the NHS so “doctor, doctor” jokes are welcome.Standup Kae Kurd has a nice line in funny videos about stressed dads cutting their kids’ hair and helping with homework. Kurd doesn’t have children – he is in isolation with his brothers – but he has a lot of friends with kids and knows what they are going through. “It’s funny seeing how parents are dealing with this. At first they’re like, ‘The structure is really important.’ After a week, it’s like, ‘Can you just stay in your room and not accidentally stab yourself?’”Kurd has been prolific at sharing homemade funnies but says standups in the UK haven’t tended to focus on making material specially for online. “We’re similar to New York comics in the sense that we can make a living off gigs. But if you look at comics from LA, they have to work on web series and podcasts, too.” He is sharing videos on social media to build his audience, but it’s also a coping mechanism. Plus, he doesn’t want to be doing material about the lockdown when it’s over and he goes on tour. “I might as well get these ideas out while I can when we’re all going through it. The last thing people will want to hear afterwards is, “Remember corona?’ I can already imagine the jokes: ‘I was self-isolating, which is like The Hunger Games but with my cat …’ Get away from me, man. I don’t want to hear any of that crap.”Creating viral comedy is “a distinctly different skill” to standup, he says. If he has a good idea, “I just try it and see how people receive it. You will know from the views and engagement levels what works better.” It’s an accelerated process of preparing new material to try at a gig – you can film instantly at home and get an immediate response online.Viewers are visiting many comedians’ homes during the lockdown. Jayde Adams is hosting a weekly half-hour “couch cabaret” on Facebook Live from her living room (a treasure trove of fabulousness with a plush blue sofa). Her first show included singing sisters Flo \u0026amp Joan harmonising through isolation, Rose Matafeo doing a Phantom of the Opera number with a pair of glove puppets, and Steve Bugeja’s predictions for life after lockdown. (“Dogs will get excited when we leave for work, not when we get home.”) Adams featured in a sketch imagining the unfortunate effects of Joe Wicks’s stomping exercises for his neighbours. The show was watched by audiences around the world, from Adams’ home town of Bristol to the US, where her Amazon Prime show, Serious Black Jumper, is a hit and led to a surge of interest on TikTok.Adams says she’s fortunate because, unlike a lot of comedians on the circuit, she has television and radio work, too, and doesn’t rely purely on live shows. She acknowledges that standup online can be very difficult to pull off without an audience in the room because you usually “ride their laughter like a surfer”.Her cabaret gives a platform to comedians, musicians and dancers who may not otherwise have the technical knowhow to share work and successfully find audiences online. She decided to put together a variety bill for locked-in audiences because that’s the entertainment she remembers watching at home with her family as a child – though you’d imagine that those TV cabaret shows didn’t feature, as hers does, a man named Pudding wearing a gimp suit. Pudding is Adams’ boyfriend, comedian Rich Wilson. They are sharing their home with another comedian, Paul Sweeney, and film and edit the show themselves. The trio also have an online pub quiz and gin club.Kiri Pritchard-McLean is compering Saturday night gigs on Zoom, with proceeds being split between performers and charity. The lineups combine established names and “gems from the circuit”, with tickets being sold for £2 or £10 if you want a “front row” ticket, which allows you to share your screen and chat to her. She points out that it is a comedy bill curated by a comedian rather than a producer, so her bills will reflect a wider pool of talent from the comedy circuit than a TV producer’s might.Even BBC regulars such as Have I Got News for You and The Mash Report are bringing together hosts and guests from their lounges and spare rooms. Aspiring comedy producer Andy Ash has been quick to develop his own format, which he describes as “a social distancing panel show with isolated comedians”. WhatsApp’ening is hosted by Mark O’Sullivan from Lee and Dean, and its panelists must separate fact from fiction. The game is played via a WhatsApp group chat and the loser forfeits control of their WhatsApp so the winner can send messages to whoever they like. Episode one featured Stevie Martin (sporting a stylish eyepatch due to an infection), Jacob Hawley, Nic Sampson and Lauren Pattison, who is in lockdown at her childhood home.Some of Ash’s guests had Edinburgh fringe shows lined up and he recognises that the festival’s cancellation is an “immeasurable blow” for many comedians. He fears the climate threatens artistic aspirations “particularly if you come from a poorer background”. He says that, as well as donating to funds for freelance creatives, it can also be productive to “invest in something creative and funny”. Ash became involved in comedy production as a way of dealing with grief after his mother died in 2016. “I decided I wanted to be a part of making people happy, bringing laughter to them,” he says. During lockdown, “now more than ever we need something to laugh at, to be joyous about”.The nimble world of online comedy content, which can be swiftly created, widely shared and is vital as clubs remain closed, could introduce a new wave of comedians to audiences. Ash points to the boom in bedroom music production in the 90s and how it created a revolution. “Maybe this could be a moment for comedy, too. I certainly hope so.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c65b0d722bf8527f606b217a9849f4c03bd3d0e/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=25340d45389eeed57a72c647303e2e94","title":"the swan birmingham royal ballet lockdown","story":"Watch a short solo from Birmingham Royal Ballet performed by a dancer and two musicians in their own homes • Hottest front-room seats: the best theatre and dance to watch onlineThe dancing lasts less than three minutes, but it’s just the fillip we need right now a gem of a moment to pull focus in often otherwise blurry days. The Swan is a lockdown offering from Birmingham Royal Ballet. Relayed in split-screen, a pianist (Jonathan Higgins), cellist (António Novais) and dancer (Céline Gittens) – all in their separate homes – perform Mikhail Fokine’s The Dying Swan, with a surprise ending.The short solo, set to Saint-Saëns’ Le Cygne, was created in 1905 for the legendary ballerina Anna Pavlova, and it captures the ephemeral otherworldliness of the ballerina’s art, as well as ballet’s enduring image of the fluttering, beautifully doomed white swan.There’s great intimacy in inviting an audience into your home, close enough to Gittens to see the seams of her tights. Just as well, this solo is all about the details: the barely moving bourrées set to a gentle simmer, the slightest acceleration or pause in the swoop of her arms, the engrossing undulations of shoulder blades. There’s a single moment of melodrama when an arm is flung to the floor and Gittens looks like a silent-movie heroine.A choreographic intervention by BRB director Carlos Acosta means this is no longer a dying swan but one who, in the final moments, raises her head, hand and heart in hope. It sounds cheesy, but it’s lovely. When a dancer herself is transported, so can we be, too.There’s something pleasantly jarring about the combination of sublime art and prosaic domestic details – radiator, light switch, the pot plant Gittens brushes past as she dances into frame. This collision of the ordinary and the exceptional, the magical and mundane, brings human connection and fantastical escapism all in the space of 165 seconds."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/df85bf4a8a66bd386219b6a1a158f31b4f28c4f5/0_365_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d14bf4915cb0749f0299588c6cd1cf02","title":"airbnb suspends new uk bookings until at least 18 april coronavirus","story":"Only key workers will be able to book stays via accommodation website amid coronavirus crisisAirbnb has blocked UK properties from accepting new bookings for the coming days unless they are for key workers.It comes after the accommodation website was criticised for advertising properties as suitable for guests to use to self-isolate during the coronavirus pandemic.The firm said it had stopped properties from receiving new bookings until at least 18 April.An exception will be made for its initiative that offers free stays for NHS staff and paid or subsidised stays for other key workers exempt from the government’s travel restrictions.Last week, Airbnb blocked private room bookings and temporarily removed the ability for whole properties to be instantly booked.Its director of public policy, Patrick Robinson, said: “Hosts across the UK are playing a vital role in housing NHS and other medical staff as they continue their critical work.

But the danger of a second wave is very real.“While these control measures appear to have reduced the number of infections to very low levels, without herd immunity against Covid-19, cases could easily resurge as businesses, factory operations, and schools gradually resume and increase social mixing, particularly given the increasing risk of imported cases from overseas as Covid-19 continues to spread globally,” says Prof Joseph T Wu from the University of Hong Kong, who co-led the research.China has pushed the reproductive number – the number of people on average that one person with Covid-19 will infect – from two or three to below one, where the epidemic is effectively shrinking.But, the researchers warn, if normal life is allowed to resume too quickly and the lifting of controls is too extensive, the reproductive number will rise again. Governments will need to keep a close watch on what is happening, they say.“Although control policies such as physical distancing and behavioural change are likely to be maintained for some time, proactively striking a balance between resuming economic activities and keeping the reproductive number below one is likely to be the best strategy until effective vaccines become widely available,” said Wu.“Even in the most prosperous and well-resourced megacities like Beijing and Shanghai, healthcare resources are finite, and services will struggle with a sudden increase in demand”, says senior author Prof Gabriel M Leung from the University of Hong Kong. “Our findings highlight the importance of ensuring that local healthcare systems have adequate staffing and resources to minimise Covid-related deaths.”Their analysis uses local Health Commission data of confirmed Covid-19 cases between mid-January and 29 February in four cities – Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Wenzhou and the ten provinces outside Hubei with the highest numbers of cases. It leads them to urge that controls should be relaxed only gradually.Allowing the rate of infections to rise again “would probably incur both marginally higher health and economic loss”, even if tough measures are put back in place to bring the numbers of cases back down.Striking a balance between allowing economic activities and keeping controls tight enough to prevent a rise in infections “is likely to be the optimal strategy until effective vaccines become widely available, despite the fact that control policies, including social distancing, behavioural change and public awareness will probably be maintained for some time”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0df3e6a0c1c747b2f6451abb8efbb304b055a0bf/0_316_4928_2956/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=799a532951fcc071e94d7c2f2631e289","title":"uk covid 19 lockdown to be extended beyond next week","story":"Ministers voice concern Easter weekend could see change in public behaviourDominic Raab is expected to signal that stringent lockdown measures must remain in place beyond next week, in the first key government decision to be taken while the prime minister remains in intensive care.The death toll from coronavirus is continuing to rise daily, with 938 UK fatalities announced on Wednesday – close to the highest daily figures reported in Italy and Spain. Medical experts are not expecting the peak to come for more than week.With the long Easter weekend looming, ministers are concerned that any suggestion of an imminent loosening of restrictions could result in an immediate change in the public’s behaviour. has learned that at least five police chief constables want the government to consider toughening coronavirus lockdown restrictions amid concerns that a growing minority will flout the rules over the bank holiday. Options for more stringent curbs include preventing people driving long distances and legislation to enforce the government’s order to limit exercise to once a day.Government sources suggested Raab, the foreign secretary deputising for Boris Johnson “where necessary”, would address the issue at Thursday’s Downing Street press conference – and prepare the public for an extension of the measures put in place on 23 March.Legislation to implement the measures dictates that the health secretary, Matt Hancock, must also oversee a formal review of their impact by next Thursday – and another within three weeks after that.Johnson, 55, was set to spend a third night in intensive care at St Thomas’ hospital in London on Wednesday night. While his condition was said to be improving – with Johnson able to sit up and talk to medics – Raab is now chairing the powerful four-man Covid-19 committee, which has continued to drive the government’s response to the crisis while the prime minister is in hospital.The group, effectively an inner cabinet that meets daily, also includes the cabinet office minister, Michael Gove, Hancock and the chancellor, Rishi Sunak.On Tuesday, Raab declined to say whether a review of the restrictions would take place as planned next week, in the absence of Johnson. But the foreign secretary is expected to address the issue directly on Thursday, after a Cobra meeting in the morning – the first since the measures were imposed.Current restrictions oblige the public to remain at home unless they are exercising, shopping for essentials or going to a job that cannot be carried out at home.Pressure for clarity from the government intensified on Wednesday, as senior politicians from across the UK suggested the lockdown must remain in force.Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, said: “I think when the prime minister announced the lockdown just over two and half weeks ago, he said he would review it in three weeks’ time, which is this Monday. I think we’re nowhere near lifting the lockdown.In Northern Ireland, the communities minister, Deirdre Hargey, suggested the lockdown should remain in place “for the foreseeable future”.Mark Drakeford, the Welsh first minister, told an online meeting of the Welsh assembly: “We will not throw away the gains we have made, and the lives we can save, by abandoning our efforts just as they begin to bear fruit.”He added: “There is more work to do in reviewing the regulations. The precise nature of what will follow the current regime will be agreed over the coming days.”Nicola Sturgeon also said that Scotland is not expecting to see an end to the lockdown any time soon. It is understood that evidence to the Scottish government does not support the idea that the peak of cases or deaths is imminent north of the border, and the expectation in Holyrood is that rigorous physical distancing is likely to have to go on for 12-13 weeks.Sunak made clear at Wednesday’s press conference that the evidence is not yet available to enable politicians to lift the lockdown – and suggested formal confirmation of any extension may not come until next week. He said the Cobra meeting on Thursday would “talk about the approach to the review”.That message was underlined by the government’s deputy chief scientific adviser, Prof Angela McLean, who said the government would need evidence about whether the entire “suite” of lockdown measures is working, before any decision to lift them could be made."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00bf46f0f2ed7030342c09c1e8c4d125cdf078d9/0_173_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8a80380e24b9b74f1e29267a80d3dba9","title":"benedictine nuns release gregorian chants to help ease coronavirus isolation","story":"French order opens abbey doors to allow what could be the largest recording project everA monastery of Benedictine nuns living in seclusion in southern France has opened its doors to allow recordings of its Gregorian chants to be made available to the outside world.In what is believed to be the largest recording project ever conducted, the US musician John Anderson followed the 45-strong order for three years. He installed microphones in the abbey church of Notre-Dame de Fidélité de Jouques near Aix-en-Provence in southern France and captured the nuns singing their eight daily “offices”. The result is thousands of chants, the entire Gregorian repertoire, about 7,000 hours long.The Gregorian chant originated in the 8th century and spread throughout Europe. It accords to St Benedict’s “rule”, in which the day is ided into balanced isions of manual and intellectual work, prayer and rest, starting at 5am with the chanting of matins, and concluding with compline at 8pm, followed by the “great silence” of night.The Jouques nuns’ lead a strict life of contemplation in which they recite the chants daily.The abbey, which has its own congregation, is closed for Easter as a result of rules applied to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. “Because of the measures taken ... we can no longer admit worshippers to our abbey’s church, and we are deeply sorry for it,” the nuns said.They have instead allowed the release of a week’s worth of their chants https:www.neumz for the six days Christians refer to as holy week, preceding Easter Sunday, the highlight of the religious calendar, when the chants have a particular importance. The rest is to go live next month.The chants are presented together with their simple scores, Latin texts and translations, allowing subscribers to sing together with the nuns.Anderson was inspired by the Gregorian chants after an aunt joined the convent and he visited her during his summer holidays from university.“The community is living in communion with nature and in quiet contemplation. Their life is regularised by the rhythm of prayer and work,” he said. “The simple beauty of their singing” had had a profound influence on him, he said, and “on the sensation of time, the amount of focus it was possible to achieve in such tranquillity”.After negotiating with the nuns for a week, he and a sound technician suspended eight low-profile microphones in the church, which recorded into a small recorder that saved the music to SD cards.The nuns pressed “record” every time they entered the church and “stop” when they exited after each service. A 4G modem was installed at the monastery, enabling the nuns to upload the 24GB of contents to the technicians’ Google Drive account every evening, from where the recordings were mixed and mastered.Organised so as to be as minimally invasive to the nuns’ lives, the recordings of clear unaccompanied voices are speckled with authentic sounds such as the creak of wooden benches, the occasional coughing or dropping of prayer books and bell chimes.Anderson, a founder of Odradek Records originally from Kansas but now living in Italy, said the launch of the project, which was eight years in the making and would raise money for the order’s sister monastery in Benin, west Africa, had come at the right time, when many people were detached from their work and social contacts.“In these days of remote work and online social activity, we hope that listening to the chants of holy week can help bring people together, religious and non-, sharing in a sense of peace and enjoying their timeless beauty,” he said.“The sisters live this paradox already – in isolation but in continuous prayer for the rest of the world, and in community amongst themselves. These days we are maybe experiencing a similar sensation, to be physically isolated but sometimes even closer together emotionally.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1ce2b23dbbd83b265ee50b822b9c37dbbcaaedc/0_249_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=e66042355ba8b14896ec2923bdcef199","title":"coronavirus could double number of people going hungry","story":"Exclusive: multinationals write to G7 and G20 urging leaders to keep borders open to trade and avert global food crisisFood supplies across the world will be “massively disrupted” by the coronavirus, and unless governments act the number of people suffering chronic hunger could double, some of the world’s biggest food companies have warned.Unilever, Nestlé and PepsiCo, along with farmers’ organisations, the UN Foundation, academics, and civil society groups, have written to world leaders, calling on them to keep borders open to trade in order to help society’s most vulnerable, and to invest in environmentally sustainable food production.They urge governments to “take urgent coordinated action to prevent the Covid-19 pandemic turning into a global food and humanitarian crisis”. Maintaining open trade will be key, as will investing in food supply chains and protecting farmers in the developed and developing world, they say.The G20 is coming under increasing pressure to act: a group of Nobel prize-winning economists and former senior development bank officials wrote to the forum advising that trillions of dollars would be needed to help the developing world cope with the Covid-19 pandemic. This week more than 100 former heads of government, including Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and Nicolas Sarkozy, also called on the G20 to act urgently or risk recurrent outbreaks.However, little coordinated action has been agreed. The UN Food and Agriculture Organisation is increasingly worried that, although harvests are good and enough food is being produced to feed the world, export restrictions or tariffs by some governments could create shortages.The urgent warning from food industry leaders comes as some countries have begin to restrict certain foods. Curbs on the movement of people, because of lockdowns, also threatens to create shortages of farm labour at a crucial time of year for many crops.“The risk of major interruptions to food supplies over the coming months is growing, especially for low-income net-food-importing countries, many of which are in sub-Saharan Africa,” the food industry leaders warn in their letter.Ports and borders must be kept open to the food trade, they urge, and big food exporting nations “must make it clear that they will continue to fully supply international markets and customers”.The business leaders also want investment in local food production, treating farmers, people working in food processing and all parts of the food supply chain as key workers. Small farmers may need access to credit to keep producing, and the letter calls on banks and major companies to help them.As people lose their jobs, or their income falls because of the lockdowns or ill health, hunger is likely to increase. “It would not be hard to envisage scenarios in which the number of people suffering from hunger on a daily basis, already estimated at over 800 million, doubles over the coming months, with a huge risk of increased malnutrition and child stunting,” the food companies warn.Targeted food aid programmes, from the government, private sector and charities, will be needed, as well as income safety nets, the letter says. Cash assistance should be directed urgently to the developing world, and this must go far beyond the debt relief some countries have suggested.Food distribution would also be key, Wanjira Mathai, director for Africa at the World Resources Institute, said. “We must ensure that supply and distribution chains can guarantee the delivery of food to the most vulnerable of our populations, especially in densely populated urban settlements, while at the same time containing Covid-19,” she said.“A vital part of this includes investing in and supporting the last mile of distribution, so that food can reach people’s homes and not get stuck in central food stores.”As governments prepare to help their economies recover from the coronavirus crisis, they should invest in making the food system more environmentally and socially sustainable, the letter says. That will require new investment and the reform of existing subsidies, nurturing agricultural land to keep it fertile, and a focus on nutritious and affordable food production, as well as ways to cut down on food waste.“Today’s food system is fragile, due to chronic under-investment, the over-depletion of natural resources, and the partial misallocation of over $700bn (564bn) of annual support measures,” the signatories warn. “There is no short-term fix to these challenges, but we can seize the opportunity to recover in a better and stronger way.”They advocate developing regional food supply networks, and providing free healthcare and income support, as well as investment in new technologies. Rich countries should help the poor to achieve this.“Getting the food system right is central to a resilient recovery across the world, creating the potential for millions of new jobs, less hunger, greater food security and better management of key natural resources: soil, water, forests and the oceans,” the letter concludes.The companies behind the letter are also taking their own action on the Covid-19 crisis. Nestlé is working with the Red Cross, giving food, medical nutrition products and bottled water for humanitarian relief, donating 10m Swiss francs (£8.2m) for the countries most in need. PepsiCo has donated $45m to developed and developing countries, and is supplying 50m meals to food banks, while Unilever is donating $100m of its products and extending $500m in credit to its small-scale producers.The letter is being sent to the leaders of the G7 and the G20, and to other countries."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7200859fb487792e1336e456cb1a1b0c126614c/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c3503426875ecac8614c1ddb0a46742","title":"coronavirus latest at a glance thursday","story":"A summary of the biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreakKey developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:Italy’s prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, told the BBC that some restrictions could be relaxed by the end of April if the spread of the disease continued to slow.

Dozens of deaths have been linked to cruise ships, with both passengers and crew dying while at sea and after disembarking. According to analysis using the ship-tracking site CruiseMapper, at least eight ships remain at sea with passengers – including one vessel on which 128 people tested positive for coronavirus.Mitigation efforts are working, White House officials have said, leading to cautious optimism the pandemic will not claim between 100,000 and 240,000 American lives.

To ensure compliance with the instruction to stay at home, the government will:Parks will remain open for exercise, but gatherings will be dispersed.According to a leaked transcript of a Zoom meeting seen by the BBC, Shute said: “You are no more at risk at the workplace as you would be in your home or at the supermarket. It is about minimising it.He added: “We cannot hide away from it forever.”This mirrored earlier government briefings but the position was overtaken when computer modelling suggested a lockdown would be needed to reduce infections.Myrtle Lloyd, HMPO’s chief operating officer, was also on the call.She reportedly told staff the guidance did not mean they “should stay at home instead of delivering critical services”.“What is also critical for us as a business is to have a manageable level of work in the system, so that when we start our recovery we are not overwhelmed by our demands,” she reportedly said.The Public and Commercial Services union (PCS) raised concerns about the reports, and said it had been pressing managers across the civil service to close offices so people could work from home.The PCS general secretary, Mark Serwotka, said: “It is absolutely scandalous that HMPO are suggesting our members can go back into work during a pandemic to process routine passports.“The cavalier approach to our members’ health and safety is shameful and ultimately puts them in greater danger of contracting Covid-19.“We have already had members die as a result of contracting corona, and pressured civil service managers in other departments to shut offices so staff can work from home.“For the deputy chief scientific adviser at the Home Office to suggest that going into work does not put you at greater risk of contracting corona is extremely irresponsible and totally contradicts current government guidance.“Processing passports is not critical work while we are in lockdown and international travel is practically non-existent due to the corona pandemic.”A Home Office spokesman said: “Her Majesty’s Passport Office is fully adhering to public health advice across all our offices and adopting social distancing measures to keep both its staff and customers safe.“It continues to operate at substantially restricted staffing levels with a significant number of people working from home where possible, and staff are prioritising emergency cases. Guidance is also available for people who are travelling into work.“It was made clear in the meeting that the government’s priority is slowing the spread of coronavirus and we all have a part to play in order to protect the NHS and save lives.”The Home Office added that government advice had been clear that people may travel for work purposes, if they could not work from home."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0bd4648de91595554b5bb66b0b6d0abdd18f6edc/0_32_5284_3171/master/5284.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7693fae3af92b3d1c0800edfbd3f0c42","title":"have australia new zealand stopped covid 19 in its tracks coronavirus","story":"Southern hemisphere neighbours have developed different strategies but both are working – for nowIts more than 35,000km (21,750 miles) of coastline was always going to be Australia’s strongest advantage in keeping coronavirus at bay, but even so, the speed with which it was used was breathtaking.Without warning on Thursday 19 March, the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, announced: “Australia is closing its borders to all-non citizens”. The ban was effective from 9pm the next day.That left visitors and visa holders stranded mid-journey, or turned around at the border and packed back on to planes, and left hundreds of thousands of Australians scrambling to get home, many of whom remain stuck in countries similarly locked down or without flights home.Australia and neighbouring New Zealand, almost unique among anglophone countries, have so far been successful in largely suppressing the spread of Covid-19 within their countries, and in particular, keeping deaths low.Australia, with a population of 25 million, has had just over 6,000 infections, and 50 deaths. New Zealand, a country of 5 million people, which closed its borders the day before Australia, has had 1,200 infections and so far only one death from Covid-19.Both countries have enacted strict physical distancing regimes, enforced by police. Planes have been grounded, workers have been told to stay home, schools have been closed in some places, and entire industries put into hibernation.And in both countries, the early decision, and the capability, to enforce a total lockdown of borders has proven crucial, buying valuable time to prepare, and allowing both nations to flatten the trajectory of their Covid-19 infection curves.“We have so far avoided the horror scenarios that we have seen overseas, whether it be initially in China in Wuhan, or in New York in the United States, or Italy, or Spain, or even the United Kingdom,” Morrison said this week. “But we must hold the course. We must lock in these gains.”Australia has inherent advantages. If a country were to be designed to withstand a viral pandemic such as Covid-19, it would look very much like Australia: geographically distant, a large island nation with borders than can be locked down, inhabited by a comparatively small population that lives, in the main, in low-density cities.Australia is wealthy, too, with a highly developed public health system, and a government sufficiently solvent to be able to turn on the tap of public monies to get its population through the months of lockdown. Legislation for $130bn (£65bn) in wage subsidies for those who have lost jobs because of the pandemic was passed by parliament this week, on top of $84bn in economic stimulus promised earlier.Australia also has had the advantage of watching the Covid-19 pandemic unfold in other countries. The delay has given it time to prepare its public health system – additional beds and staff have been readied for the coming peak– as well as its public. Internal restrictions have also been put in place. Australia’s states have closed their borders to each other for the first time since the Spanish flu outbreak of 1918.There have been significant and severe missteps, the most egregious being the decision in March to allow the Ruby Princess cruise ship to dock at Circular Quay in Sydney Harbour, allowing more than 2,700 passengers to disembark without testing, despite there being people with Covid-19 infections onboard.Another misstep was at Sydney airport. Just as physical distancing laws were being imposed across the country, social media videos showed border force officials corralling arriving passengers from all over the world to wait in cramped halls and tight queues.Apart from the impact of these failures on infection rates, they have damaged public confidence in the government’s measures. Just as the country, state by state, was being put into lockdown, governments were undermining their own messages to self-isolate to save lives.There has been, too, overreaction. In NSW, a man was fined by police for sitting on a park bench and eating a kebab. In Victoria, a learner driver practising with her mother was given a $1,600 fine, later rescinded after a backlash.But Australians have, by and large, tolerated the imposition of lockdowns. After thousands gathered at Bondi Beach on a warm autumnal Friday evening in March, it was summarily shut down and put under police guard. With occasional defiance, it has remained eerily deserted since.Ten days after New Zealand’s centre-left government closed its borders to foreign nationals it introduced some of the toughest lockdown measures in the world. No one had yet died and cases had just passed 100.“Stay home, save lives,” the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, urged her citizens, ordering them to remain in their homes for a month. “The situation here is moving at pace, and so must we. The trajectory is very clear, act now or risk the virus taking hold as it has elsewhere.”Ardern said the worst-case scenario was “simply intolerable” – up to 80,000 dead, modelling predicted – representing the greatest loss of life in New Zealand’s history. “I will not take that chance,” Ardern said. “We’re going hard and we’re going early.”The nation was given two days to prepare, panic buying was widespread. But when the moment came – effective house arrest for the majority of the population – there was absolute quiet on the streets.Despite their reputation for having an independent streak and a benign disdain for authority, New Zealanders have been overwhelmingly compliant with the restrictive measures, with a total of 367 breaches recorded by police. Eager surfers and mountain bikers have caused the most persistent headaches, according to the police commissioner.New Zealand is one of the few countries worldwide to pursue an “elimination” strategy, and the plan has the backing of the scientific community, many of whom want the country to stay in a version of lockdown until a vaccine can be deployed.David Skegg, an emeritus professor of epidemiology at the University of Otago, said: “We could effectively eliminate the virus over the next few weeks … we still have a window of opportunity but only if we lift our game quickly.”Fellow Otago epidemiologist Prof Michael Baker is one of the key architects behind New Zealand’s coronavirus defence plan. He says an elimination strategy is well suited to an island state, where borders can be swiftly and effectively closed.Writing in the New Zealand Medical Journal, Baker said the strategy would save lives, but at huge social and economic cost, particularly “for those with the fewest resources”. “New Zealand society has made a large ‘upfront’ sacrifice in pursuing an elimination strategy,” he said.For the first 12 days of lockdown, the numbers of cases rose steadily, as predicted by health officials. But cases have been steadily declining, and the prime minister has said she is “cautiously optimistic” that the strategy is working.On Wednesday, New Zealand recorded its lowest number of new cases in a fortnight, one day after testing a record number of people. More people are now recovering from the disease than being infected by it, an “encouraging milestone”, the country’s director general of health said.Attention and anticipation is turning to a gradual exit from lockdown in late April. Ardern has said it is likely some regions of the country will remain in total lockdown, while regions with few or no cases will ease into more freedoms. The borders remain closed to foreign nationals, and mandatory quarantining of arrivals is to be introduced today.“We have positive signs, not least the fact that we could have had 4,000 cases now, instead of 1,000,” Ardern said.“But I don’t want to get ahead of ourselves.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/835ca0de47d1b0c4f370afaa524e8be3d0abcf2d/1075_407_1233_740/master/1233.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d786d2fecdcdda8a766f5957be0982d7","title":"how did the coronavirus start where did it come from how did it spread humans was it really bats pangolins wuhan animal market","story":"It’s likely Covid-19 originated in bats, scientists say. But did it then spread to pangolins and humans?In the public mind, the origin story of coronavirus seems well fixed: in late 2019 someone at the now world-famous Huanan seafood market in Wuhan was infected with a virus from an animal.The rest is part of an awful history still in the making, with Covid-19 spreading from that first cluster in the capital of China’s Hubei province to a pandemic that has killed about 80,000 people so far.Stock footage of pangolins – a scaly mammal that looks like an anteater – have made it on to news bulletins, suggesting this animal was the staging post for the virus before it spread to humans.But there is uncertainty about several aspects of the Covid-19 origin story that scientists are trying hard to unravel, including which species passed it to a human. They’re trying hard because knowing how a pandemic starts is a key to stopping the next one.Prof Stephen Turner, head of the department of microbiology at Melbourne’s Monash University, says what’s most likely is that virus originated in bats.But that’s where his certainty ends, he says.On the hypothesis that the virus emerged at the Wuhan live animal market from an interaction between an animal and a human, Turner says: “I don’t think it’s conclusive by any means.”“Part of the problem is that the information is only as good as the surveillance,” he says, adding that viruses of this type are circulating all the time in the animal kingdom.The fact that the virus has infected a tiger in a New York zoo shows how viruses can move around between species, he says. “Understanding the breadth of species this virus can infect is important as it helps us narrow down down where it might have come from.”Scientists say it is highly likely that the virus came from bats but first passed through an intermediary animal in the same way that another coronavirus – the 2002 Sars outbreak – moved from horseshoe bats to cat-like civets before infecting humans.One animal implicated as an intermediary host between bats and humans is the pangolin. The International Union for Conservation of Nature says they are “the most illegally traded mammal in the world” and are prized for their meat and the claimed medicinal properties of their scales.As reported in Nature, pangolins were not listed on the inventory of items being sold in Wuhan, although this omission could be deliberate as it’s illegal to sell them.“Whether the poor pangolin was the species at which it jumped, it’s not clear,” Turner says. “It’s either mixed in something else, mixed in a poor pangolin, or it’s jumped into people and evolved in people.”Prof Edward Holmes, of the University of Sydney, was a co-author on a Nature study that examined the likely origins of the virus by looking at its genome. On social media he has stressed that the identity of the species that served as an intermediate host for the virus is “still uncertain”.One statistical study looked at a characteristic of the virus that evolved to enable it to latch on to human cells. Pangolins were able to develop this characteristic, but so were cats, buffalo, cattle, goats, sheep and pigeons.Another study claimed to have ruled out pangolins as an intermediary altogether, because samples of similar viruses taken from pangolins lacked a chain of amino acids seen in the virus now circulating in humans.The study Holmes worked on suggested that the scenario in which a human at the Wuhan market interacted with an animal that carried the virus was only one potential version of the Covid-19 origin story. Another was the possibility that a descendent of the virus jumped into humans and then adapted as it was passed from human to human.“Once acquired, these adaptations would enable the pandemic to take off and produce a sufficiently large cluster of cases to trigger the surveillance system that detected it,” the study said.This might be another reason to doubt the established story.Prof Stanley Perlman, a leading immunologist at the University of Iowa and an expert on previous coronavirus outbreaks that have stemmed from animals, says the idea the link to the Wuhan market is coincidental “cannot be ruled out” but that possibility “seems less likely” because the genetic material of the virus had been found in the market environment.Perlman told  Australia he does believe there was an intermediary animal but adds that while pangolins are possible candidates, they “are not proven to be the key intermediary”.So-called wet markets – where live animals are traded – have been implicated in previous outbreaks of coronaviruses, in particular Sars.Dr Michelle Baker, an immunologist at CSIRO who studies viruses in bats, says some of the research on Covid-19’s origins have stepped off from what was known from the past.Baker says what is “very likely” is that the virus originated in a bat. “It’s a likely scenario but we will never know. The market was cleaned up quite quickly. We can only speculate.”“These wet markets have been identified as an issue because you do have species interacting,” she says. “It’s an opportunity to highlight the dangers of them and an opportunity to clamp down on them.”Turner adds: “We’ve found the ancestors of the virus, but having broader knowledge of the coronavirus in other species might give us a hint about the evolution of this thing and how it jumped.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e37048bc182892b0c01bc21305dd5838aee3442/0_4_2894_1736/master/2894..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0cc376eff091ed7aa624d2a25aae1977","title":"nonprofit microfinancing poverty good news loans","story":"Digital microfinance has made it possible for the prosperous to help developing world entrepreneurs with capability but no capitalWhen Typhoon Haiyan laid waste the central Philippines in 2013, Bernadeth Cabusog was one of the many people whose lives were turned upside down.

We really needed some help.”Cabusog took the advice of a neighbour in her village in rural Cebu province and approached Lamac, a local agricultural co-operative. Lamac lent her around $450 to replant her crops of lettuce, cucumbers and tomatoes, allowing her to defer half of its repayment until she was back on her feet again. “I was just so thankful that they were there to help me. I felt like God had a purpose for me after all,” she says.Seven years later, Cabusog has just repaid her fifth loan of $1,900, which went towards fertiliser and other farm equipment, to Lamac. She sells her produce through the co-operative and employs two people. Some of the money will help fund the wages of more workers she plans to hire this year.While her loan was administered by Lamac, the funds came from Lendwithcare, one of several nonprofit microfinance sites where small investors can help entrepreneurs in developing countries by crowdfunding loans.Millions of people in developing countries depend on microloans to raise the funds to grow a business or just stay afloat in hard times. And thanks to digital platforms, smartphones and free-moving global capital, growing numbers of people in the rich world are using their money to lift others out of poverty.In the decade or so they have been around, nonprofit microlenders have become big business. Kiva, the Silicon Valley-based market leader, has around $158m (£120m) invested by 639,000 lenders to more than 400,000 borrowers, according to its 2018 figures.More modestly but no less impressively, Lendwithcare has lent £27m in total to 127,000 borrowers. Its recent funding targets include a baker in Ecuador looking to replace a mixer, an embroiderer in Pakistan seeking to stock up on cloth, and a taxi rider in Rwanda hoping to purchase a new moped – the kind of small inidual ventures that can make a big difference in poor communities.Critically with Kiva and Lendwithcare investors cannot make a profit – so once funding targets are met, the sites can forward on the microloan interest-free. When (and occasionally if) the loan is paid back, lenders are free to withdraw their initial investment – but most end up returning it to a new project.Microfinance was conceived as a solution to world poverty by offering people in developing countries reliable access to loans and other financial products. But, 15 years since the idea caught hold, the question that perpetually dogs the sector is whether it actually works.But Dr Philip Mader, a research fellow at the Institute of Development Studies who has looked at the sector extensively, says that, while microfinance has created more financial products in developing countries and encouraged generosity from the rich world, there is no clear evidence that microloans do, on average, lift people out of poverty.“There are always going to be exceptional iniduals for whom a loan was a single breakthrough factor, but most people just aren’t natural entrepreneurs,” says Mader. “They’re doing this to get by, and at the end of next year, they’re going to be where they were before. Some people are going to be worse off as well. Loans are risky. That’s important to consider.”It’s a point acknowledged by Ajaz Ahmed Khan, the senior microfinance adviser at Care International, Lendwithcare’s umbrella organisation. “I’ve been involved in this sort of world for 30 years, but I’ve never been convinced that any one thing is a panacea,” he says. “Poverty is far too complicated for one simple intervention to remedy everything.”Kiva is the slickest of the microfunding websites, offering a mind-bogglingly glossy catalogue of projects sorted into different categories, countries and attributes, all illustrated with backstories and pictures. It’s clear that this sense of connection between lender and borrower is a big part of the urge to invest.But the reality is often a lot messier – something that may not initially be obvious to the lender. In fact, like Cabusog and Lendwithcare, borrowers and crowdfunding sites connect via local partner microfinance institutions (MFIs) who do the essential work of assessing creditworthiness and administering loans. To pay for that, most MFIs charge interest to borrowers, often at wildly varying rates.Still, the reality is that in many cases a lender’s inidual investment is simply going towards a partner MFI’s general portfolio, rather than directly to the loanee. Both Kiva and Lendwithcare do spell this out in the small print on their sites, Kiva in particular having been accused of not being clear enough about this in the past. It’s just not quite as straightforward as you might first think.Ever wondered why you feel so gloomy about the world - even at a time when humanity has never been this healthy and prosperous? Could it be because news is almost always grim, focusing on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame?This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theIn the end, though, does this really matter? Goldie Chow, Kiva’s director of impact, says that a sense of connection is key to the urge to lend. “Kiva is a platform to democratise impact investing,” Chow says. “When you come on the website, it looks very simple, it looks very clean and very easy. But the fact of the matter is that to manage the $150m of loans that we do every year, we have to have really onerous systems and levers and monitoring processes in place.”While the work carried out by local MFIs is generally necessary and cost-consuming, the malpractice of some operators has also cast a shadow over the industry. A recent  investigation into a microfinance programme run in Sierra Leone by Brac, the world’s largest NGO, found its staff were failing to fully explain loans to borrowers, or ensuring they could afford the payments.Separately, a report last year by Licadho, one of Cambodia’s leading human rights organisations, highlighted numerous cases of MFIs preying on borrowers. It detailed widespread reckless lending practices from local credit officers in offering loans to clients who were clearly unable to repay them, and who were then pressured to sell land to clear debt. It also revealed that at least a million Cambodian borrowers had been forced to offer their land or homes as security to MFIs.Kiva and Lendwithcare both say they take stringent measures to avoid exposure to such bad practice. Khan says that Lendwithcare’s MFI partners tend to be NGOs and co-operatives and its due diligence visits typically last seven to 10 days, including full policy and procedure reviews. “Sometimes, despite all the research and country visits, we decide not to proceed,” he says, highlighting recent visits to Tanzania, Guatemala and Egypt as examples.On its website, Kiva says it will not partner with organisations that charge unreasonable interest rates, and that it requires field partners to fully disclose their rates. “Kiva only partners with organisations and microfinance institutions that have a social mission to serve the poor, unbanked and underserved,” it says.If rogue MFIs are often perceived as the problem, would it be possible to do without them? Around 2006, Julia Kurnia had that very thought while working for a small NGO in Senegal, when she saw first-hand how expensive microloans could be for borrowers.“We had started a microfinance bank and hired a loan officer,” she recalls. “He would have to travel to the villages and collect money. That was very expensive relative to the small size of loans. But even though we tried to be as frugal as we could – I was there as a volunteer – we could never get the operating cost below about a third of the value of the loans.”Zidisha uses algorithms to assess potential borrowers for default risk and for possible fraud: “That’s the main problem we have to solve as an internet service that doesn’t have people on the ground,” says Kurnia. She admits the absence of an MFI to mediate could result in a higher risk of default, though she says Zidisha offers a guarantee to lenders of up to $1,000.The traditional microlenders think that harnessing big data will be the key to lowering the cost of borrowing in the developing world. Kiva is using blockchain technology in Sierra Leone to create an online ID database so that loan applicants outside the formal banking system can prove their credit history, and it hopes to extend the system to other countries if successful.“From the outside looking in, many people assume there’s minimal economic activity in the unbanked world,” says Kiva’s chief strategy officer, Matthew Davie. “In fact, there’s a very active financial sector. The problem is all the activity in that sector never gives you credit when you move on to formal financial services.”Still, the question remains: does microfinance really achieve the objective of lifting people out of poverty? As with the differing models of loan disbursement, the answer is complicated. “Broadly speaking, I’d agree that it’s hard to prove,” says Khan. He points out that Lendwithcare tries to supplement its loans with a range of other financial services including savings and training, so that the impact is not just focused on loans.In the end, philanthropic investing in this form is only one in a range of options open to people wanting to help alleviate poverty – and that includes just giving money to needy iniduals or to good causes.“There is no one thing that will help everyone living in poverty find a way out,” says Kiva’s Guis. “Cash transfers are right for some people, loans are right for others. Where I find the argument for Kiva’s approach strongest is that we’re tapping into money that is not earmarked for charitable giving.”As Mader points out, people need to consider what they want to achieve. “If people want to give directly to someone, there’s a website called givedirectly.org. If they want to make sure that somebody is working hard to have a chance at poverty reduction and development, but only after having repaid interest to an intermediary lender, then yes, use Kiva.“I don’t want to fault anyone for giving a loan. But I’m fascinated by how well Kiva and others have managed to sell the idea that the best way to do this is by funding inidual entrepreneurs via loans, rather than working for broader community-based change.”In the Philippines, Bernadeth Cabusog is already planning for her next loan. She hopes to use it to concrete a track on her land, and to buy a motorcycle which would considerably reduce the time she spends travelling to and from the credit office in town.“Every day I see the difference,” she says. “Before the loans, everything was so hard. Now, we have a comfortable life.”• Graham Snowdon is deputy editor of  WeeklyThis article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

To ensure compliance with the instruction to stay at home, the government will:Parks will remain open for exercise, but gatherings will be dispersed.Just one in four of the 2,250 respondents said they trust the information provided by the government ‘a great deal’, with only one in five saying they strongly agree that the official advice has been effective.Blanchflower, who was also a member of the Bank of England’s monetary policy committee during the 2008 financial crash, said the rise in unemployment looked to be at least 10 times faster than in the recession triggered by that crisis.Prof Bobby Duffy, director of the Policy Institute, said: “The government’s recent stricter actions are viewed very positively, much more so than their overall strategy, with people likely to think the approach has been confused and inconsistent.“This is likely to partly relate to the strong impression among many that the original aim was to achieve ‘herd immunity’ – although there is now greater sense that the overriding objective is to prevent the NHS from being overwhelmed,” he added.Kelly Beaver, managing director of public affairs at Ipsos Mori, said: “These results show that while there is broad support for the government measures and clearly people are getting the main message, there is still confusion about many of the details, so there is a real need for the government to continue to emphasise communicating with the public, repeatedly and clearly.”The most recent employment check in Britain from IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (Cips) for the manufacturing and service sector, which makes up the vast majority of UK growth, showed it crashed to 36.0 in March on a scale where anything above 50.0 separates growth from contraction. Down sharply from 53.0 in February, the reading was the worst since records began in 1996.Duncan Brock, group director at Cips, said: “The likelihood of a global recession is now a given, though its duration and severity has yet to reveal itself.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a2e6690b23616c07de89c6b749013673101ea447/0_258_4808_2884/master/4808.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=26678e7b83324eed4e8a9fe7ecbec685","title":"vladimir putin takes backseat in russia tackling of coronavirus","story":"Putin is working remotely and mainly focusing on cushioning blow to Russian economyVladimir Putin has taken a backseat in tackling Russia’s coronavirus outbreak, working remotely from his residence in the Moscow suburbs and delegating powers that he has spent a generation mostly accumulating in the Kremlin.Strict quarantine measures and border closures have been imposed by trusted lieutenants including the Moscow mayor, Sergei Sobyanin, and the new prime minister, Mikhail Mishustin, with officials leading parallel efforts to contain the virus and its economic fallout.Putin, meanwhile, has mainly focused on cushioning the financial blow to Russians during teleconferences or in televised speeches from an empty office, a difficult perch from which to appear to be managing a crisis that he has seemed keen to hand off.The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.Many countries are now enforcing or recommending curfews or lockdowns. Check with your local authorities for up-to-date information about the situation in your area.\u0026nbspIn the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should\u0026nbspstay at home for at least 7 days.If you live with other people,\u0026nbspthey should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.It is an unusual state of affairs in Russia, where political decisions radiate out from the centre, and where ordinary Russians are also coming to terms with scant supplies of medical masks, mounting economic troubles and the simple monotony of life under quarantine. Businesses have clamoured for more government aid, including a release of Russia’s financial reserves.“Stop waiting for some mythical Putin to come and save you,” said Yevgenia Albats, the editor of the independent New Times magazine, when asked about aid on the popular Echo of Moscow radio station this week. “Only you can do it,” she said.Putin has avoided public gatherings since late March, days after donning a yellow safety suit to visit Moscow’s main hospital for coronavirus patients. While there, he shook hands and spoke with the head doctor later diagnosed with the disease. The Kremlin has said that Putin is not sick and is working remotely, but the encounter raised questions of whether Russia’s president was also self-isolating, following other leaders such as Angela Merkel and Justin Trudeau.On Wednesday, Putin gave a publicly televised speech calling for bonuses for nurses and doctors caring for Covid-19 patients, and calling the next two to three weeks “decisive” in Russia’s battle with the disease.Calling upon Russians to unite, Putin compared the country’s fight with coronavirus to battles with enemies from the 10th and 11th centuries, an eccentric choice that left many Russians searching the Internet.“Dear friends!” he said. “Everything passes, and this too will pass. Our country has repeatedly passed through serious tests: the Pechenegs tormented it, and the Cumans too. Russia defeated all of them. We will also defeat this coronavirus infection. Together we will overcome everything.”The appeal to unity came at an important moment, as Putin’s previous addresses had fallen flat. After he introduced a “non-working week” in late March, Russians flocked to barbecues in local parks, leading Moscow’s mayor to introduce a tough self-isolation regime, emphasising it was not a holiday.Other Kremlin reports of Putin’s activities have been even stranger. After telling the press that Putin was working remotely and not shaking hands, the Kremlin released a video on Monday showing the president receiving two ministers at the Kremlin and kicking off the exchange with a hearty handshake. The three men did not mention the coronavirus once during the encounter, fuelling rumours it had been filmed earlier and then released this week. Oleg Kashin, a prominent Russian journalist, said it appeared to be “preserves”, the Russian term for pre-packaged content the Kremlin sometimes releases days or weeks after an event.Putin’s televised appearance on Wednesday – where he made a direct call on regional heads to develop new measures to help Russians – may indicate he plans to take a more hands-on approach to the crisis.Analysts have noted that Putin’s approach mirrored some other countries, where local officials are tasked with enforcing tough regulations and the central government delivers economic stimulus. The approach would limit Putin’s exposure to unpopular decisions and preserve his public support.There was another possibility, wrote Tatiana Stanovaya, a Russian political analyst and head of the R.Politik analysis firm: Putin simply does not see tackling the virus as his job. Unfortunately, she added, the state machinery “has forgotten how to act independently”.“The president expects efficiency from his subordinates, but they have gotten used to merely implementing decisions made by others, and have now forgotten how to generate their own,” she wrote in a piece published by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2661c89e7aa5ec016157d330a1628a3f2184abea/0_374_6048_3627/master/6048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5dd42984b448f84f5858cddca974999f","title":"wuhan ends coronavirus lockdown in pictures","story":"After 76 days sealed off from the world, the central Chinese city of Wuhan, where the coronavirus pandemic began, has opened its doors again.

But the UK and the US have so far seemed to be about two weeks behind Italy in the progress of the disease, so their worst days may well be yet to come. Similarly, although the Chinese city of Wuhan is gradually reopening after two months of lockdown, it is by no means clear when or how other countries will begin to return to normal. In the meantime, scientists are working on several fronts to develop treatments and possibly vaccines some of those trials may start to show results in the next month or so, but a viable vaccine could still be 18 months away.Data caveatsThe case counts come from data compiled by Johns Hopkins University, one of the most reliable sources.

Occasionally there are differences in the case counts between the Johns Hopkins website dashboard and the open source data repository used here.

All around us were jagged, brilliant white peaks, piercing blue glaciers and water flecked with such a constellation of ice fragments that you could imagine a sky-sized mirror had shattered on to the surface of the ocean.The pilot cut the outboard engine to reduce noise while the scientist, Tim Lewis, dropped the hydrophone – essentially a waterproof microphone on a long cable – into the ocean. We sat quietly as the boat bobbed and drifted to within a few metres of an iceberg the size of a church. Dozens of gentoo penguins swished in and out of the water. Further off, we could hear the intermittent rumbles of avalanches as mountain snow warmed and collapsed in the pale southern summer sun. But it was the underwater soundscape that we had come to hear. After playing out 20 metres of cable, Lewis took off his woolly hat, put on the headphones, closed his eyes and let his ears take him down to the depths. We watched his face for clues as to what he was hearing. First a frown. (Is the equipment working properly?) Then a look of bemusement. Finally a wry smile. “I have never heard anything like it. Not what I expected at all,” he said. “It sounds like dripping, like the inside of a gorge.”The earphones were passed from person to person. Everyone listened with a similar expression of concentration and offered their own interpretation of these strange sounds. “Drips in a drain,” said one of the activists. “Forest waterfall,” said the coxswain. “Rainfall on city streets,” said the camera operator.My turn came, and I, too, was transported. Not, it seemed, below the ocean, but into a vast cavern, where it sounded as if water was cascading from a high ceiling, each drip echoing through the emptiness.  Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen https:uploads.guim20200408melting-glacier--trimmed.mp3 “That’s the sound of the iceberg melting,” Lewis informed us. When snow falls, he explained, pockets of air get trapped and then compressed inside glaciers over years, centuries, even millennia. “What you can hear are the pops as they are released,” he said. It was the opposite of what we imagined. Rather than water dripping down through air, we were listening to air escaping up through water. We were so close to the ice that this ancient fizz was surprisingly loud. Though we humans never hear it above the surface, this is the sound the Antarctic makes every summer. And as the planet heats, the sound is getting louder.It was mid-January, the peak of the Antarctic summer, and I had joined a broader 10-month, pole-to-pole expedition by scientists and campaigners on two Greenpeace ships, the Arctic Sunrise and the Esperanza. On this final leg around the Antarctic Peninsula and the South Shetland Islands, nine researchers from British, French and US universities were measuring how human activity is disturbing the region’s natural equilibrium.With the help of 59 crew members – a mix of sailors, engineers and activists – the scientists conducted acoustic monitoring, environmental DNA sampling, testing for plastic microfibres, phytoplankton analysis, as well as surveys of penguin and whale populations. Just as the first explorers once charted coastlines voyage by voyage, the aim was to map Antarctic ecosystems. Many of the waters and islands we were visiting had not been surveyed for decades, if ever. I caught up with the Sunrise at King George’s Island, about 600 miles south of Cape Horn, the southern tip of South America. Home to an airfield, two churches, the research bases of 10 countries and about 500 semi-permanent residents, this international community has often been cast as the last hope of humanity in dystopian novels and films because of its remoteness, collaborative spirit and focus on science. (Today, coincidentally, Antarctica is the only continent that does not have a single case of coronavirus).But it is all too vulnerable to the other great global crisis – climate change. Veterans of Antarctic exploration had warned me that this location would give me my first taste of how rapidly the region is warming. On the slopes around the bay, there was more bare rock than snow, while the stony beach was so free of ice that it could almost have been Brighton, were it not for the penguins. This was to be expected. Temperatures on the peninsula – the finger of land that points up from Antarctica towards South America – have risen by about 3C in the past 70 years, one of the fastest increases in the world. What was more surprising was the number of other vessels bobbing in the bay.“People think Antarctica is isolated. That is a myth,” Marcelo Leppe, the director of Chile’s National Antarctic Institute, had told me when I visited him the previous day in Punta Arenas, the capital of Chile’s southernmost region. “The changes are so great it is hard to put them in words,” he said. Since Leppe started studying the region in 2002, he had seen more and more visitors, and less and less snow. “I have seen glaciers retreat by 100 metres, and parts of the land become so green that it almost looks like a golf course,” he said. In December, monitoring equipment at the Chilean research base on King George Island detected something that worried Leppe even more: black carbon in the air, which came from the Australian bushfires more than 6,200 miles away. Even in tiny quantities, this soot darkens the white landscape, reducing its capacity to reflect sunlight and making it melt faster. “At least future geologists will find this black layer helpful to identify the year 2020 in their ice cores,” he joked darkly.There will be other clues for the geologists of the future. On 24 December 2019, the Antarctic probably suffered its worst one-day ice melt since records began, according to analysis by the University of Liège. In February, a mainland record of 18.3C was registered at the Argentinian base on the tip of the peninsula. Days later, a continental high of 20.75C was measured at a monitoring station on Seymour Island. On that day, on that island, the Antarctic was hotter than Cape Town.For the first two days, we sailed south in serene conditions, gazing in wonder at the seascape and wildlife. You can glimpse more species in the average London garden than on this immense continent, which covers an area the size of the US and Mexico combined. But what its residents lack in variety, they make up for in numbers.That was clear from our first short excursion at Trinity Island, which lies 150 miles southwest of King George Island. There we came across a vast number of chattering penguins, grunting seals and squawking cormorants – along with a startling number of tourists. There, and at our next stop in Paradise Harbour, we saw six giant cruise liners in the space of four days, disgorging groups of whale watchers on dinghies, adventure holidaymakers on kayaks, and red-jacketed trekkers wandering through guano-stained slopes. This southern hemisphere summer – which was the 200th anniversary of the first sighting of the Antarctic – a record 80,000 tourists were expected in the continent, an almost threefold increase from 2015. Before the coronavirus pandemic, shipbuilders had been seeing strong demand for polar- and ice-class cruise liners. Luxury cruise operators have tried to outdo one another with heated deck “igloos”, underwater lounges and extendable viewing platforms. Tourists pay as much as $10,000 (£8,500) or even $20,000 to experience what brochures describe as “the Earth’s last great wilderness frontier”. For our hyper-dominant species, part of the attraction of Antarctica is the chance to feel small in the presence of the sublime, to return to a time when nature seemed like an awe-inspiring and nurturing mother rather than the frail and overburdened grandparent it increasingly resembles today. To ensure that tourists feel like they are journeying through a nearly deserted wilderness, tour operators coordinate schedules and instruct captains to use radar to avoid visual sightings of other vessels. (As our polar guide, Tom Foreman, noted, the impression of solitude would be “somewhat ruined if you see 500 people floating past on another big lump of steel”.) If there is something absurd about tour companies expending so much energy on crafting the illusion of solitude, it does at least help avoid overcrowding. Biosecurity is no small matter in the Antarctic. Boots need to be sterilised before setting foot on land to avoid spreading seeds, fungi or viruses. Everyone must keep their distance from wildlife – five metres from a penguin, 10 metres from a seal, 50 metres from a whale, unless they come to you. And no littering. Over the past five years, Astrid Zafiro has watched the traffic to Antarctica grow. As chief of Argentina’s Admiral Brown base in Paradise Harbour, about 250 miles south-west of King George Island, she considers the rise in tourism as visible as the changes wrought by a warming climate. After guiding us through a penguin colony and up a slope behind the small research facility, Zafiro pointed across the bay at a newly emerged nunatak – a bare mountain peak sticking out above the ice. Near the nunatak, a massive cruise liner was unloading Chinese tourists in rubber boats. In the distance, we heard a crash as another slab of fractured glacier crashed into the water. “It is all happening right in front of us – the bay full of tourists, the ice breaking,” Zafiro said wistfully. Zafiro described a feedback loop that does not appear in climate models: the more the Antarctic is threatened by the climate crisis, the more tourists want to visit before it melts away. That means more cruise (and air) miles to the end of the Earth, more carbon dioxide and more global heating. Last-chance-to-see tourism becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. On board the Sunrise, a young German member of the ship’s crew, Carola Rackete, told me about “solastalgia”, the term coined by the philosopher Glenn Albrecht to describe the pre-emptive sense of loss that people feel when witnessing natural beauty in this era of environmental destruction. “You enjoy it knowing that next time it will be changed beyond recognition. There is always the anticipation of loss, which makes me feels sad,” Rackete said. Solastalgia is hard to escape in the Antarctic.We passed three days in Paradise Harbour, going out daily in the boats to gather samples and look and listen for whales, seals and penguins. On our final night, I was reluctant to sleep, knowing this was the last chance to take it all in. As the sun’s pale afterglow faded behind the mountains, the dusky bay was as smooth as polished chrome. Time itself seemed to have frozen and I began to understand why so many of the early Antarctic explorers felt close to God here. After a few moments, my transcendental musings were interrupted by the sound of KC and the Sunshine Band echoing out from a huge cruise liner anchored 100 or so metres away. “That’s the way, uh-huh uh-huh, I like it, uh-huh, uh-huh” continued to ring in my ears as I made my way to the cabin.There are still some Antarctic islands that have rarely, if ever, been visited by humans. They are deemed too small, too plain, too remote or too storm-battered. Our destination the following day, Low, seemed to tick all of these boxes. This south-westernmost island in the South Shetlands, nine miles long by five miles wide, takes the full brunt of the winds and waves that spin around the Shrieking Sixties, the stretch of latitude between 60 and 70 degrees south, which is notorious for howling gales.

Penguin guano is the only excrement that can be seen from space. Over generations, the projectile poo from tens of thousands of krill-eating birds dyes rock a delicate pink. This makes colony spotting easy, but for more precise calculations, the team of four scientists use drones and artificial intelligence to count nests. Then, armed with handheld clickers, they head out to sample areas to double-check their findings. Each cluster is counted three times in a row to ensure wandering penguins do not evade the census. One member of the team, Noah Strycker, described the process to me as “a Zen-like activity”.Chinstraps have a reputation for being one of the noisiest and most aggressive of the penguin species. During courtship, the birds chat up potential mates with loud displays. After separating to gather food, they reunite with ecstatic greetings. If nests are threatened by predators, parents shriek protectively. Scientists have discovered that birds can filter out the background cacophony and focus in on the call of their own family members (the so-called “cocktail party effect”). But this skill becomes less essential as the chinstrap population diminishes, and the boisterous hubbub of the colony grows quieter. As we wandered from nest from nest to nest, totting up chicks, the loudest noise was from pubescent chicks nagging their parents for more regurgitated krill, the tiny shrimplike creature that constitutes the chinstrap’s only meal. Scientists believe this dependence on a single food source is one reason why chinstraps populations are plummeting. Krill graze on organisms that grow under the sea ice, so when the ice melts, the krill disappear in turn. By contrast, another species of penguin, the gentoo, is thriving, because it is far less fussy about its diet. The population final count is not yet complete, but it is already clear that the chinstraps on Low are just as vulnerable as elsewhere. And it is not only the penguins that are in danger. “Such a big decline over a short time suggests something is broken in the Southern Ocean ecosystem,” said Strycker.It was a sobering thought to sleep on Low amid that shifting climate. Our group may well have been the first in history to camp on the island. The polar guides had to tie the tents to boulders because there was no soil to bang pegs into. The tents withstood a cold night of wind and rain, but there was nothing anyone could do about the smell and the chatter. In the damp darkness, the penguins hunkered down, although they never fell completely silent. Thirty years ago, the noise would have been louder. The quietening of Low was far less soothing than it sounded.Over the next two days, the weather took a turn for the worse. With a storm brewing out at sea, we sheltered in Discovery Bay, an indent on the northern coast of Greenwich Island, waiting for a break in the clouds that refused to come. In the sea, the only signs of life were strings of salps – tiny tubes of transparent jelly with pink dots for bellies. As waters warm, these little zooplankton are thriving at the expense of krill, which is bad news for the ocean ecosystem and the climate because they are a lot less nutritious for predators, and they do not appear to play such a major role in helping the ocean absorb carbon dioxide. (Krill are better at this because they graze more on phytoplankton – tiny, plantlike organisms that absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen.) The change is another consequence of the ominous sound we had heard on the hydrophone several days earlier. As the Antarctic melt gets louder, there will be fewer chinstraps and krill, more gentoos and salps, less oxygen, more acid, and, of course, less land ice and more sea water.An increasing number of scientists believe the melting of West Antarctica is so far beyond natural fluctuations that it has become irreversible. In February, a first examination of the underside of the vast Thwaites glacier – which covers an area similar to that of the UK – showed extensive erosion by warm water. This and the nearby Pine Island glacier are now losing ice five times faster than in the 90s. A collapse of the west Antarctic ice sheet is now a serious concern. It might be tempting to think humanity can do nothing right, but the short history of human interaction with the Antarctic suggests we can at least learn from our mistakes and reverse some of the damage we have caused.The stratosphere high above our heads is proof of that. In the 1980s, the world was horrified to discover that certain chemicals had thinned the ozone layer and opened up a vast hole above the Antarctic that was raising cancer risks and disrupting weather systems and ocean currents. Since then, however, international efforts to reduce CFCs and other ozone-depleting chemicals have eased that threat. This year, scientists were relieved to find that disruption of southern wind systems has paused and may even be returning towards its natural state. There is a risk that a closed ozone hole will trap more heat, but the initial damage is on its way to being repaired. This is also true of wildlife in the region. For 4.5bn years, not a single whisper was carried on the winds or the waves of this region. It was only 200 years ago, years after the invention of the steam engine and electric lighting, that humans first caught sight of Antarctica. The explorers who first mapped the continent were lauded as heroes, but carnage often followed in their wake. James Clark Ross – the British naval officer who discovered the sea now named after him – knew exactly what would happen to the seals and penguins he saw on his voyage. “Hitherto beyond the reach of their persecutors, they have enjoyed a life of tranquillity and security, but will now, no doubt, be made to contribute to the wealth of our country,” he wrote in his diary in 1841.Like seals and penguins before them, whales appeared to be doomed. But unfashionable regulations and often unpopular campaigning have made a difference. Steady increases since the moratorium on commercial whaling that came into effect in 1985 have taken southern hemisphere humpbacks close to their pre-exploitation population of about 80,000, according to the International Whaling Commission. The scientists on the Greenpeace ships are helping to track whale populations by collecting vast amounts of acoustic data, such as the communal chatter of a pod of orcas and the thunderous clicks of the sperm whale, the loudest natural sound made by any creature on Earth. Thrillingly, blue whales are also making a comeback. Last month, a British Antarctic Survey mission to South Georgia recorded 55 in just three weeks. For campaigners, the recovery of whales is a much-needed reminder that international cooperation can be effective, protections can work, and our species is capable of undoing the damage we inflicted on the natural world. But nobody is complacent. The actor Gustaf Skarsgård, who had joined the trip in order to promote conservation to his social media followers, summed it up with a personal comparison. “It’s like Antarctica is in recovery. I know a thing or two about that,” he said. “A low point has passed but the condition is still fragile. It needs more time or it could slip back again.” After the storm finally abated, the Sunrise sailed back to King George Island, from where I would have to take a plane home. The closer we came to the airport, the more cruise ships and scientific vessels we saw. In the 10 days since we had left, summer had taken a visible toll. Hillsides that had been covered in snow were now bare, black rock. The naked Antarctic will never be a tourist draw, but it is a powerful reminder that underneath the Earth’s fragile outer layer of water, ice, earth and vegetation, this is just another rock hurtling through space.Of all the moments during the trip, one stands out – an encounter in Paradise Harbour that stirred two rare feelings in the age of the Anthropocene: pure unmitigated joy and a nascent sense of hope.I heard the humpback before I saw it. A ripple, a sigh, then a soft splash behind my back. I turned in time to see the dorsal fin arc languorously out and back into the water just like a fairytale sketch of a sea serpent. The whale was about 30 metres away, and coming towards us. We couldn’t move – the coxswain had cut the boat’s engine a few minutes earlier in preparation for a hydrophone recording. All we could do was look on, speechless, as the whale drew nearer, 15 metres now, snorting water once again from its blowhole, then slipping just far enough below the surface to be out of sight. It was thrilling. Did the whale realise there was an obstacle in its path? Our small boat would surely be upturned in a collision with a creature that size. The whale had something else in mind. After passing just below the surface a few metres from the front of our craft, it turned parallel and so close we could almost reach out and touch it. Then the whale tilted its giant head out of the water and yawned cavernously, revealing a bed-sized tongue and the bristled carpet of its baleen plates. Seconds later, with a flick of its knobbled pectoral fin, it was under the water again. Mouths agape, beaming rapturously, the five of us looked at each other to confirm we had not imagined what we had seen. I cannot remember sharing such joy. The experience felt almost holy. But it wasn’t over. We turned around, and there was the whale again, completing a full circle of the boat, before silently swimming back the way it had come.We returned to the ship on a high. We were too excited to capture the encounter with any great skill. Nobody had pushed the record switch on the hydrophone. The clip I filmed on my phone was partly obscured by other bodies. Never mind. The moment would linger long in the memory. By listening, we had seen so much.Jonathan Watts’s time on board the Arctic Sunrise was funded by Greenpeace"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4224882.1586424235!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"easter weekend weather temperatures to reach 19 degrees on friday","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTemperatures are expected to rise to 18 degrees on Thursday and 19 degrees on Friday, according to Met Éireann.

People over 70 were asked to stay inside “cocoon” for the period in order to curb the spread of coronavirus, also known as Covid-19.” New powersOn Tuesday, gardaí have been given new powers to enforce rules designed to keep as many people at home as possible.Fears of rising public complacency about the virus were echoed by gardaí who are monitoring more than 1,000 locations in the State including forest walks and beaches in the run-up to the Easter holidays to ensure compliance.Garda Deputy Commissioner John Twomey said gardaí had noticed that people were “beginning to get tired” of the social-distancing regulations.The regulations are based on the guidelines issued by the Government two weeks ago. Anyone exercising more than 2km from their home or with people from outside their household will be in breach. Anyone travelling beyond 2km for non-essential reasons will also be in breach.An offence will only be committed if a person refuses a direction from a garda to comply with the regulations. It is not the breaching of the regulations that is illegal, it is the disobeying of the Garda’s instructions once you are caught.The State’s health emergency team on Wednesday said a further 25 people had died from the virus – the second-highest number of deaths in the daily announcement. The deaths of 15 men and 10 women, whose median age was 80, brought the death toll to 235.There were 365 new cases of the disease confirmed on Wednesday, bringing total cases past the 6,000 mark for the first time, to 6,074 known cases in the Republic.Medics have raised concerns about a possible surge in patients later this month if members of the public did not adhere to social-distancing requirements over the Easter weekend.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Phone and internet providers should follow lead of energy suppliers, says charityGarda\u0026iacute monitoring more than 1,000 locations across State over holiday weekendLobbying intensifies for appointment as government-formation negotiations continueNI politicians complain families \u0026lsquopressured\u0026rsquo to agree to no resuscitation for loved onesGarda\u0026iacute investigating creators of \u0026lsquoKilkee Residents\u0026rsquo Health Defence\u0026rsquo postersDepartment of Public Expendtiure says \u0026lsquocrucial we show solidarity as unified public service\u0026rsquoPeople have been asked to stay inside except for necessary journeys within 2km of homeNumbers of vehicles on all major roads rising as Easter approaches, despite Covid-19 banRefugee groups continue to raise concerns around healthworkers living in direct provisionDublin man saw monthly charge increase by 400 per cent between February and March\u0026lsquoDozens more reportedly in isolation\u0026rsquo as eight members of ICHA sent to cover next few daysFurther 200 beds secured to protect residents in direct provision centresProdigious virus numbers in Covid-19 linked to contagion, say expertsStudy assessed likely impact of cloud brightening\u0026rsquo to counteract climate changeMichael D Higgins: She was \u0026lsquoan inspirational figure and a powerful voice\u0026rsquoWeekend will see cloud and longer spells of rain with some bright intervalsIrish College of General Practitioners said vulnerable family members could be at riskGovernment considers options as Covid-19 restrictions unlikely to be lifted by June 3rdWhat will happen where trust in science is not a central part of wider culture?\u0026lsquoOngoing availability of masks cannot be guaranteed,\u0026rsquo workers told in memoStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4225082.1586437796!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"traffic counters show rise in numbers of cars returning to roads","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAs health authorities warn against people in the east of the country heading to holiday homes for the Easter weekend, traffic on the Republic’s main roads is already showing a significant increases in volumes.

Traffic counters on Dublin’s M50 are showing a rise of about 14 per cent this week alone.Health Minister Simon Harris has raised concerns about a possible surge in patients later this month if people from the east of the country where there are most confirmed cases of coronavirus decide to travel to the holiday homes elsewhere on the island for the Easter Weekend. Infectious disease expert Dr Paddy Mallon has compared the coming weekend to the Cheltenham Festival of racing in the UK which it thought to have significantly contributed to the spread of the virus.In bid to combat the exodus of people from the east, roads manager Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) has worked with the Garda to set up temporary lay-bys on all of the major roads out of Dublin. The Garda said more than 1,000 check points have already been set up and on Wednesday night traffic tailbacks from a checkpoint on the N11 at Kilmacanogue in Co Wicklow stretched back several kilometres to the M50.M50Detailed information shows that last week car traffic on the M50 numbered about 7,000 between 7.00am and 10.00 am but on Wednesday 8th, car traffic jumped to about 8,000 cars in the same period, a rise of about 14 percent.On the N11 route between Dublin and Wexford, near where the Garda stages a check point on Wednesday night at Kilmacanogue, vehicle numbers were up by almost 1,000, or nearly 5 percent on Wednesday, compared to one week earlier.Similar patterns emerged on the N81 between the M50 and Tallaght with volumes up by just over 5 percent on Wednesday compared to a week earlier.On the N7between the M50 and Newlands Cross the daily volume of traffic was up 15 percent over the same period.On the N4 near Liffey Valley traffic was up 4.2 per cent from 36,774 vehicles to 38,345 on the N3 at Blanchardstown the volumes were up 5.9 per cent on the M50 near Finglas, the busiest section of the motorway traffic volumes were up 4.46 percent to 5,12 vehicles and on the M1 just south of the airport volumes have rise by a smaller amount, just 2 per cent.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4224984.1586428448!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"when i look at the viral loads we find in elderly people it is mind boggling","story":"Virtual reality images taken from a coronavirus patient in a Washington DC hospital shows how the virus can invade the lungs and kill. Video: The New York Times\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tProf Marc Van Ranst said the pandemic was exposing weaknesses in national healthcare systems.The Covid-19 virus is “incredibly aggressive and spectacularly contagious”, according to leading coronavirus scientists. Virus numbers are three times what might be found with other respiratory viruses such as flu, including in older patients, who are more contagious than expected.“These are the highest viral loads for any virus I know,” said Prof Marc Van Ranst at the Rega Institute for Medical Research in Leuven, Belgium. He said he was astonished at the number of the germs he saw from patient throat samples in his lab. Especially surprising, he said, was that elderly people harbour prodigious quantities of virus.When older people become infected with viruses like flu, they do not produce many virus particles, because their mucosal surfaces are older and drier, it was believed. “When I look at the viral loads that we find in elderly people, it is mind boggling,” he said. “That has been for me the big surprise with this virus.” This will influence how contagious elderly people can be and perhaps is reflected in the high number of Covid-19 clusters in nursing homes, Prof Van Ranst added. AbundantThe virus is abundant in the throat of younger patients too, according to viral counts reported in the science journal Nature this week. Nine young to middle-aged office workers near Munich, Germany, who showed mild flu-like symptoms, had their nose and throat swabbed daily and spit samples collected for viral counts. “We detected Sars-CoV-2 in enormous amounts in the upper respiratory tract,” said Prof Clemens Wendtner, who led the research in Germany – 1,000 times more than for Sars. “This was shocking news.” He is head of infectious diseases at a teaching hospital of Ludwig-Maximilians University in Munich.All nine patients showed a high rate of viral replication and shedding in their throat during their first week of infection. The virus does not need to travel to the lungs to replicate, and is abundant in the throat, making it easy to pass on. “It can be spread easily by sneezing or coughing,” said Prof Wendtner. His hospital now has 190 Covid-19 patients and “there is no difference between the young and elderly” in viral load. There are three times more Covid-19 viruses on patient swabs compared to viruses such as influenza or RSV. Covid-19, said Prof Wendtner, “can be transmitted by elderly people in care home”. He advises “face and mouth protection for the entire population, regardless of age”, which is being considered in Germany.“The viral loads that people encounter when someone coughs in their general direction,” are so high, said Prof Van Ranst, that it makes transmission likely to happen. “Compared to other respiratory viruses, this is remarkable,” he added. It also meant it was easier for those with even mild symptoms to contaminate surfaces. The Nature paper confirms that “for the milder form of the disease, it doesn’t go as far as the lungs, but stays in the throat”, said immunologist Prof Luke O’Neill of Trinity College Dublin. “It means it is very transmissible just by talking. You don’t need to cough,” he said. Also, people without symptoms, “are very infectious,” he added. “Sars never infected the throat. Went straight to the lungs. So a that’s big difference,” he explained. Cell culture“For Sars-1,” said Prof Wendtner, “it was very difficult to put these viruses into cell culture. It is quite easy for Sars-CoV-2, due to the fact that we had high viral loads.” Some patients in Munich did not have fevers, yet some were super-spreaders. “It is not easy to identify Covid-19 patients,” he warned.Asked about the Nature study, TCD virologist Dr Kim Roberts noted infectious virus was readily recovered from the nine patients during the first week of symptoms, but not after day 8, though high amounts of viral RNA could be detected. “This could support the suggestion that people, at least with mild symptoms, are less infectious after the first week of symptoms.” Most of the patients developed antibodies against the virus around day 7 of symptoms, she added.Prof Van Ranst said the pandemic was exposing weaknesses in national healthcare systems. “In Belgium it is the elderly care homes. The quality is not good enough in terms of withstanding a medical crisis.” “In the Netherlands and the UK, it is the number of intensive care beds which is really problematic. In the US, it is the lack of universal healthcare that is the biggest problem,” he said. Ireland had a similar number of ICUs per person as the UK, and nursing homes here had been badly impacted by Covid-19 .

This includes a free trade agreement with annexes, as well as agreements on aviation safety and air transport, and a civil nuclear agreement.“We are sharing ours in confidence as a negotiating document, as part of the ongoing negotiating process,” a government spokesman said.“Teams will now analyse each other’s texts and we expect further conversations between the teams next week.“We will keep under review which documents it is appropriate to publish during the course of negotiations and whether it is useful to make them availablle more widely.”Though Britain has left the EU it is is currently in a transition period, continuing to adhere to prior norms pending the agreement of a deal on the future relationship. If none can be agreed, it will automatically begin trading on World Trade Organisation terms from January 1st, 2021, with potentially severe effects on the Irish economy.The government of prime minister Boris Johnson has until July to request an extension to the transition period, but has insisted it will not do so even as the Coronavirus pandemic delayed talks this week.Both sides said they were examining options such as using video conferencing in place of face-to face talks.“The negotiations can still proceed given all of the logistical arrangements that have been put in place,” British foreign secretary Dominic Raab said on Tuesday.“We’re confident that we can get this done and, actually, I don’t think delaying Brexit negotiations would give anyone the certainty on either side of the Channel that they need.”Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4224393.1586373909!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"this time the future of the euro really is at stake","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDutch prime minister   attends a debate in the House of Representatives on the developments surrounding the Covid-19 pandemic   in The Hague, the Netherlands. Photograph: Bart MaatEPAIt took 16 hours of video conferencing for the finance ministers of the euro zone to find out that once again, they could not agree.As the ministers and their aides emerged blearily out into the sunlight of Wednesday morning in their respective capitals, the mood was pitch black. “I think I would summarise it by saying positions haven’t changed, but the mood has changed, and the mood has gotten worse,” an official said.One dream of what the future of Europe might look like was already over: the idea that it could be shaped by the so-called New Hanseatic League.Called the Hansa for short, this collection of the Netherlands, Ireland, and Baltic and Scandinavian states was brought together by the departure of Britain from the European Union. As a group, it hoped to replace the UK’s clout on economic matters and defend a trade-friendly, pro-business viewpoint.Ireland left it by joining the call of nine states including, Italy, Spain and France, for joint debt issuance in the form of eurobonds or coronabonds.The northern gang was never a perfect fit for Ireland anyway. But the attitude of the Netherlands in the past few days of negotiations has made the departure final.DisasterIreland, in tune with southern states, has been appalled by The Hague’s staunch blocking of proposals to dig European economies out of disaster and debt spiral caused by the pandemic.In the Netherlands, jointly-backed debt is commonly likened to taking over your neighbour’s mortgage, an unfair characterisation that draws on an old misapprehension that the euro zone bailouts were gifts from Dutch and German taxpayers, rather than loans repaid with interest. Naturally, the Irish view is more nuanced.But it’s not just joint debt. Dutch finance minister Wopke Hoekstra was also the last man blocking a proposal to allow states to borrow from the bailout fund without the condition that they must balance the books.Germany was once the champion of this view that indebted countries can’t be given easy money because they won’t learn their lesson. But Berlin sees the pandemic as different to crises of the past, and objects to joint debt more on the grounds that rushing into such a commitment, like a Las Vegas marriage, might end badly.It was the vote of a party with 19 seats in the Dutch parliament, the europhile D66 party, that confirmed to international observers that a different reality held within the borders of the lowland state. By joining much of the opposition to back Mark Rutte’s government’s rejection of joint debt, the party sank international hopes the prime minister might come under domestic pressure to cave.Some officials believe the Dutch will come in time to see that the stakes are high for them too. But not until it has become clear that the euro itself is under threat, great economic damage has been wreaked, and seeds of bitterness between EU countries have been sown deep.The great fear is that by then it will be too late to turn back a tide of disgust in Italy towards the entire EU project.The Italian economy has hardly grown since it joined the euro in 1999. You can take your pick of domestic problems to blame: onerous laws that people ignore, a musical-chairs succession of weak governments, an aging population.But the fact is that the country has not seen the benefits of the euro. It has people old enough to vote who have known only economic stagnation.

However, delays in treatment puts lives at risk and will result in more pressure on the NHS, not less.It comes after NHS England\u0027s national medical director, Stephen Powis, encouraged people to go to A\u0026ampE just as you always have done if they have symptoms of a stroke or a heart attack.Speaking at the daily Downing Street press conference on Wednesday, he said: They are there for you and, although we are focusing on coronavirus, it\u0027s important we continue to focus on other emergency conditions.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus next 100 days future uk economy health","story":"On new year\u0027s eve last year the first case of Covid-19 was reported to the WHO. As of today, Thursday 9 April 2020, we are one hundred days in to living with the virus.We asked our expert journalists to look ahead and forecast what the next 100 days will hold. What is the outlook for their sector? Which key questions must be answered? And what will their world look like 100 days from now, on Saturday 18 July? The areas covered are as follows: The UK, the world, science, politics, the NHS, lockdown and social distancing, the economy, small and medium businesses, personal finance, property, sport, the arts, environment, education, mental health, physical health, travel and Brexit.These are their responses.If the first 100 days of this pandemic have been characterised by collective shock, denial and now frustration, we should expect the next three months to be marked by our adaptability. It’s what pychologists call the Kübler-Ross model, or the “five stages of grief”, and is a useful way of thinking about what the coronavirus holds for us over the weeks and months ahead. The model is usually shown as a bowl-shaped curve with the “shock” on the high left, a steep descent into depression and then a slow but steady rise to a new normal.The upward slope of the curve may have been what The Queen had in mind when she told the nation on Sunday: While we have faced challenges before, this one is different. We join with all nations across the globe in a common endeavour, using the great advances of science and our instinctive compassion to heal. We will succeed – and that success will belong to every one of us”.The shock of the past 100 days has been brutal, but the green shoots of recovery are becoming evident. The way we came together to demand a lockdown in order to protect the most vulnerable among us is testament not just to our humanity but our good sense. Darwinian forces may have shaped us but we see ourselves as a society not a herd. You see it too in the millions of small chores and errands people all over the country are running for those less able than themselves.Scientists from all disciplines have also grown in stature and confidence. They are displacing ideology with evidence and knee jerk reaction with reasoned decision making. They are also embracing cross-border cooperation and transparency like never before. One of the first papers providing hard evidence that infection with the coronavirus creates protective antibodies in our blood was published yesterday by a team of Chinese scientists and shared instantly around the world. In the same vein, the once secretive scientific committees advising ministers in Britain have taken to publishing, not just the abbreviated minutes of their meetings, but the substance too in order that others can constantly test and critique their decision making.Even the public are becoming involved. Perhaps the best view we have of the spread of the coronavirus in Britain is provided by data from the Covid Symptom Tracker app, used by over two million ordinary Brits. The latest figures estimate that 1.4 million people in the UK aged 20-69 have symptomatic Covid-19, a fall from 1.9 million on the 1 April.While scientists are working round the clock on treatments and vaccines, thousands of other experts are collaborating on the economics and logistics of getting our factories, schools and high streets up and running again.Don’t expect lockdown to end within the next 100 days but we will almost certainly know the shape of it by then.Life is unlikely to fully return to normal until a vaccine or treatment is found but with good planning and direction from the top, it should be possible for large parts of society to be at least partially freed-up without the virus spiking dangerously again and overwhelming the NHS..If there is a risk in front of us, and there surely is, it comes less from the virus itself but the profound economic and political shock which the world will experience in its wake. We know from history that such shocks like this can spark conflict and already China and the US are squaring up to each other, stoking palpable fear and tensions.Covid-19 has exposed the world’s frailties and its strengths: we humans have a long established habit of messing up before dusting ourselves down and starting over again. Be in no doubt, we will get back on our feet. The only real variable is how many people will die unnecessarily in the process.There are really only three kinds of country in the world today: those slowly waking from the coronavirus nightmare those in the middle of it and those who are about to be hit.All face the same brutal dilemma: how to balance human lives and public health with economic sustainability.Over the next few weeks each will see their latent weaknesses, and perhaps strengths, exposed in unforgiving light. And the outcomes will vary dramatically according to national wealth.China, South Korea, and Japan, the advanced economies which suffered the first wave of the coronavirus crisis, will try to ease their city lockdowns without allowing a resurgence of the virus.But early signs are that it will be a tricky and long-drawn out process. Tellingly China has still not rescheduled the annual meeting of the National People\u0027s Congress, which was postponed in March, suggesting Beijing is not quite confident that progress is irreversible.Meanwhile, developed countries in Europe and North America where the epidemic has yet to peak will remain focussed on saving lives. Lockdowns may be extended into the early summer, and tensions over the economic, social, and political consequences will rise.The mounting death rate in the United States in particular poses an immense challenge to president Donald Trump in the run-up to November\u0027s presidential election, and could challenge orthodoxies around healthcare.Everywhere, the global economic slowdown will have knock-on effects with as yet impossible to predict consequences.The Kremlin\u0027s spokesman warned Russians last weekend to be braced for a perfect storm economic crisis lasting up to two years.  But alarmingly, a third wave hitting the developing world is only now taking off.With neither the healthcare capacity to handle multiple cases nor the economic reserves to survive the shutdowns that saved lives in Europe and East Asia, the outbreaks are likely to last longer and claim many more lives.Aid agencies are especially worried about conflict zones like Libya, where an outbreak of the virus has failed to slow the fighting, and refugee camps, where cramped conditions and rudimentary sanitation mean thousands of people will likely die if the virus takes hold.  In the world\u0027s largest refugee camps in Cox\u0027s Bazaar, Bangladesh, there is not a single venilator for more than 800,000 Rohingya refugees who fled a genocide in Myanmar in 2017. Médicines sans Frontier have described the camps, which are overcrowded and unsanitary as a ticking time bomb.The first 100 days of the coronavirus have brought the economy to a ‘hard stop’ the likes of which has never been seen before.Preventative action to stop the spread of the pandemic has forced the shutdown of swathes of British and global productive capacity.The next 100 days begins with a reckoning in the jobs market. Economists expect GDP to fall by as much as 20 per cent by the end of April.JP Morgan estimates such a fall would be expected to push up unemployment from below 4 per cent at the start of the year to as much as 13 per cent - far worse than the financial crisis or the recessions of the 1980s and 1990s.Almost 1m have signed up for benefits already. Typically that would cause serious scarring as some of the unemployed lose touch with the world of work for years, finding it hard to get a job and seeing their skills lose value as they are not kept up to date with modern employment.If the furlough schemes and business support efforts work the unemployment rate could be limited to around 7 per cent, staving off the worst social and economic effects of the crunch.The next key factor is the length of the shutdown. If restrictions begin to be eased in May, a rapid bounceback seems possible. Retail and hospitality can begin to reopen, bit by bit.Domestic travel can recommence. Workers on furlough or working from home can get back to normal work. Government efforts to ‘bridge’ this period with grants, loans and wage payments will have largely succeeded in keeping the economy from collapse.“We expect the economy to rebound quite swiftly, should quarantine measures be lifted sometime before the third quarter,” says economist Sanjay Raja at Deutsche Bank.This would not restore the economy to its previous peak instantly. International travel and large-scale events will take longer to return to normal. Lost education, training and investment could also take time to be recovered.Behaviours could change, too. Businesses and households may build up more savings to keep themselves safe from any ‘second wave’ or other future lockdown. That is the good scenario.But if the shutdown carries on into June or even to the end of the next 100 days, the economy could look very different.More businesses and jobs will have been lost for good. Those who are still standing risk lower incomes or higher debts. Businesses will be less willing to fund new investment in a weaker economy, and workers risk losing their skills after a prolonged period of forced rest.In that case, a long depression could lie ahead.In early January the World Health Organization issued an alert warning that a “pneumonia of unknown cause” had been identified in Wuhan, China. Just a few days later the mystery illness was confirmed to be a novel coronavirus and within a week Chinese scientists had published its full genetic sequence. Since then, experts across the globe have been scrambling to uncover the virus’ secrets. While miracles will not happen overnight, never before have scientists been so united in a common pursuit – and already a remarkable amount of progress has been made. “There is this spirit of collaboration,” Nick Cammack, therapeutics accelerator lead at the Wellcome Trust, told The . “Science is the exit strategy.” Looking forward, there are three key areas that experts are honing in on. The first is to answer the outstanding unknowns: How many of us have already had the virus? How common are asymptomatic carriers? And how much immunity, if any, do we acquire after surviving an infection?Widespread antibody testing will unlock many of these answers, as accurate assays will be able to detect prior infections and identify whether we are approaching widespread immunity. Scientists at the UK’s high tech, high security facility at Porton Down near Salisbury are among those who have already started this work – expect answers in the near future. Identifying effective treatments is another essential area of focus. While experts have started to track down completely new compounds that could be used to attack the coronavirus in the future, the most promising option right now is to repurpose existing drugs.Antimalarial treatments first tested during the Second World War (chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine), a combination drug used to treat HIV patients (ritonavir and lopinavir) and an antiviral first developed to treat Ebola (remdesivir) have all been pitted as potential cures, alongside convalescent plasma therapy and anti-inflammatories.While hundreds of clinical trials have started during the pandemic, it is the “megatrials” launched by the WHO, University of Oxford and French firm Inserm that will offer the most conclusive results as they have the largest sample sizes. Initial results for some of the potential therapies could start to emerge within a month. The final, and perhaps most critical, tool is a vaccine. About 35 companies and academic institutes are racing to create an inoculation and four candidates have already been tested in animals – but experts have warned it will be at least a year, if not 18 months, until a safe vaccine is ready for widespread use. Efforts are under way to speed this process up. Bill Gates announced this week that he would build factories to manufacture the seven most promising vaccines – even though this would “waste” billions of dollars, as the Gates Foundation would only ever mass produce two candidates. It’s a sign, if you needed one, of just how seriously the international community is taking the coronavirus threat. “Science is the exit strategy” might be a savvy soundbite, but it’s also true. The NHS has worked at full throttle to plan for the peak of the coronavirus outbreak, creating 10,000 extra intensive care beds at NHS Nightingale Hospitals and asking tens of thousands of retired medics and students to join the fight. Consultant surgeons have retrained as ICU nurses, as operating theatres and labour wards have been converted into Covid-19 wards.  When the peak comes in the next 10 to 20 days, with London and the West Midlands expected to come first, we will see if the preparations were sufficient.Staffing will be a major pinch point. A workforce deficit of 100,000 before the crisis will be compounded by medics going off sick - up to 25 per cent of staff are already self-isolating, according to the highest estimates. Increased testing will help, but medics will need to adapt.Nurses in ICU, who normally look after one patient at a time, could be asked to monitor half a dozen at once, while doctors will improvise with anaesthetic machines when ventilators are all in use and move patients around the hospital to maintain oxygen pressure. After insufficient amounts of PPE equipment were delivered in the early days of the crisis, fixes to the supply chain should hold up.As hospitals reach capacity, ambulances will be re-routed to NHS Nightingale Hospitals. NHS Providers has early confidence that hospitals won’t become overwhelmed, as they were in Italy, but is concerned about the effect on community services, such as GPs and social care. Frontline charities, such as St John\u0027s Ambulance, will need to draw on new funding from the Government in order to support the NHS.Coronavirus deaths will be commonplace, and medics will find themselves standing in for loved ones. They will facilitate video calls with family members, play comforting music, and hold patients\u0027 hands as they take their last breath. Medics will also die. There could also be a rise in non-corona deaths, as patients avoid going to A\u0026ampE and miss out on treatment.After the peak hospital admissions will plateau, but it will take weeks for the effect to be seen on wards as critical patients recover. Lockdown measures will help avoid a second peak, while contact tracing and immunity testing will become key.“People are putting on brave faces when in fact they are crying inside,” one ICU doctor tells me. NHS staff will rely upon a new NHS mental health helpline and ‘wobble rooms’ to ease the burden, but some will suffer from PTSD. Without a doubt, though, they will continue to work as hard as they can.As Dr Qian Xu, an A\u0026ampE doctor, says, “We are all scared, just like everyone else, but we have a professional duty to fight this war.The lockdown has obviously pushed us further apart. We can\u0027t see loved ones we can\u0027t go to work the public sphere, famously described by Jurgen Habermas as the place where ideas and experiences are freely exchanged, is gone. Even if we do go for a walk, we have to keep two metres apart, and our faces are hidden behind masks. This is deeply ironic given how much time Europe spent debating whether or not women should wear the Burqa.On the other hand, this is the closest we\u0027ve come to a collective experience in years. We are suddenly watching the same news and digesting the same information. We\u0027re probably talking to each other more than ever over phone and internet, and hundreds of thousands have volunteered to help the NHS. There is evident national pride at the construction of NHS Nightingale, the largest critical unit in the world, in just nine days.Criticism of politicians and suspicion that we might be getting this wrong, is balanced by the feeling that we\u0027re all in this together, even if all we can do is shout hello from a safe distance.But these are early days. Lockdown Britain is going to have to process two traumas. First, death. People die all the time, but rarely in one go and with the same condition, and never with this degree of media attention. Given the scale of mortality it\u0027s likely that almost every family will be touched by it but, due to the lockdown, we\u0027ll be denied many of the usual rites and companionship that we rely upon to cope with grief.Second, we are going to have to confront the trauma of prolonged boredom, unemployment and loneliness. There\u0027s been growing awareness in recent years of the link between mental and physical health, that if you are depressed or unstimulated, physical problems follow. Well, now we are engaged in a mass experiment in enforced isolation or, just as difficult, being stuck with the same person for a long period of time. One suspects that as frustrations increase, so will tensions between the generations.The phrase things will never be the same again is almost as over-familiar as stay at home - but it\u0027s not necessarily true.Some things will go straight back to normal when the lockdown ends because we miss them and we want them back: the pubs will be jam-packed and flights will sell out. But the Coronavirus could always return for another season, or some other disease, so we are likely to be left feeling very vulnerable for a long time.Sport’s shutdown narrowly allowed the real Cheltenham Gold Cup and has just given us the Virtual Grand National. In between, the industry’s business model has been exposed as over-reliant on TV deals and reckless with its salaries for players.Pent-up longing will bring fans swarming back into stadiums. Britain’s love for sport was always deep but now we will see new heights of appreciation. But football, in particular, has stretched the public’s loyalty, with billionaire-owned Premier League clubs using the government’s furlough system to transfer staff wage costs to taxpayers. The cries of poverty emanating from many clubs and sports organisations have invited scrutiny around how they are run and where all the money goes.With Euro 2020, the Olympics, Wimbledon and The Open lost or postponed, the English sporting summer, a mainstay of our culture, has been wiped out. Another hundred days from now, in mid-July, cricket’s new smash-ball form, The Hundred, teeters as August and September become the best hopes for a resumption. The Hundred was meant to be cricket’s new goldmine but may not be seen until 2021.Football’s quandary is the most pressing. It hopes to complete the 2019-20 season before the next one can commence in August - or later - in large part to avoid paying rebates to broadcasters for uncompleted fixtures. Last season in the Premier League, Liverpool amassed 97 points but still fell short of the title, which they have not won for 30 years. This time they are 25 points clear with nine games left but are at the mercy of a microbe.Industry watchers predict a “bloodbath” as budgets are slashed and jobs cut. Sport’s complacent belief that the show would always go on has unravelled in the face of a pandemic - and even superstars have lost their omnipotence. Many will be feeling physically and mentally frazzled and will need time to regain their form.A country in need of life-affirming spectacles is desperate to see them back from their lockdowns. Yet the financial damage will take many years to correct. A return to the old ways of funnelling vast revenues to the performers and their agents with no structural underpinnings would show that lessons had not been learned.Hopes remain for live sport in July, or perhaps more realistically, August, but mass gatherings will be the last of the prohibitions eased by the government, so we may see sport proceed at first with turnstiles locked.One hundred days ago, Boris Johnson and the Conservative Party were still basking in the glory of an unexpectedly large election triumph. That victory came from a transformation of the party. A new Tory coalition was forged from disillusioned Labour voters in the Midlands, the North and Wales through a politics that was more Left-wing when it came to splashing the cash, but more Right-wing on key social issues such as immigration.Nowhere was the transformation more clear than at the new Chancellor, Rishi Sunak’s Budget, where he opened the spending taps for tens of billions on roads, rail and broadband.Yet that Budget also marked a turning point. Mr Sunak announced £60 billion of spending to battle the economic fallout of the Coronavirus pandemic. Within days he was announcing billions of pounds more. And more again a few days after that. By then, all other priorities were on hold.As for the next 100 days, several major questions hang over the Government. The most obvious and immediate is how and when to lift the lockdown. Ministers and their scientific advisers are juggling a number of factors. They know that collapsed businesses and raging unemployment could lead to health problems just as damaging as the epidemic itself. But move too soon, overwhelm the NHS and see death rates from any and all illnesses and accidents spike, and the economy would be in dire straits anyway.When it ends, the epidemic will have complicated significantly the long-term goals of the Tory Party. The pandemic creates serious problems for “levelling-up”. The cost of supporting the economy through the lockdown will have piled tens of billions onto the national debt. How much room will be left for infrastructure? And will the global economy be stalling or roaring back? That matters for the public finances, but also for the regions that the Tories want to boost. Regenerating post-industrial towns is hard enough without a global recession.But is there a case for optimism? The economic recovery, which many still hope will be swift and dramatic, could provide a significant chance to reorder the economy. The Government has a major task ahead in reaching net-zero emissions by 2050, but it could target the post-virus stimulus not only at lifting up the regions but at transforming public transport, energy production and housing in the process. Here’s hoping.As this lockdown continues, one thing has become apparent to most families in Britain: we need teachers.  On March 20, schools across the UK shut indefinitely to all but the children of key workers in order to help slow the spread of the coronavirus. In an unprecedented move, GCSE and A-level exams will not take place instead, GCSEs, AS and A-levels will be awarded in July based on mock data, inidual assessment and prior attainment. Many have questioned the accuracy of these, particularly for black and minority ethnic, working-class and other marginalised students. Students may also be allowed to sit exams early in the next academic year or in summer 2021.The next three and a half months will bring us up to the end of summer term. The Government has said it will assess the situation after Easter, but most educators in Britain are preparing for the likelihood that schools will remain closed through May and, most likely, through the end of the summer term. While a study released this week by University College London concluded that closing schools may not have a big impact on preventing the spread of Covid-19, most around the world remain shut.What does this mean for learning? On one hand, the British education system is sensibly repetitive. “Homes aren’t schools, and nor should they be,” notes Dr Dan O’Hare, an educational psychologist at the University of Bristol. “They worry is that children need a lot of ‘learning’ - but the curriculum is pretty repetitive and they’ll have covered it before, and will cover it again.”The greater loss during this period is social, says Dr O’Hare. Whether four or 14, children rely on classroom interactions to build and maintain the social skills that will carry them through life. Adolescent development relies on peer identity. To keep that skillset going, Dr O’Hare says social media, with parental supervision, can be a very positive tool.The provision of education at home during this period is deeply uneven, and the degree to which parents are able to lead home-learning has exposed deep isions: while some parents may be organising four hours of focused, supported study each day, others in the same school may be struggling to feed their children.Some educators have taken the cancellation of exams this year as a chance to reconsider the British education system. The UK is alone in Europe in assessing twice (at 16 and 18), and in offering such a narrow range of subjects at the final school assessment level (A-level). Even the inventor of the GCSE has called for them to be scrapped perhaps this period of reflection will allow educators to step back and re-prioritise the outcomes of our education system?Twelve years ago – the last time the global economy was brought to its knees – it was the banks that needed bailing out. This time it’s everyone else: borrowers, savers, renters, homeowners – and yes, even landlords.Politicians and regulators have made it very clear that Britain’s banking system must now repay its debt and support the taxpayers who, as a result of the 2008 crisis, endured austerity and a lost decade of wage growth while property prices took ownership out of the reach of many younger workers.Banks have fallen into line, agreeing various “holidays”, from mortgage payments to extortionate overdraft fees. It seems certain these will now be extended into the next 100 days.I’m afraid the real economic hit will not be fully revealed for some time yet. Currently furloughed workers are having 80 per cent of their wages (up to £2,500 a month) guaranteed by the Government. A much-needed safety net, but one that doesn’t do much to help employers who must stump up the cash today, and claim it back later. At best, this is keeping thousands of firms on life support. When that is withdrawn, we will see unemployment figures soar, in line with the truly terrifying figures coming out of America. It will be far, far worse than the financial crisis.If that does come to pass, payment holidays of all stripes will need to be extended – there’s no chance of unemployed people being able to meet repayments. Applications for Universal Credit, the main out of work and low-income benefit payment, have already surged. Expect another wave in June. Universal Credit has already been increased, to just under £100 a week, and may need to be raised again.Most at risk is Britain’s five million-strong self-employed army. While Rishi Sunak did (eventually) extend his bailout to people who work for themselves, millions are still missing out on any help whatsoever. By mid-summer, what little cash reserves the prudent have set aside may have been burnt through, and struggling businesses will have cut contractors and other third parties to control costs. Mr Sunak has all but confirmed the self-employed will have to pay him back with higher National Insurance costs in the future. Though he may be forced to backtrack, as former chancellor Phillip Hammond was, given this could be seen as a “tax on entrepreneurs”.The self-employed and anyone who fills out a tax return have had a reprieve on this year’s “payments on account”. This second tax deadline will now be due in January 2021, not July this year. More help may be forthcoming when the scale of the challenge facing the sector becomes apparent.  Students and parents of children at nurseries and fee-paying schools face a nervous wait. Will they get any refunds? So far, institutions are resisting particularly where they are offering online services. If the lockdown is still in place in 100 days they may be forced to offer refunds, even if that means they enter dire financial straits.Anyone with a big chunk of their assets in the stock market will be hurting – a lot. The FTSE 100 index of the biggest British companies has lost about a third of its value since the start of the year. Billions of idends have been cut, and will likely not resurface for years. Yet there is a growing case for arguing this is one of the best times in history to be investing. In three months’ time, brand-new investors or people putting their cash into markets now, might already be sitting on healthy profits. Pick the right stocks and in 20 years’ time, well you might just be a surprise entry to the ranks of Isa millionaires.A screenwriter I know claims he has never been so busy  – the film industry has in the last fortnight gone into overdrive, he says, looking for material to fill the gaps that will occur when the lockdown lifts, with every studio determined to be ahead of the game.The same is true throughout the arts. Having rolled out programmes of streamed content to ensure some continuity, the movers and shakers have knuckled down to the conference-call business of forward planning for the autumn and beyond.Not much is likely to happen before September. Glyndebourne still fondly hopes to reopen on 14 July, and at the time of writing the BBC Proms (theoretically kicking off on 17 July) hasn’t yet been canned. But the Edinburgh festival jamboree in August is off, and West End shows aren’t likely to reopen in a hurry when there will be scant traffic, either touristic or domestic.So the focus is now on shifting dates and contracts to counter the loss of short-term income and minimise unnecessary risks: expect the announcement of some extra-long panto runs, and a lot of performances of tried and tested hits such as Carmen, Swan Lake and A Midsummer Night’s Dream. ENO is replacing its autumn Coliseum season with 10 weeks of the musical Hairspray.The good news is that the Chancellor has been quick to recognise the sector’s needs and decent concessions have been made, even if the sums involved are hardly on the German scale of 50 billion euros. Gift Aid can now be claimed on tickets not refunded, and Arts Council England has relaxed National Lottery rules so that money that would otherwise have channeled to capital projects can be used for emergency aid to the arts instead, without cost to the Treasury or the taxpayer. Some extra grant will be necessary for museums not under the ACE umbrella – could its source lie in the £120 million currently allotted to the Brexit Festival of 2022?The biggest challenge facing the arts over the next 100 days is to predict how taste and demand will change as a result of the trauma of the crisis – quite apart from the effect that straitened incomes will have on people’s ability to pay for entertainment. But be in no doubt: the arts are highly resourceful, imaginative and upbeat - and they have an absolutely central role to play in the national recovery.In another world, Glasgow would be gearing up to host the international climate summit COP26 in July, the biggest moment for climate diplomacy since the Paris Agreement was reached in 2015.Its postponement until next year pauses desperately needed international cooperation to keep global warming at 1.5 degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels.That might not be such a bad thing. You will be hard-pressed to find many observers who held out high hopes for the outcome of the summit.The talks will now take place in a changed world.What may turn out to be the greatest impact of the crisis is the overturning of many of the assumptions that underpin our consumption-based emissions. Do we need to fly to that conference, rather than join online? Can we all adjust to working from home more and limiting our car journeys?Meanwhile, it has reminded us of the value of the natural world. Suddenly, we are desperate for the restorative powers of the great outdoors, and the local wildlife has come out of hiding. The zoonotic origins of the disease may prompt a rethink about our relationship to wildlife and bioersity. China is under pressure to permanently ban wildlife markets, believed to be the source of the virus.Already we can see the benefit to the environment of our changed behaviour. Carbon emissions and air pollution have dipped during the shutdown China’s annual CO2 emissions are estimated to have fallen 18 per cent. Air travel is down more than half.Clearly, these cuts are unsustainable in the current mode and are likely to bounce back, as we have already seen in China, unless they are translated into long-term changes.Questions over how we will rebuild have rightly largely been put aside for the time being as the world focuses on saving lives and getting back to work. But in 100 days we will start to see more conversations about where we want to focus our resources and whether the post-Covid stimulus packages should be invested toward a greener world.The prospects for that are mixed, so far. The response in the US is likely to be decided in the November presidential election. Already Donald Trump has relaxed environmental requirements for the fossil fuel industry, citing the crisis.China has also relaxed some environmental regulations and early indicators suggest it has ramped up production in those areas of the country where the lockdown has eased.The EU has said it remains committed to its Green Deal, but there have been calls from Poland and the Czech Republic for it to be put on hold.The other big question for the next few weeks is what role will international cooperation play? Should we start to see a united front in the fight against this virus, it may reinforce the power of collaboration to face a common challenge. Again there, so far, the outlook is not rosy.For many, the anxiety set in slowly. As people washed their hands to the tune of Happy Birthday with one eye on the news, talk of mass death and draconian lockdowns started to fill our social media feeds. It sounded hysterical at first, but it wasn’t long before all our lives had changed beyond recognition. 100 days in, and our so-called “new normal” has left us with a mental health crisis which is gathering speed.It’s no surprise given how much has changed. We are now unable to see and touch our loved ones, even when they are dying. We don gloves and masks for the occasional nervous visit to the supermarket, we are at risk of being shouted at by police on our daily government-sanctioned hour of exercise, and we hover over our finances and food supplies with trepidation. All those little routines we never used to think about - the quiet building blocks for our resilience - shattered in a matter of weeks. Meanwhile, we live in fear of an invisible virus and obsess over symptoms lists.Public Health England’s guidance on how to cope with this brave new world includes maintaining contact with friends and family via the telephone, video calls or social media, keeping to a regular sleeping pattern, and focusing on a hobby. It’s perfectly sensible advice, but it can’t come close to addressing the damage this crisis is doing to our mental health.A recent Ipsos-MORI poll revealed 62 per cent of Britons were finding it harder to stay positive about the future in the face of the pandemic. Meanwhile 80 per cent of young people with a history of mental ill health have found their conditions have worsened since the crisis began. Distressing reports coming from Covid wards suggest there may be many frontline workers, survivors of the virus, and bereaved families requiring mental health support in the coming months.One hundred days in, we still don’t know when this will end, nor how, and it’s impossible to predict exactly where we might be 100 days from now. But while we can’t control what happens in the coming weeks and months, we can try to get a handle on how we react to all this. Mind, which was given a £5 million grant by the Government last week to administer to mental health charities around the country, advises that we all take extra steps to help combat anxiety during this period.Take a break from the news cycle maintain social contact stay hydrated, well fed, mentally stimulated and physically active keep taking your medication if you are on any (if you have a repeat prescription you might be able to order it by phone, online or using an app, and your GP can still have an appointment with you over the phone) and above all don’t leave it too long to seek help. Start by talking about how you feel with someone you trust. Start today.I don’t have to look far to find a picture of how exercise has changed over the past 100 days. As I write these words from the shed at the bottom of my garden, I can see my neighbour doing inverted press-ups, using TRX bands that he’s strung from the back of his house. Inside my own house, my partner and kids are learning ‘spidey squats’ with Joe Wicks on YouTube. Later, I’m hoping to nip out for an hour on my bike, to take advantage of the empty roads. On a weekday.The last time I checked, before coronavirus made its way to the UK, we were in the doldrums of February - a time of hibernation and cancelled gym subscriptions. Now, a few weeks later, it’s as though we’re back in the heady days of early January, intent on working off the excesses of Christmas. Exercise is everywhere and we’re not deterred by barriers from getting it. Yoga studio closed down? No problem: we’ll do a class over Zoom. London Marathon cancelled? Who cares: we’ll run it virtually. Gym doors shut? What you want is Wicks on the TV, or some TRX bands in your garden.The question for the next 100 days is simple: will we keep going? New Year, New You health kicks tend to slide into guilty deferrals (‘next year, new me’). So how resolute is this current trend?I have hope. All around us, exercise is being reframed as an expression of our freedom. When it’s the one thing you can do outside every day, going for a run or a ride feels less like a chore, more like something that’s actually quite fun. The lockdown might not be in place in 100 days\u0027 time, but perhaps the reminder that exercise makes us feel good, and it\u0027s freely (or easily) available to everyone, will stay in our minds?The gym industry is going to have to work out where it fits in this new, more egalitarian world of exercise. The traditional gym certainly won’t die - you’ll always have people who want to work out away from their own homes, and the hardcore bunnies who love the wrought iron atmosphere - but expect big chains to start competing for the online class space. And don’t be surprised if you see personal trainers trying their luck here either: online workouts offer a way for them to teach clients without having to pay rent or commission to a gym landlord. Embrace Zoom, and you might just find your weekly PT session dropping in price.For the nation’s backbone of small and medium-sized businesses, surviving the next 100 days will be an achievement in itself.  They are adaptable and resilient, but few businesses could emerge unscathed from the plunge in demand triggered by the coronavirus lockdown.From cheesecake makers in Preston to door-makers in Buckingham and car-parts makers in Worcester, erse businesses are facing the same stark question: How can you carry on, when the customers have disappeared?Added to the practical problems of poorly staff and looking after their own families, life in recent weeks has been a difficult haze for the millions of striving bosses in this crucial sector which supports 22m employees.Much of their energy since the national lockdown on March 23 has been spent trying to navigate the financial support put in place by the government - on hold with banks, haggling with landlords over rent holidays, deferring VAT payments, or talking to equally stressed suppliers.Only once those conversations have taken place and options are exhausted will it become clearer which businesses will make it through. Insolvency practitioners are braced for a wave of business once bosses work out where they stand.It\u0027s clear the government support will not solve all of businesses’ problems, even with the welcome improvements to the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme that were introduced at the start of April, and pressure on banks to lend.Many companies are reluctant to borrow given the uncertainty over how quickly demand will recover. Putting staff on government-funded paid leave is helping bosses avoid lay-offs, but doesn’t help those who still need workers to help re-right the business, but cannot afford to pay them.Given the shock to demand, there is stress on all sides, and no easy way out. Legal challenges loom between suppliers and customers, tenants and landlords. Radical solutions being floated -  such as getting stronger companies to take over struggling rivals or the government taking equity stakes - are likely to gain more traction.Yet the simple biggest help to many companies would be some clearer guidance about when lockdown might be lifted - for financial planning as much as a psychological boost to bosses thinking about throwing in the towel. Hence ministerial attempts to dodge questions about the exit strategy are exasperating.In the meantime, companies will need to adapt, and many are already doing so. Many are selling vouchers for when they re-open making use of back-up supply chains organised during preparations for a no-deal Brexit opening up new online sales channels or even putting resources at the use of the NHS.There is hope then, that July 18 will be marked by successes along with the inevitable defeats.As the world has ground to a halt, virtually all travel companies are facing an existential threat. March would normally have been an important month for advance bookings - airlines and operators rake in cash as people book ahead for their spring and summer holidays. Instead, the vast majority of flights have been grounded and the industry - from hotels to airlines - has spent the last five or six weeks trying to cope with a deluge of cancellations and requests for refunds.Without more help from the government or a sudden change in fortune, significant numbers seem certain to collapse under the financial strain. We are likely to end up with fewer travel agencies, tour operators and - probably -  airlines too. We may well see some big names go under.But the one thing which would help save the bulk of the industry is the main summer holiday season. As chance would have it, the next 100 days of Covid-19 will take us to July 18. That’s just before most schools are expected to break up for the summer - assuming they return in the meantime. It is peak time for nearly all holiday companies - the six weeks or so when they make their key revenues for the year.The prospect of a successful summer is now on a knife edge and depends on two things. First that lockdown is a success, not just in the UK but also in the key Mediterranean holiday destinations, and it can be relaxed sufficiently to allow international travel. And second, that people feel confident - and solvent - enough to take a foreign holiday. Given the chance, the travel trade will no doubt attempt to drive bookings by offering exceptionally good deals. Even so, they are likely to have a battle on their hands to win back custom.France seems likely to be one testing ground. Once restrictions are lifted, we may see the first shoots of recovery among British travellers taking their own cars across the Channel. But the recovery of air travel will be crucial. Some airlines - Jet2 for example - say they will start flying again on May 1. Ryanair and British Airways look more realistic in planning for a significant increase in services from June onwardsBritain’s biggest tour operator, TUI is allowing customers to postpone existing bookings made before the end of June. Clearly it is hopeful to be able to operate during those key months of July and August.In short, the timing looks incredibly tight. If we are to avoid a lost summer of foreign holidays and the decimation of the travel industry, the battle against Covid-19 needs to go seamlessly.The prospects for holidays in this country look more rosy, however. Assuming travel restrictions in the UK are lifted relatively soon, hotels, holiday cottages, camping and caravan sites should be well back on track by mid July. Given the pent up demand from a public driven stir-crazy by lockdown, this summer may be boom-time for British holidays.So far, coronavirus has frozen the housing market, begun a mass withdrawal of mortgage options and halted most major housebuilding projects. Buyers and sellers have been thrown into a painful limbo. And many have started to worry seriously about house prices.So what’s next? First, transactions are going to tank. The government has effectively banned house sales unless buyers and sellers are legally bound to go ahead. In some weeks in April and May, Capital Economics forecasts falls in mortgage approvals and transactions of more than 90 per cent year-on-year. This would match what happened in China during lockdown. Overall, across the next three months, the research firm expects a 70 per cent drop in sales compared to the same period in 2019. Sales are unlikely to resurge fast after lockdown has been lifted. Savills has based its predictions on an assumption that transactions will stay at as much as 40 per cent below their five year average until September. Estate agents’ commission books are going to take a nasty hit.But that is not the same as a house price crash. It is in fact possible that so few transactions will take place that there won’t be enough data to produce some house price indexes.When the lockdown lifts, some purchases that were put on hold will go ahead as previously planned, but everyone in the market will be newly cautious - buyers of getting into negative equity and vendors of under-selling. We will almost certainly be in a recession. Stock levels will be low, but some people will have to take price cuts and sell. Savills forecasts a short-term price drop of between 5 and 10 per cent.Still, the number of forced sellers should be low. The Government has made swift measures to protect jobs, earnings and home ownership. Airbnb landlords, who will have lost their cash flow with the collapse of the travel industry, will find themselves on a pressure point. In 100 days, we will have seen a mass influx of these properties first to the long-term lettings market, and then perhaps to sales. But far more home owners should be stable than in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.Then, as with the crash in the early Nineties, the house price plunge followed a period of exponential growth. This time around, our market was not volatile but tentatively recovering from a low base. Many buyers who currently have transactions on hold haven’t thought about renegotiating because they had already got themselves, say, a 10 per cent discount. There isn’t the same cliff edge to fall off. Overall for 2020, both Capital Economics and Knight Frank forecast price falls of only 3 per cent, with recovery starting in 2021.This was meant to be the year Boris Johnson would get Brexit done on January 31, and dusted on December 31 by seeing the United Kingdom out of its transition period on time.The first part of the Prime Minister’s plan went off without a hitch, thanks to his election win helping him steamroller parliamentary opposition. But his hefty Commons majority has not been able to stop Covid-19 from throwing a ner in the works of the post-Brexit talks.After negotiators faced off in their first round of talks at the start of March, the UK and EU had to ert increasing amounts of money, manpower and attention to the raging pandemic rather than preparing for life fully outside of the bloc. Coronavirus soon made it unsafe for negotiators to meet in person, with Michel Barnier and his British counterpart David Frost having to lie low after showing symptoms of the disease.With negotiators reduced to a back and forth of emails and attempts to make the most with remote communication technology, progress has been glacial. Talks have little advanced from opening demands. But in less than 100 days, both sides have to decide if they want to extend the transition period in order to allow more time to negotiate their future relationship.Before coronavirus reared its ugly head, Boris Johnson threatened in February to ramp up preparations to leave without a deal unless negotiators made enough progress by June, nailing down key areas like fisheries and financial services. With the sufficient progress now nigh-on impossible, barring a last-minute erasure of red lines in a desperate grab for a deal, the Prime Minister will have to decide how ready he is to make good on that threat.Meanwhile, European politicians are piling pressure on him to seek a delay, knowing well how vehemently he ruled out such an idea.The UK Government insists for now that it will not budge in its refusal to string out negotiations, but even stalwart Brexiteers are bracing themselves privately for such a delay to be agreed. Expect it only to happen at the very last minute ahead of the July deadline, when it is beyond doubt how badly Covid-19 has disrupted everything.Coronavirus has already struck down the Prime Minister, UK and EU negotiators and any chance of both sides steaming towards a good deal by July. Mr Johnson will be fighting until the last minute not to have its cherished transition deadline enter its own “delay phase”.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"watch close covid 19 vaccine","story":"The quest to find a vaccine solution for Covid-19 is critically urgent, but experts in the field tell us we are at least 18 months away from a viable product and human trials are a tricky process.

Reading the news is, for the most part, a solitary activity.Even online, taking in the news isn’t particularly social, at least until you rush to share it on Facebook, Twitter or\u0026nbspWhatsApp. Indeed, given most people now get their news via the\u0026nbspinternet, you might think the industry would be one of those least impacted by social distancing and self-isolation.But in reality, newspapers are more exposed to the economic shock the virus is causing than most other businesses.

Here’s how to take the perfect picture of it:Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesUse a landmark to get perspectiveEveryone will be taking pictures of the supermoon by itself, but some of the best pictures show the moon next to a land mark or trees and houses, which is what helps to give the picture “a sense of place”, says Nasa’s senior photographer, Bill Ingalls. “Think of how to be creative – that means tying it into some land-based object. It can be a local landmark or anything to give your photo a sense of place.”Created with Sketch.9 best images of the 2016 supermoon Show all 9Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The moon rises over the O2 Arena in south-east LondonA commerical jet flies in front of the moon on its approach to Heathrow airport in west London on November 13, 2016.A super moon rises over the Statue of Freedom on the Capitol dome in Washington, DC November 13, 2016.The supermoon, the closest the moon comes to Earth since 1948, rises over the Power and Light building in downtown Kansas City, Missouri, U.S., November 13, 2016A woman sits on the rooftop terrace of a house during the supermoon in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, November 13, 2016The moon rises behind the eagle sculpture high atop LeVeque Tower in Columbus, Ohio, Sunday, Nov. 13, 2016The moon rises beyond the Arch in St. Louis as seen from the Compton Hill Water Tower on Sunday, Nov. 13, 2016The moon rises behind Reunion Tower in downtown Dallas, Sunday evening, Nov. 13, 2016.The moon rises over the harbor of the costal town of Lambert\u0027s Bay, South Africa, Monday, Nov. 14, 2016The moon rises over the O2 Arena in south-east LondonA commerical jet flies in front of the moon on its approach to Heathrow airport in west London on November 13, 2016.A super moon rises over the Statue of Freedom on the Capitol dome in Washington, DC November 13, 2016.The supermoon, the closest the moon comes to Earth since 1948, rises over the Power and Light building in downtown Kansas City, Missouri, U.S., November 13, 2016A woman sits on the rooftop terrace of a house during the supermoon in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, November 13, 2016The moon rises behind the eagle sculpture high atop LeVeque Tower in Columbus, Ohio, Sunday, Nov. 13, 2016The moon rises beyond the Arch in St. Louis as seen from the Compton Hill Water Tower on Sunday, Nov. 13, 2016The moon rises behind Reunion Tower in downtown Dallas, Sunday evening, Nov. 13, 2016.The moon rises over the harbor of the costal town of Lambert\u0027s Bay, South Africa, Monday, Nov. 14, 2016Pick the best spotLocation isn’t everything, but it can definitely help with getting a perfect picture of the supermoon if you have time to plan it. You can look up the best monuments or statues in your area to photograph the image of the moon against, like Mr Ingalls does in Washington D.C., where he lives. “It means doing a lot of homework. I use Google Maps and other apps – even a compass – to plan where to get just the right angle at the right time,” he told Nasa.Use an app to find the moonUnless you\u0027re an astronomer, the best way to know where the moon will rise or set is to use a app on your smartphone to locate it. There are several free or cheap options you can choose from, each using your phone\u0027s inbuilt accelerometer to know which way you\u0027re facing.The apps can also tell you what phase the moon is in, while some even give other celestial details, like the location of planets and star constellations. Decent options for iOS and Android devices include Star Chart, Sky Safari and Skyview.Get the right exposureIf you’re taking a picture on your camera, control the light balance by first tapping the screen where the moon appears to get the camera to focus on the object before dragging your finger up and down to play with the exposure. “You’ll usually want to drag it down for underexposure to be sure you have all the highlight detail,” National Geographic photographer Michael Christopher Brown said.Use a tripod for your camera or rest your phone on a solid surfaceDavid Reneke, an astronomer and writer for Australian science magazine told ABC.net that if you’re using an SLR or DSLR then it’s important to play with aperture settings on your camera to photograph the supermoon, but that using a tripod is essential.It’s worth using a tripod for taking pictures with a smartphone too, as any camera shake can compromise the quality of the pictures – but if you don’t have one to hand you can simply rest your phone on a window ledge.For older smartphones that use a digital zoom rather than an optical zoom, it’s generally best not to use the zoom as it could compromise the quality of the image. Instead, take the picture and then crop it.Newer phones like the Huawei P30 and P40 series feature incredible zoom capabilities that can take detailed pictures of far away objects. Other cameras come with special features to improve pictures of the night sky, such as the Google Pixel 4’s Astro mode.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But we’re committed to working with others groups and organisations who come might along to help meet the needs of the community in different ways as time goes on.”He said the group has a pool of over 250 volunteers and an on call rota who are now getting several dozen calls a day from people in the area in “real need” of supplies.“Whatever help\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbspcan give in mapping the support network across the country is a good thing, especially if it means more people get access to the support they need,” Mr Vine added.Many food aid charities have been struggling with a drop in donations and a fall in the number of regular volunteers. Yet the mutual aid groups\u0026nbsphave been able to help them adapt by delivering food to people’s doorsteps.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

There are a lot of people are struggling to make rent, struggling with loss of income, struggling to access universal credit, as well as isolating for health reasons.

Yet some arts charities have switched gears and stepped in to help, delivering emergency food packages to people in desperate need.The Auckland Project – an organisation delivering cultural and education programmes in the northeast town of Bishop Auckland – is now leading a huge emergency food operation to deliver supplies to vulnerable people in County Durham.The Independent’s Help the Hungry campaign has been supporting the work going on across the UK to ensure that everyone has enough to eat during the outbreak, backed by figures such as London mayor\u0026nbspSadiq Khan, Labour MP\u0026nbspJess Phillips\u0026nbspand TV cook\u0026nbspNigella Lawson.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Auckland Project is an impressive example of how small groups are adapting to the crisis. Based at Auckland Castle, the kitchen staff at the visitor cafe are now cooking 500 fresh meals a day. More\u0026nbspthan 10,000 of the frozen meals have been dropped off at homes in the area over the past few weeks.“We knew a big section of the community would be hit hard by this, so we felt getting food out to those in need was the best way to help,” said Liz Fisher, one of the directors at the project. “It means big changes, but the staff wanted to do all they could – they really stepped up.”How to support our campaignThe Auckland Project’s team of 17 staff and volunteers have been busy working in the kitchen, preparing dishes such as cottage pie, lasagne, mince and dumplings and carrot cake for distribution.There is a move to grow food locally, too. Two acres of the castle’s walled garden has now been set aside for planting potatoes, beans, leeks, cabbages and asparagus.“Hopefully we can start getting the food we grow here into our meals, and possibly even have a celebration dinner once we get past the crisis,” said Ms Fisher.The charity has teamed up with the South Durham Enterprise agency and another local charity called Health Express to work out which iniduals and families need support.Chris Bowron – owner of The Miners Arms on the outskirts of Bishop Auckland – is also part of the emergency food drive. His closed-up pub acts a distribution hub for the local “mutual aid” group, and Mr Bowron and a team of volunteer drivers deliver around 150 frozen meals from The Auckland Project each day.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I look like I’m doing the donkey work, but it really isn’t just me, the other teachers also drive to deliver meals to children who live further away, we call the families up every week to make sure they’re doing okay, we prepare and pack the lunches together every single day,” he added.Created with Sketch.Coronavirus: London on lockdown Show all 29Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A man walks down a deserted Camden High StreetGoodge Street Station is one of the many stations closed to help reduce the spreadAn empty street in the heart of ChinatownPeople in masks in Chinatown a day after the lockdownA near-empty Piccadilly Circus during the first week of lockdownSonja, my neighbour, who I photographed while taking a short walk.

We literally knock and run, we don’t come into contact with them, but we didn’t expect the amazing response we’ve received.“There is a lot of poverty in the area, and some families are struggling. I’ve had parents call me up telling me how worried they are about getting food, and we are a lifeline for some of them.”Delivering the lunches personally also gives the teachers a chance to check in on the children and ensure they’re doing well while under lockdown.“I’ll wait for them to come to the door and sometimes have a quick peek inside just to make sure everything is in order and the children are okay,” said Mr Powles.Women ‘lose out on £126bn per year’ in unpaid work like childcareHe added: “I think it also gives them a sense of normalcy to see me every day. Of course, normal for them is coming to school every day, seeing me and their friends and other teachers – so having me come to see them might be reassuring.“Our school tagline is ‘The School That Cares’, and we really do care about our children, we will do almost anything for them.”As the coronavirus lockdown in the UK remains in place, schools raised concerns over how children who were entitled to free meals would continue to access them.In order to tackle the issue, the government announced a scheme to provide children who were entitled to free school meals supermarket vouchers every week worth £15.Schools can order the vouchers directly from supermarkets or shops to be emailed or printed and posted to families entitled to them.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Jack, 65, has meanwhile been dismissed from his role as an exam invigilator, leaving the family with a dramatically reduced income.This loss of work means Aisha is no longer able to meet the Home Office’s minimum income requirement for spouse visas\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspintroduced\u0026nbspin 2012\u0026nbspas part of the government’s\u0026nbsphostile environment for immigrants –\u0026nbspwhich\u0026nbspstipulates that the\u0026nbspapplicant and their partner must\u0026nbsphave jointly earned a salary of at least £18,600 per annum.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“When I found out my husband had lost his job it felt like there was a big ball of fire in my body,”\u0026nbspAisha\u0026nbsptold The Independent.\u0026nbsp”I’m so worried\u0026nbspI can’t sleep.

We have teamed up with The Felix Project – a start-up charity we helped launch in 2016 – to deliver produce to community hubs in London boroughs.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Independent is also asking food charities across Britain to contact helpthehungry@ to tell us about your project and help build a directory of ways that our readers can help the hungry in their area – through money, volunteering and food donations. Food banks, which were already struggling to meet the need for emergency food parcels, have seen a huge surge in demand in recent weeks, while at the same time coping with dwindling donations, supermarket rationing systems, and a loss of many volunteers to self-isolation – yet none of the government’s rescue money goes to them.British households have stored more than £1bn worth of goods in their homes in response to the pandemic, creating shortages for food banks as shoppers ignore assurances that supply chains are robust.How to support our campaignJess Phillips, the Labour MP who recently ran for party leader, has backed our campaign, saying: “Nobody should be in the position of not being able to get enough food. In my constituency, London and in places all around the UK the coronavirus pandemic is placing extra stress on a system that was already straining.“We should all do what we can to help food and other essentials get to those that need it. That is why I’m backing the Help the Hungry campaign – please give if you are able.”Pastor Obi Onyeabor, the manager at Barking Foodbank, part of The Trussell Trust’s national network, said his pool of around 50 volunteers has been reduced by a dozen or so people currently self-isolating at home. Yet he and his team have kept their two church hall food banks open, and are now making home deliveries on Tuesdays and Thursdays to make sure the most vulnerable get supplies.“We have been scrambling for the past couple of weeks, doing all that we can – but we’re appealing for more people to come and help,” he said. “Out of fear people have been buying for themselves and their families, but I’ve seen some real generosity too.“I hope that if we can get past the panic buying stage, more people will want to give money, food or some of their time too.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He said: “In a city as prosperous as London, everyone should have enough food to feed themselves and their families – but unfortunately the coronavirus outbreak means some Londoners are facing even greater difficulties. It’s commendable these organisations are joining forces to help ensure surplus food isn’t wasted and instead reaches those who need it most. I urge Londoners to support this crucial initiative.”Mark Curtin, CEO of The Felix Project, said: “Our role is to pick up large volumes of nutritious surplus food from the commercial sector and deliver it to community hubs to ensure there is enough food for vulnerable people for as long as this health crisis ensues. We will be working all hours doing our bit – and it would be wonderful if your readers can get behind us so we can do this job for London.”Emma Revie, chief executive of The Trussell Trust, which supports 1,200 food banks, appealed for help from the public to get vital food to people who cannot afford the basics, and to boost volunteer numbers in areas where they are needed.“Our main priority as coronavirus unfolds is ensuring the safety of everyone who comes to a food bank – whether it’s someone needing help, someone volunteering their time, or someone making a donation,” said Ms Revie. “Until we are confident that adequate government protection against poverty is in place, food banks provide an essential community service to people unable to afford food. But this should not fall to food banks.“Our benefits system could be the life raft people need now. That’s why it’s more important than ever that we end the five-week wait for universal credit. While incredible food bank volunteers continue to help people unable to afford the basics, we would ask our government to take this essential step and end the five-week wait now. It’s five weeks too long.”Sabine Goodwin, coordinator of the Independent Food Aid Network UK, which oversees 834 independent food banks, said the charitable services were “struggling to stay above water” in the current climate and accused the government of so far “failing to act” to prevent an ever-increasing number of people falling into poverty.“Food bank use was rising before the coronavirus outbreak and the impact of job losses can only make matters far worse. But this catastrophe in the making is avoidable,” she said. “We’re calling for an income-based solution to this crisis which would mean that the Herculean efforts by volunteers across the country wouldn’t be needed.“FareShare, the UK’s biggest food redistribution charity, is also calling for more volunteers to help with packing and making van deliveries. The organisation takes food from the food manufacturers that can’t be sold in shops, either because of packaging errors or overproduction, and gets it out to food banks, hospices, homeless hostels and other charities.Commercial director Alyson Walsh estimates around 1,200 people have got in touch over the past week. “We have quite a lot of older volunteers who have had to stay at home, but we are now seeing a wave of interest in new people willing to fill in.”Ms Walsh added: “We know we have the capacity to do more – we have the warehouse\u0026nbspspace and the chillers. But the government needs to help the food industry do more in terms of all the bagging and boxing and delivery of food that needs to be done.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The £1m you have donated will help us help The Felix Project feed NHS workers, care workers, the poor and the vulnerable. Thank you.How to support our campaign“But I have to report that I have been out delivering food with Felix today and they are seeing unprecedented demand from people who cannot afford or access food.“I went to two homeless charities, The Marylebone Project and Rhythms of Life, where our deliveries are preventing deep distress. I accompanied one of 22 Felix vans that set off across the capital, filled to the brim, to ferry over 20 tons of nutritious food to three of the giant community hubs established in Barnet, Islington and Haringey, and to more than 75 charities and schools.“That’s more than double the 10 tons a day Felix were supplying in normal times.”Mr Lebedev added: “Within days, this picture is set to change dramatically yet again. Felix say\u0026nbspthey expect another 11 community hubs in another 11 boroughs to open their doors to hungry Londoners – and with it, Felix’s output will need to double again.“That is why we at The Independent\u0026nbspare committing our resources to raise another million pounds to prevent food insecurity to people already anxious about their health and that of loved ones. That is why we say: £1m raised, £1m to go. Let’s finish the job and keep vulnerable Londoners healthy and fed.”The deliveries are part of our food appeal’s support for the charities in the London Homeless Collective, the umbrella organisation of London homeless charities that The Independent\u0026nbspis working with through our Homeless Fund. Felix is delivering to other homeless organisations, as well as The Marylebone Project, including Centrepoint.Des Scott, CEO of the Church Army, which runs The Marylebone Project and provides 112 beds to homeless women under the Edgware flyover, said: “Being able to get fresh vegetables is one of the key things we can do to keep these women healthy.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The only difference is that now I stand with my megaphone and shout, ‘Guys, please, two metres apart, you’re still going to get served, two metres apart, please.’”James Bardrick, head of Citi UK, said their donation to Help The Hungry\u0026nbspcomprised a combination of company money and an (as yet unknown) aggregation of employee donations which could conceivably exceed the £50,000 minimum pledged by the bank.When can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?Listen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastHe added: “Our employees want to support those struggling.

But she told ITV’s Peston: “Given our average daily is between 10,000 to 12,000 that’s still a significant number.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMs Coffey added it was not just people who had\u0026nbsplost their jobs that were making claims, but also self-employed workers whose incomes had “fallen significantly”.\u0026nbspThe government received about 55,000 claims for universal credit “in a normal week” before the crisis, according to the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) permanent secretary Peter Schofield.Tracking the coronavirus outbreak around the world in maps and chartsWhen can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsListen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastCalls to the DWP’s universal credit helpline soared to 2.2 million on 30 March and totalled 5.8 million over a seven-day period, he told MPs on the work and pensions select committee.The committee has launched an inquiry into the DWP’s response to the coronavirus outbreak following the increased strain on the system.It wants to understand how well universal credit is working given the “unprecedented” number of new claimants, whether there have been improvements in the delays faced by claimants in the second half of March, and how quickly people are receiving an advance on their first payment.Mr Schofield, replying to questions posed before the launch of the inquiry, said 41,000 new claimants were paid an advance in the week beginning 16 March and 72,000 in the following week.He said he was unable to provide details on claims submitted more recently as they are being processed.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This is nowhere near good enough.As Boris Johnson croaked from his sick bed, mass testing among the general population is the ONLY way out of this national purgatory.But at the moment we do not even have widespread testing among our NHS workers.Right now we are letting down those selfless doctors, nurses and health carers.On Thursday night at pm, my street in North London resounded to the sound of grateful clapping for our carers.But as our frontline health workers start to die, they need more than a weekly standing ovation.They need us to understand that the lockdown rules apply to us all.Lucy Hutchings, , is a nurse caring for coronavirus patients in Southampton.In a Facebook post, shared , times, she wrote it is “devastating” to see so much suffering when there are still people not following simple rules about staying home, staying safe and protecting the NHS.“I’m scared, everybody I work with is scared,” wrote Lucy, her face etched with exhaustion after another gruelling -hour sht.“The quicker people stay indoors, the quicker it will be over.“I’d like to stay at home but I can’t, so for people to go against the rules is so stupid and irresponsible.“I keep myself away from my mum, dad and brother because I don’t want to pass the virus on. It’s a hard thing to do.”Lucy’s face should haunt us all.Remember it every time some thick-as-mince footballer wraps his expensive motor around a lamppost.Remember Lucy’s face every time you see people who think social isolation rules do not apply to them.Remember Lucy’s faceyou want to understand what a long way we have to go before we truly start supporting the NHS.Yes, it is hard for a people raised in freedom to obey these restrictive rules.But NOBODY has a harder job right now than those NHS workers who are risking their lives in under-equipped, overcrowded hospitals that are being pushed to breaking point and beyond.The health crisis is unprecedented in our letime but the Government cannot keep cocking it up.The NHS does not have the kit it needs, the testing it needs, the support it needs.Health Secretary Matt Hancock promises , coronavirus tests a day by the end of April.If Hancock does not deliver, get shot of him.Because right now, that “Protect the NHS” slogan is looking heartbreakingly empty.All foreign NHS workers who are out there now fighting on the frontline deserve British passports.If these foreign heroes are good enough to risk their lives to save our lives, then they have earned the right to stay in the UK for ever.CLAUDIA Schfer tells Elle magazine that at the height of her supermodel glory days she felt like a rock star. She reveals that she wouldfrom another hard sht on the runway to discover that her bra and knickers had been stolen by obsessive fans.“It was insane,” she says. “Like being a rock star.”Well, not quite, Claudia.

And they take advantage now to say, ‘Yes, I’ve been a victim’. There is a lot of hypocrisy.”It’s a bit rich someone from the Bond franchise complaining about hypocrisy.Daniel Craig said in  that he would “rather slash his wrists” than play James Bond again.And what could be more hypocritical than that, Lea AS this newspaper pointed out last week, it is totally bonkers that archaic Sunday trading laws restrict large grocery stores to just six hours of trading on Sundays.Nobody in the country is finding it easy to buy essential shopping for their family right now.Yet supermarkets can’t stay open for longer than six hours on a Sunday, even though the hours of convenience stores are not limited by prehistoric trading laws.The Department for Food says it has no plans to extend Sunday trading hours. Why the hell not As Iceland boss Richard Walker says: “We have spoken to the Government about this.“My hands are still tied with these archaic Sunday trading laws.“This is a moment of national crisis and we need our shops open.”When the current three weeks of lockdown ends next week, it will inevitably be extended.This will be a bitter pill for everyone in lockdown Britain.Scrapping the Sunday trading laws would make it easier to swallow.PRINCE William wants toto his air ambulance duties.Meanwhile, Prince Harry scuttles off to Los Angeles in the last private jet out of Canada before the borders closed.And the tragedy is that Harry would have been brilliant during our national emergency.Harry was born for mucking in, raising spirits and doing his bit.Can you imagine the reaction Harry would have got in an overstretched NHS hospital  What a waste.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Get it on now.”So there it sits, Monday to Friday at pm. The Steph Show, hosted by the former BBC Breakfast presenter, from her Yorkshire home, with nothing for company but a mission statement: “It’s a power hour of positivity.”An easy thing to claim, an impossible thing to deliver without ideas, creativity, content or anything other than secondhand clips and the same old guestsyou’ve seen clogging up every other show recently.The Steph Show has one thing and one thing only in its favour, though. Honesty.She promised viewers it “might be a bit rough around the edges”, and has been utterly faithful to her word, starting last Monday, when Steph went hurtling round her house to show off the remote cameras and then spent the next ten minutes gasping for air.Over the following  minutes, Skype links maled, mobile phones went off and an attempt to kick off a feature about weird dreams, with Keith Lemon, was shut down as quickly as it started.“What did you ask Michael Hutchence in your dream ”“Things he did romantically with Kylie Minogue that . . . ” “OK, let’s move on.”Had you thought day two was going to improve things, you probably banished those thoughts when Steph began with her own epitaph: “If you tuned in yesterday, you’ll know this is the show that isn’t meant to be on yet.”Or any other day for that matter, although Tuesday’s episode was a technical cracker and climaxed when someone rang Steph’s doorbell, mid-episode. We never did find out who, but I’m willing to bet good money it wasn’t Bafta.And so this hypnotic mess continued throughout the week.Thursday, however, was the day the edice really crumbled, as Steph attempted to lead a mass, safe-distance dancing demonstration, from a car-park in Bristol.Until it transpired the choreographer was at such a safe distance from her CD player it’d be another minute or so before it could start.Honestly, you’ve never heard a silence so awkward or so deafening and it was hard not to have a measure of sympathy for Steph and her production team, who’ve clearly been thrown under a bus by Channel .I say a measure of sympathy, because professional northerner Steph is hardly the underdog she’d have you believe.Her close friend, Sinead Rocks, is MD for the regions at Channel ’s Leeds HQ and, while there’s no suggestion she had anything to do with her recruitment, there’s always an assumption Steph McGovern is “a good thing”.Having never concentrated on her work before I’m going to assume this is for box-ticking, rather than professional, reasons, because, based on her performance here, she’s not a good presenter.For a start, she chunters for Britain, has a knack for saying exactly the wrong thingand crunches the gears during an interview like Jack Grealish heading back to lockdown.: “Provided the last laugh in Germany, did you  What are your tips for attracting wildle ” Eh  There’s more than a hint of The Fast Show about her as well.Absolutely everything is “brilliant”, especially when it’s not. It’s her habit of thinking out loud that could be the death of The Steph Show, though.“Hey! Let’s have our own talent show. Maybe your nan can yodel, your dog can dance.”Or your sister can present daytime TV without mentioning her baby. Every. Five. Minutes. I sense a vacancy in the offing.BASKET-case football club Sunderland and its army of long-suffering fans are trapped in an abusive relationship with Netflix.Every couple of years the streaming service gets to broadcast the most heartbreaking and brilliant documentary series anywhere on television, Sunderland ’Til I Die.In , they get defeat, ridicule, embarrassment and another story of failure told largely through the bracketed series of doom-laden captions that accompany every fresh disappointment: “Indistinct chatter”, “Seagulls cawing”. “Man yells”. “Jack Ross screams”. “Men chant gregariously”, and always “Tense music playing”.You get the impression, of course, the supporters love the attention that comes with losing which, in turn, tends to attract  prophets and publicity-crazed “saviours” to the club. Series two begins with a new owner, Stewart Donald, arriving at The Stadium Of Light along with public schoolboy executive director Charlie Methven, very much the David Brent of the piece, who understands only two things, attendance figures and metaphors and should’ve been ridden out of town the moment he turned up wearing pink corduroy trousers.Improbably, Sunderland also seem to have found a brilliant striker, Josh Maja, who you absolutely know is on the first stage out of Dodge the moment he arrives to turn on Sunderland’s Christmas lights and promises: “I’ll be here next year.”From that point on, disaster’s guaranteed but has to be spelt out to Charlie and Stewart by Graham at the Roker Rapport podcast: “If Will Grigg was the manager’s signing, how come he can’t find a way to play him ”“Um . . . ”BEFORE Friday night, I was convinced a mixture of resolution and good humour would see us through this crisis.No bad thing, but they also need to ditch the host, two guestsand Paul Merton and Ian Hislop, who all appeared, via Skype and remote cameras, in front of their own chosen back-grounds, on Friday.An open invitation to reveal the inner tosspot, they weren’t ever going to refuse.Hislop had a vast library behind him, as befits the intellectual colossus he imagines himself to be, while feminist author Helen Lewis was carefully positioned in front of her new book, exploiting a global pandemic for commercial gain in a manner that seems to be perfectly acceptable to the BBC, so long as you’re left-wing.If your stomach wasn’t already turned enough, the following half hour probably did the job as the four lists and host Steph McGovern cackled demonically at the brilliance of their own route-one puns.“Hasn’t Boris got his Churchill moment now ”Hislop: “Yes.

Save Lives . . . including your own.If the Prime Minister being in intensive care doesn’t focus their minds, then perhaps the sight of -year-old Ismail Abdulwahab’s coffin being lowered into the ground by strangers in hazmat suits will serve as a salutary lesson that this isn’t “just like the flu” — it’s a potentially deadlier unknown.Whatever your age, gender, race, health history or fitness level, it could be you. And until you have it, you have absolutely no idea what the outcome will be. No two cases have been the same.You could be lucky and only suffer mild symptoms, you might be less so and have a spell in hospital, or worst of all, you might never come out.The latter has been the harsh reality for — at the time of writing — , people in the UK, a figure that is likely to keep risingthose who clearly think that it won’t happen to them don’t start adhering to the strict behaviour codes that will, hopefully, send this thing packing.Or to put it bluntly, better six feet apart than six feet under.ONE of the positives of the lockdown is the rise of socialising via video apps such as Zoom, Houseparty etc.Some people dress up for a party, others have a virtual dinner together, choirs sing, kids have playdates and my friend and I completed a crossword together.But it has its drawbacks too.I’m due to do a chat with This Morning tomorrow and a virtual paper review from home on The Andrew Marr Show this Sunday, and I’m trying to find a suitable backdrop.The kitchen is too informal, with a real and present danger of either the dog snoring or The Bloke wandering into shot in his, ahem, attractive “lockdown shorts”.A couple of noisy, nesting pigeons rule out the garden, and for obvious reasons the bedroom would be a little too familiar.Most online commentators have chosen a backdrop of bookshelves displaying weighty tomes that convey their vast intellect, but thanks to The Bloke’s fondness for books such as The Subtle Art Of Not Giving a F*** and Is It Just Me Or Is Everything Sh** , I’d have to spend an afternoon sanitising ours.So, apologies in advance, it may have to be the downstairs loo.But while they are helping save lives, who is there to help them The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealCHANNING Tatum is single again after splitting up from pop singer Jessie J.We know this because he’s reportedly back on celebrity dating app Raya, where his profile reads: “And yes, I used to be a stripper.

Well done to the people who made this!”Another posted: “Wooooow look how cool that is.”A third posted: “Good on you. Enjoy yourselves, keep safe x”And one joked: “Are the neighbours complaining  Just to add to the authenticity.”Meanwhile, the real Benidorm has been left a ghost town after Spain too – like much of Europe – was put on coronavirus lockdown.Shocking pictures show the holiday hotspot’s normally bustling bars and beach completely deserted, apart from soldiers and cops policing the curfew.The country has been much worse hit than the UK, with , deaths and , confirmed cases of the deadly bug.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappeal  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I went for a few days without food after Domino’s stopped taking phone orders, so I’m really grateful for everyones help.”Hoggett moved to Aldershot from Manchester in the s. His we passed away in  and he has no family or friends in the area - so he had no one in the local area that could shop for groceries on his behalf.When his favourite pizza chain stopped taking orders over the phone Mr Hoggett - who suffers from osteoarthritis- tried to walk to his local Morrison’s to get essentials.The walk - less than half a mile - was too much for David and some kind members of the pubic helped him cross the road, before he was spotted and approached by Hampshire police officers.After learning of his story, the officers bought him some groceries and helped himhome safely.Wanting to help him in the future, The Sun offered to get some more essentials for David and brought him some loo roll, vegetables, ready meals and his favourite snack - Mini Cheddars.We also have arranged food deliveries over the coming weeks for the pensioner.David said: “I began self isolating on February . I didn’t want to take any chances because in , I ended up in hospital three times – the third being a heart attack. “I had some bits in the cupboard but was basically just living on Domino’s pizza, cookies and Coke Zero for about a month.“When they stopped doing phone orders I didn’t know what to do, I tried to walk to the shops but it’s a bit too much with my osteoarthritis.“I have no friends or family down here, so I am completely on my own. The only people I know are  miles away in Cleethorpes.”As well as the local police helping him, once she was aware of his plight, neighbour Jodie Cordner, , stepped in to help.She picked him up some essentials when doing her own shopping and has helped arrange him receiving hot meals from the local Talavera School.She said: “I wouldnt like to see my family in that situation and David has no friends or family.

For those of you who say this virus is nothing out of the ordinary, a big fuss about nothing – how often do we have a Prime Minister in intensive care We all wish Boris a swt recovery. The country needs a strong leader at a time like this and Boris has proved, in three short months, he is that leader.There have been calls for a national unity government. All the parties coming together to see us through this crisis. It’s happened before, of course — most famously during World War Two, when we had a coalition government led by Boris’s hero, Sir Winston Churchill. We had one during the Napoleonic Wars back in , too, when that short French tosser was causing havoc in Europe.But do we need one now I think not. The only reason people are raising the issue now is because the Labour Party at last has a leader who isn’t actually certiable.Nobody would seriously think that giving power to an oaf like Jeremy Corbyn would help us through this crisis.But there are plenty of other reasons to object. First of all, we kind of already have a unity government.The Conservatives have a whopping -seat majority. In the last opinion poll Boris had  per cent of the country behind him, thinking he was doing a good job. That’s about as close to unanimous as you will ever get in a democracy. The Government, then, has a free hand.Perhapsthis virus had struck back in October last year, there might have been a point. Then we had a paralysed government with no working majority.Battling this virus would have been nigh on impossible in such a position. But the December General Election changed all that.But then there’s this. Unity governments are usually convened when we are threatened by a foreign power — as happened in World Wars One and Two and indeed the Napoleonic Wars. There have been brief exceptions.But by and large we have a unity government to show the foreign power that the whole country is united. The virus isn’t a ­foreign power. It is an insentient microscopic parasite. It doesn’t give a monkey’s who is running the country.But the most important objection is this. We are a democracy. And democracy is no less important during times of crisis than at other times. And we need a competent opposition to hold the Government to account. Boris and co haven’t done a bad job, so far. But there are plenty of questions that could be asked. Did the Government react too slowly  Why do our frontline medical staff not have adequate protection against the virus  Why did we allow planes to land from China, back in March, when the danger was apparent.OK, you may think some of those questions unfair. And asked with the benefit of hindsight. But it is the job of the Opposition to ask dficult questions, to challenge policies and highlight incompetency.I would argue that is more vital now than at any time in the last  years.Labour’s new leader, Sir Keir Starmer appears to be a sensible bloke.He is generally behind the Government in its fight against this pandemic.But he must be allowed to question, in public, the Government’s policies.We are no less unied when dficult questions are asked of politicians.The more those dficult questions are asked, the quicker this virus will be beaten.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealLIFE will never be the same again. No, I’m not talking about this wretched virus for once.The Labour Party has got rid of almost all of its nutters from positions of influence.Diane Abbott has gone. John McDonnell has gone.So has the former chairman, the godawful Geordie Ian Lavery.Corbyn himself will be gone very soon.What are we going to do for a laugh without these clowns spouting rubbish all day long Luckily — thank the Lord! — the genuinely berserk David Lammy has been installed as Shadow Justice Secretary.It’s up to you, now David, you dingbat. Keep us chuckl­ing during these dark days.DONALD Trump has turned his guns on the World Health Organisation.He’s threatened to cut off its funding. He reckons the WHO has handled the virus pandemic very badly.The WHO told Trump he was wrong to ban flights from China at the start of the outbreak because it “wasn’t necessary”.He said: “The WHO receives vast amounts of money from the United States and we pay for a majority, the biggest portion of their money, and they actually criticised and disagreed with my travel ban at the time I did it.“And they were wrong. They’ve been wrong about a lot of things.”He may look like a morbidly obese Belisha beacon in a badly fitting wig.He may sometimes talk out of his a***hole. He may have the diplomatic abilities of a semi-housetrained wolverine.But he may well be dead right on this.SOME experts reckon we could be in a state of lockdown until well into autumn.That sounds pretty grim. But there is a silver lining.It means that tour by Genesis might have to be called off.WHO’S nicked all the flour, then  Can’t find the stuff anywhere.It’s aspeople thought: “Uh oh. Armageddon’s coming. Better make a really nice cake. Maybe a coffee one with walnuts, or something. Or a Swiss roll.” I suppose stockpiling flour is more sensible than stockpiling bog rolls. People seem to have given up on that now. Crisps, though, are selling out really quickly.As I mentioned last week, that’s because most sensible people are sitting on their sofas watching Netflix. And you need a snackyou’re doing that for  hours a day.Plus copious quantities of alcohol. One serious point – round my way, it’s impossible to get a click and collect slot for any of the supermarkets.And it’s been that way for two weeks. I know these are dficult times.And I’m pleased the supermarkets are giving priority to vulnerable customers. But would it tax them too much to take on a few extra drivers LONDON Mayor Sadiq Khan reckons that bus and Tube drivers in the capital don’t need protection kits to keep them safe from the virus.With every day that passes, this looks more and more dangerously wrong.There is growing evidence that the virus is more severeyou catch it from multiple sources. That explains the tragedy of young doctors and nurses dying.And also London bus drivers – nine have died so far.All the people selflessly working in frontline jobs where they meet thousands of people deserve proper protection.These PPE kits cost less than  quid per person. Not much to ask, is it I SEE that my home town is in the news.Middlesbrough has been named the place in the UK where people are least likely to obey social distancing directives.This is almost certainly because they think thatthe virus comes anywhere near them, they’ll kick its f***ing head in.“Come near me, you radged microscopic t**t, and I’ll give you a split lip.”JUST seen a report that says our pets don’t know what the hell is going on.They don’t know why we’re home all the time. And they don’t get why we’re so stressy.I tried to explain to my daughter’s hamster, Alastair, what the problem was.“It’s the coronavirus,” I told it. “We’re all a bit worried.”It looked at me levelly for a moment and said: “Well stop Chinese people eating small mammals, then,” before crapping on my hand and going back to run around on its stupid wheel.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

My daughter aged  had Strep throat a month ago. She has had a dry, continuous cough for two weeks, which isn’t clearing. Could it be coronavirus and what should I do A. It is possible that your daughter has coronavirus as a new, dry persistent cough is a typical symptom.

The guidance is for you to stay home and self-isolate with your family for  days.Q. How would being on lelong warfarin affect meI had coronavirus A. Warfarin stops your blood from forming clots.

which was first identied in the Chinese city of Wuhan - could have been passed onto humans by intermediary species on sale at a wet market.Those markets, where wild and often poached animals are packed together, have been described as a breeding ground for disease and an incubator for a multitude of viruses to evolve.Following the outbreak of the virus, China banned the breeding, trading and consumption of wildle -

We reveal all...According to the New Scientist, plants need a period of cold then warm weather before they can flower.Butthere is a long winter, plants that couldnt flower earlier in the spring are more likely to do so all at once.The term is known as a condensed spring because it is far shorter than normal.This causes more pollen to be produced - causing misery for hayfever sufferers.Tree pollen is likely to be worse, which affects one in four Brits.In short - yes.The Met Office has predicted high pollen levels across most of England, except the North East, as well as all of Wales.Scotland and Northern Ireland are set to see medium levels, with only Orkney and Shetland set to escape the pollen bomb.Those conditions are predicted to stay pretty much the same for most of July.Sufferers will experience cold-like symptoms - such as itchy eyes and a runny nose - but the threat could be more serious.Half of Brits plagued by hay fever could experience deadly asthma attacks triggered by the pollen.Hay fever and asthma are closely linked, with around  per cent of people with asthma finding their symptoms are made worse when pollen counts are high.You can check pollen levels on the Met Office website.Sonia Munde, nurse manager at Asthma UK, said anyone who has both asthma and hay fever should ensure they are taking antihistamines and nasal steroid sprays, and ensure they take their preventer inhaler as prescribed to ward off an attack.She added: Pollen is a top trigger for asthma attacks at this time of the year, affecting an estimated .million people with asthma in the UK.People with asthma who also have a pollen allergy not only experience classic hay fever symptoms such as itchy eyes and a running nose, but are also at an increased risk of a le-threatening asthma attack.Holly Shaw, nurse adviser at Allergy UK, urged people to stock up on antihistamines to help manage their symptoms.Typically the hay fever season starts in mid-March, with tree pollen blooming until May.However, the damp weather in June  meant there was a delay to the pollen season this year but pollen levels are expected to be high in the early part of July, causing problems for hay fever sufferers.With wet conditions a lot of the pollen in the air is simply washed away.Dr Beverley Adams-Groom told the Mail: The weather in most of June was pretty poor which meant quite a lot of pollen was washed away by the rain.But the past week or so has been nicer so we’ve started to see high or very high counts again.While normally we’d be past the main peak by now we’ve had something of a delayed pollen season this year.With last year’s hot, dry conditions, grass was dry and exhausted by the start of July.Instead this year’s wet June means it’s still growing so pollen is still being expelled, meaning it will be a longer season this year.Allergy expert Max Wiseberg warned: “When the tree pollen season is delayed, more trees are likely to release their pollen at the same time, creating a time bomb waiting to explode.“Peaks of tree pollen could be higher than normal.The recent cold wintry weather provided the optimum conditions for this to happen.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A leaked transcript of a Zoom meeting involving Passport Office managers, reported by the BBC, suggested up to , members of staff couldto work on routine passport applications. According to the transcript Home Office deputy scientic adviser, Rupert Shute, told the meeting: “You are no more at risk at the workplace as you would be in your home or at the supermarket. It is about minimising it.” He reportedly added: “We are working on the assessment that % of us,we havenapost already, will get the virus. We cannot hide away from it forever. Mark Serwotka, general secretary of the PCS Union said: “It is absolutely scandalous that HMPO are suggesting our members can go back into work during a pandemic to process routine passports. The cavalier approach to our membersapos health and safety is shameful and ultimately puts them in greater danger of contracting Covid-. We have already had members die as a result of contracting corona and pressured civil service managers in other departments to shut offices so staff can work from home. For the deputy chief scientic adviser at the Home Office to suggest that going into work does not put you at greater risk of contracting corona is extremely irresponsible and totally contradicts current Government guidance. Processing passports is not critical work while we are in lockdown and international travel is practically non-existent due to the corona pandemic. A Home Office spokesman said: Her Majestyaposs Passport Office is fully adhering to public health advice across all our offices and adopting social distancing measures to keep both its staff and customers safe. It continues to operate at substantially restricted staffing levels with a signicant number of people working from home where possible, and staff are prioritising emergency cases. Guidance is also available for people who are travelling into work. It was made clear in the meeting that the Governmentaposs priority is slowing the spread of coronavirus and we all have a part to play in order to protect the NHS and save lives.  The Home Office added that Government advice has been clear that people may travel for work purposes,they cannot work from home. At a Number  briefing this morning, the Prime Minister’s official spokesman said: “I think the government advice is very clear that you may travel for work purposesyou cannot work from home. “That guidance is obviously available for the passport staff who are travelling into work.” "},{"url":null,"title":"dominic raab set decide uk","story":"NewsDominic Raab set to decide on UK lockdown while Boris Johnson not working in hospitalReports claimed the PM would want a say on coronavirus restrictions - but No insisted he is not working and any decision will be taken by Dominic RaabShareCommentsByDan BloomOnline Political EditorMikey SmithPolitical Correspondent:,  APR Updated:,  APR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news politics video rishi-sunak-gives-update-prime-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,mvtTests:[ UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,mvtTests:[ UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news politics dominic-raab-set-decide-uk-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWe will use your email address to send you newsletters.

Drastic limits on leaving your home will be reviewed by April  - but itaposs clear they wonapost be lted. As coronavirus deaths continue to rocket, they will probably drt on into May at least. A meeting of the COBRA emergency committee today kicked off the process of working out what to do next, chaired by Boris Johnsonaposs deputy Dominic Raab.  But the government isnapost planning to actually tighten the law - yet. Instead the focus will be on enforcing the law we already have and making it last longer. Meanwhile police are preparing for a tough Easter weekend - with threats to search peopleaposs shopping and fine anyone going to bask in the sun. So what can and canapost you do under the lockdown law, what is changing, and when will it all end   Hereaposs the lockdown latest explained.What are the basic lockdown rules  You cannot leave the house where you live without reasonable excuse. That boils down to:Shopping for basic necessities, for example food and medicine, which must be as infrequent as possible One form of exercise a day, for example a run, walk, or cycle - alone or with members of your household Any medical need, including to donate blood, avoid or escape risk of injury or harm, or to provide care or to help a vulnerable person Travelling for work purposes, but only where you cannot work from home. Gatherings of more than two people are banned in public - unless youaposre from the same household, or a few other exceptions . And pubs, cafes, restaurants, gyms, funfairs, playgrounds, sports courts, cinemas, theatres, nightclubs, bingo halls, concert halls, museums, galleries, car showrooms, casinos, betting shops, spas, hair and beauty salons, barbers, massage parlours, tattoo studios, skating rinks and more must shut.  What is the punishment for breaking the lockdown  Breaking the rules above without reasonable excuse, or obstructing an officer enforcing them, is a criminal offence and you can be prosecuted. However, you can in most cases avoid a criminal conviction by paying a aposfixed penalty noticeapos issued by the police within  days. The law allows police to issue £ fixed penalty notices - rising to £ for a second offence and then doubling each time up to a cap of £. Police, PCSOs, council officers and other government representatives can also order or force you toto your home, and disperse gatherings of more than two people.  When did the UK go into lockdown - and for how long  The lockdown was announced by Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Monday  March. It took effect immediately. Police powers to enforce the lockdown took force a few days later - at pm on Thursday  March. The law says the lockdown must be reviewed by Health Secretary Matt Hancock every three weeks, with the first review by Thursday  April. But reviewing the lockdown doesnapost mean it stops. The law is in force for up to six months without the government needing to write a new one. Will the lockdown be extended for longer than three weeks  Yes. The UK government hasnapost made an official announcement because thataposll only come next week. But ministers, civil servants and  Downing Street have been absolutely clear that April  is much too soon to end the lockdown. Wales has already confirmed it will extend the lockdown. Scotlandaposs First Minister Nicola Sturgeon added: I don’t think there is any possibility, any likelihood of these lockdown measures being lted immediately or even imminently. Even before a COBRA meeting to discuss the lockdown, Downing Street basically confirmed the UK government agrees with Ms Sturgeon.  Why isnapost the extension being announced properly today  Because the government wants to wait to see how well the restrictions are working at reducing cases. A formal announcement will be made on or before April , based on scientic evidence. Whoaposll make the decision  Technically itaposs made by Health Secretary Matt Hancock but itaposll be overseen by Boris Johnsonaposs stand-in, Dominic Raab. Not the PM, whoaposs in intensive care. Downing Street said: The Prime Minister is not working. I think weaposre very clear on that. And he has asked the First Secretary of State to deputise for him. It will be the First Secretary of State who leads the COBRA meeting [on Thursday] and the First Secretary of State who will lead any cabinet decision making process.  So can I go out for a picnic this Easter weekend then  No, absolutely not. Yes, the lockdown is being reviewed, but that absolutely does not mean it has stopped. You may only go outside your home with a reasonable excuse - just like any other day under lockdown. When will the lockdown end  We donapost know. But it will only be lted when the UK is well over the peak of new Covid- cases per day, and thataposs not any time soon. Ministers had hoped the peak would be Easter Sunday but estimates now put it at least a week or two later. Even then, cases have to drastically dwindle too. Otherwise thereaposll just be a second outbreak. The UK government has also repeatedly refused to say what its aposexitapos strategy is. Until we get a vaccine next year, itaposs quite possible they just donapost know yet. Officials havenapost ruled out a partial end to the lockdown, where some people can go outside earlier than others. Or restrictions being lted for a few weeks, then reimposed.  Are even stricter restrictions on the way  Not right now, no. The government hasnapost ruled out making the rules even stricter - such as banning exercise. But No emphasised the focus is on policing the current rules more strictly, not making new ones. Boris Johnsonaposs spokesman said: I think the focus for now is ensuring that people continue to stick by the measures weaposve put in place. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden warned the government may enhance or change the lockdown, but thataposs not happening right now. No said: Weaposve always said thatthe scientic advice suggested other steps are needed weaposd be prepared to take them. But for now our focus is on ensuring the steps we already have in place are properly enforced. What does the law actually say  The lockdown is enforced through a law called the Health Protection Regulations . Importantly, it isnapost exactly the same as the government guidance. You should of course follow both, but it makes a dference to whether police can stop you going about your business. Here we go through a few common situations. Whataposs the full list of aposreasonable excusesapos for leaving my house  Reasonable excuses include, but it appears are not limited to:To obtain basic necessities, including food and medical supplies for those in the same householdor for vulnerable persons To take exercise either alone or with other members of their household To seek medical assistance To provide care or assistance to a vulnerable person, or to provide emergency assistance To donate blood To travel for the purposes of work or to provide voluntary or charitable services, where it is not reasonably possible for that person to work from home To attend a funeral of a member of the person’s household, a close family member, orneither are attending, a friend To fulfil a legal obligation, including attending court or satisfying bail conditions To access critical public services, including childcare school, social services, DWP services, victims of crime services To allow children with shared custody to move between each parentaposs house For a minister of religion, to go to their place of worship To move house where reasonably necessary To avoid injury or illness or to escape a risk of harm.When can more than two people gather in public  Exceptions to the rule are:Where all the people in the gathering are members of the same household Where the gathering is essential for work purposes To attend a funeral To facilitate a house move* To provide emergency assistance* To fulfil a legal obligation* To provide care to a vulnerable person** Where reasonably necessary. Can police fine meI exercise twice in one day  No. Government guidance is clear - you should only exercise once a day. You should follow this advice. But the law itself doesnapost specy how many times you can go out. It just says you may take exerciseyou need to. Meanwhile, guidance has been updated to let people with a medical need go out multiple times a day, for instance people with learning disabilities or autism.  Can police stop me sitting in the park  Yes,you canapost provide a reasonable excuse. You wonapost be surprised to hear the list of possible reasonable excuses does not include sitting, having a picnic or sunbathing - evenyouaposre doing it with proper social distancing. Police have of course been asked to show discretion, and there are exceptions in the rules for people with a medical need. Can police go through my shopping  The law isnapost % clear - but the Home Secretary has said itaposs not appropriate. It comes after a police force threatened to go through peopleaposs bags to check for non-essential items. After an outcry, Northamptonshire Police later claried: We absolutely will NOT be searching peopleaposs shopping trolleys in Northamptonshire.Home Secretary Priti Patel later said this is not appropriate and branded it heavy-handed. So thataposs all good. But what does the law say  The law says you can go out to buy basic necessities, including food and medical supplies. So you might interpret that asyou start buying non-essential items, youaposre breaking the law. But the government also says open shops donapost have to pull all their non-essential items from stock. So Sainsburyaposs can carry on selling, say, kidsapos toys and paddling pools - and thereaposs nothing to stop you buying them. Shops that are still open are free to sell any items that they have in stock, Downing Street told us. Yet Downing Street also told us: When we ask the police to carry out enforcement of any rules we give them discretion on how to do that. Thataposs the nature of policing in the UK. They have set out in guidance to officers that they should engage, explain, encourage and then finally enforce.

So far the Government has failed to explain how the restrictions will be wound down. People understand the exact timetable will depend on how well social distancing works. The Government’s scientic advisers say that while the initial data is promising, it is too early to say for certain how effective it is. As a result, it is almost certain the lockdown will continue well beyond the Easter weekend. Parents want to know when children will be able toto school. Firms want guidance on how long they will have to remain closed and furlough staff. Families want to visit relatives again. The lockdown is only bearablepeople can see light at the end of the tunnel.

Professor David Heymann, a leading expert on infection outbreak control, said it is not possible to predict the destiny of a new infection. He said it is not viable yet to tell whether the new coronavirus will become endemic - or regularly found in society - like seasonal flu or HIV. The new coronavirus outbreak is on trajectory to continue transmitting for a time but it unclear whether it will be long term, he said. But he warned it may be that it canapost be eliminated as it is now. Do you have a coronavirus story  Email webnews@mirror Citing the situation in China, Prof Heymann, who led the global shutdown of the Sars outbreak in , said that despite severe lockdown measures the virus has not been eliminated. Despite their extreme measures they still have a little bit about - I think they had nine cases in one day recently, whereas in imported cases theyaposve had over  or  a day of cases being imported in Chinese coming back, etc, he told an online briefing with the think tank Chatham House. So, it would be nicethis could be eliminated. But it looks like - and weaposre watching very closely, whataposs happening in China - it looks like it hasnapost been eliminated from China.  If thataposs the case, under these severe lockdown measures, then it may be that it canapost be eliminated as it is now. We canapost really predict the destiny of a new and emerging infection. At present, we can only say that itaposs in populations now, and that it looks like itaposs on a trajectory to continue transmitting for a time, but we just donapost know what will happen in the long-term. We know that some influenza viruses enter human populations and transmit quite signicantly. And then they disappear. So you know itaposs not really clear that this virus will become endemic, as did HIV has some seasonal influenza.  But you know, every day, the chances are more and more that it may at least linger longer than we hope, and it may linger for a longer period and it may, as [some] predict, may linger indefinitely, but I canapost say that because I donapost have any evidence yet that that would occur. We have to just wait and see and do our best to control it. He was also asked about  patients in South Korea who had Covid-, tested negative for the virus after their recovery, and three weeks later tested as positive. Prof Heymann, who works for the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said scientists are working to determine whether these tests show reinfection, or recrudescence, or re-occurrence of the virus. To do that, theyaposre looking at the virus under a genetic sequencing analysis, to seethe virus that occurred two weeks or three weeks after PCR testing became negative in those persons is the same virus, which has reappeared which was hiding from the immune system previously, or whether that virus is a new virus, he said.

Justine Laymond has a permanently compromised immune system following her le-saving transplant back in  and has one of the worldaposs rarest lung diseases. Speaking to , the -year-old said she knows that catching Covid- would be game over for her, but she is determined to do all she can to stay safe at home. And she is calling on everyone across the UK to do their bit this weekend and asks anyone thinking of breaking the lockdown to simply not do it. She said: The sun may be shining outside - but darkness will fall on others who may die,not yourself. This is not a movie, itaposs reality. Have you got a coronavirus story  Email webnews@mirror Justine was just hours from dying back in July  when she fought back from being in a three-week coma, spending weeks on le support and  lung collapses to be well enough to be put on the transplant list. Her le was eventually saved when she received the healthy lungs of a -year-old man, and she was given another chance at le. But Justine, who is currently furloughed from her part time job at Hyundai in Chelmsford, admits she is frightened for her health once again. But after spending two days crying over what the deadly virus could mean for her, Justine picked herself up and decided to fight for her le - by staying safe and self-isolating. She said: Iaposm so frightened. Iaposm not going out to exercise every day. I need to keep my fitness up so my lungs stay healthy. But I knowI do get it, I will die. I would fight for my leI did get it, but I know it will kill me. Justine, from Rayleigh, Essex added: Iaposve got my wishes written out. If we have to call an ambulance, Iaposve got a list of people to call to say goodbye to. Iaposve got an emergency bag packed. I knowI get this I will die, thataposs the reality.  Justine, who is self-isolating with partner Tom Hipperson, was left in shock when she was not included in the Governmentaposs list of .milllion people most at risk from the virus. Despite being a transplantee, permanently immuno-compromised and having serious underlying health conditions, she did not get a text to say she would have help getting the vital medicines she takes each day, or have any way of getting food. After numerous calls to her GP and hospital, she was eventually told her medical records were not accurate and her medical code needed amending so she could be included on the high risk list.  And now she is back to her positive self, doing fitness classes at home and keeping up her hobbies as a drag queen, where she has a large online presence, and keeping busy with cos-play make up and art. She said: I know Iaposm in lockdown for  weeks, so you just have to change your mindset.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor more information on how we use your data and your data protection rights.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailA former World Health ­Organisation executive has revealed his four-step strategy to ease Britain out of coronavirus lockdown. Professor Karol Sikora said the first step would be to let small businesses with fewer than  staff open again on April . All schools should be allowed to reopen and social distancing measures should be eased on May , the ex-director of the UN bodyaposs cancer unit argued. Offices, bars and restaurants should be able to open their doors again on May , Prof Sikora, a former member of the Department of Healthaposs Expert Advisory Group on cancer, said. The final step ministers should take is easing restrictions on international travel and mass gatherings on June . The professor said: With more testing, no mutation of the virus and compliance with the rules I think this is a feasible timetable. He added: The lockdown is working - we are flattening the curve. But we need to see an exit strategy. With more testing, no mutation of the virus and compliance with the rules I think this is a feasible timetable. During this crisis I have remained an optimist- letaposs hope Iaposm right.  He said that his timeline was contingent on the virus peaking this weekend and people following the Governmentaposs rules.As ministers came under pressure to tell parents whether their children canto the classroom, Robert Halfon said he was worried some kids will be left behind because of the ongoing coronavirus lockdown.Health chiefs insist it is “premature” to say when the restrictions will be lted and they are likely to extend beyond next week.Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced the review of the ­lockdown will go ahead around Monday, more than three weeks after it was imposed, but refused to put a time on when an exit strategy will start. It is all but certain that schools will not be opening after the Easter break. But heads and MPs have said that, while it would be unsafe toin coming weeks, they would hope to be able to open fully before the end of the summer term in July.As the number of UK deaths rose by  to ,, Mr Halfon – chair of the Education Select Committee – said: “Obviously I want schools to open as soon as possible because I’m really worried about what’s going to happen toleft-behind kids. If they’re stuck at home they’re potentially going to suffer enormously.“Education is the most important thing we can give to children and young people and it’s vital that schools open as soon as the science allows. It has to be a number one priority for the Government.”  Mr Halfon spoke after review from University College London last week cast doubt on the effectiveness of school closures in halting the disease. But unions have stressed the safety of teachers, pupils and the community – must come first. Chris Keates, acting general secretary of the NASUWT, said: “Everyone is anxious toto normality as soon as possible, but decisions to either strengthen or loosen the current restrictions must always be governed by the medical and scientic evidence. Political or business considerations must never be allowed to override the safety of pupils, school staff and the wider community.” Whitehall sources insisted no date had been set to reopen schools in England, and that a date would only emerge once scientic advice concluded it was safe for them to do so. Mr Sunak said: “We committed there would be a review in and around three weeks, that review will be based on the evidence and data, which will only be ­available next week. I think rather than speculate about the future, I think we should focus ­seriously on the here and now.”The authorities face more immediate concerns over the four-day Easter weekend, with the expected warm weather prompting fears that parks and beaches will again be packed.Experts say any easing of social distancing measures relies on widespread testing - which Britain has fallen woefully behind on. Ministers are reportedly preparing to issue a plea to UK industry to build a home antibody test that would help exit the lockdown. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has promised , daily tests by the end of the month so that all stretched NHS staff who are self-isolating can be checked for the virus. The Department of Health said that a new testing laboratory set up by ­AstraZeneca, GSK and Cambridge University would aim to carry out , tests a day by May. It could take weeks before the ­slowdown in infections turns into a fall in daily deaths.

Jason Powner, , has been busy putting together food parcels to deliver to the elderly self-isolating due to Covid-. He uses his tattoo parlour, called SkinJase, as a hub to prepare parcels and as a drop-off point for donations, reports Stoke-on-Trent Live. But environmental officers from Stoke-on-Trent City Council yesterday carried out a spotcheck after receiving a tip-off the tattooist was still working. Do you have a coronavirus story to share  Email webnews@mirror  In a scathing post on Facebook, Jason, of Burslem, Stoke-on-Trent, described the tell-tale as a neanderthal. I just had a call from the Environmental Health and a visit from suits and clip board, the charity champion wrote. They said aposwe have received a couple of complaints from very worried members of the public that your still openapos. I replied that aposYes, thataposs right we are openapos. They then said aposOh can you tell me how your tattooing from the safe two-metre distance. I told them aposYes, of course I use a broom stick with f***ing duck tape at the end of it, not the best tattoos Iaposve done but gets me through these rough timesapos. I then went on and said aposI have a question for you, Iaposve been out of work like most for three weeks and still have not received a f***ing penny from the state after you closed us all down apos. I told them to aposPlease Google the name SkinjJase and youaposll find out why Iaposm openapos. I added aposnow please remove yourself from my studio and please tell the certain member of the public he sheaposs a neanderthalapos.  SkinJase is one of  businesses in Stoke-on-Trent which have been visited to censure they are complying with new legislation in the wake of the pandemic. In  instances, environmental health officers issued advice. But Jason, who has spent a decade helping families and charities across the city including raising hundreds of thousands of pounds for worthy causes, struggling families and poorly children, feels the council has been overzealous. He said: Apparently they received a complaint and it wouldnapost surprise meit was malicious. I know the council is just doing its job but Iaposm well-known for what I do in the community. If theyaposd just done a little bit of research and typed the name SkinJase into Google they would have saved themselves a trip. The coronavirus lockdown is a worrying time for millions across the UK. But itaposs also bringing out the best in people who are selflessly giving their time each day to help those most in need. Our Mirror Coronavirus Heroes series wants to recognise all of those helping the most vulnerable during the crisis. Whether itaposs a local business going the extra mile for the community or a teenager helping an elderly neighbour, we want to hear about it. You can email your stories of Mirror Coronavirus Heroes to webnews@mirror. I just wanted to get the word out that Iaposm not open for tattoos. Iaposve been doing the food bank now for six or seven years but since we went into lockdown, the workload has quadrupled.

To mark Maundy Thursday, which commemorates the Last Supper, Jesusaposs final meal with his  disciples before he was killed, the Monarch hands out coins in a tradition that dates back to the th Century. Every year, the Queen attends a church service in Windsor and hands coins to senior citizens selected in recognition of the service they have given to the church and their local area. But despite the service being cancelled this year, she was determined that people would not miss out so has sent the pensioners a personal note and a minted coin the thank them for their hard work. The letter reads: I have great pleasure in sending you the Maundy Gt, which, unfortunately, I am unable to distribute to you personally at the Royal Maundy Service in St Georgeaposs Chapel, Windsor Castle, on Thursday, th April. This ancient Christian ceremony which reflects Jesusaposs instruction to his Disciples to love one another, is a call to the service of others, something that has been at the centre of my le. I believe it is a call to service for all of us.  It is one of my most rewarding duties as Sovereign to observe this highly signicant ceremony at such an important point in the Christian calendar. I know that you, as a Recipient of this yearaposs Maundy gt, will be as deeply disappointed as I am that it is not going ahead, while understanding the necessary decision in the current circumstances. However this shoud not mean your invaluable contribution within the community goes unnoticed, and I am sending this Maundy Gt to thank you for your Christian service. My thoughts and prayers are with you and your families at this dficult time. With my best wishes to you this Easter. The note is hand signed with Elizabeth R. Retired teacher Jane Armstrong was one of the pensioners to be sent her Maundy Money through the post after volunteering more than  years at her local church.  Jane, , of Bishop Auckland, County Durham, has run youth clubs, crisis support groups and food banks, at Woodhouse Close Church, sincethe late s. The Maundy Thursday service at Windsor would have been the third time she met the Queen. Her package from the Queen contained a £ coin commemorating William Wordsworth in a red pouch, a p coin for the  Olympics in a silver pouch. The  specially-minted silver pennies were in a white pouch. The married mum-of-two and grandmother-of-one said: “In the letter she expressed her sadness that it couldn’t go ahead. “I understand that she has never missed a service and that Maundy Thursday is very important to her as she has strong Christiancommitments.  “I think she is quite sad about it. It was way before Christmas I had the invitation. “I was surprised but itaposs quite an honour. I’m very committed to my work at the church and I felt it was important. I think it was for thework I do at the church. “All my le I’ve worked at the church. We are very involved in the community. “It’s been a privilege to be part of that. I’m still in and out every day even at my age. “We are still working during coronavirus and the food bank is open every day. “It would have been the third time I had met the Queen after I received my MBE in  and later a ceremony with the Queen for theChurch Urban Fund.

While one might have thought strict social distancing measures would hurt the practice - which typically involves young women exchanging sexual acts with wealthy older men for money - the industry is booming. Seeking Attraction, the self-titled aposworldaposs largest sugar dating siteapos, has self-reported a % increase in sign-ups in the UK in the two weeks after the lockdown began compared to last year. Do you have a coronavirus story  Email webnews@mirror For Sherene, who studies history of art at the University of York, this has translated into a huge jump in the number of men wanting to indulge in illicit Skype sessions with her. With families stuck at home under penalty of arrestthey donapost have a valid excuse for leaving, men are playing a dangerous game when it comes to speaking to the -year-old. It’s a fun little secret for the married boys and the single dudes just like sending stuff and seeing you in something they picked, Sherene, who is inundated with lingerie sets by her admirers, told . I have one client, he’s a QC, and he’s with his we and older kids and we sext all the time. He says he’s addicted to buying me stuff and seeing me in it. His we thinks he’s on important client calls when he calls me during the day. Like, he literally cannot stop. It’s awesome. Another of her sugar daddies, a CEO called John, has been a trusty source of income since Sherene started as a sugar baby in August last year. On their first date they enjoyed a meal together, visited York Gallery and took a drive in the countryside. Infor a £,-a-month retainer and regular gts, Sherene would chat to John about his family, take trips to the cityaposs famous Minster and engage in oral sex with him. He talked a lot about his we which was really boring, and his work, which was also very boring, Sherene explained. Heaposs a bit patronising. We kissed a lot. I have my limit which is intercourse itself. We get to almost third base. I donapost think his we knows about me. Since the lockdown began Sherene and John have had to move their relationship online.He canapost video call as much because heaposs at home with his family so we have to talk at really awkward hours of the morning, she said. John is totally into it. He tells me that it puts him on edge. Itaposs a little bit of drama and trouble. Sometimes he leaves the door open and says aposmy we could come in.apos Sherene, whose boyfriend away from sugar dating is studying for a PHD, is clearly the exception and not the rule. Not only has her monthly income recently increased from £, to £,, she is incredibly open about what sheaposs doing and honest when it comes to its issues. Maybe I could say the biggest drawbacks are judgement from the oldies and also feeling a little greedy, she said. It’s like gambling and not knowing when to stop. It’s an addictive lestyle for sure.  I’m not saying this because it’s so amazing you’ll get addicted, it’s addictive because everyone that’s in it gets hooked. While she is one of the few women who is open about her sugar dating, many are involved in secret. Seeking Arrangement claims to have million members worldwide, two million of which are sugar babies in the UK. They are typically vying for , UK-based sugar daddies on the site, while , male sugar babies compete for the same men, as well as , sugar mothers. Sugar babying is big business in UK universities, with the University of London boasting the most members -  - in the country. Portsmouth, Salford, Kent and Leeds make up the rest of the top five universities in terms of sugar infants. According to Seeking Arrangementaposs spokeswoman Kimberley De La Cruz, the average active female sugar baby makes £, a month.  Another website which has seen a surge in members since Brits were condemned to the indoors is Next Dating. It claims to have seen male sign-ups grow by % in recent weeks, with a % increase in female members. One long time member is Lola [not her real name], a -year-old who lives in Mayfair. Her introduction to sugar dating came at  when a wealthy businessman took her for drinks at the Dorchester. He drove the Ferrari model she had wanted when she was a child and took her on a helicopter tour of the capital. Lola has since forged relationships with men who send her gts and pay her retainers stretching into the thousands of pounds per month. Unlike Sherene, Lolaaposs sugar babying has been negatively impacted by social isolation measures. I have three guys who I talk to regularly, she told .   But thereaposs zero gts at the moment because theyaposre not here. When you have aarrangement itaposs not contingent on how often I see them, butdefinitely declined. One of the men is married, one is in a serious relationship. You know that you donapost text them on the weekend when theyaposre with their family. At the moment every dayaposs a weekend day. You stay up until am until they manage to get to the office to talk. In what she self-knowingly describes as her illustrious career, Lola has twice been contacted by the troubled spouses of her sugar fathers. I have got that woman-to-woman long paragraph text message about how awful the whole situation is, she said. One time it was on the telephone. I know a lot of women who have been in that situation, you are sympathetic, but I think itaposs a conversation they should have with their husband. The arrangement is a symptom not the cause. I have never in my le been involved with the boyfriend or a husband of a friend.  Asked whether she would recommend sugar dating to others, Lola - who attended a private school and describes herself as upper-middle class - is hesitant. She said: I know a few people that love it, but Iaposve seen it be very detrimental to a lot of girls. Iaposm very pragmatic about it. If you understand the situation, and arenapost naive, itaposs fun and relatively safe and doesnapost hurt anyone. As for her future, Lola says she will give up sugar dating when sheaposs in a relationship that leads to marriage when he will take over the finances. Although her father does not know about her sugar dating, her mum is supportive. She took it really well when I told her, Lola said. She said it makes sense with your personality, considering where you are with your career and what you want financially. The burning question that hangs over the industry and the heads of some of the sugar children and parents is whether it is sex work.

And it will largely result in warm temperatures and glorious sunshine for most of the UK, asdetails in our area-by-area breakdown. Southwest Forecasters say temperatures will be in the Cs across most of the southwest of England, including Devon and Cornwall.

There is mixed guidance over whether wearing a face mask prevents a person contracting the virus - with the World Health Organization this week saying other measures should also be adopted to prevent exposure. But the CDC is still advising the use of simple cloth face coverings to slow the spread of the virus and help people who may have the disease, and do not know it, from transmitting it to others.The cloth face coverings recommended are not surgical masks or N- respirators, as it adds, these are critical supplies that must continue to be reserved for healthcare workers and other medical first responders. See the images below for a step by step guide on making a mask.Follow the latest coronavirus updates in our live blogThe CDC also advises that when wearing a cloth mask, they should:fit snugly but comfortably against the side of the face be secured with ties or ear loops include multiple layers of fabric allow for breathing without restriction be able to be put in washing machine without damage or change to shape  The World Health Organizationadds that you should wear a maskyou are coughing and sneezing. It also states that masks are effective only when used in combination with frequent hand-cleaning with alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water. WHOaposs guidelines say:If you wear a mask, then you must know how to use it and dispose of it properly.  Before putting on a mask, clean hands with alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water Place the mask carefully, ensuring it covers the mouth and nose, and tie it securely to minimize any gaps between the face and the mask. Avoid touching the mask while wearing it. Remove the mask using the appropriate technique: do not touch the front of the mask but untie it from behind. After removal or whenever a used mask is inadvertently touched, clean hands using an alcohol-based hand rub or soap and waterhands are visibly dirty. Replace masks as soon as they become damp with a new clean, dry mask. Do not re-use single-use masks. Discard single-use masks after each use and dispose of them immediately upon removal.It advises these other measures to prevent contracting coronavirus: Wash your hands frequently Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Why  Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.Maintain social distancing Maintain at least  metredistance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing. Why   When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the Covid- virusthe person coughing has the disease.Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth Why   Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.Practice respiratory hygiene Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately. Why   Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-.If you have fever, cough and dficulty breathing, seek medical care early Stay homeyou feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and dficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.

It would be our intention,the season is brought to an early conclusion, where practical, to reimburse those season ticket holders for the remainder of the season that was not played.  This will be further assessed for timelines, etc., as we make our way through the claims process. We have often said that the club is a family and that remains true throughout this situation.In addition to our insurance coverage, we have also sought to access ious sources of support offered by the League, the Association, Government agencies and our associates.  All that have been involved have been extremely helpful in our solidication of the club as a business.  I would like to personally thank John Bennett for his very generous and selfless gesture of suspending rent on the stadium.

They have been working in an ever-changing landscape throughout this unprecedented event. They have continued to keep us informed and provide us advice on how to best navigate this predicament. They have freely shared the advice and guidance they are receiving from the government and UEFA as we all feel our way through these weeks. We continue to take advice and express our opinions on what football should look like when football resumes. Although none of us know yet what will transpire with this season, it is clear that football will be back.We’ve been inundated with requests on how people can help the club.  It’s truly been heart-warming. The one way to helpyou can – and onlyyou can # is to purchase season tickets and merchandise online.  We still have limited availability of this year’s Third Strip, which may become a collector’s item as it may never be worn.This supports the club as well as SSAFA and The Black Watch Association charities.  We will soon be launching our - kit in the upcoming days and we know it’s not enough to completely fill your appetite for football, but keep an eye on the social media sites for Dundee FC and DFC in the Community, which will provide some entertainment while we all do our part to save lives by staying home.We wish we had something more definitive to say, but we hope this brief update will provide some reassurance that we are still here and will remain here when this crisis is over.

allow the Premiership campaign to be played to a finish this season.SPFL clubs are set to vote on a resolution to terminate the Championship, League One and League Two due to the ongoing Covid- crisis.A % majority is needed to vote through the proposal which would see Dundee United , Raith Roversand Cove Rangersnamed champions.A decision on the outcome of the top flight has been delayed to give the best possible opportunity for the remaining Premiership games to be played.However,the SPFL board determine that the remaining Premiership matches cannot be played, the top flight season would also be terminated, with points per game dictating final placings.When Scottish football went into shutdown due to the coronavirus pandemic on March , Aberdeen were fourth in the Premiership table.They trailed Motherwell by a single point in the race for third and automatic qualication to the Europa League pre-qualying rounds next season.McInnes wants the opportunity to finish the campaign, but accepts that could be dficult.He said: “We would like the opportunity to play the season out. If there is a way to do that I believe that is what everyone around the table would probably want.“It is whether we are going to get the opportunity to do that or not. Whether it is going to be possible remains to be seen.“It seems that with each passing week that is something which seems less likely to happen.“For all the clubs, whether it is Celtic or Dundee United, they will want to win the title properly.“Rangers will want to try to stop Celtic doing that.“Ourselves, Motherwell and other clubs are still fighting it out for European spots.“At the bottom end of the table it is also crucial.”Following an emergency meeting, the SPFL moved to table the resolution to their member clubs in light of the cabinet secretary for health announcing on March  NHS Scotland had been put on an emergency footing for at least  weeks until June .The SPFL also took into consideration the Scottish Government’s public advice that expectations are that restrictions could remain in place for at least  weeks.Their conclusion was the remaining fixtures in the three lower leagues and related play-off competitions cannot be scheduled without signicantly damaging the SPFL’s ability to start and complete, on time, the   league season and Betfred Cup.It is understood the deadline for votes is pm tomorrow with an announcement expected early next week on the outcome.McInnes said: “I think everyone would want the chance to play the season out and finish it properly. But whatever decisions are reached it is clearly going to upset some and not be favourable on all teams.”If voted through, the resolution would also confirm the relegation of Partick Thistle and Stranraer.There will also be no play-offs and the pyramid structure for promotion to the seniors would be scrapped this year.Should plans be approved the SPFL will consult with teams on reconfiguring the leagues for next season.SPFL chief executive Neil Doncaster admitted the situation with the Premiership is “particularly complicated” – especially as UEFA recently threatened to strip European spots from any nation ending their season early. Belgium recently ended their campaign.Doncaster confirmed the SPFL are keen to work with UEFA and remain in discussion with Europe’s governing body regarding the situation in Scotland.McInnes said: “Hopefully we can have the opportunity to make sure we can still finish third and win a cup.“However, there is no doubt this is going to impact on all clubs in some shape or form.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2020/04/A64E600D-4D79-47C1-8B10-2526DFBB6FC1.jpg ","title":"aberdeens 1970 scottish cup winning squad where are they now","story":"Saturday marks  years to the day since Eddie Turnbull#s Aberdeen travelled to Hampden and won the Scottish Cup for the second time in the club#s history.To do so, the Reds overcame Celtic -.

As we stood about on deck while the dishes were being washed a boy from one of the motor boats passed in his dinghy. He was wearing blue shorts and red stockings which brought from the Pilot the remark: #In Brodickyou don’t wear red stockings you might just as well be in Lamlash.#All but the Skipper and Mate went ashore on Centre Island for a stroll. The Major was still completely paralysed in his hind quarters but he was full of spirit and when the Bosun held up his hind legshe galloped along. It was a quiet peaceful evening with a very light northerly breeze but it was distinctly chilly and there was a magnicentsomewhat lurid sunset. The shore party back aboard the Bosun took the Tar off in the dinghy and they landed on Eilean na Beithe and while the former explored the island the latter played on a shingly shore – it was long after dark when they ed.At half past ten we began to turn in and, as always on the first evening, this was a longer business then usual as pillows and blankets had to be allocated and pillowslips put on but by a quarter past eleven we were all in bed and shortly after that a light shower pattered on the deck. The problem of what to do with the Doctor’s mattress was solved by the Pilot double banking his bunk. We were all very glad to have had such a good day for the start.It was noticed that voices were still coming from the ladies’ cabin when the last of us in the main cabin fell asleep.The Tanky brought an innovation to the Fulmar # #Quickies# # a patent washing gadget that saved precious water.We had a dead quiet night with, as far as any of us knew, no rain but the forecast was not good, promising north to north-east winds, force  to  with frequent heavy showers. The glass had continued its steady drop. When we turned out, a light but cold north wind was blowing from a well broken up sky.We had a breakfast of bacon and eggs then the Bosun took the Major ashore for his walk. The latter was possibly a little better and was able to take a few steps on the deck, but ashore on the rough ground could do nothing. While they were ashore the big motor boat with the red-stockinged boy left after very nearly going ashore on Seil Island while getting his anchor aboard.At twenty past ten we were away under engine, but as soon as we were outside the sails went up to the north-easterly breeze and we set off for the Sound of Mull. There was no sign of the swell that is usually met south of Kerrera and we got along quite well, but we could not point any higher than a mile or so south of Loch Don. The Pilot went below and brewed a welcome cup of tea which warmed us up, then we took a tack right up to the south coast of Kerrera and had a close up view of Gylen Castle and the Skipper waxed historical.Putting about again we passed close south of the Potlid Island, but when we were about halfway across to Loch Don the wind died and the strong ebb began to force us south and about the same time the rain came on.The engine was started and we headed up for Duart, but our progress was pitully slow, and indeed at one period we but barely held our ground. The Lady Rock and Lismore Lighthouse seemed never to get any nearer closing. When the engine had run an hour we waited for the first sign of the old familiar falter but none came and we began to hope a cure for its stopping had been effected by replacing the HT coil.This change was a despairing effort made because it was the only thing we had not tried, though all the pundits declare it could not possibly be the cause. The engine would either go or not go, they said, and it would never startthe coil was defective. We got one scare when it staggered for a moment, but the Bosun, who was at the tiller at the time, said we had just passed though a big mass of floating seaweed and may have got some round our propeller.As we were to prove later the cure had been found and the engine ran impeccably all the cruise and the Skipper had a lot of unkind thoughts about all the many professional motor experts who had caused him a great deal of trouble, not a little acute anxiety and more than considerable expense through their failure to diagnose a not very obscure disease.As we came up to the Black Memorial Tower Leonora crossed our bows making for Oban and another yachtpassed close by south bound under engine though by this time quite a reasonable and, for then, favourable breeze was blowing from the north-east and our sails were drawing.We learnt later that the owner’s we would not allow a sail to be set under any conditions as long as she was aboard – a pity, we thought, as she certainly was a lovely job and we felt it would have been betterthe we had decided to stay ashore.At Duart we stopped the engine and were able to make good progress, but the rain got heavier and heavier and our sandwich lunch was taken below in relays. Then at about three with the turn of the tide the wind died completely and the engine was started again. Near the Grey Rocks we saw St Roma coming south under power so we altered course to intercept her then at slow speed turned back the way we had come for a few hundred yards while we exchanged news.We heard a thoroughly bad forecast at mid-day, the wind had gone, the rain was stotting in the glassy sea, and, though the glass had come back only a fraction, we decided to call it a day so, with the Bosun the only dissentient, made for Loch Aline. As we turned inshore at Ardtornish we saw Seewolf to the north of us, becalmed but heading south, and guessed she would be joining us later. Coming in, when between Morven Pier and the Ferry Pier, the Skipper held too close to the west shore and the bottom showed up suddenly far too clearly for our peace of mind and a quick sheer out was necessary.Through the narrows we turned to starboard and anchored at half past four in Kyle Bay in a flat calm and the rain coming down heavier than ever. Gratefully we realised that it was not quite as bitterly cold as it had been out in the Sound.Seewolf came in shortly after going very slowly and Hamish Lawrence called over that he had run a big end and was on his way to Oban for repairs and to hand over to brother Alec and his family. Soon after that we were joined by a small motor boat, Saguenay, flying a blue ensign which, in view of her size, the Skipper was sure she was not entitled to do and then a little later, while we were warming up with some coffee, Lindisfarne arrived and anchored close beside us with Guy Clephane in his usual tremendousform – he’s a proper marvel is Guy.Hamish Lawrence came across in his dinghy and came aboard for a gin and while he was there Guy called over inviting Tanky and the Pilot across to Lindisfarne then sent the Pilot back to Fulmar to fetch the Bosun. Hamish gone, the Skipper began to put nine inch tacklines into our line of flags as we had discovered at Rothesay at the Royal Clyde Centenary Regatta that without them our line was about fteen feet too short and we wanted them to be right for the Queen’s visit to Tobermory.When the Pilot came back he and the Bosun got the tents up as the rain was by then torrential.We had a supper of sausages and beans and while the dishes were being done the Bosun took the Major ashore. He was walking a little bettervery slowly, but there was, unfortunately, no concrete results from his exercise.At nine o’clock we went in two loads across to Seewolf and were offered drinks OR tea, but the Skipper insisted on both. We were, however, not allowed any biscuits with our tea as to have them would have meant opening a new box and broaching Alec Lawrence’s stores. The Tanky had not wanted anything but tea, but Hamish had given her a good strong gin which she tried to hide on a shelf behind her and it was only got rid of when the Pilot took it off her hands and quickly put it to its proper use. The Bosun was drinking beer and when he opened up the tin a goodly portion of it bubbled onto the fitted carpet in the cabin.On board Seewolf were, besides the two paid hands, Hamish’s mother and his two sisters. The old lady, well over eighty, was in grand form and waxed eloquent on #The old days# and the greatness of #Belshaft#. Also on board was a great big collie who was obviously petted and spoilt beyond measure and he behaved more like a lap dog than the great big clumsy creature he was.It was half past eleven before we went back to Fulmar all in one load with little enough freeboard for the dinghy considering the conditions. There was a nasty little lop on the water, the northerly wind was bitterly cold, and the rain was as heavy as ever. As quickly as possible we got below and into our warm bunks, not even the Bosun wasting any time about it, though he did read for some time after all the rest were sound asleep."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast podcast episode 10 nessie and the lost golf balls","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWelcome to Episode  of the Oban Time#s BOBcast.Charting Bob#s progress  and discussing lots of things golfare  presenters Stephen Day, George Graham, Martin Laing and Keith McIntyre.

As part of this project the fund provided MACPool with seven aqua cycles and training from Hydrorider.Arriving early to take photogaphs of the others giving these bikes a go, any sense of nervousness was set aside as I watched healthcare professionals and fitness and well-being enthusiasts laugh and chat through their shot.After some quick adjustments to the bikes June, from our advertising department, and I were raring to go.Partially submerged, the feeling of being weightless combined with the resistance of the water as we began peddling was initially a bit odd. As we got used to the feeling, we started to speed things up, pretending we were racing the rest of our group to The Cairnbaan for a gin and tonic.Finding our rhythm, instructor Kathryn Craig began to lead us through arm exercises. Our co-ordination was put to the test as we carried on cycling while doing simple arm movements that felt more impactive due to the water resistance. Then for the real challenge # floating off the back of the bike while continuing to pedal – not an easy taskyou are short-legged but a workout that feels like it is doing you the power of good.For me aqua cycling is everything I hoped it would be – a fun, impactiveand enjoyable way of exercising. And I could still walk after it!With no aches and pains the next day and still smiling, I signed up for some of the classes.Classes y in intensity and are currently running on Tuesdays from .-.pm, Wednesday evenings from .-.pm and Saturdays from  .-.am.

Included in this is the Isle of Jura.This is as shockingly reckless as it is offensive.The Isle of Jura is not a #bolthole# as the Daily Mail has chosen to state but a very beautul island steeped in culture and rich history.On both Jura and Islay we, like so many rural areas, are struggling to deal with all of the challenges related to the Corona virus out break. Our local health services have very limited resources as it is, along side a population that has many elderly residents who are more at risk to the virus.We have seen a local uptick in people traveling to Islay in camper vans and this is happening at a time when the UK government is advising against non essential travel.Those who are choosing to travel to our islands of Islay, Jura and the many other islands in Argyll and Bute in order to avoid the coronavirus may end up inadvertently spreading it to islands who arenot as much affected in the same way as so many built up urban areas are. Such actions are as reckless as they are selfish and I would implore people who do not need to travel to our rural constituency to avoid doing so until this global pandemic has passed.Jura, Islay and the rest of Argyll are some of the most beautul places you will ever visit and you won#t find an area where the people are more hospitable and friendly but while this crisis is ongoing I would ask everyone who is not currently living here to avoid traveling here for the time being.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward.To the Scottish public,During this time of unprecedented uncertainty, we are all concerned about the safety and wellbeing of our families, friends and colleagues.Our hearts go out to those who have been affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus , as well as the many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in an attempt to slow its spread.We appreciate and are mindful of the challenges iniduals are currently facing as well as the impact this pandemic has had on our vital emergency services as well as the grocery retail sector, supply chain and producers.Like our retail partners, we want to take this opportunity to assure you that Scottish farmers, auctioneers, hauliers, processors and butchers are doing everything they can to maintain the ongoing availability of fresh, locally sourced Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI and Specially Selected Pork.We would like to thank all those who work in the Scottish red meat industry and their families for their ongoing and unwavering efforts to keep our supermarket shelves and butcher shops stocked, fuelling Scotland with top-quality red meat during this challenging time.As bodies supporting the Scottish agricultural and red meat industry, we are constantly reviewing the developing situation and are doing all we can to support everyone involved in putting nutritious food on your plates.Alan Clarke, chief executive, Quality Meat ScotlandMartin Morgan, executive manager, Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers Duncan Todd, secretary, Scottish Beef Association Jen Craig, president, National Sheep Association Scotland Penny Montgomerie, chief executive, Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs and Gordon King, executive manager, Scottish Craft Butchers.What on earth is going on  It was banal enough when Ben Goldsmith # English financier and environmentalist # tweeted that #overgrazing# by upland sheep farmers, was responsible for the devastating floods in South Wales, rather than record-breaking torrential rainfall.Unbelievably we now have a government official, Dr Tim Leunig, suggesting the whole of the UK does not need farming, and his comparison of the UK to Singapore in this context is absolutely ludicrous. You truly have to wonderthere is something in the water that he is drinking – could it be flood contamination Surely, every person having a full and ing set of neurons and synapses, the complete opposite is the truth, as we dearly need our hard working farming community.The UK Government should be fully supporting the farming industry and indeed, good land management. The Welsh Assembly has totally lost its way with its mindless policy of devastating Welsh forests with thousands and thousands # an understatement # of trees being felled for wind farms, and compounding the felony by covering acres of land with very limited electricity generating solar parks # Wales is not the Sahara and the sun disappears at night! Solar  will generate about  per cent of their maximum capacity in the UK.Returning to farming perhaps some kind person should tell Dr Tim Leunig that the answer lies in the soil and then lead him to a darkened and quiet room so he can lie down and contemplate the truth # wise men recognise that truth is the daughter of time, not of authority.Dave Haskell, Cardigan."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part 10","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat a night! All of us were agreed that never had we experienced anywhere a worse one and we were glad we had been in Loch Aline on Sunday night not in Tobermory as intended as, from what we heard, that night had been similar but twice as bad.It was a wild night lashing with rain and a big swell was rolling in from the north-east causing us to pitch and roll horribly. Everything banged and rattled and the ropes, despite their lashings, slapped on the mast, the chain rugged continuously on the bobstay, and there was one most annoying thump that kept everyone awake .We could not trace its origin until in desperation the Pilot donned oilskins, sou’wester and seaboots, and went on deck and found it was the tiller end bumping on the bulwarks. The Pilot had a very justiable grouse about this as he had suggested lashing the tiller, but the Skipper had said that he did not think it necessary and that we would lie easierit was allowed to go free.About six we heard Murdoch in Venture hailing us and the Skipper and Pilot hurried on deck. The yachts in the harbour were all lying higgledy-piggledy owing to the swell, to there being little or not wind, to the strong surface current from the swollen river, and to it being about the turn of the tide.Venture and Fulmar were lying stern to stern and what had aroused Murdoch was that the Venture had got her mizzen boom over our main boom and as we pitched we had lted it up crutch and all – how nothing was broken was a miracle. She had then swung round and her now free boom had knocked the cap off our jackstay. As the Skipper came on deck Venture again surged towards us and started pitching and her counter came down with a terric slam not six inches from our bulwarks. We put our helm over and swung clear.Murdoch and Barclay were both in their dog-house and the Pilot and Skipper stayed in ours until the new tide took charge and the boats began to swing in normal fashion and all were able to retire once more to their bunks. Luckily the rain had cleared off shortly before this episode took place.At a quarter to eight we heard the usual poor forecast but for the first time since the cruise began there was not a gale warning for any area. The glass had risen well during the night. What wind there was was from the north-west.The Skipper went ashore for the milk and rolls. The dinghy had a lot of water in it and owing to the rolling it was impossible to get into it and balance on the thwarts till it was baled so the Skipper got his feet thoroughly soaked – the simple remedy of wearing seaboots had never occurred to him. Again the rolls were sold out and again he had to take porter biscuits.On board the Pilot lit the fire then started in to get our breakfast of bacon and egg. After our meal the sky cleared and it became a beautul sunny day, and everything we had was up on deck drying off or airing. The owner of Rose came alongside and for a good time tried to get us to persuade him to go north against his better judgement, but when we heard he had the lady member of his crew of three sick in her bunk our advice was that he go south and that immediately and reluctantly he was forced to agree and half an hour later he sailed. Hervor also went out about the same time and she turned north and we were to meet her later in Iona."},{"url":null,"title":"worldwide ceilidh community sign up for tunes in the hoose","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCapercaillie founder Martin MacLeod, originally from Oban, and his son, also Martin, have came up with an innovative way to connect musicians from all over the world and allow them to play together for the enjoyment of others.#Tunes in the Hoose# was inspired by Scottish musician, and family friend of the MacLeods, Peter Wood, who was posting videos of himself playing tunes in his home during self-isolation.Having saw the footage Martin senior, called his filmmaker son to askhe had the technology and know-how to put a video together of him playing along to Peter’s video.#I run my own production company based out of Glasgow, so it’s relatively straight forward work for me ,# said Martin Junior.#From that first successful attempt, our new idea was to create an online community for all Scottish musicians to help them connect and continue to play together during these uncertain times.#Housed in Facebook, Tunes in the Hoose amassed over  followers last week with ,+ views worldwide.

Almost nobody has been untouched by it, although for some it has been more cataclysmic than others. But we are in this together, and it will be together that we pull through it.One of the real heartbreaking consequences of the lockdown has been the separation of families. Many grandparents now cannot see their grandchildren, or even their own children. Family of people who are ill cannot visit their loved ones. Each story has its own set of circumstances and sadly more is to come before it gets better.While we do need light-heartedness at this time, itrsquos also really important to acknowledge peoplersquos struggles. It was with gut-wrenching despair I realised a number of weeks ago that the arrival of Covid- in Europe was going to seriously affect so many families, my own included.I have five children, but my middle child, who is now  years old, has for the last eight years shared time between Scotland and Sweden.She went to school here until she was seven, when she began to attend school in Sweden. It was then that I had to adjust to the painful reality of less time with her, although I was still able to maintain regular time with her in Scotland and of course keep in daily touch.Itrsquos been an emotional rollercoaster, in which I have stories of me sleeping at airports, travelling through Scandinavian landscape at ungodly hours, and along the way meeting people who have helped and made a real dference. But itrsquos been worth it as it meant our blended family remained connected and my daughter hasnrsquot felt ided between two families but rather a full part of both.We were due to travel to Sweden this Friday andlater, but of course the flights were cancelled a couple of weeks ago. Explaining this to my daughter, and then not being able to say when we would be together was heartbreaking. I felt so helpless, unable to comfort her. Wersquod all counted down the days and now it seems it may be weeks, even months, before any reunion will be possible.I know that there will be families in similar or worse situations. My heart goes out to them all. My initial response to my situation was to close down with despair. The idea of not being with my child, for whom I was the equal main carer until recently, feels unbearable. Some friends have said, with good intentions: ldquoAt least shersquos safe.Yes she is, and I give thanks for that. But any loving parent facing long-term enforced separation from their child will understand the grief that such separation creates. It seeps into your being and makes it dficult to get through the day without having really dark moments. I tried to hide my emotions, but my loving and understanding we knows me too well yet she too felt helpless.There are moments in our lives when we are just overwhelmed by the impossibility of a situation and we just want to curl up and close down. I recently reached that point.Then my daughter asked me while we were talking online: ldquoI wish we could get a magic flying carpet or something dad, or ask the faeries to make a portal. She understood this wasnrsquot possible, but it was the wake-up call I needed. It made me realise I needed to get out of the pit of despair and, for her sake as well as mine, use my creativity to make that magic carpet, and that portal, to help us stay closely connected during this awful time.And the magic ingredient is stories. My daughter has always loved stories, and we have made many up together some of them have even been printed on this page. Now these stories help keep us connected and ease the pain of separation for us both.And so, with the help of technology, and, crucially, a good relationship with her mother, stories have begun to create a vital space for my daughter to be with her Scottish family, even when separated. We can all be together, even my grown-up daughters, who I miss even though they are isolating close by.We storytell to each other, make stories up and even share them in short films. Wee sister Skye, who is six and misses her sister like crazy, holds the tablet which she uses to speak to her, so they can be together while I tell stories and share riddles. We draw and add to the stories together, make fun dramas in which we film ourselves on phones acting out stories like Cinderella, and I have learnt to put wee films together which we can then watch together.Sharing stories like this has given extra meaning to our online communication. It takes us away from just asking ldquohow was your day  or ldquowhat did you do today  questions that often just seem to emphasise our current disconnection.

At a crucial time in the survival of the language, graduates have helped create a Gaelic speaking workforce that now holds key posts across a wide range of sectors in Scotland.Sabhal Mograver Ostaig is one of the key partners in fulfilling the governmentrsquos objectives in the National Gaelic Plan, which aims to increase the number of people speaking the language and accelerate the growth of Gaelic.Many people are keen to learn more about the language because of its rich culture and the college provides a wide range of short courses in Gaelic language, song and traditional music. Ceilidhs, workshops, conversation circles and music sessions all create an encouraging atmosphere that bring together students from  countries across five continents.As a modern, innovative college, Sabhal Mograver Ostaig has excellent learning resources on campus including an exceptional library collection, residential student accommodation, broadcast and recording facilities and a Gaelic medium childcare facility on site. It also has a growing international reputation for academic research.The college was founded on the principle of being part of the local and wider community and its activities are greatly enhanced by co-operative links, being home to a number of signicant national creative and cultural projects such as Tobar an Dualchais, Ainmean Agraveite na h-Alba and Cagravenan Graphics Studio. It plays a leading role in the promotion of the Gaelic arts and culture and also offers an international exchange programme with universities in Canada and Ireland.The collegersquos graduates include Seumas Greumach , Chief Executive of An Comunn Gaidhealach, which runs the Royal National Mod, who studied the Cugraversa Comais in  and then ed for another year to study Cagravenan is Cultar na Gagraveidhlig.

It is one of the many canards which have debased social media in this crisis and turned Twitter into a pariah medium.What he told Philip Schofield on This Morning on March  was that ldquoone of the theories is that people should ldquotake it on the chin and not take measures to prevent the spread of the disease. He went on to say that this was not the Governmentrsquos policy, and that it was pursuing a ldquobalanced approach and taking measures to ldquoprotect the NHS.But that hasnrsquot stopped people saying it for him. It has become a political factoid, an article of faith that Mr Johnson, under the guidance of his dark amanuensis Dominic Cummings, has been pursuing a social Darwinist, survival-of-the-fittest approach to Covid-.Enough. Everyone with any decency should simply be wishing the Prime Minister and his pregnant partner, Carrie Symonds, well right now, following the lead of Nicola Sturgeon yesterday when she echoed the Get Well, Boris slogan.It could be any one of us in the next few weeks. This is a moment to reflect on the fragility of existence and the gt of being alive. For once, we really are all in this together.The only grain of truth in the ldquochin theory is that, as is widely known, Mr Johnson has tended to see illness as something other people get. He has famously robust good health and former advisers, like the journalist Guto Harri, say theyrsquove never seen him ill before.All the more reason to take this disease seriously. It doesnrsquot just kill the very old or those with medical issues. Even a fit, tennis-playing political leader in his prime has had to be placed in intensive care fighting for his le.This is not like a bad dose of flu, as President Trump unhelpfully suggested. Covid- mocks us because many carriers have mild symptoms or none at all. Then, after  days,the symptoms donrsquot go away it turns very nasty.There is so much we do not know about coronavirus. What we do know is that it is gendered ndash though not in the way we expect that word to be used. It seems to hit men very hard, and twice as many die of it. Women seem to have some form of genetic immunity.Either that or men just ldquodonrsquot look after themselves as some believe. That might actually be the case with Mr Johnson, since hersquos been under immense pressure over the past year: replacing Theresa May, renegotiating Brexit, then fighting a General Election.So, no one should be under any illusion that hersquoll be able tonormally any time soon. This raises dficult questions. Who in his Cabinet will have the authority to tell him that he canrsquot be allowed to take key decisions while his faculties are impaired Who exactly is in charge  The First Secretary, Dominic Raab, is formally chairing Cabinet committees. But that begs the question of who takes the final decisions. Where does the buck stop Someone has to balance the competing demands of the two front-line Cabinet ministers, Matt Hancock and Rishi Sunak. They have very dferent constituencies of interests. Mr Hancock is all about saving the NHS and avoiding immediate deaths Mr Sunak is about saving the economy, upon which just as many lives could ultimately depend.Who decides whether and for how long to renew the lockdown on Monday  It will almost certainly be continued, but should there be a provisional timetable for lting aspects of it, following Austria and Denmark Research led by Professor Russell Viner for University College London appears to show that keeping schools closed is of little use in halting the spread of coronavirus. Yet it damages the educational prospects of less-well-off children. Others disagree, including, it seems, Professor Neil Ferguson of the celebrated Imperial College report that prompted the lockdown last month.The minor scandal of the Scottish Chief Medical Officer, Dr Catherine Calderwood, breaking her own stay-at-home guidelines underlines the problem of compliance. For the comfortable middle classes, with gardens and nice homes, lockdown is tolerable but working-class families in small flats may find it unbearable.Then again, should the UK be encouraging the wearing of masks  Countries like Austria and Slovakia have made them compulsory. America is adopting masks on the grounds that it slows the spread of the disease. But the advice here is still that theyrsquore of little use.A broader question now there is a new Labour leader, is a government of national unity. Keir Starmer has clearly ordered his new shadow cabinet members to stop saying ldquowe were right and start talking constructively about how to revive a moribund economy when the lockdown is over.The Opposition has a crucial role to play in getting the Government to focus and be clear about what it is doing. But should there be a more formal arrangement, as in the Second World War when the then Labour leader Clement Attlee, was made Deputy Prime Minister It would mean the Opposition is bound by collective responsibility, and has to endorse the decisions made by Government in the next few weeks. On the other hand it would greatly enhance the political profile of the new Labour leader, and could provide a  on which Sir Keir could build a winning election campaign, in the way Attlee won the post-war General Election in .These are decisions that only a Prime Minister can make, for the simple reason that he will be required to accept the consequences. This is a desperate time for him and the country, as the death toll continues to rise.As I write, it seems that the PMrsquos condition is stable. Twitter aside, there has been a considerable degree of public sympathy for Mr Johnson. No one can be in any doubt that he feels our pain. The Prime Minister is, as it were, the first casualty among equals.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Shops across Scotland are closing.

The wording is apparently so ldquocack-handed ndash the charityrsquos phrase ndash that recipients are misinterpreting it to mean they will not receive any medical helpthey contract the virus.This is not what the letter says, but it would be an easy mistake to make. Evenit were clear, it would still be upsetting. Signing a DNAR is almost as sure an indication that the end of the line is fast approaching as requesting the last rites. Often it is signed by those with power of attorney for elderly relatives who are no longer of sound mind. Brutal though it looks when expressed in cold print, the intention behind it is compassionate.At a certain stage of ill-health, the process of resuscitation can be harsh. It unnecessarily prolongs suffering rather than allowing someone who has suffered a cardiac arrest to slip away peacefully. In some circumstances, especially where the patient is extremely frail, resuscitation is the worst of all options. Hard though it is to accept, the prospect of death can come as a relief to some for whom there is no hope of recovery, and who are simply longing to be gone.But for many who received this bald DNAR request, that is not the case. Instead of being asked to speed up and simply medical bureaucracy, they needed reassurance that, should they fall ill with Covid , they will be treated like anyone . The only grey area is over what they wish done in the event they require resuscitation. In their thoughtless and insensitive mail-shot, doctors presumably have pre-selected those for whom they think a DNAR is in their best interests. But what a way to go about it. It brings to mind Treasure Island and the sinister Black Spot pressed into piratesrsquo hands, signying their imminent demise.Even worse is the case of a care home where some residents, who were mentally well, learned staff had signed these forms on their behalf. I would not wish to be the manager should anyonersquos otherwise robust existence end prematurely because of a legally binding instruction they knew nothing about.What all this points to is troubling. There has been much trumpeting about the ways in which communities are pulling together under lockdown, growing stronger and kinder because of the strain on those who are least able to help themselves. Despite this, however, there is an insidious undercurrent to some discussions, a faint suggestion that the aged are in danger of being perceived as a nuisance, a drain on limited resources that are better used for the young. The tenor of recent government guidelines appears to hint that when people reach a certain vintage they should expect less heroic or interventionary treatment, and accept thatthings take a turn for the worst, their time is up.When new guidance was issued to medics by the former Chief Medical Officer Catherine Calderwood last week, Dr Donald Macaskill, chief executive of Care Scotland, was perturbed at its implications: ldquoNothing in this document gives me confidence that we will not be putting our clinicians in a position where they have no option but to decide on the basis of age.Le-saving equipment and highly trained medical staff are undoubtedly in limited supply. When intensive care beds and ventilators have to be rationed, then the decision of who benefits most will have to be made. Who would envy a doctor faced with such a bleak choice But it would be a terrible indictment of our societythe exigencies of this emergency fostered the sense that old is synonymous with surplus. If the word ldquopensioner is in danger of becoming a le-threatening label the long-term legacy of this disease will be far worse than the number of fatalities. It will have buried one of the primary principles on which modern civilisation is based.The idea that iniduals automatically become obsolescent after a certain age is repugnant. So too that their worth diminishes with each year. Who has the authority or right to say that one personrsquos le is more valuable than another  The more I see of friends in their eighties and nineties, the more I understand the old joke: Who would want to live to   Someone who is .One of the reasons this pandemic is so intense is because we have long recognised the importance of seniors. Modern medical advances have been expressly designed to allow much of the population to reach and enjoy advanced age, eventhey do rattle occasionally with their daily regimen of pills.Before going to university I worked for a year as an auxiliary nurse in a small hospital, on the male and female geriatric wards. It was a revelatory experience. Some of the patients had dementia, a few were permanently bed-bound, but there was not one of them who could not find some enjoyment and pleasure each day, or who did not retain much of their personality. It was an inspirational lesson that one of the finest achievements of society is to take such loving care of those whose best years are behind them, and for whom the future is measured in months, weeks, or simply hours.It is not for the state to determine who lives and dies. Every day doctors quietly make these calls, for reasons of humanity, and we must trust their judgement. When they need to discuss matters of le and death with relatively healthy patients, however, they would do well to remember that up to the very end, we all will rage against the dying of the light, and rightly, properly so.Shops across Scotland are closing.

In short, you know exactly where you are with a doctor.This was very much the case with the former Chief Medical Officer Dr Catherine Calderwood when she helped deliver the Scottish Governments daily coronavirus updates alongside Nicola Sturgeon.Calm and assured, she rattled through the grim daily death toll with authority and when she appeared on our TV screens telling us all to stay indoors and save lives, the vast majority of us did because we didnt want to let her down or her colleagues.But then the illusion was shattered when she took a couple of weekends off with her family at their second home in the East Neuk of Fe.Worse still, she appeared to have misled the Scottish Government when she was caught by claiming she only went to check on the property, only to admit she had been there the previous weekend too.Hours later she had resigned, despite Ms Sturgeons best efforts to defend her and keep her expertise in the fold.The whole affair was a sorry saga with the only acceptable outcome reached.If she cant follow the rules then why should we  would have become a legitimate question with potentially fatal results.Hopefully the affair will not knock Nicola Sturgeon off her stride as she has been an impressive presence so far during the pandemic, as indeed have most politicians who have put bitter rivalry to one side for the greater good and long may that continue.The First Minister showed a particular touch of class when she sent her very best wishes to Boris Johnson and his family after he was admitted to intensive care after his coronavirus symptoms worsened.She added that the whole of Scotland was also willing him on as he begun his fight and she was right.

In the UK, an almost accidental referendum on EU membership with an unexpected victory for Leave another generationally signicant event. Around the world, the rise of populism and the election of Donald Trump to the US presidency, a concept which seemed ridiculous and literally unbelievable until just before it actually happened.And now, of course, abruptly, coronavirus. An unknown death toll. A feared second wave. And a global economy in the bin, with perhaps decades-long consequences for public and domestic finances, and for the way that politics and economic works.I have omitted one other item of domestic signicance the five years of Jeremy Corbyn as the leader of the Opposition. When New Labour left office in , after a -year term which, ignoring the usual party political finger pointing, was at least perfectly competent, and which contained four events of historical signicance .There was no indication, at that point, that one more election defeat would provoke the knee-jerk reaction of having Mr Corbyn as leader. It is, by any standards, historically remarkable that the country has twice been asked to make its Prime Minister a man with what can most charitably be termed a controversial relationship with terrorists in Ireland and the Middle East, and with a litany of Communists dictators both to our east and to our west.Step in Sir Keir Starmer, elected as Mr Corbynrsquos replacement at the weekend. His election, I must concede, came as a pleasant surprise to me. I had presumed that the Labour party had been changed forever filled with Corbynistas and Momentum activists and destined to choose a Corbyn disciple as its leader.But just as Mr Blairrsquos changes were shown not to be permanent, so Mr Corbynrsquos seem to have been transient. The big question now, for the Labour party and for the country, is what does Sir Keir do  What Sir Keir do we get  And can Sir Keir reverse the damage done to our political discourse by those whom he has just defeated On that final point, it is easy to thinkthat the reversal can be instantaneous. Following a Skype call to Jewish leaders immediately after his election, Sir Keir won their praise for ldquoachieving in four days more than his predecessor in four years in addressing anti-Semitism in the Labour party.This was heartening. But will it materialise  After all, the promoters of anti-Semitism and other vitriol have not gone anywhere, at least not yet.In the push-back against anti-Semitism, as in many other areas, so much depends on the steeliness of Sir Keir himself. He has a career defining decision to make does he continue to pander to that element of his party, as he did during the leadership election in order to secure their votes, or does he reject them and ready himself to defeat them when they inevitably turn on him This fundamental decision, and Sir Keirrsquos preparedness to make dficult choices, will likely shape his leadership over the next five years, and with it his prospects of entering Downing Street at some point during .Should he forge his own path, he has the genesis of a radical  which could reshape the country in two fundamental ways. The first is the structure of the economy and, by implication, society.Coronavirus is certain to present governments all over the world with an economic problem countries experience only after a once-in-a-century event such as war or, in this case, pandemic. The UK Government is currently wielding the enormous power of the state, but continuing to do so as a method of facilitating the economic recovery is likely to be the road to ruin.Sir Keir would be well advised to reject outright his predecessorrsquos student socialism instead he could be better placed than anyone to reinvent capitalism for a post-coronavirus environment. He might choose to repurpose the philosophy of his social democratic background and look at how he may be able to use the private sector for a social purpose.How might private medicine, for instance, be used in partnership with the state to offer a better service to the public  How might the housebuilding sector be better aligned with the planning process to create the new homes that governments always talk about but never deliver  How might the large energy companies be utilised to create the domestic electric car charging network which governments accept we need but are probably too clumsy to deliver These are big concepts and big questions which Sir Keir needs to answerhe is to take on a Prime Minister who has, as a result of coronavirus, become a Tory who throws money around like confetti and lauds the power of state intervention, not to mention one who is currently enjoying massive approval ratings.The second fundamental change which Sir Keir has explicitly promoted relates to the UKrsquos constitutional structure. Federalism is a word to which everyone ascribes a dferent meaning, and it is far from clear what Sir Keirrsquos interpretation is.However, what everyone agrees on is that it sits somewhere in the middle of our constitutional status quo and independence. By simply positioning himself on that admittedly woolly ground, he positions himself in the same territory as most people in Scotland, as three-question polling has consistently shown.It will be up to Ian Murray, the reinstated Shadow Scottish Secretary who has forged a deserved reputation as a moderate and thoughtful force in the party, to put some much needed flesh on these bones.Mr Murrayrsquos consistent and clear opposition to Mr Corbyn has made him a figure of distaste for that side of his party. But in politics, the winner takes it all. And in creating a narrative for Sir Keirrsquos federalist agenda, Mr Murray will immediately move on to bigger things.Andy Maciver is Director of Message

owners has been associated with the loss of cultural ties between communities and the land, the quango said, as well as issues of insecurity, neglect, and disempowerment.This contrasts with the situation in some European countries, according to the SLC, where communities are often more ldquoculturally embedded in the land and more involved in land management.Its report examined a iety of international models, including in countries such as Kenya, Norway and Canada where land is owned or managed by indigenous people.Collective properties and commons, where land is owned and managed through co-operative business models, or where the rights of landowners are restricted, were also looked at.Elsewhere, the report explored municipal ownership and commonage, where local authorities own and manage land in the public interest, and where land is co-owned by the state and community with ying degrees of public input, such as in Norway, France, South Africa and Germany.Third sector and Community Land Trusts , where non-profit organisations own land with the primary aim of community benefit, such as in the US and England, were also analysed.The report said there is ldquoan opportunity to investigate further the potential application of the CLT model to deliver affordable housing in Scotland.It also argued municipal ownership ldquomay offer considerable potential, although Scotlandrsquos larger councils represent ldquoa key challenge for implementation.Hamish Trench, chief executive of the SLC, said the international research will help shape reform that works for Scotland.He said: ldquoThere is no single blueprint for land ownership, but this report highlights the possibilities and opportunities for thinking dferently about land ownership in Scotland.ldquoIt poses questions that go beyond the usual debate on land reform and ask us to think beyond the sectoral ides we sometimes assume are fixed.ldquoWe will be using this work to explore new governance models and I hope it will stimulate wider discussion and ideas.ldquoWe should be drawing on this international experience to shape reform that works for Scotland, reform that is designed to enhance our collective wellbeing and prosperity.Facilitating community ownership of land and assets is seen as a cornerstone of the current Scottish land reform agenda.Community bodies own just . per cent of Scotland.More than % of this is taken up by  large landholdings, as a result of the buyout of entire estates.Two-thirds of the Western Isles is under community ownership.The SLC said these acquisitions ldquohave been directly linked with far-reaching socioeconomic and environmental outcomes.These include increased investment, population retention, employment creation, community empowerment and sustainable land management.However, it added: ldquoDespite these positive impacts, communities engaging in acquisitions or those having acquired land and or assets often encounter a wide range of challenges.ldquoThese include: legislative and administrative hurdles limited funding availabilityobstructive landowners ensuring economic viability of the asset landholding ision and conflict in the community and limited community capacity.The SLC said there is a ldquounique approach to land reform in Scotland, adding: ldquoThe focus is on the expansion of community ownership, as opposed to increasing public or private ownership, in ways that deliver benefits for communities, as is the case in many other countries."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-lockdown-extended-ministers-suggest","story":"Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who is deputising for the Prime Minister, will chair a Cobra emergency

confirming there would be a review of the measures ldquoin and around three weeks after they started.The three-week mark will be reached on Easter Monday, while legislation designed to assist with the

However, a cause for hope is that the daily infection rate appears to be slowing, suggesting the attempt at flattening the curve of infection is working thanks to the public observing the Governmentrsquos instructions on self-isolation and social distancing.Yet the restrictions face their toughest test so far over the Easter weekend. Temperatures in some parts of the country are set to reach a balmy C, threatening to tempt more people to break the stay-at-home rules.The UK Government is expected to launch a media blitz in the next  hours to urge people to stick to its instructions and not allow the progress made thus far to be set back. The issue of the Easter lockdown is expected to dominate this afternoonrsquos daily Downing St press conference.Oliver Dowden, the Culture Secretary, took to the airwaves this morning to urge the public not to give up on the measures during the test of the long weekend as he predicted they would not be eased next week.\"I dont think its very likely these measures are going to be changed given theyre just starting to have an effect but, as we said, we would review them,\" he told BBC News.\"Its only prudent that on an ongoing basis we review them after three weeks,\" the Secretary of State explained.He went on: \"We are beginning to make progress on this, weve not seen the acceleration you would have expected had we not introduced this, the curve is beginning to flatten. This is the moment that we need to stick to the path weve chosen.\"The British people have really come behind this, we shouldnt be giving up this Easter weekend, that is the number one thing.\"Mr Dowden insisted the reason to hold off on making the decision until next week was because they were following the \"proper process\" and not because ministers were waiting for theof the Prime Minister, who he described as doing \"reasonably well\" in a stable condition. Last night, Mr Johnson was said to be improving and was sitting up bed ldquoengaging positively with his doctors.The Welsh Government has already announced an extension of lockdown measures. Vaughan Gething, the Welsh Health Minister, insisted there was \"virtually zero prospect\" of experts advising that UK-wide measures could be eased yet he said they would remain in place for \"a number of weeks\".Ms Sturgeon echoed the sentiment, telling Sky News: ldquoI dont think there is any possibility, any likelihood of these lockdown measures being lted immediately or even imminently.\"We dont yet really have enough data from what has happened so far to know for sure the impact they are having and, of course, we continue to see the number of deaths from coronavirus rising,\" added the First Minister.And in a sign that the police are poised to take an even tougher approach to those who disregard the Governmentrsquos instructions, Nick Adderley, the Chief Constable of Northamptonshire, made clear his force would now ramp up the enforcement of coronavirus regulations.He emphasised how the \"three-week grace period is over\" and people in the county could now face fines or a criminal record.Mr Adderley noted how a small number of people had been flouting the regulations with some having ldquobaited officers.He said the force could have to resort to more extreme measures such as road blocks and searching shopping trolleys should people continue to break the rules.\"These are not guidelines anymore. This is the law, declared the police chief.\"We havent issued any fixed penalty notices but we have charged a number of people with Covid-related offences.

Now is not the time to try and get rid of items following a spring clean or DIY project, we are urging you to keep them at home until recycling centres re-open and charities begin to collect furniture and clothing again.ldquoPlease donrsquot be taken in by offers of cheap disposal ndash thatrsquos likely to lead to others fly-tipping your items.ldquoKeeping items on your own property for a few weeks is better than taking part in a criminal act that could have longer term consequences, not to mention a fine of up to pound,.ldquoFlytipping is illegal, ugly and dangerous. It can be harmful to lambs, calves and other animals and wildle too.But for farmers and other landowners, it is also costly to clean up.ldquoDealing with litter and flytipping costs an eye watering pound million of public money in Scotland every year, and thatrsquos only in relation to public land.ldquoThis money could be better spent where, particularly at this time.ldquoWhen litter and flytipping occurs on private land such as farmersrsquo fields, it is down to the owner to have it removed ndash and to foot the bill for doing so. The costs involved are huge.ldquoThe effects are not all financial either. Flytipping takes time to clear responsibly, can block access, and can cause issues around health and safety.ldquoThe public can also help by acting as the eyes and ears of their community - we urge anyone who notices flytipping to report it, so it can be dealt with by the appropriate authority.ldquoThis can be done in a number of ways, including through the online Dumb Dumpers website or reporting directly to the relevant local authority.ldquoAs rural and environmental organisations, we are working together to stop flytipping ndash but we can only do it with the publicrsquos support.The joint statement was signed by Sarah-Jane Laing, chief executive of Scottish Land and Estates NFUS president Andrew McCornick Alan Dron, rural crime coordinator at the Scottish Partnership Against Rural Crime Barry Fisher, chief executive of Keep Scotland Beautul and Iain Gulland, chief executive of Zero Waste Scotland.The plea comes amid reports of a surge in flytipping across the UK.Residents have been urged to act responsibly as councils suspend normal services such as household waste centres to cope with the Covid- pandemic.There have also been concerns over an increase in waste as families spend more time at home and stock up on supplies.Councils across Scotland have scaled-back services.The collection of bulky waste has been suspended at Glasgow City Council since March .It urges residents not to leave items on the street. Its website adds: ldquoPlease leave any unwanted items safely on your own property such as your back garden or your back court and remain mindful of any fire risk.All household waste recycling centres are closed until further notice.Edinburgh has also suspended the collection of bulky waste, and advises residents: ldquoIf you have large items please keep them at home and only use communal and wheelie bins for your day to day waste and recycling.The cityrsquos recycling centres are also closed until further notice.Mavis Valley Recycling Centre in East Dunbartonshire has been closed since March , while household waste recycling centres in West Lothian were shut on the same date.In West Dunbartonshire, the recycling centres at Ferry Road and Dalmoak are closed until further notice.Similar measures have been put in place at councils up and down the country.Mark Ruskell MSP, the Scottish Greensrsquo farming spokesman, said flytippers are putting others at risk.He said: ldquoFlytipping is illegal and dangerous at any time, but at a time of national emergency it is a downright disgrace. Emergency regulations state that people must stay at home unless they have an essential reason to be out.ldquoThose perpetrating this anti-social practice are not only breaching these regulations but they are putting others at risk, potentially spreading the virus while doing so.ldquoIrsquod urge anyone with information on anyone engaging in this irresponsible activity to report it to police and local authorities immediately.Scottish Conservative rural affairs spokeswoman Rachael Hamilton MSP said: ldquoThe country is going through an unprecedented crisis and farmers are doing their best to keep the food and drink supplies coming.ldquoThe very least they deserve is to be repaid by increased fly-tipping.ldquoFlytipping is dangerous to livestock and hazardous for farm workers to clear-up.

Today’s [April ] change means new parents won’t miss out financially and can keep their families safe.“The Government will do whatever it takes to support people and the NHS during this outbreak, and HMRC are working around the clock to help families and businesses across the UK.”Angela MacDonald, Director General for Customer Services, HMRC said: “It’s really important that new parents remember to register for Child Benefit, even during these unprecedented times.“The increase in Child Benefit is a boost for family budgets but there’s more to claiming than the payments. We’re encouraging people to claim so they don’t miss out on National Insurance credits that help protect their State Pension. It also helps children to get their National Insurance number automatically at .”To claim, first time parents will need to fill in a Child Benefit Claim form CH found online and send it to the Child Benefit Office. If they haven’t registered the birth because of COVID-, they should add a note with their claim to let HMRC know.If they already claim Child Benefit, they can complete the form or add their new-born’s details over the telephone on   . Parents will need their National Insurance number or Child Benefit number.Child Benefit claims can be backdated by up to three months and are paid into bank accounts, usually every four weeks.Only one person can claim Child Benefit for a child. For couples with one partner not working or paying National Insurance contributions, making the claim in their name will help protect their State Pension.HMRC is also reminding High Income Child Benefit Charge customers of the importance of claiming these benefits, eventhey choose to opt out of receiving monetary benefits.The tax charge applies to anyone with an income over £,, who claims Child Benefit or whose partner claims it. Eveniniduals do have to pay the tax charge, they could still be better off by claiming Child Benefit # the tax is % of Child Benefit for each £ of income over £,.Parents can use the Child Benefit tax calculator to work out how much they may have to pay, or they can opt out of receiving Child Benefit payments altogether when they complete the form, so they won#t have to pay the charge but will still protect their State Pension.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The shot was clearly going just wide of the upright before Fraser MacDonald inadvertently erted it into his own net for a bizarre opener.”Under the canny guidance of manager Angie Murchison, Skye’s useful blend of youth and experience continued to revel on the big stage. Youngsters like Somhairle Macdonald, Ewen MacSween, John MacLean and Allan MacLeod had established themselves along with several survivors of the  team – Cowie, Willie MacRae, Peter Gordon, John ‘Bodach’ Mackenzie, Ally MacDonald and Ewen MacKinnon.With  minutes played the islanders doubled their advantage.McCormack takes up the action: “John MacLean delivered a corner into the danger area, and with keeper Kenny MacDonald under pressure Cowie took two attempts before slipping the ball over the line as he tumbled face-forward onto the pitch”.Skye’s fans were in dreamland but, as the reporter had noted: “Kyles are famous for their battling qualities”.By half time the match was level.From a powerful hit in from the right the ball broke to veteran Dan MacRae “who had time and space to place the shot beyond the reach of keeper MacKenzie.”Then, calamity struck Skye in the closing moments of the half.“Another massive hit in by Tom White caused panic in the Skye defence, and as MacKenzie lashed out in an attempted clearance the ball appeared to come back past him off team captain MacSween”.Seconds later it took an outstanding save from MacKenzie to deny Dallas Turner and prevent Kyles from turning around in the lead.Murchison’s men regrouped.“The second half had been underway less than  seconds before Skye retook the initiative thanks to a corner which was turned in by Cowie, with Peter Gordon hovering to pick up on any mistake.”For much of the second half Kyles were kept well away from the Skye danger area, but a fourth goal proved elusive – thanks in large part to legendary goalkeeper Kenny MacDonald.And with Skye just eight minutes away from sealing a place in the final the men in blue hauled themselves back from the brink.Our reporter said that Dallas Turner “had looked the likeliest threat” and it was the youngster who “saw a glimmer of an opening and fired in a shot which took a deflection and flew past Bodach MacKenzie and into the net”.“That was the signal for the islanders to lay siege to the Kyles goal and for the Tighnabruaich keeper to dig dep with a string of exceptional saves.”MacLean, Somhairle MacDonald , Gordon and Cowie were all denied before the whistle sounded to herald extra time.In “energy-sapping heat” it was hardly surprising that the added half hour was more low-key, but five minutes into the second period came a “glorious chance” for Skye.Referee Donne Fraser spotted an infringement in the area, and the islanders were awarded a penalty.Rankin stepped up, but was unable to make clean contact and the “scuffed spot hit was easily turned away by MacDonald”.And so to a penalty shoot-out. Both goalkeepers excelled themselves, MacDonald saving two, and MacKenzie doing likewise. With Kyles - ahead, Rankin had to score to force sudden death, but his shot sailed wide and it was Kyles who went through to the final.Ian McCormack concluded: “Rankin was hero as well as villain. Once he got the measure of Ronnie MacVicar he dictated play from the centre, giving a hundred per cent in effort and running himself into the ground in the process. Up front Willie Cowie was immense – especially for a player just back from injury.“And while the defence as a whole were tight, Willie MacRae at buckshee back gave another award-winning performance.“If there was a man of the match award it would undoubtedly have gone to Kyles keeper Kenny MacDonald, who had excellent cover from full back Fraser MacDonald.“Their most dangerous forward was Dallas Turner, while that veteran Dan MacRae showed he still has a few seasons left in him at the top level.”In the final Kingussie, in the middle of a run of seven-successive Camanachd Cup triumphs, proved too strong, though Kyles gave a good account of themselves and had taken the lead before succumbing to a - defeat.The redoubtable Kenny MacDonald was the final’s man of the match, but his remarkable career had still some way to run.

But it was great chance for us.“We were the better side for much of it, but not for the first time Kenny MacDonald was the saviour for Kyles.“At the time Kingussie were virtually unstoppable and we’d have met them in their prime. Our chance of winning the cup may have been slim, but it would have been nice to have made the final.“A lot of that Skye team would have deserved a shot on that stage.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3063615.jpg--.jpg?1586252028000\n","title":"advice for consumers as major retailer appoints administrators","story":" The news that Debenhams have announced plans to enter administration may have left many of their customers in the Ballymena area who have gt vouchers wondering what their rights are.Debenhams, which has a Ballymena outlet, announced that it will file for administration for the second time in a year.John French, Chief Executive of The Consumer Council said: “At the moment Debenhams is still accepting gt vouchers online but this may change.

It has done what relationships gurus couldn#t trythey were asked to. It has definitely repaired many a family squabbles bringing tranquility I would imagine where there was no possibility for that. Businesses, places of worship, schools, restaurants and pubs are all closed sad, yes, but the cumulative effect of the lockdown is the peace it has brought in homes. vw, px\"  TAILOR-MADE: Absence makes the heart grow fonder # Elly OdhiamboThat is my experience: fewer silly arguments about whose turn it to wash the dishes and get the food ready for the household. The shutdown is magical albeit an emotionally draining one. I had to talk to my landlord from across the street so that we don’t infect each other with this virus that has caused the shutdown. I have heard of families avoiding each other within the house in order to stay clean of the dreaded disease.The shutdown is non-discriminatory because its basic effects to you and me will probably be equal. It does not target this or that race, gender, height measurement and so forth, we have seen reports that little children ill with the disease are dying. So people need to stay home.Thee other day I was thinking about back home, Kenya – the dferent urban and rural settings where I grew up and the things that I am missing. For example, a slimy vegetable called apoth. This vegetable is heaven on earth especially after it has been left in the pot matured for days with some milk. You will regret ever becoming a fan of meat. So once you’ve cooked your ring aliya, a special sun-dried beef, and got your four-stars chilli pepper, you get your maize flour ugali meal ready. These are some of the things we miss.MISSING IN ACTIONThe plan was to fly back home this summer after being missing in action there since . Shock, horror! Not really, because I know of people who sadly haven’t been home for a very y period of time. A Zimbabwean told me seventeen years and counting.Eleven siblings meeting under one roof has never happened in our household since around the same time the Cold War ended in , or thereabouts. This was without a doubt the last time I saw all eleven of us packed in one room in the small lakeside town of Homa Bay. Our mother was a tailor, still is at the age of . She had the natural talent for making women’s cloths only. If she was going to cross that line and do outfits for males, it was for boys – her children. Her shop sounded elitist, Mama Vicky’s Boutique, but it was a normal place on an earthen, untarmacked road – what Belfast would call ghe High Street. Those were the days I tell you. Iniduals and families could afford buying new tailored clothes because the structural adjustment policies of the financial world had not yet hit our African economies. In simple words there was disposable money floating about even in countries without social security systems but people could afford basics.The cotton industry in African countries was still strong. I remember we used to pick cotton, bale it up and drive it to the local ginnery for cash. That cotton was not exported, it stayed in Kenya for the Kenyan market. Mama Vicky’s Boutique was a smaller version of the shirt factories that littered Ireland and made women the bosses of their household – correct me thereI am wrong.DILEMMA OF INHERITANCEThese unique places that kept the Irish and British economies going started shutting down . The women and male tailors in Kenya were generally not employed in big manufacturing textile mills, there were only about six such places in the country. But the feeling was the same when the garment industry faced closure. Jobs were lost and people could not sustain their livelihoods. In Africa many people had to turn to farming the smallholder units. Families rely heavily on rural inheritance, so the land favours the boys in the family and less so the girls as once they are married off, the women have to go to live in their husband’s home, hence the dilemma of inheritance. It is discriminatory against women and the laws have changed in many African countries, hopefully for the better.One day, with her permission of course, I will tell you why my mother prefers making women’s clothes.Elly O Odhiambo is a freelance writer living in West Belfast."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"we could be heroes","story":"All has changed in Belfast in the space of a short few days.

But when the Covid- pandemic hit, he was made unemployed at short notice having only started in the job last October. Just when he thought his luck had run out, the -year-old was stunned to receive a call on Monday afternoon telling him he had won the car and the cash, thanks to dream car competition BOTB.I just could not believe it and the news still hasn#t sunk in, Steven said.

The last thing she needs is further worries like me being out of work throughout all of this but she has certainly been keeping me busy with painting jobs all around the house, he said.It was devastating to lose my job, and I know that is the case for a lot of people so this could not have come at a better time for us.

I used to drive my friend#s BMW e and I just thought it was incredible.

And this year, pregnant women also have to worry about Covid-, a virus that can affect a person’s lungs and airways.Last week, the UK government announced that pregnant women were at an increased risk of severe illness from coronavirus.However, the advice to pregnant women was described by Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty as “a precautionary measure” because “we are early in our understanding of this virus and we want to be sure.”So how does the coronavirus crisis affect youyou are pregnant or have just had a baby This advice was compiled with the help of Dr David Glenn FRCOG, a Consultant Obstetrician and Gynaecologist at Kingsbridge Private Hospital and Clinical Director for Women and Child Health at Ulster Hospital.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseDr David Glenn FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappDr David GlennWhy are pregnant women in the high-risk category Pregnant women do not appear more likely to contract the infection than the general population. Pregnancy itself alters the body’s immune system and response to viral infections in general, which can occasionally be related to more severe symptoms and this will be the same for Covid-.Can a pregnant woman pass coronavirus on to her baby Transmission from mother to baby during the pregnancy or delivery is probable, although the proportion of pregnancies affected and the signicance to the baby has yet to be determined. Amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swabs, placenta swabs, genital fluid and breastmilk samples from Covid- infected mothers have so far tested negative for the virus. However, a new report describes a case in which the baby born to a Covid- positive mother was found to have antibodies in their blood at birth. This is thought to represent a baby’s response to infection within the womb.Is there a greater chance of miscarriageyou test positive for Covid- There is currently no evidence of an increased risk of miscarriage or early pregnancy loss in relation to Covid-.Moreover, there is no evidence that the virus damages the baby. Despite recent evidence that the virus can be passed from mother to baby, the proportion of pregnancies affected and the signicance to the baby has yet to be determined.What symptoms should pregnant women be aware of, and what should they dothey are experiencing any of them If you are infected with Covid- you are still most likely to have no symptoms or a mild illness from which you will make a full recovery. Most women will experience only mild or moderate cold flu like symptoms. Cough, fever, shortness of breath, lack of smell taste and even gastrointestinal symptoms are other relevant presentations.For women who have had symptoms, antenatal appointments can be deferred until  days after the start of symptoms, unless symptomspersevere.For women who are self-isolating because someone in their household has possible symptoms of Covid-, appointments should be deferred for  days.If women develop more severe symptoms or her recovery is delayed, this may be a sign that they are developing a more signicant chest infection that requires enhanced care. In this situation you should contact your maternity care team.Are all antenatal appointments going ahead as normal in Northern Ireland If you are well at the moment and have had no complications in your previous pregnancies arrangements for your care may be altered but they are still important to attend.If you have a routine scan or visit due in the coming days, you will still need to attend but the appointment may change due to staffing requirements. Maternity care is essential to reduce complications in mothers and babies. Even in the context of coronavirus, it is important that pregnant women continue to attend their scheduled routine care when they are well.Pregnant women will be asked to keep the number of people with you to a minimum. This will include being asked to attend maternity appointments alone.There may also be a need to reduce the number of routine antenatal visits.If women have an urgent problem related to the pregnancy but not related to coronavirus, they should get in touch using the same emergency contact details they already have. They should not contact that number unless they have an urgent problem.If women have symptoms of coronavirus, they should contact their maternity service and they will arrange the right place and time for the visits. They should not attend a routine clinic.What risks are there of an expectant mother contracting Covid- on a trip to hospital for an antenatal appointment Maternity care is essential and has been developed over many years with improving success to reduce complications in mothers and babies. The risks of not attending care include harm to mother, her baby or both.Many provisions have been put in place to reduce risk to mothers. These include reducing the number of visits to the hospital to a minimum, advice to mothers on reducing the number of people travelling with mothers to the hospital, attending the appointments alone, keeping numbers reduced in waiting rooms, spacing patients in waiting areas, staff taking additional protective efforts to reduce transmission in clinics with hand washing, cleaning equipment etc.How prepared are hospitals to deal with pregnant women with the virus Very signicant changes have been occurring in hospitals over the past weeks to deal with pregnant women with Covid-. Signicant changes have been made in all areas of the hospital, from clinics to wards and including delivery suites. Practice drills are being run frequently to train staff, additional resources have been brought in to help and a huge effort has been made by all levels of non-clinical, clinical, administrative and management staff.If the mother of a baby has symptoms or tests positive for Covid-, should she isolate herself from the baby Given the current limited evidence, we advise that women and healthy infants, not otherwise requiring neonatal care, are kept together in the immediate post-partum period.A risks benefits discussion with neonatologists and families to inidualise care in babies who may be more susceptible is recommended.Can a new mother with the virus breastfeed The main risk of breastfeeding for infants is the close contact with the mother, who is likely to share infective droplets. In the light of the current evidence, it is advised that the benefits of breastfeeding outweigh any potential risks of transmission of the virus through breastmilk. Precautions should be taken to reduce spread to the baby such as, hand washing before touching the baby, avoiding coughing or sneezing on the baby while feeding, and considering wearing a face mask,available, while feeding or caring for the baby.Can a pregnant person be accompanied by a partner or have visitors A person in labour can be accompanied by one birthing partner, according to the new guidelines. No visitors are permitted in ante-natal or post-natal ward areas.Will babies continue to be delivered in all Northern Ireland hospitals No, not at Causeway Hospital in Coleraine. Antenatal services will continue but it is not possible to deliver babies in the hospital during this surge period.This is due to a lack skilled paediatricians available to provide emergency care to a baby born in distress throughout the  hour period. To protect the wellbeing of mothers and babies, women booked to deliver in Causeway will be contacted and have their delivery transferred to Antrim or Altnagelvin Hospital.Should parents introduce their newborn to friends and family Current government guidance is that you should not meet with people outside your household, so no family celebrations are permitted at present.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It#s been an extremely strange time, he says. For the guts of three weeks now I#ve barely been out of the house. The one exception was at the weekend when my we and I drove over to my daughter#s house nearby to look through the window at three of our seven grandchildren.You see, we have a new grandson who is three weeks old so we were able to take a look at him through the glass, evenwe couldn#t hold him.The coronavirus situation has had a huge impact on us, like it has on everyone . In a way I feel like we#re very lucky because we#re out in the country and we have plenty of room in the garden to get out and get a bit of air.Some days I feel asI#m competing to have the best mown lawn in the country, I#m tidying it up that much. We#ll be able to play golf on it before long. And I#m doing wee quirky things too, like a bit more cooking and bingeing on box sets.But it has been dficult too. For  years I#ve run a business, a factory  yards from my house where we create bespoke kitchens and furniture. We have  employees. So for  years that#s been my lestyle.I#ve been up and about, in and out of my work and the house from .am until pm in the evening, or later, but we furloughed the business on March , the day after the lockdown came into effect.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseDeclan with his we Maria and granddaughter Moya before the lockdown FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappDeclan with his we Maria and granddaughter Moya before the lockdownIt was a very upsetting thing to do, especially thinking about all the people we had to send home from their jobs.It#s the biggest call I can remember making in all that time but I think it was the right thing to do to protect us all for when we come out of this thing.I#m in a high-risk category for Covid- because I#ve got a heart condition, which was detected quite recently.I was due to have a procedure soon to deal with it, but because of everything that#s going on it#s been cancelled for now.I decided to isolate myself even before the government lockdown, so I haven#t been into Newry in more than two weeks, which is very strange.Normally I#d be in and out of the town at least once or twice a day, so I am feeling the effect of this in a big way. I#m in the house on my own quite a bit because my we is carrying on going to her work in the hospital.It#s strange to have my routine completely knocked on the head.From days when I#d be so busy morning to night with people milling around all the time in and out of the factory, it#s become very quiet and there#s a lot less activity going on.I#m doing some work in the house on my laptop, bits of admin and keeping in touch with my son who also works in the business.But compared to what it was, it#s very dferent. My we and I were supposed to be going to New York with our daughter and son-in-law a few days before St Patrick#s Day, but we cancelled. I#m relieved we did because the situation over there seems to be dire, and at least we avoided getting caught up in it or bringing it back home with us.The thing about it all is that, while it#s strange and dficult to adjust to, I think it will have a lasting impact. It#s definitely made me sit up and think what was all the rushing about for. If we#re lucky to come through it all then maybe it#s time to have a look at it and change our perspectives a bit.As well as my we working in the NHS, my daughter is a consultant up in the Royal in Belfast, so it#s a worrying time. It#s certainly made me sit back and take stock.We don#t really need the foreign holidays or to be so busy in our lives all the time. What we actually need is to slow down and realise what matters - our families, our health, a good quality of le in our local areas.It#s been a huge wake-up call and a huge chance to make some serious changes when this very dficult situation comes to an end.‘Living in a fth floor flat, we feel trapped.

It#s been hard for all of us, and especially because I#d be classed as a high-risk person. I had a double mastectomy after being diagnosed with breast cancer four years ago, and while I#m about to hit four years clear it won#t be until the five-year mark that I#ll be able to feel truly confident.My immune system took a real knock through the treatment so when everything started to become more serious with the coronavirus outbreak we knew it was going to be major.When you have cancer, you learn to take every day as it comes and try to avoid going down the road of stressing about everything because it really doesn#t help.Living in the high-rises at the minute really isn#t easy. Daisy and I don#t get out - except that I get to leave the flat to do some volunteering at the Dunanney Centre to help other people in the Rathcoole community. But other than that, Daisy and I are pretty much stuck inside.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseDaisy looks out the window FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappDaisy looks out the windowDave is a key worker so he#s carried on as he works in distribution for animal feed. He#s the only one of us really going anywhere.We have three bedrooms in the flat, with a separate bathroom and toilet, a living room and a kitchen.It#s quite good in size compared to what some other people have, but being trapped inside all the time makes you realise just how small it is. We don#t have a garden to open the back door into. We don#t have a balcony, and our windows have latches on them so they only open a very small crack.You can take the latches offyou need to, but for now with Daisy so young I don#t even want to go there, so we keep the latches on. I keep the blinds pulled right back so any sunshine there is can get in, and the windows are open a crack for some air, but that#s it really. It will be hard as the weather gets nicer.There are communal areas outside, and we have communal lts to get you down there. Butwe do that then we#re running the risk of being in close contact with other people, and none of us know who may have symptoms or could have been exposed to this.Not getting out into the fresh air is very dficult. I suppose it#s getting me down a bit, and the longer it goes on the more I#m feeling a bit anxious. But I know it#s the right thing to do. Luckily Daisy has taken it really well. She#s not at the point where she#s tearing her hair out wanting to get outside. She misses the park and getting to school with her friends, but she#s been really understanding and accepting of the situation.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseJillian with husband Dave FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappJillian with husband DaveHer school was great in explaining a bit about the coronavirus so she knows we#re inside to stay safe and that it won#t last forever.What I#m desperate for is to be able to take Daisy to the park. Normally we stop off on the way home from school so she can have a run about for  minutes before we go home to do her homework, but now everything is limited to inside.We#re still doing some exercise. She really enjoys dancing and we put music on and she makes up dances and practices her cartwheels. I#ve got my stepper on my phone, and we go walking around between rooms to get our steps up.It#s actually been fine because we#re just doing our best to fill our days, and be flexible with it. I think trying to impose a strict timetable on ourselves just wouldn#t work, because this just isn#t a normal time.Our usual routine is completely gone. I don#t work, but I volunteer in the community as a Listening Ear and at other groups, and between that and school as well as Daisy#s Girls# Brigade we usually have a lot to keep ourselves busy.For now though we#re just trying our best, like everyone . When Dave is off he#s doing wee cookery classes with Daisy, and as well as that we#re trying to do a bit of school work every day because she#s always really enjoyed learning. I don#t want that to be something she loses because of all this.The next thing to think about is Daisy#s birthday, which is later this month, a couple of days after mine. We#ve told her she#s going to be like the Queen, with two birthdays in .She#ll have a small one at home with me and her daddy and then a lovely big one later on when all of this stuff comes to an end. It will give all of us something to look forward to.Support is available for people isolated or in need during the coronavirus crisis in Newtownabbey through the Good Morning Newtownabbey project, tel:  Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He added: I am hearing anecdotal evidence that a minority continue to flout the rules. That selfishness will have an impact in the coming weeks and it could be you, your neighbour or your loved one that feels that impact. Do not let the minority ruin it for the majority. Both a doctor and a professor of molecular virology said Northern Ireland#s current clampdown probably does not go far enough.Dr George O#Neill said people must not be allowed to drive to second homes, beaches or parks and he also voiced concerns about people browsing in supermarkets.We want people to stay within a short radius of their homes, he said.People should stick to a given area and not move out of it and realise that they#re saving lives.They#re also ensuring that the capacity is there in the health service to deal with this onslaught that we#re going to face.Dr O#Neill said browsing in supermarkets is a problem.People are concerned about people lting items off shelves and putting them back - that is a risk to others, he said.Another complaint being made is stacking of shelves - maybe they should close aisles while that is being done.He added: There#s an etiquette we have to develop. There#s a learning curve. Lots of stores have a system which offers some degree of protection to their staff and their customers and they should be commended for that.Dr Ultan Power, who is based at Queen#s University Belfast#s School of Medicine, raised concerns that a lot of people still appear to moving about the place.I#m a bit concerned there might be a little bit of breakout, said Dr Power.He also said he believes the isolation period for those infected with Covid- should be extended to  days.I know the recommendation is seven days, he said.I have great concerns about that because we have evidence to indicate that people are still infectious after eight.The evidence is telling us that going back to work on day eight is taking a big risk.He added: I absolutely think it should be longer, the recommendation for most other countries is  days.Dr Power said the key to beating coronavirus is all about stopping people from interacting with one and other as much as possible.What everybody can do is respect social distancing and stay at home, he said.They can make a huge dference to the transmission of the virus.Every single person in Northern Ireland can take this responsibility personally to avoid that surge and make sure the most vulnerable people don#t end up in hospital.Dr Power said there is a valid argument for more severe lockdown restrictionsthe current rules are being flouted.He added: If reasonable numbers of people are not respecting the recommendations that are there, it obviously puts the most vulnerable people at greater risk of infection and therefore of dying from the disease, but it also means the virus itself will keep circulating for a much longer period of time within society.When asked how long the lockdown will last, Dr Power said statistics are key.We have to follow the data, he said.What is the level of infection  How many people are dying Then you can starting making decisions on easing restrictions.But it has to be based on what#s actually happening on the ground.Meanwhile, Dr Anne Carson, chair of the BMA NI consultants committee, asked people to help medical staff by staying at home over Easter.Doctors across Northern Ireland, from the most junior doctor to the most experienced consultant, will be working over Easter to care for patients, not only those with Covid-, but with other illnesses as well, she said.Please help us to help your families by staying at home.Celebrate with just those in your own household.If you are out for a walk or cycle, observe social distance.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Rishi Sunak confirmed that charities, including those supporting domestic abuse victims and hospices, would receive cash grants to ensure they can meet increased demand as a result of the virus. Some £million from government departments will go to charities providing key services, while smaller ones will benefit from £million, including through a grant to the National Lottery Community Fund. Welcoming the news, Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said: I am delighted to announce that Northern Ireland charities will receive at least £million under the Barnett formula as part of the multimillion-pound package of coronavirus funding unveiled by the Chancellor today. I encourage the Executive to use this funding to support vital organisations as they continue to provide key services at the heart of local communities during this challenging time.The charity sector delivers key support to the most vulnerable in our society, and this initiative will help to ensure that they can continue to assist those who are most in need.The Government has also pledged to match the public#s donations to the National Emergencies Trust, guaranteeing a minimum of £million. It will match whatever the public decides to donate to the BBC#s Big Night In charity appeal on April . Mr Sunak said: Our charities are playing a crucial role in the national fight against coronavirus, supporting those who are most in need. It#s right we do everything we can to help the sector during this dficult time, which is why we have announced this unprecedented £million package of extra funding. This will ensure our key charities can continue to deliver the services that millions of people rely on. Tens of thousands of charities are expected to benefit, including hospices, St John#s Ambulance, vulnerable children and victims services and Citizen#s Advice.Announcing the funds for frontline charities at a Downing Street press conference, Mr Sunak said: For them, shutting up shop at this moment would be to contravene their very purpose, their entire reason to exist. Those charities have never been more needed than they are now, and they have never faced such a sudden fall in their funding. At this time, when many are hurting and tired and confined, we need the gentleness of charities in our lives. It gives us hope, it makes us stronger and it reminds us we depend on each other. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said he was delighted that up to £m would go towards hospices. Mr Hancock added: Hospices have suffered a huge challenge to their funding due to the outbreak of coronavirus, but at the same time they have continued to play a vital role in delivering compassionate, quality end-of-le care for many people.Belfast Most ReadMotorcyclist who died in Armagh crash had become dad for first timeMan killed after being hit by car in BelfastEssex lorry deaths: Northern Ireland driver Mo Robinson admits manslaughter of  peopleMan killed after being hit by car in BelfastMan charged after searches in connection with UVF#s drug supply network,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Dr Tom Black, chair of the British Medical Association Northern Ireland, said: “We know that everyone is missing seeing and socialising with their families and friends during this time. And particularly at Easter when normally people would be able to visit family, take day trips together or enjoy an Easter Sunday lunch. “However, we must all continue to work together to stop the spread of coronavirus and make sure our health system is able to manage and treat patients who become very unwell. That’s why I am appealing to the public not to visit family unnecessarily or see friends for the next few weeks until we have passed the peak of the outbreak.” googletag.cmd.push Dr Anne Carson, chair of the BMA NI consultants committee, added: “Doctors right across Northern Ireland from the most junior doctor to the most experienced consultant will be working right over Easter to care for patients, not only those with COVID- but with other illnesses as well. “Every day I am hearing about health staff right across Northern Ireland who are working unbelievably hard and giving up time with their own families to make sure our hospitals and GP surgeries are staffed and ready to care for patients. “Please help us to help your families by staying at home. Celebrate with just those in your own household. If you are out for a walk or cycle, observe social distancing. If you or someone in your family show symptoms, isolate for  days. googletag.cmd.push “This situation will not go on for ever, and we all look forward to the day when we can see our families again.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Thats the view of Newbridge manager Killian Conlan, who also acknowledges the importance needing to be placed on safely managing the current Covid- pandemic that has brought the sporting calendar to a standstill. Conlan, who also coaches the Ballinderry U team, speaks of the strange scenario of going from being busy to being left looking at sport from the outside. “It is coming up on four weeks this Thursday. We had training scheduled and the first competitive game in the Larkin Cup,” he said in an interview with the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push Conlan, a coach under Damian McErlain at minor and senior level, said it was great to see all the youngsters across the country honing their skills and uploading them on social media. But at senior level, preparations are much dferent. The Newbridge squad have also been using technology to keep in shape, with the help of player Nathan Rocks, who has a background in Strength and Conditioning. “He runs an online workout for the players and they do a bit of road-running,” said Conlan, who is cautious of the implications of pounding the roads. “You need to be cautious, with players having knee and Achilles problems in the past.

Gone is the interaction of meeting up three days a week. Like many clubs, the Bridge  has many family links and players are having to refrain from entering each others houses. “We have to look at the bigger picture here, the more we can do then the quicker this whole scenario can leave us and we can move on,” Derry are due to play Armagh in the Ulster SFC on Saturday, May . As yet, no decision has been made on the next step. The games involving London and New York have been pulled due to the travel plans involved. “It is a dficult job for them , but they are probably soon going to have to make a call on what they are going to do,” Conlan added. “After the league, counties usually have a month to prepare for championship. Whatever date they decide to go back to,they ever do, they will have to allow for teams to prepare. It is going to be very hard for an entire  of players to prepare for a game they didnt know was going to happen.” It will knock on to a club fixture calendar Conlan says is stretched already. “I can see the league maybe being cancelled and used as warm-up games before playing a club championship in the autumn. Thats just my thinking and what other people are thinking, but we dont know. “When clubs started, the Derry CCC were excellent with their communication. You had a certain time limit to put forward dates for weddings and stag dos. Youd imagine that has all been shelved. All of a sudden, new fixtures could be released and they dont suit.” With sporting teams all over the world uncertain of what is around the corner, Conlan puts things in perspective. “In the grander scheme of things, it is insignicant when you think about the battles and the real le scenarios that are happening in the hospitals at the moment. To me that is more important. “It has been great the way the GAA has came together, with each club – with help from the Official GAA – to having dferent contacts in dferent communities for the elderly and vulnerable to call on for help and deliveries.” RELATED - GAA suspend all activities.

All of a sudden, new fixtures could be released and they dont suit.” With sporting teams all over the world uncertain of what is around the corner, Conlan puts things in perspective. “In the grander scheme of things, it is insignicant when you think about the battles and the real le scenarios that are happening in the hospitals at the moment.

Derry Trades Union Council chair, Niall McCarroll, said: The global Covid- crisis means we cant celebrate May Day, the international workers day, in the way we normally would. This year we were working with Derry and Strabane Council to host a Workers Rights and Social Justice Week culminating with the May Day march and rally. The Covid- crisis is causing tremendous pain and hardship. We are in the midst of a tragedy that we hope will end as soon as possible with as few deaths as possible. googletag.cmd.push The response to the crisis has also put a spotlight on the inadequacy of government action, the state of our public services and the central role of workers saving lives, protecting communities and allowing society to . Many in the political establishment have joined claps in recent weeks for our heroic nurses and frontline workers but they have spent the last decades justying poverty wages, undermining trade union representation and dismantling our public services, including our health service. The hypocrisy is glaring. Governments have described the battle to contain Covid- as a war but theyve sent frontline workers out without PPE and testing. Far too many employers have risked workplace and public safety by refusing to implement public health guidelines. Workers have been forced to take strike action to make sure health guidelines are followed. googletag.cmd.push Its crucial we put a focus on the heroic efforts of workersresponding to this crisis, on the need for workers rights and on the central importance of our public services. The Derry Trades Union Council is calling on everyone to mark this May Day by joining a Five Minutes of Noise for Workers Rights at pm on Friday May st - and by putting up red flags and signs for workers rights from homes and workplaces for  hours. Well be working with unions, community groups, equality campaigners, artists and others that we were collaborating with for the Workers Rights and Social Justice Week to organise as much as possible through social media. We will be launching our Workers Charter - our vision for dignity, respect and justice at work, in communities and for a more equal society. Were calling on the trade unions and organisations supporting workers rights across Ireland, North and South, to join this effort. People from all backgrounds and communities deserve workers rights,dignity and equality. We want this event to be as inclusive as possible. We need to begin to shape a new way of doing things thats centred around recognising the value of workers and the needs of the working class communities.

Derry Trades Union Council chair, Niall McCarroll, said: The global Covid- crisis means we cant celebrate May Day, the international workers day, in the way we normally would. This year we were working with Derry and Strabane Council to host a Workers Rights and Social Justice Week culminating with the May Day march and rally. The Covid- crisis is causing tremendous pain and hardship. We are in the midst of a tragedy that we hope will end as soon as possible with as few deaths as possible. googletag.cmd.push The response to the crisis has also put a spotlight on the inadequacy of government action, the state of our public services and the central role of workers saving lives, protecting communities and allowing society to . Many in the political establishment have joined claps in recent weeks for our heroic nurses and frontline workers but they have spent the last decades justying poverty wages, undermining trade union representation and dismantling our public services, including our health service. The hypocrisy is glaring. Governments have described the battle to contain Covid- as a war but theyve sent frontline workers out without PPE and testing. Far too many employers have risked workplace and public safety by refusing to implement public health guidelines. Workers have been forced to take strike action to make sure health guidelines are followed. googletag.cmd.push Its crucial we put a focus on the heroic efforts of workersresponding to this crisis, on the need for workers rights and on the central importance of our public services. The Derry Trades Union Council is calling on everyone to mark this May Day by joining a Five Minutes of Noise for Workers Rights at pm on Friday May st - and by putting up red flags and signs for workers rights from homes and workplaces for  hours. Well be working with unions, community groups, equality campaigners, artists and others that we were collaborating with for the Workers Rights and Social Justice Week to organise as much as possible through social media. We will be launching our Workers Charter - our vision for dignity, respect and justice at work, in communities and for a more equal society. Were calling on the trade unions and organisations supporting workers rights across Ireland, North and South, to join this effort. People from all backgrounds and communities deserve workers rights,dignity and equality. We want this event to be as inclusive as possible. We need to begin to shape a new way of doing things thats centred around recognising the value of workers and the needs of the working class communities.

Like a B-rated sci-fi movie, our world is being ravaged by a killer virus which will affect tens of thousands, maybe millions. No-one knows. The experts disagree. Politicians do too, though that’s less of a concern. Worst, there is no certainty of a happy ending, with a superhero with special powers and a shiny suit to sort it all out. In a world where for almost all illnesses, we have effective diagnosis and treatment, and international experience and research to guide management, this Covid  lark is beyond our comprehension.We people who are accustomed to a pill for every ill must readjust to a new set of paradigms. googletag.cmd.push The prospect of arbitrary illness and possible death, without the presence of loved ones at the bedside, and for those of faith, the comfort of the sacraments, is terrying. For families, being unable to have the beautul and peculiarly Irish ritual of farewell, a wake and funeral to grieve and offer thanks, compounds the dread. We know that the young and healthy are likely to come through this, and that it is our elderly who are likely to succumb. Many of the sacrices we make are to protect the vulnerable and those who care for them. But there are no guarantees that any of us is safe. googletag.cmd.push Prince and pauper are vulnerable-tho it’s fair to assume that the prince isn’t coping from a homeless shelter or wracked with worry about how the bills will be paid. As with all human endeavour, there is goodness in abundance. People are delivering hot meals from their own resources to the isolated and vulnerable. Supermarket staff are stocking shelves, scanning tins and packets and smiling through the fear. Council staff empty bins, clean the streets and work from home to keep the wheels of this city turning. Bus drivers, mechanics, what we used to call lorry drivers but are now logistics operatives, all are at their posts, so that we can eat and stay healthy. Mammies and daddies, facing their own worries are reassuring their children that all will be well, putting them over their lessons and trying their best to keep them occupied and safe.So many people who have left work are offering their skills and experience to help in whatever way they can. Machinists skilled from years in Derry’s factories are working at home making masks to protect their neighbours. An incredible , people have volunteered to help the beleaguered NHS. A friend confided regarding her own health worries that she wasn’t concerned so much about herself, but about what might happen her mother with dementia, for whom she cares at home. This is love in action. Our postman came this morning, our usual chat done at two metres distance. We still managed to cover our usual repertoire of politics, weather, health and families, while keeping two metres part. My washing machine packed in. Well I think it’s a vital service, so I rang the man, fully expecting him to tell me to get lost. He told me he would look at it, but wanted to work alone, as his son is immunosuppressed. He came in the back door, I left the money in an envelope, and my clothesline now flutters with clean sheets. I feel especially for our young people, the unique, primal, mad impulsive joy of teenage springtime pulsing in their veins with the first sunny days. They are staying indoors, chatting online, putting in the days, making mad memes for the craic and to keep sane. My niece, doing her Leaving, and with no prospect of exams, is still doing a bit of study, and helping her daddy plant spuds.Her school days ended without the rituals of parties and goodbyes. Even our wee Fionnuala, my four year old grandchild, who lives with us and is the light of our lives in these dark days, knows that school is now at the kitchen table, because of the bad germs which and might make people sick. She washes her hands hourly - and the floor and walls - with enthusiasm and great care. Everywhere, people are doing what they must, often at great personal cost, while struggling with their own worries about work, bills and what the future will bring. They do these things cheerfully and in the best way they can. Superheroes don’t always wear fancy costumes, they are all around us. In these surreal times, we see our old certainties and values exposed as worthless. They seem to have been replaced by an older and more tried and tested value system, less about rights, and more about what is right. Let’s hope that these lessons stick when Covid  is a distant memory.

Kieran Stevenson was man of the match in their win over Antrim and Michael McMullan spoke with the Derry keeper, as he rekindled the memories of their golden era.  For  years, Derry had wandered around in Ulsters hurling wilderness. Until that moment. The  Ulster final was ticking towards a conclusion.

The wind carried the sliotar into the danger-zone, where vigilant Derry goalkeeper Kieran Stevenson deflected it wide. It was the last action and the final whistle kick-started an outpouring of emotion for the new Ulster champions. Bullfrog was the keeper in Banaghers three-in-a-row winning minor team, before moving into the county scene. An -year career began in , as understudy to Laveys Fergal Shorty McNally.

From that team, captain Colin McEldowney, Benny Ward, Mickey Conway, Gary Biggs and Geoffrey McGonigle would help spearhead Derry seniors towards Division One. The minors lost in the final that year, to the Saffrons, by an almost identical margin and Stevenson was the keeper on both teams. In , the Us took Antrim to a replay and  frees from the unerring Dermot Doherty, on his own Emmet Park turf, finished the job as Derry took the title in mid-week extra-time thriller. “That was a good win,” Stevenson recalls. “Antrim were always the team to beat, in terms of the county.” Things began to change. They ran Antrim to three points in the  senior final, but lost convincingly the following year. It was a spell in hurlings top tier that made the wheels of change turn that bit quicker.

The cream of hurling was lting Derrys standards. A -point slump to Tipperary, in Thurles, was their toughest afternoon. A one-point defeat in Laois was the one that got away, leaving Derry needing to beat Kerry in a relegation play-off to stay afloat before dropping down at end of the  campaign. “I think it as the Division One hurling that stuck to us and we were on an upward curve,” Stevenson feels. “There were more players added to the . “Derry hurlingwas about filling up the numbers and going out to play the matches. Then it changed and everybody was taking it serious. The club scene was improving and you could see the skill level going up from  to .” HARMONY In an interview three years ago, Conor Murray painted the Derry hurling scene he played on at the start of the noughties as a family. A unique one, with club rivalry left at the gates of Owenbeg and picked up on the way home. Stevenson agrees. “No club stuck to themselves, everybody got on well with everybody,” he said. Other managers werent chirping in players ears, telling them not to commit to the small ball game. In the  season, Kieran McKeever threw his lot in with the hurlers, while also playing in an Ulster football final weeks later. “Players were not restricted in playing for the county, in terms of hurling and everybody gelled,” Stevenson added A mountain of upside-down kit bags would be erected in the aisle of the team bus, with a coat thrown over it. Hey presto, they had a card table, around which they laughed on their journey to whatever battle they would later brace themselves for. It got more advanced when Stevenson, a kitchen manufacturer by trade, patented a custom-made card table. “When we were coming home, we were arm-wrestling on it and it was all a bit of craic,” he joked.  Emmett McKeever, Kieran McKeever and Geoffrey McGonigle celebrate Derrys  Ulster title. Steering the ship was Cushendall man Kevin McNaughton. After spending time helping foster Swatraghs structures and leading them to back to back intermediate championships, he came on board with Derry at the start of the  season. His trusted lieutenant, from the Swa, Roger Anthony Quinn, Laveys hurling godfather Tom Magill, Banaghers Gerard McCloskey and athletics coach Malcolm McCausland made up the management team. Heading up the M for the  final, Derry were in a decent place, following a - to - win over a Down team who had beaten New York in the quarter-final. Antrim were -point winners over London in their semi-final, but Derry blitzed them in the first half of the decider. Rookie defenders Emmett OHara and Declan McKillop were led a merry dance by the Derry attack. Ace attacker Geoffrey McGonigle and Emmett McKeever were missing through suspension. That told enough of the depth in Derrys squad. “We were getting better with playing all the better teams. There was plenty of skill, speed and fitness in the team. It was about trying to put it all together...it was a good ,” Stevenson explained. McKeever had been suspended after being sent off with Downs Noel Sands in the semi-final, on the advice of a linesman. With high-ranking officials on their July holidays, the appeal – lodged before the end of June – wasnt heard and McKeever would miss the final. “Beefywas our best player in defence...he was lethal,” Stevenson said of his captain. “We wanted to try and win it for him because he was hard done by. He was well-liked and in every match, hed have put his head in front of the hurl to stop the ball. “Antrim had Alistair Elliott, Gregory OKane was full-forward and Gary OKane started at centre half-forward, before going back .” DREAM START Kieran McKeever, Gary Biggs and Ollie Collins hit first half goals to leave Antrims foundations rocking. The Saffrons didnt score from play for  minutes. “We shouldve been further ahead,” said Stevenson of their - to - interval lead. “We had missed a pile of scoring opportunities and we were against the breeze in the second half. “We knewthe forwards were getting on the ball, they could score goals because they were skilful and quick.” Derrys backs were to the wall as Antrim notched  unanswered points and, with  minutes gone, went four points ahead. Derry replied with points to take the wind out of Antrims sails. Their case was helped further when John ODywer finished to the net for the crucial fourth Oakleafers goal. “It was the goals that won us the match,” Stevenson said. “I still have a hurling ball in the house, with the scorewritten on it.” All the press cuttings and programmes were kept too. A raft of memories from the glory years. But the hurl that deflected Gary OKanes last minute sideline cut to safety is long gone. “Some wee Belfast boy stole it,” Stevenson reckons. The Derry squad threw their history-making hurls on the turf to celebrate and within minutes they had vanished. “When the final was blown, it was more thepressure, you were always checking the time to see what was left. If the game had went onthere was less likelihood that we couldve won the game.” Conor Murray accepted the cup in the stand, before taking it down to the pitch for the suspended Emmett McKeever to again hoist it skywards to salute the magical moment. “We were there on merit,” was Stevensons assessment of their win. “We had a good defence and a good forward line. When you take the likes of John ODwyer, Geoffrey and Mickey Collins as your front three – you have a good side. “Conor Murray at full-back was safe, you had Collieand Niall Mullan in the corners.” Stevenson picked up the man of the match award and added to it with the Ulster hurler of the year accolade the following season when Derry retained their title. Later that night, the team partied into the wee small hours in Dungiven club. You could barely turn a sweet in your mouth. It was jam packed. Before that, on the joyous journey home, there was a poignant moment when the players got off the bus to carry the cup over the River Bann in Toome. “We had talked about it in previous years – the days when we were beaten,” Stevenson remembers. “It was a short walk, the boys were more interested in getting on the bus and heading on home.” Derrys fallow  years was over.

Maggie McCann from Limavady was issued with a Notice of Intended Civil Recovery, despite ing to the store to settle a pound. bill she had absent-mindedly forgotten to pay. She also received a letter demanding payment of pound., including a demand for the pound. she had already paid in store. Maggie told the County Derry Post that she had ed to the shop in an attempt to recty the situation. “When I left Tesco, it just popped into my head: Did I pay for that ” Maggie said. googletag.cmd.push “I had lted my bag and I don’t knowI didn’t swipe my card properly orI totally forgot. “Nobody sought me, nobody came after me, nothing. I went off to my daughter’s school and got everything sorted out and then came out home. “I thought we’d all go to the beach a run and walk the dogs to get away from the chaos for an hour, but I wasn’t in the house ten minutes until the police landed.” Maggie immediately realised her mistake when the police officers appeared, and they accompanied her back to Tesco so she could pay her bill. googletag.cmd.push However, once she had paid the outstanding amount at the Customer Service Desk, she was waved over by the store’s security guard. She said: “The security man was talking to what turned out to be a manager and he waved me over. I went over and told him I was sorry and that I had made a mistake. “The first thing he did was flip a notepad open and start tapping with a pen. He said he would need my name, address and date of birth. I said I’d already given that to the police. “I explained that I wanted to come in and recty it and that the police were sitting outsideneeded, but he handed me a Notice of Intended Civil Recovery.” The notice explained that Tesco’s solicitors could write to Maggie to recover the costs of investigating the incident, and there was further punishment in store. “They said I was barred for a year. I asked how I was meant to get my pound-a-week shop and he said I’d have to get somebody  to do it for me. “They would only say that it was Tesco’s policy. I was gobsmacked. It was pound.. The day before I’d spent pound and the day before that I’d spent pound. “It was all kept in the public eye, they didn’t take me into a room or anything. I didn’t care though, because I was doing the right thing. “Where is their compassion, their humanity  Especially at a time like this. I came back to fix this, and they treated me like a criminal.” The County Derry Post contacted Tesco for a response, but none was available at the time of going to print.

If I lose money on this, I lose money on this.Im not one to shout from the rooftopsbut I am very proud of it and I dont think we could have done a better job.His new album Home was produced byPaul Casey with Johnny McCullough on piano, Liam Bradleyon drums, Paul Cutlfe on whistles, pipes and saxaphone,Nicky Scott on double bass and backing vocals by Lauren Doherty and Liam BradleyGeorgehas been hard at work for the last year- touring the States, supporting Phil Coulter and headlining the Ulster Hall with a  piece choir.My parents were so proud, they just couldnt believe it, he recalls.My first big solo performance was singing Bring Him Home at the Waterside Theatre when I was .My mum was terried and she was saying I cant deal with this, aww thats my wain, he laughs.My dad was the opposite. He just couldnt wait to see me perform and its still the same now.Georges father and namesake is a former Derry City FC player, and his uncle PeterHuttoncaptained the squad for  years.All my uncles and my dad played football, but it didnt quite work out for me, he says with a smile.I always loved it though.Georges parentsGeorgeand Ann have  children and raised their family in Creggans Butcher Street before moving to Troy Park in .My mum always wanted to maintain that link with Creggan and thats why I went to St Eugene s Primary School and after school Id go my grannys house in Circular Road in Creggan Heights or my aunties house in Butcher Street.Georgehad always wanted to go to St Columbs College, but his plans changed after he didnt get the mark he needed in his +.I remember crying eyes about that, he admits.I went to St Patricks and St Brigidsin Claudy instead and that was a good experience and then I did go the College to do my A-Levels.My brother had been deputy headboy so I felt I had to follow in his footsteps and after about two or three weeks I got made a prefect.There were lads who had been at the school for a lot longer than me and they were saying this is a joke, he laughs.They werent one bit amused.George is classically trained and has been taught by Derry’s Eoin O’Callaghan and Ciaacuteran Kelly and Mexican Tenor Benito Rodriguez who is married to Derry singer Laura Rodriquez nee Sheeran.Last year he was a judge on the BBC show All Together Now and his first album Chapter One was met with critical acclaim,.Georgefinished up supporting Phil Coulters tour with a show at St Patricks Cathedral in Dublin on January , where he got the seal of approval from one of hismusic idolsOne ofmy biggest influences growing up was Luke Kelly and the Dubliners and the only surviving member, John Sheahan, was performing that night.Hes  and still performing and Ive followed that man for years and I got to sing with him.He came up to me afterwards and said keep nurturing your gt, youve got such a good voice and that was just an amazing moment for me.Dery born pianist Fergal Murray was also playing on Phils tour.I thought that was great because it was like three generations of St Columbs College pupils, me in my s, Fergal in his s and Phil in his s, saysGeorge.Phil later tweeted thatGeorgewas the only support act in his y career to get standing ovations each night.Georgeis very grateful for his fellow Derry mans support and guidance and calls him his mentor.For him to contact me and take a chance on me is massive.Hes a fantastic mentor and well be doing another tour together this winter and theres a few other things in the pipeline that I cant talk about yet.I look at Phil and hes a man who is just not going to stop.He released a book at the end of last year and one of the things I admire about him is that he has never been afraid to take a chance.Thats something Ive learned to start doing.Such a chance presented itself whenGeorgewas asked to be a judge on BBC NI SChool Choir of the Year competition alongside the Richard Marr of BBC Radio Ulster and the Ulster Orchestra, Ciaran Scullion head of Arts Council NI and conductor Lynsey Callaghan.Georgeadmits he struggled with imposter syndrome at the start of the process.It was a great experience and it was really nice to be asked, he says.But i was surrounded by these amazing people and then theres me,GeorgeHutton.Its such a wonderful experience to find yourself sitting amongst these people and I just had to remind myself the BBC had asked me to do it for a reason and that I was there on merit.I feel more confident being on stage singing than I do having to judge.Choirs have played a big part in bringingGeorgeto the world stage. googletag.cmd.push He sang in the school choir at St Eugenes PS, but fell away from music as a teenager before finding his voice again aged , first in the Encore Contemporary Choir, followed by the Ulster University Choir.The Ulster University Choir changed things for me, he says.Dr Sean Ryan was the musical director and it was him who encouraged me to take this furtherI joined the BBC Youth Chorus at  and then I went to Dublin and joined Anuna which was my first real taste of touring.You learn a lot in choirs and you make a lot of friends.You are learning and developing all the time.You get better at reading music and your ear improves and thats all completely transferable to being a soloist.There were so many people at that time telling me that this was what I needed to do.Georgegot his big break signing with the Five Irish Tenors when he was in his early s, and his cousin the singer songwriter NoellaHuttonwas on hand to help and guide him.Shes a really successful singer and had supported Sheryl Crow and been signed to labels like Universal so she really knows the industry, he says.She said to me what does it say in your contact  Are they giving you this, are they giving you that I said dont worry its with Columbia and she said I dontcare who its with, you need to know whats in your contract.Thats what I love about Noella. She takes no shit!Just before the corona virusstruckGeorgeticked another item off his bucket list singing with The Priests in DerrysSt Columbs Cathedral where he was accompanied by pianist Ruth McGinley.Id always wanted to perform with Ruth, shes widely regarded as one of the best pianists in the world.Shes used to playing Rachmaninoff and she was accompanying me, he laughs.For nowGeorgeis keeping busy plugging his album online and enjoying spending time with Megan.The most important thing is peoples health, he says.My brother Christy is a doctor and has a private clinic in Belfast but hes going back to help the NHS, which is going to be terrying.Im just down here in Navan going for walksIm grateful that I have an album to plug and something to give me a creative outlet.Georges second album Home is out now on iTunes, Spoty and Amazon. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Even in defeat, it was Derry who stole the show. What was supposed to be a Sunday stroll for Offaly turned out to be nothing of the sort as Derry flew the underdog flag with real pride. At the midpoint of the second half, Derry were level and pressing, and it took a strong finish by the overwhelming favourites to earn a six-point cushion at the end. Offaly’s manager, Pat Fleury, readily admitted that his team would have to make enormous improvements before the semi-final against Cork. googletag.cmd.push The truth is, Derry were always in contention in this game despite the dire predictions of a massacre. Geoffrey McGonigle ed from suspension to rattle in two goals and the full forward line of Gary Biggs, Michael Collins and John O’Dwyer scored - among them. There were high-class performances at midfield from Ronan McCloskey and Oliver Collins, and at the back, Derry held both John Troy and Gary Hannfy scoreless. We came down here to win, said manager Kevin McNaughton. We know we are not that far away and I always thought we were in with a chance, we were hurling so well. googletag.cmd.push There was the feeling throughout the first half that Offaly always had the upper hand, but once McGonigle pounced for goals in the final quarter, the complexion of the contest changed. Brian Whelahan had been left out of the starting lineup due to a hamstring strain, but he was quickly pitched into service to shore up a leaky defense, and Joe Errity was also sent into the action. Their presence had the desired effect as Derry managed only two scores in the closing stages, while Offaly had five points and a vital goal by Brendan Murphy. Derry were five points in arrears at the changeover, but they had the advantage of the breeze to come. McGonigle got the first of his goals when he latched on to Kieran McKeever’s probing delivery, and then when Stephen Byrne made a save from John O’Dwyer’s shot, McGonigle was perfectly positioned to dispatch the rebound. We put in a hell of a performance, said Ollie Collins, who was forced out with injury during the second half. This our first time down here. I’m certain this team will be back at this stage of the competition and go better.

No matter where you go or who you are talking to up and down the country, they always ask about Roly. There is always someone who knows him or has played with or against him.The above paragraph was taken word for word from Drumaness Millsrsquos th anniversary booklet in . It captures brilliantly the essence of Roly lsquoThe Manrsquo.Roly died on Wednesday, March , sparking a deluge of tributes on social media. True gentleman, one in a million, what a lovely man, one and only Roly, top man, a legend mdash these tributes, among many others, appeared again and again.Roly was an integral part of village le in Drumaness, dandering to the bookies or the shop. He would make multiple stops to say hello to everyone he met, discussing the issues of the day.I have known him for a!most  years. He worked in Sam Bellrsquos egg factory across the road from St Josephrsquos Primary School in Crossgar. The workers would kick a ball about the road during their break and even to my untrained eye he was dferent class. It was my introduction to Roly lsquoThe Footballerrsquo.Some years later Roly and his brother, John, knocked on our door in Crossgar. They wanted me to play for the Mills in the Newcastle Summer League and I was more than happy to do so.Playing with Roly was a great education for a young player. He made football look easy, was stylish and talented, possessing the rare gt of keeping the game simple.Small wonder then that when talk comes around to the Millsrsquo greatest ever player, Roly is always in the conversation, despite competition from the likes of Robbie Strain, Osie Gelston, Conor Walsh and Davy Mills.Legend has it that in those days boys were born with boots on in Drumaness because this was a village where sport was king. So it was that Roly also excelled at billiards and cricket, reaching a very high standard in both.But football and the Mills were Rolyrsquos first loves and he rarely missed training or matches. Inevitably his talent came to the notice of Irish League managers and he enjoyed spells with Portadown and Cltonville in the early seventies. Nevertheless, Roly was a home bird and sooner or later he would pull on the Mills shirt again.By now I was playing for the all conquering Downpatrick Rec team of that era and we pitched up to a Border Cup final early in  to play the Mills. We had just won the Steel and Sons Cup and had our eyes firmly on the double, but Roly and Osie Gelston had other plans and proceeded to inspire the Mills to a famous - win.Roly had reached the twilight years of a glorious footballing career, but there was still time to lead the Mills reserves to another giant-killing act, beating Castlewellan in the Bobby Dalzell Cup final in .After such a stellar playing career, Roly was expected to become a manager. He did dip his toes in the managerial waters once or twice, but with no offence intended to the managerial fraternity mdash myself included mdash Roly was probably too nice to be a manager. In all the years I have known him I canrsquot remember him raising his voice. He was just so easy going, decent and level-headed.As a result people liked Roly and this popularity unsurprisingly proved to be an asset in his working le. After Sam Bells he spent a number of years working in the Co-Op shop in Drumaness before taking up employment with well-known butcher Vincy Doran.He was a familiar sight in Vincyrsquos van, delivering to hotels and restaurants, but it was his weekend door-to-door run which played to his strengths and further cemented his popularity.He became known as Butch or Butcher mdash a nickname he loved mdash and Vincy to this day has nothing but good things to say about Rolyrsquos eight-year stint with him.Rolyrsquos next stop was with Jimmy Quinn, who owned a bakery in Downpatrick. Jimmy shrewdly ed Roly to the door-to-door market and with people still finding it dficult to say no to the personable Roly, their successful liaison continued for  years.Jimmy likes nothing better than relating Roly stories,none of which can be repeated here, and like the rest of us he will remember Roly with the utmost fondness.Unfortunately Roly wasnrsquot immune to the ups and downs of le and deteriorating health curtailed his working le. He managed to fight and beat prostrate cancer a number of years ago, but this time around the lsquoBig Crsquo has claimed this lovely man.Ironically it was during these latter years that he seemed to be ever present on the streets of Drumaness, allowing him to befriend a generation entirely unaware of his past sporting prowess.Roly married Betty Rice on October , , and together they brought Noel, Pauline, Betty, Carol and Christine into the world. After almost  years together as a couple they remained best friends, as well as husband and we.Apart from my football connection to Roly, I have been his neighbour for  years and since his passing I have heard him described as lsquoMr Drumaness Millsrsquo, but for me he was Mr Drumaness full stop.

Hopefully wersquoll be back playing as soon as possible, I think thatrsquos the goal.ldquoI think we just have to accept it and sit tight and when it does pass, we can get things moving a bit quicker.Certainly things have happened fairly quickly for Sharvin in his career to date. He only took up golf seriously relatively late in his teenage years, but went on to have glittering amateur career.In  he was a member of the Great Britain and Ireland Walker Cup team, contributing three points and remaining unbeaten in a .-. thumping of the United States.Sharvin turned  the following year and joined the ranks of the European Challenge Tour.Having missed his European Tour card by a single shot in , Sharvin relocated to Dublin and It proved to be the right move.He amassed eight top ten finishes in  starts to earn a rookie season on the European Tour thanks in large part to his six top fives.Sharvin only missed four cuts, two of which came in the first two events of the season, before he kickstarted his campaign with back-to-back top ten finishes.However, his best performance came at the Irish Open at Lahinch where he finished tied for th and was also the leading Irish golfer.He showed impressive consistency during the  season and proved his elite-level credentials with a tie for th finish at the Irish Open, ending the week as the leading home competitor.He says: I had a really good year, I put myself into contention a lot which was great. I think I was ready to take that step and I think the way I played, I deserved to get my card in the end with a few good results.ldquoI also managed to play well in a couple of European Tour events as well which showed me that I was ready to take that step. Therersquos a relief that I have my card now but itrsquos only the start of it mdash I know I have to keep improving and moving up the rankings.At the Irish Open he finished ahead of future Open champion Shane Lowry, Ryder Cup star Tommy Fleetwood former world number one Lee Westwood and Ryder Cup captain Padraig Harrington.ldquoIt was disappointing to shoot level-par on Sunday, but I feel like I didnrsquot do much wrong, he said.ldquoIt was really nice to have that pressure of going into the final round of a big European Tour event with a chance to win. It showed me where I was mentally and physically, that I was able to come from the Challenge Tour and compete in a top-level European Tour event.ldquoThat was an unbelievable week. The crowds were incredible and I attracted a big following being the leading Irishman, and that was a great feeling.ldquoItrsquos a nice feeling when hundreds of people are following you and everyone is willing your ball into the hole. I think that really geared me up quite a lot. It was a class buzz.ldquoIt was dficult going back to playing the Challenge Tour in the middle of nowhere in France the week after, but that week gave me the confidence to string together more good results to get off the Challenge Tour.Sharvin admits itrsquos been a slow start on the European Tour, with a tie for th in the Oman Open his bestin four starts this year, but his belief in being able to compete at the higher end of leaderboards remains undimmed.ldquoI feel like my game is good, but I havenrsquot really put all the facets together. ldquoI think in Oman I was second in strokes, gained tee-to-green and just putted really poorly. I played quite nicely in Qatar and just didnrsquot get it going.ldquoItrsquos obviously such a short period of time so itrsquos hard to assess in four events, but I feel like Irsquom close. This break may help me improve other things and hopefully Irsquom a better player when we start again.Given his Walker Cup experience, Sharvin would dearly love to play in the Ryder Cup in the years ahead.ldquoThe Ryder Cup would definitely be up there for me. I grew up playing team sports and have been involved with them my whole le, so that would be huge.ldquoI feel like Irsquom pretty good in a team and having tasted a little success in team sports, I think thatI can get my game to that level, Irsquod be a good asset in that sense..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 Ballynahinch.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch singer performs at nursing homes  ","story":"A BALLYNAHINCH man is serenading residents in local nursing and residential homes through the COVID- crisis with hit songs to remind them of happier times.The gesture from popular singer Wayne Rodgers is even more laudable as he lost all his work overnight in the lockdown as a driving instructor and a wedding band performer.The  year-old performed outside four homes on Monday, delighting the residents and carers in Redburn Nursing Home, Oakridge Care Home, Spa Nursing Home and Fishbourne House Care Home.Performing classic hits from artists such as Jim Reeves and Clf Richards, Wayne believes his singing is helping strike a chord with the elderly residents who need to be kept apart from family members at this time.ldquoThe singing helps the residents and it really helps me too as it passes the time for me as my work has had to stop due to the virus, said Wayne, who now lives in Bellaghy.ldquoIrsquove received photographs taken from the inside of the home showing residents enjoying my songs and itrsquos lovely to see.

It is certainly a strange experience for me.I was ordained in  in Downpatrick. New technologies and new means of communication came after that, and Irsquove struggled ever since. So the recent experience of having to install web-cams at short notice into the three churches in my two parishes of Portaferry and Ballygalget, has been somewhat traumatic.This week is the holiest of weeks for Christians. The passion and death of Jesus is commemorated, in preparation for the resurrection on Easter Sunday. We celebrate this in ious ways. We might well ask ourselves what happened to Lent and how on earth do we celebrate what will seem like a lsquovirtualrsquo Easter Coronavirus suddenly intruded into our Lent, at close quarters, and changed everything.My mother still remembers the glow in the sky over Belfast, when from her home in Ballykinlar, she heard the planes over South Down on their way to blitz Belfast. No doubt her grandmother would have told stories of the terrible pandemic of Spanish Influenza just over a century ago.But my generation and that of my nieces and nephews have known little of such things and we experience this pandemic a grave threat.At the moment of writing, the streets of Portaferry and Downpatrick are entirely empty, as are the great cities of Rome, London and New York.The unexpected severity of lockdown leaves us feeling bewildered, disorientated, shell-shocked. We are acutely aware of the suffering around us mdash illness, hospitalisation, loneliness in sudden isolation. As schools close we are anxious about increased tension in family le. The loss of our work and leisure patterns, financial and employment worries.In the Old Testament Jobloses so much of what he had mdash health, family, possessions and friends mdash yet he refuses to rebel against God in his suffering. This is incredibly dficult for most of us. His attitude of acceptance of his suffering can be of help to us. He says: ldquoShall we receive the good at the hand of God, and not take the bad Jobrsquos story can be useful to us at present. If you can get a chance, read it.Lent mdash an old English word for spring mdash is more challenging this year than we ever expected. As we celebrate Holy Week here are two words that figure in the writings of Henri Nouwen, a Dutch spiritual writer, that I find useful.The first word is security. Where do we look in our lives for security. A basic human need  In success, popularity, money, friends, family, insurance and so on  We mightnrsquot think we do. We will always be influenced by them, but deep down they will never provide us with security.Many of those things are good in themselves, but spiritually, the only true security will be found in the everlasting love of the One who loved us first and who wishes to love us into and for all eternity. Job understood that mdash security.The second word is patience. Patience means a kind of ldquosuffering through the present. Itrsquos from the Latin, patior, which means to suffer. But being patient does not mean sitting back and doing nothing. It is not being passive. Having patience is not easy for us. How do we wait patiently for God this Holy Week, Easter and beyond during this world pandemic Being patient is an active waiting mdash it means a certain experience of suffering through the present moment. To let the seeds of our suffering be sown in the ground so as to grow later into healthy, strong plants.It means avoiding the dead-end of what could have been for the ability to pay attention to what is happening before our very eyes, paying attention to the people and world around us. By that patience, we can begin to catch a glimpse of the first rays of Godrsquos glorious coming.Last week, I personally saw those first rays when I witnessed the staff in a residential nursing home in Portaferry decide to live-in with the residents for as long as this emergency would last.This week I witnessed those first rays when a cousin, a retired doctor, rang me to tell me he was volunteering toto work to bolster the Health Service.In one way or another have we not all been privileged to witness the generosity of spirit, despite danger, of those carers, nurses, doctors, medics, ancillary staff and many others Might this not be for us another glimpse that helps us experience in our present circumstances that Christ is indeed risen and lives now among us  It certainly is a glimpse for me.The Old Testament reading for many of us on Sunday last was from Ezekiel. ldquoThe Lord says this: I am going to open your graves. I mean to raise you from your graves and lead you back to the soil of Israel. I shall put my spirit in you, and you will live, and will know that I, the Lord, have said and done this it is the Lord who speaks.The people of Ezekielrsquos time knew their frailty and experienced uncertainty as we do today. Their faith in God had been severely shaken. Could they start again Security, patience, maybe these two words might stay with us over the next while as the reason for the hope that we have I leave you with the words of a psalm, which St Patrick himself echoed in his own writings, his lsquoConfessionrsquo.The words encourage us to place our hope in the Son of God who will sustain and strengthen us in our days, the Son of God, Jesus, who knew what it was like to stumble and fall beneath the weight of the Cross. With these words I ask God to bless us and keep us safe:ldquoI waited, I waited for the Lord and He stooped down to me, He heard my cry. He drew me from the deadly pit, from the miry clay. He set my foot upon a rock, and made my footsteps firm.With security and patience we can put our trust in the fallen saviour..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 Huge.jpg","title":"Huge boost for foodbanks  ","story":"THE districtrsquos foodbanks have been provided with a pound, boost by Newry, Mourne and Down Council to help them respond to increasing need during the coronavirus pandemic.The funding has been provided via the local authorityrsquos community network and is one of a series of initiatives the local authority is spearheading to continue providing a range of frontline services and responding to the needs of the vulnerable and elderly in particular.This week, residents across the district have been thanked for adhering to advice to help stop the spread of coronavirus by staying indoors and keeping safe.And, as the Easter weekend approaches, council chief executive Marie Ward has appealed to people to continue to listen to the advice to stay at home and save lives.

","story":"AMBITIOUS plans to redevelop Ardglass harbour could cost in the region of poundm, a new report has revealed.The figure is contained in a detailed consultants report commissioned to undertake an in-depth feasibility study to look at potential developments for the harbour which is home to Northern Irelandrsquos third largest fishing fleet.The key issue the consultants focused on was deepening the harbour to facilitate larger vessels, with work also undertaken to look at improving harbour conditions, berthing pontoons for smaller vessels and increased berthing facilities.In addition, the study included a comprehensive review of possible harbour layouts, historic document research, topographic and bathymetric harbour surveys, quay wall inspection above and below the waterline and computermodelling.The consultants also liaised with the Department for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairswhich has been given a copy of the consultants report ahead of further discussions with its officials on the way forward.Ardglass has the only all-weather harbour between Howth and Bangor and has three primary areas including the so-called fish dock within the south pier.There is also the Phennick Cove marina located behind a breakwater mdash which could be extended mdash to the west of the main harbour which can accommodate up to  leisure craft and the inner harbour which dries out at low tide.The consultants say that the inner harbour is particularly useful for vessel maintenance but not utilised as extensively as the outer harbour due to limited water depth.Last August, ious concept layouts produced by consultants were reviewed by members of the Ardglass Harbour Developments group which has been set up to oversee the regeneration of the port. The concepts were subsequently amended in November.The prime focus is on deepening the harbour and moving forward, a cost effective approach may be to zone dredge levels in particular areas.The report suggests deepening the outer harbour by nine metres and the area adjacent to Cochranersquos building at the inner harbour by two metres to facilitate crab vessels.In addition, consideration is being given to creating a pontoon with so-called finger berths adjacent to the quay wall in front of Cochranersquos with gangway access for crab vessels. No leisure craft would be permitted at this part of the harbour.Removal of the existing slipway at the southern end of the harbour adjacent to the beach is suggested as it is not generally used and considered too deep for access, with potential issues in relation to the removal of an area know as Church Rock to be investigated.Quay reclamation work is suggested between the north west corner of the existing finger pier at the ice plant and north western tip of the fish market quay.This would feature a new piled quay, backfilled and surfaced with a heavy duty concrete. Extending theof the quay wall by  metres is also suggested.The estimated cost of the harbour dredging is in the region of pound, with piling work and the new quay line and reclamation work estimated at poundm and poundm respectively.The breakwater extension is estimated at pound.m with the new pontoon facility estimated at pound,.The consultantsrsquo report makes it clear that the costings include primary construction elements but does not include licensing fees, site investigation, engineering design and tendering costs.Before anything happens, a marine licence is required for specic site investigation work, rock quality design and testing, sediment sampling of overburden, contamination testing and an environmental impact assessment.The regeneration jigsaw also requires detailed design work and planning approval ahead of tendering and construction.An economic appraisal may also be required.News of the proposed investment at Ardglass harbour comes after the portrsquos importance to the Ardglass fishing industry to the district and wider South Down economy was highlighted during a recent meeting with Stormont fisheries minister Edwin Poots.He met with South Down MLA Colin McGrath and local councillor Dermot Curran to discuss planned improvement work at the harbour, with the politicians also highlighting the need for additional investment in the harbour and its infrastructure.They described Ardglass harbour as ldquostrategically important for the Co Down fishing fleet, highlighting its crucial role in driving the South Down economy and its location as a central hub for processing fish landed at the port.Mr McGrath and Cllr Curran say further investment is ldquocritical to allow Ardglass harbour to expand to provide an economic boost, not only for the village but the wider area, and create new jobs..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 Mourning.jpg","title":"Please stay in  ","story":"ldquoHE was my superman ndash the moving words from Loughinisland woman Maria Farrell whose father sadly lost his battle with COVID-.As her sister also lies in hospital fighting the virus, the mother-of-two has bravely spoken out to warn others not to be complacent about the deadly disease.Maria, who buried her father on Sunday, warned: ldquoIf you think you are exempt from this or you are immune to COVID-, you are barking up the wrong tree.ldquoMy dad went really quickly, hersquos tackled prostate cancer, heart attacks, falls, you name ithellip and hersquos bounced back.

He also highlighted the need for financial support for the southern relief road scheme in Newry.ldquoI fully understand that the roads minister has a lot on her plate and recognise that she is not responsible for the failure of her department to invest in any major road scheme in the local area over the past number of decades, he continued. ldquoThe bypass should be in place by now. Itrsquos potential for Ballynahinch and the wider South Down economy is immense.ldquoThe multi-million pound road scheme can rid Ballynahinch of its traffic nightmare, help rejuvenate the town and encourage more visitors into the district and wider Mournes area.South Down MP Chris Hazzard signed off the eagerly-awaited bypass in December  when hewas roads minister in a previous Executive.The by-pass, which would be the single biggest road scheme ever constructed in the district, is expected to take in excess of  months to build, with roads officials insisting that it will greatly benefit both strategic and local road users by reducing journey times and improving road safety.Major new roundabouts are proposed at the Belfast Road junction with the Saintfield Road and at the Newcastle Road junction with the Downpatrick Road, with a new bridge constructed over the Moss Road.It is also proposed that a section of the by-pass will pass under part of the Crossgar Road with a  metre long bridge constructed to take traffic over Ballynahinch River.Overtaking lanes stretching almost  metres are proposed at either end of the by-pass where major new roundabouts are to be constructed, with the scheme also including a shared footpath and cycle lane..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 Recognition.jpg","title":"Recognition for poet Stephen  ","story":"A BALLYGOWAN poet is celebrating after his debut anthology was recognised by two major awarding bodies.Stephen Sextonrsquos If All the World and Love Were Young was awarded the highly acclaimed American E M Forester Award which was previously won by Seamus Heaney in .His anthology, published by Penguin Books, was also shortlisted for this yearrsquos Shine Strong Award ndash an award presented annually to the author of the best first collection of poems published by an Irish poet.Stephen says his work centres on coming to terms with the death of his mother, Elizabeth, who passed away in .He said: ldquoI started writing a book of poems that initially were meant to be frivolous and entertaining.ldquoHowever, as I began writing, the intense grief I was battling at the time came to the fore.Critics say what developed was a touching tribute to his mother which they described as a moving narrative exploring bereavement, family le, memories and loss.The judging  consisted of poets Colum McCann, Jhumpa Lahiri and Paul Muldoon.As part of his prize fund for winning the highly acclaimed award, Stephen received , to travel and stay in the United States.Downpatrick poet Damian Smyth, head of literature at the Arts Council of Northern Ireland, congratulated Stephen on his award.He said: ldquoThe sense is quickly growing on both sides of the Atlantic that Stephen Sexton is already one of those rare poets whose obvious and prodigious lyrical gts are matched both by accessibility and universality.He added: ldquoIt is poignant that the person for whom the whole book is an elegy ndash his late mother mdashnever lived to see the acclaim lavished on her son.ldquoHowever, there are few contemporary works which describe the human processes of grief, loss, hurt and how love survives and endures as memorably and as movingly as this one, with virtuoso technique and profound wisdom, which I have to say is already a classic.

I have been transported to a time that has changed my perception of le forever.People with CF have a faulty gene which means the mucus in their bodies is much thicker and stickier than in other people.They donrsquot catch viruses more easily than other people but when they do, it affects their lungs by causing inflammation and increasing the amount of the sticky mucus. This makes bacterial chest infections more likely, some of which are resistant to antibiotics, leading to a decline in lungwhich is the leading cause of death in people with CF.As parents, for the first sixth months of Lorcaacutenrsquos le we were consumed with the fear. We were advised not to visit baby groups, not to let people with colds into the house, not to take him to the supermarket on a weekend when it was busy, not to let him play in soil, wet sand, or day-old playdough as well as taking many, many more precautions to keep him safe.We also discovered that my mother-in-lawrsquos COPD and my fatherrsquos bronchiectasis meant that Lorcaacuten would always have to be careful around his beloved Nana and Grandad in case he caught an infection from them. For the same reason, he could never be within six feet of someone  with CF because of the risk of cross infection. My world would never mdash could never mdash be the same.We rarely left the house. I gave up my job in the RSPB and postponed my studies. Much of our time was taken up with the heavy burden of treatment for CF, including daily physiotherapy and antibiotics. I spent a lot of time campaigning for a cystic fibrosis drug, Orkambi, to be made available on the NHS.And I cried a lot.Over the last three years, le has become more lsquonormalrsquo but beneath the joy of every milestone has been the fear of taking risks that could shorten Lorcaacutenrsquos le at any time.During this time we have learnt that there are some risks you need to take in order to be happy. Lorcaacuten began pre-school as well as swimming, gymnastics, and football classes and I resumed my studies and began working a few hours a week.There has been a lot of stress and sleepless nights, a lot of handwashing, and a lot of happiness. With the support of the public we won the campaign for Orkambi, a drug which can slow the decline in lungby up to % and can be taken by around half of people with CF. Lorcaacuten started taking it at the end of last December mdash the champagne was popped and finally we thought we could start to relax a little.Sadly it wasnrsquot for long. During the wait for Orkambi, Lorcaacutenrsquos lungs had become damaged, after catching a couple of colds in March, he ended up in the wonderful Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children for  days of IV antibiotics to treat a long standing chest infection.During those  days I watched the horrying news that COVID- was spreading. I grew ever more disturbed at the lack of action by the UK Government. How could our amazing health service, stripped bare by  years of austerity and cuts, possibly hold up under the strain of COVID- Lorcaacuten was moved to a room further away from other patients, masks appeared and I watched the eyes of the incredible staff in the hospital become more and more tense.With nearly every death I read that the patient was either elderly or had an underlying health condition. But why did that make it OK: Surely that made it worse  The message seemed to be that lsquoonlyrsquo the vulnerable were at risk but other peoplersquos lsquoonlyrsquo is my everything.As the days in hospital passed, I learned that the lung conditions of my son, mother-in-law, and father put them among the , in NI on the extremely vulnerable list. They would need to lsquoshieldrsquo for the next  weeks. Shielding means not leaving the house at all and having to rely on the government and the goodness of others to deliver medication and food to your door.When Lorcaacuten was able to leave the hospital, we arrived home mdash with great relief mdash to a lockdown. Once again, with no job to go to and my studies on hold, I am transported to those months of isolation three years ago.This time, however, it is dferent, because this time I have hope. For us, this too shall pass. We willto the normality so hard won in our lives. We, unlike so many others who will lose their lives, will have this as a memory to pass on. I let so much of Lorcaacutenrsquos infancy be marred by fear that I just canrsquot let it happen now. Every day I am thankful for my good fortune in a desperately unfair world. I am thankful for all the frontline workers and volunteers, for the Executive finally working together for the common good to sustain us and to protect the most vulnerable in society, for the kindness of people delivering food and medication to those most at risk.I am grateful to the other souls sitting in their homes feeling helpless and feeling like le is passing them by. But by feeling helpless we are helping more people have a le toto after this all ends.It will end but the world will never mdash can never mdash be the same and none of us will look at it in the same way either.Maybe it will be a world in which those who need support will begin to get it, a world in which our NHS will finally be built up rather than worn down, a world we protect rather than profit from. As I watch Lorcaacuten run happily and healthily around our safe home with his little sister, Saorla, I donrsquot feel fear for him. I feel fear for those putting their lives at risk for all of us, for those who will lose their lives and loved ones, and for those who are sitting in their homes feeling afraid.I often think that doing nothing is the hardest thing to do, but for the moment doing otherwise is a risk too great to take, for us all.

Performance of the Oberammergau Passion Play : Freelance“The nd Oberammergau Passion Play will be postponed due to the current situation caused by the corona pandemic.”In the Baian district of Germany, beside the Ammer River and framed by the Ammergau Alps, Oberammergau is a small town known for its woodcarvings, its NATO School and its internationally renowned -yearly Passion Play.The organisers of the Passion Play summarised the historical signicance of the postponement, explaining that the event “goes back to a vow made in . At that time, the people of Oberammergau vowed to perform the suffering, death and resurrection of Christ,no one died of the plague anymore.Engraving depicting the Passion Play in  : Freelance \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Therefore the plans to perform the Passion Play in  are currently beginning.”Held in the ‘decimal year’I attended a performance in , one of the most vivid and moving experiences of my letime, and indeed, I had toyed with the thought of ing this year.There would have been  performancesstarting in mid-May with an expected , visitors from around the globe paying between € to € for a ticket.The enormous production has been running since  except for two cancellations and a postponement.Crucixion scene in the Passion Play in  : FreelanceNearly half of the , residents of today’s Oberammergau are involved with the show - actors, musicians, front of house, backstage and looking after the horses, sheep, goats, cows and doves that add to the often intensely dramatic scenes.The other half of the townsfolk run the restaurants, shops, hotels, BBs and farmsteads where many of the visitors stay,they’re lucky.The nearest accommodation I could get in  was St. Anton am Arlberg in the Austrian Tirol.Participants in the production must have been born in Oberammergau or have lived there for  years.Oberammergau on the River Ammer in  : FreelanceIt’s not unusual for up to four generations of the same family to be taking part in the same run of plays, which can involve around  children on stage at the same time.In the th century, passion plays were held in many parts of Europe, often performed on carts in the street.They re-enacted Christ’s last days, from his entry into Jerusalem to his trial, crucixion, resurrection and ascension.In the bigger and more elaborate productions, when scene one ended the cart trundled off to another part of the town or city and scene two arrived, and so on!They were the ‘poor man’s Bible’ enabling even the most illiterate become familiar with Bible stories.But Oberammergau’s is the only play with its origins in a collective vow to God which has run, almost without a break, for approaching four centuries. This unique double-accolade brought the town a UNESCO World Heritage award.It’s quite likely that passion plays were already common events but a document in Oberammergau’s archives records “the first decades of the th century went by in peaceful calm…but then followed the Thirty Years’ War with all its hardships from  until . As early as , infectious diseases spread in Baia. This village was spared by dutul vigilance until the church festival in , when a man brought the plague into the village.”More than  local folk died and almost every family lost loved ones.“Faced with the great distress that the terrible illness inflicted upon the population,” the archive continues, “the leaders of the community came together and pledged to hold a passion tragedy once every ten years. From this day forward, not a single person perished, even though a great number of them still showed signs of the plague”.They made the pledge in  and the Passion Play was first performed at Pentecost in , on a wooden stage that some say was built on plague-victims’ graves near the church.Surviving documentation from the  production shows that the play ran ‘completed smoothly’ with seating provided ‘for spectators standing close by.’From  the date of the performance was changed to the beginning of each decade, by which time folk were coming from all over Germany to see substantial productions.Paint and painters for the  show’s scenery cost  guilders, ‘the gentlemen trumpeters’ got two guilders and  guilders went ‘to the actors for drink’!There was no performance in  when Maximilian III’s Clerical Council banned all passion plays and when another threat loomed in the s the so-called ‘mad’ King Ludwig II of Baia protected it from those who wanted to close down the ‘harmful’ passion plays. Following WWI the play was postponed until , and there was a special th anniversary show in  attended by Adolf Hitler.There were no performances in  during WWII, just the second cancellation…until now.Plans to perform the Passion Play in  are already under way, for over  five-hour shows, several thousand participants, a -strong orchestra and a -strong choir.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

It will cut planned capital spending to pound million from a budget of pound million and will work to grow online.MS said in a statement: \"Whilst we remain confident that the post-crisis future of the business and our transformation programme remains as strong as ever, trading over the next nine to  months in our clothing and home and international businesses is likely to be severely impacted.\"As a result, it is not possible to provide meaningful guidance on future earnings, although we are taking every step to secure future value for shareholders, colleagues and suppliers.\"The chairman of Wetherspoon has said that a decline in sales was accelerated when prime minister Boris Johnson told people to stay away from pubs.After rising in previous weeks, sales fell by . per cent in the week to March  and the slowdown has picked up further since the Prime Ministers statement, Tim Martin said.It came as the business reported profit before tax rose  per cent to pound. million in the half-year to January  on revenue of pound million.Health secretary Matt Hancock has warned that coronavirus will keep spreading as long as people continue to socialise.Speaking on talkRadio, Mr Hancock said: \"If you stay at home you are saving lives.\"I know, of course, this is a more dangerous disease for older people but not exclusively, some young people get it too.\"But, more importantly, the more that people continue to go out and continue to socialise, the more it will spread and the longer were going to have to keep these measures in place.\"So, were urging people to follow the public health advice.In the emergency Bill thats in front of Parliament right now, we are taking the powers to be able to enforce these measures, so we can make it happen by lawwe need to.\"Id rather not do that and the evidence so far is that the vast majority of people are following the advice, are doing what is sensible and right.\"The company said it was cancelling its interim idend, which had been p a year earlier.Mr Martin said: \"It is obviously very dficult to predict, in these circumstances, how events will unfold in future weeks and months, but we now anticipate profits being below market expectations, so long as the current health scare continues.\"As a result of this uncertainty, it is impossible to provide realistic guidance on our performance in the remainder of the financial year.\"The company has decided to delay most capital projects and to reduce expenditure, where possible, including the cancellation of the interim idend.\"As a result of these actions, combined with the Governments proposals on business rates relief and credit guarantee facilities, the company believes it has sufficient liquidity to maintain operations at a substantially lower level of sales.\"Nicola Sturgeon has urged anyone who left the medical profession in the past three years to consider ing to help the fight against coronavirus.Sharing a plea from Scotlands chief nursing officer Fiona McQueen, the First minister tweeted: \"Scotlands NHS needs our help to meet the #coronavirus challenge.\"Mr Hancock said some retired medics whoto work in the NHS to fight the coronavirus will be able to come \"straight back in\".Asked on the BBCs Breakfast programme when workers couldto the NHS, he said: \"Well, over the next couple of weeks because for some theyll have very recently left and they can come straight back in, their annual trainings been up-to-date and they can just restart.\"Imagineyouve left at Christmas, for instance, you can restart straight away. For others who have been out for a little bit longer, they may need more of a refresher because, of course, its vital that we keep people safe, thats the whole point of the NHS.\"So the letter will go out today, well then be engaging inidually with all those who respond and I very much hope that many, many thousands will respond.\"From those Ive talked to, I think people can see just how important this is. The training will happen for those who need it over the next couple of weeks, at the same time well allocate people to a hospital near them because theres a logistical exercise here as well.\"Mr Hancock suggested that tougher measures could have to be brought inpeople do not follow the Governments advice.He told the BBCs Breakfast programme: \"What I can say is thatpeople follow the advice, stay home which saves lives andthey keep apart from others, more than two metres, more than six foot, then we can tackle this and we can turn the tide.\"The scientists advise that we can turn the tide in  weekspeople follow the advice.\"If people dont follow the advice, then itll be longer and we might have to bring more and tougher measures.\"He added: \"We have brought these measures in earlier than Italy did in terms of where theyre up to with the number of cases.\"But were absolutely clear thatwe need to, we have the powers, in fact weve got a Bill in front of Parliament now to strengthen those powers further.\"But I think its far betterpeople follow the advice.\"The FTSE  has risen by more than five per cent in early trading as travel companies jump out ahead after a bruising few weeks for the sector sparked by the Covid- pandemic.Intercontinental Hotels jumped by about a fth despite revealing that demand for rooms was the worst it had ever seen, as markets opened on Friday.EasyJet also rose by around  per cent and cruise operator Carnival jumped by around . per cent.Meanwhile, the price of a barrel of Brent crude oil joined the rally, rising five per cent to . dollarsafter a massive fall earlier in the week.Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has warned about the prospect of a recessionpeople do not receive their wages.Labour has urged the Government to ensure the salaries of workers are protected as businesses lose trade during the coronavirus pandemic.He told the BBCs Breakfast programme: \"We need the Government now to act to protect people to keep them in their jobs.\"In that way, what well be able to do is ensure people have an income coming in, their job will be protected, but we prevent the second wave of a recession hitting uswere not careful.\"Becausepeople lose their jobs, they dont have their wages, demand collapses in the economy and then you really do have a recession.\"The lesson from past crises like these is act fast and act big, so thats why were saying the Government should step in and say to employers, well cover  per cent of your wages, you keep people in work.\"Demand for a room at Intercontinental Hotels has reached its lowest point in history, the group said, as the travel industry continues to be battered by the coronavirus pandemic.The business revealed that it would be cutting costs, eliminating its idend and reducing salaries in a bid to save cash.However, shares in the group, which have been badly hit in recent months, jumped by around  per cent on market open in London as investors reacted positively to the companys proposals.Chief executive Keith Barr said: \"Demand for hotels is currently at the lowest levels weve ever seen.Intercontinental Hotel Group has a robust business model and the measures we are announcing today to reduce costs and preserve cash give us the capacity to manage the business through this unique environment and to support our owners during this incredibly dficult time.\"These were not easy choices and we are mindful of the impact these decisions will have on our colleagues and shareholders.\"However, we believe that these are essential to ensuring that we come out of this as strong as we possibly can and ready to capitalise on what remains an industry with excellent long-term growth potential.\"Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders , said the list of key workers to whom schools will remain open is \"perhaps more extensive than we might have expected\".He said: \"Realistically, theywill need to identy these children by lunchtime.\"Mr Barton added: \"We already know from the trajectory of this that were not going to have many staff.\"We have to be careful that the message to parents is not business as usual.\"Matt Hancock said that a communication will be sent to around . million people who are classed as vulnerable to set out specic action for them to take.The Health secretary told Sky News: \"The first thing were going to do is set out exactly what conditions that applies to.\"We expect about . million people to then get a communication from the NHS to say that they are part of this and what they need to do.\"Many of these people have pre-existing health conditions and so will be very worried right now, and I understand that, and theyll need very specic sets of action - for instance, how do you go about still getting your chemoyou have cancer whilst also social-distancing \"If you have cancer its particularly important to stay away from other people, but you also of course have got to keep going with your chemotherapy.\"He added: \"These are some of the most dficult and challenging cases so well be getting in contact with them, butpeople think that they are on this list and dont receive a communication from the NHS, then they also need to get in contact.\"So that is under way, the money was announced for it yesterday.\"A combination of money to the NHS and money to councils because theyve got a very big part to play in keeping people safe.\"ASCL general secretary Geoff Barton said schools will have first worked to identy vulnerable children, as they will know who they are, and will then be looking at the \"key worker\" category.He said the ASCL is telling members: \"You have to do your best to negotiate the key workers list. Youre doing this to a tight timescale, and what you offer children on Monday may be dferent to what you offer next Wednesday.\"Mr Barton said that initially, schools will be doing all they can so that pupils who need to can still turn up to their own school after the weekend.In the longer term, there will be more strategic planning of school provision, he added.Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers , said: \"The Government has made clear that every child who can be safely cared for at home should be. And their advice makes clear too that this applies to children of key workers.\"For the vast majority of children and young people, school buildings will close tonight and not reopen for the foreseeable future.\"Taking up a place at school during this time of wider closure is the offer of last resort, for the minority of key workers, who have no alternative.\"School leaders have many questions that remain unanswered about how this will work in practice. We will continue to work with the Government throughout the day to provide greater clarity to schools to enable this reduced offer to be up and running as soon as possible.\"Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, added her voice to calls from school leaders urging parents to only send their children in as a last resort.She said: \"This is a very long list and could result in some schools having the majority of pupils attending. This will not achieve the goal of slowing the spread of the virus.\"So it is vitally important that parents follow government advice to keep their children at home, wherever possible.

Irsquove grown up on the beach.ldquoI normally take landscape pictures because I love the water and some of the sunsets here are incredible, especially in the winter.Rochelle wrote her Instagram handle on the parcels, so that people who found them could send her a message.ldquoIt was just to make someone smile, and Irsquove had some lovely comments from people who got back to me on Instagram, she said.ldquoThey said they were going to put it up in their room and frame it.ldquoSome people were feeling a bit down and didnrsquot expect to find anything, so it cheered them up.ldquoMy job was done ndash the main purpose was to make people smile and it did - it made me smile too.ldquoI think itrsquos very important to say hello, especiallypeople are living by themselves orthey havenrsquot got their family around.ldquoWhen Irsquom normally walking the dog I say hello and have a chat, but itrsquos quite hard to do that now because everyone is quite wary.ldquoI donrsquot have to have that physical contact with someone to brighten up their day.ldquoArt is just a dferent  to communicate with. You knowsomeonersquos a bit shy and they donrsquot want to speak using words, they may want to draw a picture and open up that way instead.ldquoI think art can show feelings that words canrsquot quite express, so itrsquos a great idea to share that with the community.At a time of uncertainty and doubt, Rochelle ended with a message of hope and solidarity:ldquoI think as a community we could do so much more at this time, she saidldquoEveryone is concerned about how long it is going to last, but I am hopeful we can get past it, andwe all work together and remain positive we may come out of this in an even better situation than we was before.Rochelle would like to make clear that all parcels were fully sanitised.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

And he stressedthat those flouting public health advice have no right joining in the weekly applause for care workers. “Please don’t be tempted into letting down your guard over Easter. Our health and social care staff are relying on us all to keep doing the right thing. “The weekly Thursday night applause is so important and heartening, but it is not sufficient by itself. We have to keep following the social distancing restrictions. The vast majority of people are doing so, and I thank them for it. “But I am urging the small majority ignoring the restrictions to think again for the sake of themselves and their loved ones. Don’t be a hypocrite tonight by applauding care workers and then letting them down by your actions.” Mr Swann added: “The social distancing measures will stay in place for as long as they are needed and will be strengthened furtherrequired. “They are starting to make an impact. However, it is still early days and there will be many dficult weeks and months ahead.” The Minister concluded: “As we head into the Easter weekend, the message remains the same. Stay at home - do not go out unless it’s absolutely necessary. Keep your distanceyou do have to leave your home. Keep washing your hands and keep fighting back against COVID-.”  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n n n n n bannerbox_baecfbfdacecdced   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n n n n n bannerbox_fcdafdccadafebcf   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/258/172/true/GN4_DAT_3069224.jpg--.jpg?1586430164000\\","title":"poilce stay at home this easter ","story":"With the sun continuing to shine and a stretch in the evenings, it may be tempting to leave the house to celebrate Easter this weekend - but the PSNI Chief Constable, Simon Byrne, requests that you stay at home to save lives.Whether it is investigating murder or searching for missing people – amid the current challenges of Covid- – your Police Service continues to work hard to keep communities safe, he said.We can only do our jobs with your support, particularly when it comes to staying at home and listening to the advice from the Government and health professionals.Easter weekend is one that traditionally many people look forward to enjoying with friends and family. There’s a stretch in the evenings and the weather’s better – but please don’t be tempted to head to parks and beaches. Now isn’t the right time – you need to follow the rules that have been put in place. What we do now can help slow the virus – and we all have our part to play in that.You should only be leaving home for a number of key reasons – these include getting food and basic supplies, seeking medical assistance and taking exercise close to your home. Please – do not get into your car and travel excessively for exercise. Thank you to the vast majority of people who have been complying with this.Our policing approach continues to be that we will engage with iniduals and communities explaining what we require them to do and encouraging them to change their behaviour to reduce the spread of the virus. We will only use enforcement when it is absolutely necessary –people are not listening and putting lives at risk. For the small numbers of people who are continuing to ignore the restrictions it is inevitable that we will have to move to enforcement through the issue of penalty notices.Our job as police officers is to keep communities safe - and that’s what we want to do now, in these unprecedented times, just as we have always done.Please help us to support our health service to jointly fight the spread of the virus.Stay home stay safe save lives.  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n n n n n bannerbox_cbbcfdfefafedd   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n n n n n bannerbox_becaceecedb   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
