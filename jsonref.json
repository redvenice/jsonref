Time to turn to the experts for some tips ... From pay freezes to furloughing and reduced working hours, 2020 changed the financial circumstances of many people, so it’s not a shock to find that more than a third of British people are worried about their finances as a result of the Covid-19 crisis, according to Aviva.The pandemic has shown that the future is impossible to predict, but surely that’s all the more reason to prepare for the unexpected when it comes to your money.Resist kneejerk reactionsSelling your car or leaping into a less-than-ideal job can seem like sensible moves when your financial circumstances change suddenly, but it’s not the time for kneejerk decisions. “Never rush into rash decisions because of loss of income,” says Laura Stewart-Smith, Aviva workplace savings manager, “Instead, take time to think things over before taking any action in relation to your finances.”Impulsive reactions aside, moving quickly to take stock and regain control of your finances is something Stewart-Smith recommends for anyone faced with loss of income. “Don’t delay in facing the facts – doing so sooner rather than later is likely to be better for your wellbeing, and can actually help you feel better compared with the uncertainty of not knowing your true financial position,” she says.Build a budgetIf your income drops, your first task should be to draw up a revised household budget. Cheryl Sharp, founder of the accountancy firm Pink Pig Financials, recommends analysing bank statements from the past three months to track where your money goes and identify savings you can quickly make.“Categorise everything into how important the spend is – for example, your mortgagerent is critical but a take-away coffee is a luxurynice to have,” she says.With your budget in place, you can formulate a plan to live within your means and avoid or get out of debt. But don’t start a budget and then forget about it. “Share it with someone you trust for accountability, and then track, review and adjust your budget as your circumstances change,” says Sharp.Don’t forget to include annual costs. Plan to put money aside each month towards those once-a-year bills, so they don’t come as a surprise.Pick up the phone“Talk to your bank and any other financial providers you have relationships with because they may be able to help,” says Stewart-Smith. “Ask what’s available in your circumstances, and whether you can review your package or defer payments. You might have payment protection that can kick in if you lose your job or experience loss of income, but you won’t necessarily know unless you pick up the phone and speak to those experts.”Don’t ditch insurance“Check whether you’ve got insurance policies designed to help if the worst happens, such as payment protection insurance, mortgage payment protection insurance or short-term income protection insurance,” says Jay Lee, a mortgage adviser and founder of uAcademy, which provides training for mortgage advisers. “They might be part of a bank-account package or a mortgage add-on product, so you may not even realise you have them.”It can be tempting to cut costs by ditching insurance policies when your income changes. “Don’t – your home is your castle and you should protect it, so buildings and contents insurance is a must,” says Lee.Reviewing your home insurance policy, however, does make sense when your finances change. “If you’re worried about unexpected expenses during a period of reduced income, you could invest in add-on packages such as boiler repair or accidental damage and home emergencies policies, which will cover these eventualities.”Ponder your pensionIf you make fixed monthly payments into a pension, it may be worth switching to a flexible plan if making the payments is too much of a financial stretch. “It’s also worth reviewing your pension, as you may be paying higher annual charges than you would in a different scheme,” says Lee.While paying lower charges today won’t immediately put money in your pocket, you could end up with a bigger pension pot in the future, making you better off when you retire.Start a rainy day fundHaving an existing savings pot can help soften the blow when the unexpected impacts your income. Even if you haven’t got that to fall back on, don’t make the mistake of thinking saving is only for when finances are flush. The best time to start saving is now.“Some people believe they don’t have any spare cash to put away for emergency savings, but this is rarely the case,” says Claire Roach, founder of Money Saving Central.“Even when your income is reduced, put as much as possible into an emergency fund each month – aim to save three to six months of basic living expenses so you can take control of your finances during times of illness or unexpected loss of income, and continue to meet your financial obligations.”Consider new income opportunities A loss of income can hit hard, but it can sometimes yield new opportunities. Lee lost his job in fraud investigation for a UK bank during the first lockdown, but it prompted him to launch his business running online training courses for mortgage advisers, which now turns over £5,000 a month.“It was an extremely worrying time as not only had I lost my job, but lockdown meant I couldn’t find any other work to keep me going until the situation improved,” he says.“I set up my business hoping it would cover a few of my bills, but within weeks I was making enough money to keep running my household.”Above all, remember that support is available when your financial circumstances change. “Take all the practical steps to shore up your finances and make sure your money is working as hard as it possibly can for you. Also, check whether you can apply for any benefits, speak to your tax office to see if you’re eligible for rebates, and look into tax-efficient investments and savings vehicles,” says Stewart-Smith.“Then remind yourself that the situation is not your fault. Loss of income is very often outside of an inidual’s control. But there are many organisations that can help. You’re not alone.”The views expressed in this article do not constitute financial advice.

Try not to panic, say experts, because retirement savings are long-term investmentsCovid-19 has turned the world upside down, sending Britain into its worst recession since records began. People may worry about what this means for their pension pot, wonder whether they can afford to save, or even consider raiding their retirement fund. What is the reality for pensions in a recession and how can you secure your future in uncertain times?Don’t panicSeamus Walsh, a pension guidance expert for Aviva, says that many people were spooked by the impact of the virus on stocks and shares earlier last year: “When big drops occurred in the markets back in March, some customers asked to switch funds. But ... things have been tracking upwards since.”Any panic may well be misguided as pensions are meant to be long-term investments that ride the highs and lows of stock markets. After the last financial crisis, pension funds recovered their losses when equities rebounded. This time round, while stock markets have been volatile since Covid-19 struck, news of potential vaccines has helped them, and pension funds, to recover lost ground.“Pensions investments are for the long term,” says Walsh. “The longer your money is invested, the longer it has to recover from any dips.”Where is your money? “People should know where their money is invested and be comfortable with the balance of their portfolio,” Walsh says. “Your pension provider can discuss your options. If you’re prepared to pay for advice, seek out a financial adviser.”While equities have had a volatile year, fluctuations should even out over time. Cautious investors may opt for a more balanced portfolio, with some money invested in cash or government bonds, which are regarded as a safe haven. Age is another factor – those nearing retirement may move more money into bonds as they will need to access their cash soon, while younger savers have more time to make up short-term losses.Choose the right pensionMany people struggle to understand pensions but given their importance, it’s worth spending time getting your head around the details. Final salary, also known as “defined benefit”, pensions are the gold standard, but many employers have moved away from providing such generous schemes that give a guaranteed retirement income. More common are defined contribution schemes where employees build up inidual pension pots through their contributions and those of their employer. They know what they are putting in, but the payout is less certain, as it depends on the performance of the markets and your pension provider in managing your fund.Under automatic enrolment, a government initiative to increase the number of people saving for retirement, employees are automatically signed up for the pension their employer offers. As long as you don’t opt out, you will make contributions alongside your employer, and receive tax relief on the money you pay in.Alistair McQueen, Aviva’s head of savings and retirement, says: “For employed iniduals, any money they pay in is boosted by their employer under automatic enrolment. They can’t access money until they are 55, but they do get money from their employer they wouldn’t otherwise receive.”Things are a bit different for people who are self-employed. They can pay into a personal pension set up with a provider of their choice or choose a self-invested personal pension (Sipp), which gives investors control over how money is invested. “Self-employed people should be aware of the boost a pension gives in tax relief,” says McQueen.An important source of income for most pensioners remains the state pension. For people who are uncertain how much they will receive and when, the government has an online calculator to give an accurate forecast, and help people plan ahead.McQueen adds: “From 55, you can access your pension, but there are implications for your retirement finances, plus tax issues if you take out a lump sum. Also, the amount you can save into a pension later may be affected. Seek help. You could turn to Pension Wise, the Money Advice Service, the Pensions Advisory Service, Citizens Advice or your pensions providers’ support services.”Some people may feel they cannot afford pension payments if they are unemployed, furloughed or have seen earnings slump, but it is wise not to stop payments if you possibly can as this is likely to mean you have less to retire on. McQueen says: “Pension products are very flexible, allowing you to stop, start, increase and decrease contributions. Talk to your provider to make adjustments. Before you act, check a pensions calculator online to assess the long-term implications.”Why pension saving is usually a good ideaExperts insist there is no bad time to start a pension. And be reassured savings are protected by the Pensions Protection Fund. McQueen says: “All pensions are heavily regulated by government regulators. Iniduals also have recourse to the Pensions Ombudsman if they feel mistreated.”The views expressed in this article do not constitute financial advice.

And transmission only reduces if those who are sick self-isolate. But what if that comes at too great a cost? The millions of people who cannot afford to self-isolate face a choice between financial devastation and compliance. By not providing proper support, the government is forcing people to decide between their families and their communities. This choice is cruel. And it is avoidable.The evidence is clear that Covid-19 disparities are driven by differences in exposure both at home and at work. Those of lower socioeconomic status are hit hardest by both the virus and the collateral damage of restrictions. In lockdown, almost all risk is shifted on to the 10 million key workers who cannot work from home, as well as those living in deprived areas and overcrowded houses – two groups that often overlap.Given that the new variant of Covid-19 is significantly more infectious, transmission within households and among key workers, who spend extended time in close proximity to others, will increase. As always with deprivation, one problem amplifies another – being an essential worker and living in dense housing with multiple generations is not just associated with Covid-19 risk: it is the mechanism that creates the risk.An OECD review showed that, because it permits workers to self-isolate, paid sick leave can contain and mitigate the spread of the virus. Therefore, it plays an important role in protecting workers and their communities during a pandemic. Yet the UK has one of the lowest proportions of income covered by statutory sick pay in Europe, and millions don’t even qualify. The government calls it a war on Covid, but they have left a key weapon at home.This failure to provide proper self-isolation support has meant that the country is split in two: those who have the means to stay at home and protect the NHS, and those who cannot, no matter how much they want to. Affluent communities with adequate housing and sick pay provisions are given socioeconomic immunity, while the burden is shifted on to the networks of the working class. It is protection for some, and pandemic for others.Nowhere has this been more obvious than in Leicester. Most of the country at least had some sort of break from Covid-19 over the summer, but Leicester has been on the highest level of restrictions since June due to a surge in cases in the city. Public Health England evidence showed that workers in the city’s garment factories and food-processing plants were a significant driver of transmission. Many of these workers felt they could not stay off to self-isolate when sick. Transmission was likely amplified further by poor working conditions and networks of people living in over-crowded, multi-generational housing. These outbreaks then spilled over into the community, contributing to a surge in cases and restrictions being applied.This is the untold story of the pandemic. The focus on personal compliance has taken attention away from the structural inequities that preclude compliance and drive transmission risks in communities.And yet, with all of this evidence, with school, university, and business closures, local economies in freefall and the NHS near breaking point, the government has still failed to implement the most basic of public health principles. By not enabling the financially vulnerable to self-isolate, we have repeatedly exacerbated social inequities and the disasters of the pandemic.By directly addressing the barriers faced by socioeconomically vulnerable populations, self-isolation support to patients and their households can also increase test uptake and the number of contacts given. In Liverpool, a pilot of mass testing was rolled out with hundreds of thousands of rapid tests and large numbers of army personnel to implement it, but the government ignored requests from local public health leaders for additional funds to support isolation. The pilot report concluded that the impact of mass testing was reduced due to low test uptake in deprived communities. The reason most often given? A fear of not having adequate support to self-isolate. It’s one of countless examples of the government shooting for the moon without bothering with fuel for the rockets.Isolation of infectious iniduals is the single most important measure in terms of controlling transmission. If we don’t pull these basic public health brake levers to slow the spread, the virus will simply continue to transmit among key workers and their families. Therefore, the effect of lockdown will be limited. Given the emergence of the new variant, providing income protection and support for self-isolation may be the deciding factor in whether we reduce R below 1.The disproportionate impact of Covid-19 on households living in poverty emphasises the need to urgently update our definition of “vulnerable” populations and address these inequities. Many (rightly) take issue with the Great Barrington declaration and its policy of focused protection. But this current blanket lockdown approach fails to address what is really driving the pandemic, and is merely the focused protection of the middle classes. Even the strongest of wills cannot overcome hard economic realities. We need targeted and sustainable solutions, based on evidence and core public health principles. To make this lockdown a smart lockdown, the government must support key workers and self-isolation. This tale of two pandemics has gone on far too long."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/382227056080819104c2adb50523328202289583/0_130_1626_975/master/1626.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=bd1dd13ed50f107038ebf260dd975a85","title":"share your experiences of homeschooling during the new uk lockdown","story":"We would like to hear from parents and s about how they have been coping with teaching children at homeThe prime minister said he would be “extremely cautious” about when schools will be able to reopen fully after lockdown is lifted.

If only others would do the sameThe director Joan Micklin Silver, who died last week, was – to use the kind of cliche she abhorred – a pioneer. She was a female director at a time when studio executives were more than comfortable with being openly sexist, telling Silver: “Women directors are one more problem we don’t need.”She made distinctly Jewish movies, as opposed to the kind of Jewish-lite movies that were – and are still – Hollywood’s more usual style. Her two greatest films, Hester Street (1975), about a Jewish immigrant couple (Steven Keats and Carol Kane) on the Lower East Side in the 1890s, and the peerless 1988 romcom Crossing Delancey, about a modern young woman (Amy Irving) who is reluctantly fixed up with a pickle seller (Peter Riegert), are to When Harry Met Sally what the Netflix series Shtisel is to Seinfeld: Jewish as opposed to merely Jew-ish.But Silver did more than that. She took on what has stealthily become a staple cliche of American romcoms, exploded it and inverted it: the theme of Jewish assimilation.The idea of something as academic and hard-edged as cultural identity underpinning a genre as frothy and pleasurable as the romantic comedy may sound like a fast track to Pseuds’ Corner. Yet once you spot this theme, you see it in almost every movie, like Alvy Singer in Annie Hall, who sees antisemitism everywhere.Annie Hall is perhaps the film that made this plotline so central to modern romcoms, with its storyline of Alvy, the nebbish hypochondriac Jew (Woody Allen), who momentarily finds happiness with Annie, a blond Wasp (Diane Keaton). Allen emphasises this theme in the famous scene in which Annie takes him home to her family, and he imagines how they see him, which is, of course, as a fully garbed-up Hasidic Jew, and he mentally contrasts the calm wealth of her family with the chaotic poverty of his own.Ultimately, Annie leaves Alvy for a record producer, played by Paul Simon, possibly the only man in New York who looks more Jewish than Woody Allen: Annie is off to rescue another Jew from himself. In reality, after Keaton’s relationship with Allen ended she got together with the definitely-not-Jewish Warren Beatty, so for Allen to cast Simon in his stead was clearly his own in-joke.Romcoms are based on the idea that love will save the protagonist. In fairytales, this means a wealthy prince rescuing a poor girl in modern romcoms, it often means a dark-haired young man getting lifted out of his Semitic misery by a perky blond woman. Allen more than any other film-maker established this template, particularly in his films with his then partner, Mia Farrow. In Hannah and Her Sisters, depressive hypochondriac Mickey (Allen) was married to glamorous theatrical Hannah (Farrow), until she orced him and got together with someone more similar to her, Elliot (Michael Caine), leaving Mickey to stew in his own anxiety. (He finds a way out by marrying Hannah’s sister, played by Dianne Wiest.)In Broadway Danny Rose, nervy Danny (Allen) has the time of his life and is ultimately redeemed by Tina, a blond gangster’s moll straight out of a Hollywood B-movie (Farrow). In my favourite Allen film, The Purple Rose of Cairo, Allen switches the set-up and this time it’s the woman, a poor New York housewife (Farrow), who is rescued by a glamorous bombshell who walks, literally, off the movie screen (Jeff Daniels).Thanks in no small part to Allen, you see this trope in every romcom starring actors such as Ben Stiller, Seth Rogen, Adam Sandler opposite the likes of Jennifer Aniston, Katherine Heigl, Drew Barrymore. In all these movies, the men are attractive because they have what are now seen as innately male Jewish qualities (anxiety, sarcasm, self-obsession), but simultaneously need to be rescued from them. Only someone who is their exact opposite can do that because while male Jewish qualities are depicted as desirable, the qualities associated with Jewish women (nagging, spoilt, nasal voices, dark hair) are very much not, as these movies often emphasise.In 2004’s Along Came Polly, the very Jewishly named Reuben Feffer (Stiller) has his heart broken by the duplicitous Lisa (Debra Messing, who is Jewish), but finds redemption with quirky Polly (played by Aniston, who is not). In 1998’s The Wedding Singer, Robbie (Sandler) has his heart broken by his spoilt, dark-haired fiancee, and only recovers when he gets together with the very blond Julia (Barrymore). In Knocked Up, Alison (Heigl) is initially wowed by Ben’s (Rogen) exotic Jewishness, drunkenly stroking his curly hair in the nightclub and asking what “product” he uses on it. “Uh, Jew?” he responds.Even When Harry Met Sally – despite being written and directed by Jews (Nora Ephron and Rob Reiner) – relied on this set up, with the miserable, dark-haired, corned-beef fan Harry (Billy Crystal) and the cheerful, blond, white-bread-and-ham-sandwich-eating Sally.This shtick transferred to US sitcoms, in 1990s shows such as Mad About You (starring Paul Reiser and Helen Hunt), while in Curb Your Enthusiasm, Larry (Larry David) is – initially – married to sexy blonde Cheryl (Cheryl Hines), whereas his poor manager Jeff (Jeff Garlin) is stuck with the very Jewish Susie (Susie Essman), who, unlike Cheryl, nags and gives her husband an extremely hard time. She is the partner you don’t want to end up with, the wrong one, like Janice in Friends, or like the nagging, ball-breaking, killjoy of a girlfriend played by Sarah Silverman in School of Rock.Knocked Up was made by Judd Apatow, who has followed in Allen’s stead in depicting marriage between a dark-haired man and a blond woman as the ultimate happy ending (Apatow himself is married to Leslie Mann, who often plays the desirable blond woman in his movies.) And this is not just limited to stories about Jews. In 2017’s The Big Sick, which Apatow produced, Kumail (Kumail Nanjiani) falls for a white woman, Emily (Zoe Kazan), much to his parents’ horror. And it’s not enough to depict Emily as perfect, the movie presents all the Pakistani women Kumail is set up with by his family as boring or just flat-out unattractive.Romantic love is often how a young person makes their definitive break from their parents, and an easy way to illustrate that is to show them rejecting their own background, assimilating into the mainstream. In fact, the rise of Hollywood is itself the story of Jewish men attempting to assimilate themselves into this new world that, at the time, often expressly banned them. In An Empire of Their Own, Neal Gabler writes that, when American golf clubs and elite neighbourhoods refused to admit Jews, the Jewish movie producers in the early 20th century responded by making films about those elite worlds.Female Jewish actors are certainly presented as desirable in movies, but only if they look like Scarlett Johansson or Natalie Portman, or Winona Ryder, none of whom are exactly the female equivalent of Seth Rogen. Before she mutilated her perfect nose, Jennifer Grey was one of the very few classically Jewish-looking actresses to be in a romcom in which she gets together with the beautiful non-Jew (Dirty Dancing, of course, playing opposite Patrick Swayze). Dirty Dancing was written by a Jewish woman (Eleanor Bergstein), just as My Big Fat Greek Wedding was written by a Greek-Canadian woman, Nia Vardalos. Apparently, it’s only when a woman writes the movie that a female protagonist’s ethnicity can be celebrated. But neither Vardalos nor Bergstein was as brave or original as Joan Micklin Silver when it came to questioning whether assimilation was right at all.In Hester Street, a Jewish immigrant husband is ashamed of how unassimilated his wife is after she arrives in the country a few years after him. Hester Street was filmed in black and white and is largely subtitled, with the characters speaking in Yiddish. In an echo of the plotline, no studio wanted to make the film, deeming it “too ethnic” – Jewish, in other words. But it was a hit and Carol Kane, who played the wife, was nominated for an Academy Award.Izzy has a romance with the sort of man who she thinks is her world, the glamorous author Anton Moss (Jeroen Krabbé). But he has his own assimilation issues when he is reprimanded by a fellow author for not writing in Dutch, his “mother tongue”. “I live in New York,” Anton responds crossly. “Well, I wasn’t asking to see your green card!” laughs the other author. But there is a sense that Anton doesn’t know who he really is and this is expressed in his lack of a moral compass, whereas Sam very much knows where and who he is. For his big date with Izzy, Sam soaks his hands in vanilla, “to take away the smell of the pickles”. Because that’s what you have to do if you want to assimilate: go vanilla. But in the end, it’s Sam’s familiarity that draws Izzy to him.• This article was amended on 8 January 2021. Nia Vardalis is Greek-Canadian, not Greek-American, as an earlier version said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f4cd5f49e64ada15d810ed1b3175eb304984d488/0_315_1532_919/master/1532.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=6c119049c128bd45d604dfcabe45ec3a","title":"magic marine spurs fa cup","story":"My daughter learned there it was acceptable to shout on a terrace and Spurs will apparently change in the suite we’ve hired for our kids’ birthdaysWhen my daughter was little, I took her to watch Marine AFC play. Thrilled by the revelation that it was socially acceptable to shout your head off on the terrace, she yelled: “Come on you football match!!” She never uttered a truer sentiment. For a few blissful moments the crowd behind her took up the chant. It was empowering.And, Football Match did indeed come on. This Sunday, it’s Marine’s turn to embody the Magic of the FA Cup when they play Spurs – currently something like 160 places ahead of them, the biggest discrepancy at this stage in the competition’s history. José Mourinho’s team will apparently be using the Arriva Suite – which we’ve hired for our kids’ 18th birthdays – as their changing room.Sadly it will also be Marine’s turn to embody 2021. The greatest match the club has ever played will take place in front of no fans. I say no fans. In fact one side of the pitch is bordered by the back gardens of Rossett Road. Some residents are in the habit of watching the game from atop their garden walls or – in one case – their children’s slide rather than walk round the corner to the turnstile.Back in the heady days of Tier 2 there was a lot of banter about them Airbnb’ing their back bedrooms – with uninterrupted pitch views – to Spurs supporters. One of my sons had booked himself a tip-toe speck on a Rossett Road toilet seat. Those dreams have now burst like pretty bubbles in the air.Marine fans have to be made of stern stuff. “The game against Stalybridge,” says the club photographer Susan – Mrs. Marine – Nugent, “is annually scheduled for the wettest and coldest Tuesday night of the year. It’s often played without a shot on target.” She never misses it. When I talk to fans about highlights they will often name a coach trip to Kent – there and back in a day – to watch the club lose 4-3 to Dover Athletic in the second round of the FA Trophy.One arresting fact about lower-league sides is that while attendances rise when a club is doing well, they rise a lot more when a club is facing relegation. The coach trip to Dover may have been exciting but Susan enters a kind of ecstatic trance when describing The Great Escape – the time Marine avoided relegation in the closing moments of the 2014-15 season thanks to a 2-1 victory against Blyth Spartans. They sang all the way home, as though something more than football had been saved. What was that something?Adam Bretherton who helps run the unofficial fan group – the Crossender Way – started supporting Marine when he gave up his LFC season ticket in order to save up for a mortgage. “The first time I came down here the chairman – Paul Leary – was greeting people at the turnstile. He didn’t recognise me so he introduced himself. And I thought, this is good.”Adam and the other Crossenders noticed that the club didn’t do much in the way of social media so started to do their own post-match interviews. “I’d often had a few drinks so I was sometimes not that clear about who I was interviewing and whether they had actually played.” In the end, the official fan association were persuaded to start providing their own content.Part of the attraction of supporting a club like Marine is the fact that a fan like Adam can have an impact like that. Susan’s day job was environmental health officer. Mrs. Marine is her superhero identity. At Rossett Road a little girl can shout and be heard. The night the team qualified for this match by beating Havant and Waterlooville, my friend Stuart posted a photograph of the goalie Bayleigh Passant – still in his kit – dashing back from the Co-Op where he’d bought some carry out for his teammates.This togetherness is widely cited as an argument for the widespread belief that Marine will prevail on Sunday. That and the fact that it’s probably been a while since Spurs played on a pitch where the ball might have to be retrieved from someone’s back garden. I’ve been re-reading and recommending J.L.Carr’s novel How Steeple Sinderby Rovers Won the FA Cup, somehow forgetting that it’s a work of fiction not a handbook.I know I know, the FA Cup isn’t really magic. The main reason it holds such glamour for people of a certain age is that it was the only match that went out live on TV. On the estate where I grew up every window would have its curtains half drawn on the day to keep the sun off the screen. The fact that a Marine game is going to be televised is almost compensation for the fact that we won’t be watching it together.If this last terrible year could do one good thing it would be to move the definition of the word community away from its more recent meaning – online interest group – back towards its older, more challenging meaning – the people who live near you with whom you have to learn to get along with. The magic of Marine – and clubs like it all over the country – is the magic that will get us through these next few months.The magic of knowing that shared bad times – whether they be lockdowns or rainy nights in Stalybridge – can bring you together. The magic of knowing that we matter to each other. Indeed that we only matter at all in so far as we matter to each other.Frank Cottrell Boyce is a British screenwriter and novelist"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2c9873e5392548d689c093b075b12869a3574a0/886_345_3512_2107/master/3512.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=12688697f784244d6334e42176769472","title":"uk lockdowns fuel record year for home entertainment spending","story":"British consumers spent a record £9bn on entertainment last year as the pandemic fuelled a boom in the popularity of digital services such as Netflix, Amazon and Spotify while the public sought to alleviate lockdown boredom.Last year proved the biggest ever for new UK subscribers to streaming services, hitting 32m, more than double the number signed up to traditional pay-TV providers such as Sky, BT TV and Virgin Media.This week Netflix, the UK’s biggest streaming service with 13 million UK subscribers, raised its prices, with its most popular package increasing by £1 per month to £9.99.Disney’s Frozen II sold 973,000 copies including renting and buying or downloading a copy physically or digitally – as families sought to keep their children entertained while stuck at home.“If there was ever a year in which we needed entertainment, it was 2020,” said Kim Bayley, the chief executive of the ERA. “The trend towards an increasingly digital entertainment market may be long established, but no one could have foreseen this dramatic leap as digital services filled the gap left by shuttered cinemas, concert halls and retail stores.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f41e0c4ae28cb232ebba5ec59c05b0e9b081e8d/13_460_2581_1548/master/2581.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=e79375e37a8ea064a928d599261b0f3d","title":"wealthy london home food bank hotspot naomi russell property pandemic","story":"Naomi Russell reveals what inspired her to turn her multimillion-pound property into a food distribution lifelineIt is not what you would expect to find on one of the most expensive streets in the country. But these are unusual times.Naomi Russell has transformed her multimillion-pound home overlooking Hampstead Heath, north London, into a food bank distribution centre, helping hundreds of people struggling to feed their families during the coronavirus pandemic.A pink gazebo dominates Russell’s driveway and acts as a drop-off point for donations. Her car and her husband’s have been shunted out of the double garage to make way for hundreds of boxes storing everything from pasta and fresh fruit to chocolate and exotic spices. And, most importantly, Russell says, box upon box of toiletries, loo roll, nappies and baby milk formula.“It’s not what people expect to encounter around here, that’s true,” Russell said of her makeshift food warehouse on a road that winds its way from Highgate West Hill towards the wild swimming ponds on the heath.“Because of where we are right by the heath, we sometimes have 100-200 people a day spotting us and coming in here to see what’s going on. No one expects to find a food bank distribution centre here.”Russell said she decided to do something to help people struggling with the fallout of the pandemic early on in the crisis. “It was terrible to see what was happening, and the lack of government support. We had to do something,” she said.“Hundreds of people were suddenly out of work, and literally couldn’t put food on the table. People who would have had a salary, now have nothing, and have to wait six weeks to get into the benefit system.”The heavy footfall of walkers passing Russell’s home has been ideal for recruiting volunteers to help with collecting, organising and delivering supplies to 15 nearby food banks.“I’ve met all my neighbours now, right up down and round the street. Many of them are helping out,” Russell said. “And then there are all the walkers and joggers out on the heath. People will see us working, and wonder – like you did – what’s going on here? They come over and have chat, they are very surprised that this a food bank donation spot. They don’t think of that sort of thing happening here.“They will see me working and ask about the house. They are often very shocked. I don’t think they expect the person who owns this house to be working in a food bank.”Russell said during the first lockdown she would see a jogger at precisely 07:30 every day, and sometimes again at 19:30 when he would head out on a then-rule-breaking second jog. “After a few weeks he stopped and asked, ‘What are you doing out here all day?’. I told him, and now he is one of most dedicated volunteers.”Russell is not alone in turning her home into a food bank collection point. She formed Food Bank Aid, which supplies food and essential items to food banks across north London, with Jo Rosenblatt. A dozen other homes in the area also act as drop-off points.Similar grassroots charitable ventures have formed across the country. But Russell’s stands out as unique because of its position on a street where homes change hands for more than £6m.Emma Revie, the chief executive of the trust, said: “Throughout 2020, communities across the country have stepped in to provide vital support to people left without enough money.“Volunteers in food banks have been working hard under extremely difficult circumstances to make sure support is there for people struggling to afford essentials. But it’s not right that any of us are forced to a charity for food, at any time of year.Russell and Rosenblatt said they had at times been overwhelmed by the generosity of people donating supplies, particularly during the October half-term when the government had refused to provide free holiday lunches despite a high-profile campaign by the England footballer Marcus Rashford.“During the Marcus Rashford period it went absolutely insane,” Russell said. “We got more than double we usually did. In fact there was a day when I actually had to say to people can you keep it and bring stuff in the next few weeks instead. We had queues of cars waiting to drop stuff off.”They said many people would do two weekly shops at the supermarket – one for their own household and one to donate to the food bank. Others order groceries online to be delivered directly to Russell’s home. “One Ocado man said it was the biggest order he had ever delivered,” Russell said. “It was half of his entire truck.”The Ocado driver was so struck by Russell’s work that he also volunteers doing deliveries for the food bank in his spare time.One of the centres supplied by Russell and Rosenblatt is Finchley food bank, three miles to the north. Anna Maughan, who runs it, said the service was supplying more than double the number of households it was catering to before the pandemic.“We’ve never been so busy,” Maughan said. “We started with a handful of households, but it just grew and grew and now we regularly support 50 households.” During the summer, 110 households queued for supplies.“There has been a huge rise in people who are desperate for support. It is people on zero-contract-type hours, the people who were just getting by prior to the pandemic and are no longer getting by not getting by at all,” she said.“It’s anyone that didn’t have a buffer. Some of them are people that would never have expected to come to a food bank, but now have no choice. We have also seen big rise in people seeking support who have entered a refuge.”The food banks said they had received enough items to support families over Christmas, the time of year when people were most generous in providing donations. But they fear supplies could now run low, when donations dwindle as many people discover the size of their Christmas credit card bill."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/040312e79121422c3b08f8b793eae3a846ee3dba/0_258_7743_4649/master/7743.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=0df57dfb4195571fe13c4e16b66a3f9a","title":"moderna covid vaccine approved for use by uk medicines regulator","story":"Britain’s third jab to receive clearance for public use will not be available until the springThe Moderna coronavirus vaccine has been approved for use in the UK.The jab is the third to be given the green light by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), along with the Covid-19 vaccines from PfizerBioNTech and OxfordAstraZeneca.

It received a “significant” delivery of the PfizerBioNTech vaccine on 23 and 27 December. It then took in 22,000 doses of the OxfordAstraZeneca on Monday and is due to receive 25,000 doses next week and 80,000 the week after that.But Drakeford said: “We need to know beyond three weeks. To be able to plan for the maximum delivery you need a reliable sense of how many doses you are going to have available.”Wales has so far vaccinated relatively fewer people than other UK nations but Drakeford said: “Vaccination is neither a sprint nor a contest.”He said the roll-out of the vaccination programme would continue “getting faster in the weeks ahead”, with the number of vaccination centres rising to 35.By the end of the month, 250 GP practices in Wales will be administering vaccines and there are already 14 mobile units providing vaccinations to care homes around the country.“All frontline ambulance staff in Wales will have had their first dose by next week and we will be extending vaccination to staff working in special schools and to school and college staff who are at risk,” he saidThe vast majority of Scottish university and college students are expected to work from home until early March and will then only be allowed back onto campus in stages, the Scottish government has said.Ministers have scrapped plans for a staggered return to college and university which had been due to start on 25 January, with only students who are already living on campus or with critical teaching needs allowed to be campus. Apart from a second group of students close to graduation who must study on campus, who will be allowed back from 15 February, everyone else must remain working from home, said Richard Lochhead, the higher education minister.Halls of residence were epicentres for major outbreaks when students arrived universities in August and September last year, with significant hotspots in Glasgow, Aberdeen and Edinburgh.Lochhead said: “The return of students to campus, including returning to term-time accommodation, involves the mass movement of thousands of people across the country. The mixing of people on that scale, including the potential movement of tens of thousands of students to university halls and private-rented flats, simply isn’t safe right now. It would fuel the virus, and that is something no one wants.“Our immediate priority right now is to say to students, other than in specific special circumstances, they must not return to their campus or term-time accommodation before they are specifically told to do so by their institution.”Sources in government have told the BBC’s health and science correspondent, James Gallagher, that they believe Covid-19 infections in England are running at above 100,000 a day.The prime minister has welcomed the MHRA approval for the Moderna vaccine, the third vaccine to be given the green light for use in the UK.The mayor of London said he had written to Boris Johnson asking for more financial support for Londoners who need to self-isolate and are unable to work, and for daily vaccination data.Sadiq Khan is also asking for the closure of places of worship and for face masks to be worn routinely outside of the home, including in crowded places and supermarket queues.Major incidents have previously been declared in London for the Grenfell Tower fire in 2017 and the terror attacks at Westminster Bridge and London Bridge.Making the announcement in London, Sadiq Khan said: “We are declaring a major incident because the threat this virus poses to our city is at crisis point.“If we do not take immediate action now, our NHS could be overwhelmed and more people will die.“Londoners continue to make huge sacrifices and I am today imploring them to please stat at home unless it is absolutely necessary for you to leave.” The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has declared an effective emergency in the city, as it grapples with soaring coronavirus case numbers and hospitals struggling to cope with the influx of patients.London has been the worst-hit area of the UK so far in the winter peak of Covid-19 cases.Speaking alongside Boris Johnson at a Downing Street press conference on Thursday, Simon Stevens, the chief executive of NHS England, said hospitals in London were now receiving 800 Covid patients a day, the equivalent of the entire capacity of St Thomas’, one of the capital’s flagship hospitals.Scotland’s chief constable, Ian Livingstone, has urged people to report any incidents or suspicions of domestic abuse to the police after warning the renewed lockdown could lead to an increase in domestic violence cases.Livingstone said protecting vulnerable women and children living in risky situations at home “goes to the heart of our purpose, goes to the heart of our mission”.Speaking during the Scottish government’s regular coronavirus briefings, he added: “We would urge anyone, everyone with concerns about another person - a relative, a neighbour, a friend or a colleague, to call the police.”Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, said the “stay at home” order in force across mainland Scotland did not mean victims of domestic abuse had to endure it. The restrictions “do not prevent you from leaving home”, she said. Additional funding had been given to women’s aid and anti-domestic violence charities, she said, to support women in crisis. Around eight in 10 recent positive cases of Covid-19 in London and eastern England could be the new variant of Covid-19, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).Police have handed out more than 30,000 fines under coronavirus laws since the start of the pandemic, figures show.A total of 32,329 fixed penalty notices (FPNs) were issued by forces across England and Wales between March 27 and December 21, according to the National Police Chiefs’ Council (NPCC).Data published on Friday showed 28,744 were handed out by forces in England. In Wales, forces issued 3,585. The figures include those handed out by British Transport Police and Ministry of Defence police.Coronavirus rates have begun to “creep up again” in Wales after beginning to drop in the post-Christmas period and the new variant has a “firm foothold” in the north of the country, the Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford has said.“On Monday, there were around 440 cases per 100,000 people in Wales. Today, this is more than 20 points higher,” Drakeford told a press conference in Cardiff.“It is still the case that around one in four tests is positive for coronavirus, and that demonstrates that we still have very high levels of this virus circulating in the community in Wales.”Drakeford said the new strain of coronavirus was “undoubtedly adding to the pressures that our NHS is experiencing at the moment”.More than 2,700 coronavirus-related patients are in Welsh hospitals, with 143 people with Covid-19 in critical care beds.“Overall, the number of people in critical care has reached the highest point in the pandemic,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0002134db788022c0e9e3849bbc920323c602b6e/0_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=05510c2f2f4f64ae405e2236a70a0155","title":"which countries have reported new uk covid variant","story":"The visuals show 13 countries have recorded community transmission of UK variant, as 24 experience rising case ratesForty-five countries have so far identified the UK coronavirus variant, with experts warning that more countries could report sharp increases in cases in the coming weeks.Thirteen of these nations have recorded community transmission of the B117 variant, which spreads faster and has helped pushed England into a third lockdown.With planes capable of carrying a total of more than 8 million passengers scheduled to leave the UK between October and December, and poor surveillance likely to have missed cases of the variant abroad, there are concerns it may already be seeded in other countries at a low level.While it is impossible to know where exactly the variant is and how cases will develop in the future, the following visuals help show its whereabouts and which countries are suffering from increases in Covid-19.Countries including France, Spain, Portugal, Germany and Italy have identified local transmission, according to the Cov-lineages.org tracking website.The US – which on Wednesday reported a record daily death toll – has also identified local transmission in five inidual states.It is not yet clear how strict border controls and quarantine measures will contain the international spread of the variant.But even before a host of countries closed their borders to the UK over the Christmas period, hundreds of thousands of people had flown from the UK to other countries.Figures provided by the travel data company OAG show that flights with a combined capacity of more than 8 million were scheduled to depart the UK from October to December. While the statistics do not account for some short-notice cancellations and it is not known how many passengers ultimately boarded the planes, the numbers suggest hundreds of thousands of people travelled from the UK as the variant took hold.The top destination for flights leaving the UK was Spain, which imposed a travel ban on 22 December, three months after the variant was first sequenced.Experts warn this is likely to have spread the variant across the world already, and that it is only a matter of time before it is identified in greater numbers.Martin McKee, a professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene \u0026amp Tropical Medicine, warned of large events causing new increases at a time when the variant was likely circulating.“The UK variant smouldered from 20 September for several months before taking off – probably because it took a while to reach a few super-spreader events. The same is likely true in other countries where the UK version is circulating at low levels.”While it is hard to link the rise in the number of cases with variants without good surveillance, data from Johns Hopkins University reveals several other countries alongside the UK are already suffering increases in infection after the Christmas period. Twenty-four countries recorded more new coronavirus cases in the week ending 4 January than the week ending 21 December.

Dara Mac DónaillThe  FileMinister for Finance Paschal Donohoe has said that the Government will focus on how special needs and vulnerable students will be supported while schools remain closed.On Friday morning, the Minister said the Government had reversed its decision on the opening of schools next week as to do would have required the “absolute involvement” of teachers.Minister for Education Norma Foley had engaged in numerous discussions with the unions and the Government had gone ahead with its announcement with the expectation of agreement being reached.It was now important to focus on the welfare of children and their needs and to ensure that remote learning met with their expectations, Mr Donohoe told Newstalk Breakfast.A decision on whether the Leaving Cert in 2021 would go ahead in the traditional format needed to be approached “in a calm and judicious manner,” he said.The Minister defended the pace of the vaccination programme and said it was dependent on the availability of the vaccine, what could change the pace was if there was approval for further vaccines.It was important for businesses to be aware that there would be “significant contingency supports” available.Mr Donohoe’s comments come after the Government reversed its decision to partially reopen schools in the State from Monday.The Government also abandoned plans to bring Leaving Certificate students into class for three days a week from next week amid mounting opposition from teachers and principals. The move is pending “further engagement with all education stakeholders”, said Minister for Education Norma Foley.The U-turn came less than 24 hours after the plan to bring up to 60,000 Leaving Cert students and an estimated 18,000 pupils in special schools and special classes back to school next week was announced at a Government briefing on new lockdown measures. The Government said the plan was for all other children to be taught remotely.In a statement on Thursday night, Ms Foley confirmed all schools would now remain closed from Monday January 11th.From this date, all students, including children with special needs, “will resort to a programme of remote learning in line with the rest of the Government restrictions”.Ms Foley’s statement came after confirmation by the two main secondary school teachers’ unions that they would not be co-operating with the initial plan to reopen schools on Monday.‘Huge shock’On Friday, an autism support charity said the decision reversal came as a “huge shock”.“Up to last night our families were preparing” (for a return to school), chief executive of the autism support charity As I am, Adam Harris, said. There was a “sense of devastation” that this much needed support was being “stripped away”, he said.Mr Harris called for therapeutic supports for the families of children with autism for whom remote learning does not work.Mr Harris told RTÉ radio’s Morning Ireland that the decision on Thursday night was a missed opportunity for children with special needs.He pointed out that 61 per cent of children with autism lost key skills during the last lockdown. Remote learning does not work and “they need in-school support,” he said.On Friday, Labour’s education spokesperson Aodhán Ó Ríordáin called on the Government to make a decision on the Leaving Certificate 2021.Mr Ó Ríordáin pointed out that every part of the UK had made a call on state exams. “The call has to be made in February,” he told Newstalk Breakfast.“Are we doing all of this (school closures) in favour of a written exam in the summer?”Leaving Cert students had missed 11 weeks of school last year and there was no guarantee that they were going to be back in school by mid term or by St Patrick’s Day, said Mr Ó Ríordáin.He said students teachers and parents did not want to be this situation “but the numbers have exploded”.Mr O Ríordáin said parents had been prepared “to vote with their feet” and their children would not have returned to school next week.He went on to criticise the Government for not consulting fully with unions prior to making the initial decision to keep schools open three days a week for Leaving Cert students and for not getting “a specific sign off” from Nphet.The president of the Association of Secondary Teachers in Ireland (ASTI), Ann Piggott, told the same programme that she thought people were relieved at the Government’s “U-turn” on the return to school.It would be better for schools to remain closed for two weeks and then to look at the situation again if the number of Covid cases had begun to reduce, she said.The largest managerial body for secondary schools, meanwhile, said it supported Minister Foley’s decision to postpone the reopening of our schools for specific groups of students from Monday next, pending further engagement with the education partners.  Our students will be provided with a programme of remote teaching and learning until schools can be safely and fully reopened, and we would hope that this can occur in as timely a manner as possible. We look forward to working with the Minister and the relevant stakeholders to this effect, said John Curtis, the JMB\u0027s general secretary.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Company delivered 14m parcels in December, double the level of same period in 2019About 335,600 people will receive the benefit this week"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4453135.1610102486!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"temperatures to drop as low as 8 degrees on friday night","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWidespread frosty conditions have been forecast.

Photograph: iStockPersistent ill-health can result from contracting Covid-19 regardless of the severity of the initial infection, according to the findings of a new study by a team of Irish researchers.In what was the first global study of its kind, researchers from Trinity College Dublin assessed lung function and respiratory symptoms among 153 patients infected with Covid-19, including those who self-isolated at home and others who required ICU care in hospital.The study’s lead author, Liam Townsend, research fellow at TCD’s Department of Clinical Medicine and specialist registrar at St James’s Hospital, said little had previously been known about lung health following infection with the virus that causes Covid-19 and whether there were links between respiratory problems, fatigue and ill-health and the initial severity of the disease.While fatigue, ill-health and breathlessness were all common symptoms as a result of Covid-19 infection, Dr Townsend said they appeared to be unrelated to the severity of the initial infection.Chest X-rayAll patients who participated in the study were given a chest X-ray and six-minute walk test.Dr Townsend admitted that researchers were surprised at the findings of the study, which is published in the latest edition of the Annals of the American Thoracic Society.“We expected a greater number of abnormal chest X-rays. We also expected the measures of ongoing ill-health and abnormal findings to be related to the severity of initial infection, which was not the case,” Dr Townsend said.Researchers examined a number of measures of recovery for the patients who attended an outpatient clinic, with a median of 75 days after they had been diagnosed with Covid-19.The findings of the study suggest that Covid-19 does not cause significant fibrosis as only 4 per cent of patients showed signs of lung scarring on CT scans.‘Full health’It found that 62 per cent of patients felt they had not returned to full health, while 47 per cent were classified as having fatigue.“Patients who felt they had to exert themselves during moderate exercise also reported they felt fatigue and poor health,” Dr Townsend said.He said the findings showed patients experienced significant symptoms, but there was a relatively low rate of people with abnormal X-rays.Dr Townsend said the results highlighted how there is no simple diagnostic test to predict which patients with Covid-19 will suffer long-term effects such as fatigue.Dr Townsend said it was important that all patients diagnosed with Covid-19 received follow-up treatment, irrespective of whether they suffered mild or severe infection.The study suggested the highest-risk group for suffering post-Covid symptoms appeared to be females under 60 years, which Dr Townsend said indicated genetic factors might be a factor."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4453218.1610111987!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"covid 19 ni to require travellers to take pre departure test","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA sign for Covid-19 test results at London Stansted Airport, UK, on Friday. Photograph: Chris RatcliffeBloombergNorthern Ireland is to require incoming travellers to undertake pre-departure testing for Covid-19.British transport secretary Grant Shapps has already set out new rules which, from next week, will require passengers arriving in England by boat, train or plane — including UK nationals — to take a test up to 72 hours before leaving the country of departure.Failure to comply will lead to an immediate £500 (€555)fine.Northern Ireland’s Minister for Health Robin Swann said: “I have agreed in principle to the proposed pre-departure testing regime for Northern Ireland.“Officials are currently working with colleagues across the UK to resolve policy and operational issues around an effective implementation.“This will strengthen our response to the changes seen in the transmission of the virus both domestically and across the globe.“Taken together with the existing mandatory self-isolation period for passengers returning from high-risk countries, pre-departure tests will provide a further line of defence — helping us control the virus as we roll out the vaccine at pace over the coming weeks.” People entering England and Scotland will have to show a negative Covid-19 test result starting next week as authorities try to ramp up protection against new, more infectious strains of the coronavirus from other countries.“We already have significant measures in place to prevent imported cases of Covid-19, but with new strains of the virus developing internationally we must take further precautions,” said Mr Shapps.He said there were concerns that vaccines might not work properly against the highly transmissible variant of the coronavirus discovered in South Africa, echoing recent comments from other government officials.On Thursday, Britain said it would extend a ban on travellers entering England from South Africa to include other southern African countries, and non-essential travel in and out of the United Kingdom is restricted.Prime minister Boris Johnson ordered a new lockdown for England this week after a surge in cases linked to another variant of the virus believed to have originated in the country.Scotland, which like the rest of the United Kingdom has tight Covid-19 restrictions in place, said it too would require travellers to show negative tests and the rule is also expected to be applied by Wales.Passengers from many countries are currently required to self-isolate for 10 days, or five if they pay for a private test and test negative. Those requirements will remain in place after the new pre-departure testing rule comes into effect.Britain’s airlines industry recognised the need to introduce pre-departure testing but said it should be only a short-term, emergency measure.“Once the roll-out of the vaccine accelerates, the focus must be on returning travel to normal as quickly as possible in order to support the UK’s economic recovery,” said Tim Alderslade, chief executive of Airlines UK, an industry group.“What we’d like to see is that testing before you take off becomes the standard as an alternative to quarantine,” said John Holland-Kaye, chief executive of Britain’s biggest airport Heathrow.Travel to and from Britain has been almost wiped out by Covid-19 and the quarantine requirements, leaving many airlines and airports fighting for survival.Exemptions to the new testing requirement rule in England would be offered to hauliers, children under 11, crews and people travelling from countries where tests are not available. – PAReutersEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4452645.1610048143!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"north s chief vet gives assurance on assistance dogs post brexit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tNew arrangements for bringing pets and assistance dogs to Northern Ireland from Great Britain are in effect following the end of the Brexit transition period on January 1st. The North’s Chief Veterinary Officer has pledged that assistance dogs will not be prevented from entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain despite new rules covering the travel of pets across the Irish Sea border. “No genuine assistance dog will be turned back,” Robert Huey said. “We will find a way of doing it. “I don’t want to say much more because I’d be admitting to breaking the law so I’m not going to go there.”While he warned that he would not “buy everything being an assistance dog”, genuine assistance dogs will not be turned back.Mr Huey appeared before the Stormont Agriculture Committee on Thursday, and was questioned by MLAs about new arrangements for bringing pets and assistance dogs to Northern Ireland from Great Britain following the end of the Brexit transition period on January 1st. The UK has Part 2 listed status under the EU Pet Travel Scheme, which means that pet dogs and assistance dogs, as well as cats and ferrets, ravelling from Great Britain to Northern Ireland must have an Animal Health Certificate (AHC) from a vet and arrive through an official point of entry. They must also be vaccinated against rabies and dogs must be treated for tapeworm. Neither disease is present on the island of Ireland. There is no such requirement for pets or assistance dogs travelling from Northern Ireland to Great Britain. ‘Common sense’ Minister for Agriculture and the Environment, the DUP MLA Edwin Poots, wrote to the UK’s Secretary for Agriculture and to the European Commission on Thursday asking for a Common Travel Area for pets to be applied between Great Britain and the island of Ireland.This, he said, was “common sense” and would “alleviate the real and serious concerns of pet travelers across all jurisdictions.” He said the difficulties caused to assistance dog owners and assistance training puppies meant “some of the most vulnerable in our society are being directly affected. This cannot and must not be the case,” he said. The Chief Veterinary Officer said officials in Northern Ireland would not enforce the new rules until February 1st “to give people a chance to get ready.” The new requirements, he said, were “onerous and it is expensive and in my view it’s unnecessary.” His officials, Mr Huey said, had been working with colleagues in London and Dublin to try to find a resolution, and while he was hopeful it would be solved, he did not believe it would be soon. “I was hopeful that at an operational level I would be able to find some room for pragmatism but the legislation is written in a very black and white way, I can find no wiggle at all, so I have no alternative but to enforce this legislation,” he said. “We’ll be doing it sensitively, pragmatically and sensibly as far as we can, but I am not happy with the situation we find ourselves in, my minister isn’t happy with the situation we find ourselves in, and we’ll be doing all we can to try and mitigate this problem.” In a statement on its website, the UK government said it recognised the changes would take time to adjust to and it was working with the authorities in the North “on an enforcement approach that takes this challenge into account. “This approach will be implemented in a way which supports pet owners and assistance dog users while the Government pursues a permanent solution,” it said.

Photograph: iStockThere was a 67 per cent decrease in the number of enforcement orders served on businesses for breaches of food safety legislation in 2020. The Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) said recurring issues that led to orders last year included unregistered and unsupervised food businesses, filthy conditions, evidence of rodent infestations and droppings, the presence of cockroaches, failure to maintain temperatures of foodstuffs,unsuitable food storage facilities and improper or lack of water facilities. There were 42 enforcement orders served last year in comparison to 125 in 2019. The FSAI said the drop in numbers largely reflects the impact of Covid-19, “where large numbers of food service businesses were temporarily closed for long periods throughout the year, and is not necessarily due to improved food safety practices”. The kitchen area of a bar in Roscommon was the only premises served with a closure order in December. Hayloft Bar in Strokestown had to close its kitchen after the HSE found “there was a grave and immediate danger to public health” as there weren’t the necessary facilities to ensure “that food produced is protected against contamination”.“There was no running hot or cold water at the staff toilet or the sinks in the food room for the cleaning of food, crockery and cutlery,” the HSE added. The closure order on the kitchen area was served on December 11th and was subsequently lifted 10 days later. Last year, 31 closure orders, two improvement orders and 9 prohibition orders were issued by environmental health officers in the HSE, veterinary inspectors in the local authorities and officers of the FSAI on food businesses throughout the country.Dr Pamela Byrne, chief executive of the FSAI, said there continues to be “a minority of food businesses not complying with their legal requirements”. “All food businesses must recognise that they are legally bound to ensure that the food they produce is safe to eat,” Dr Byrne said.“Consumers have a right to safe food.

Photograph: Alan Betson The The young tech entrepreneur and founder of Evervault, Shane Curran, has outlined his hopes that his 18-month old company will “build the encryption engine for the internet”.Its company mission was straight forward – “encrypt the web” underpinned by a wish that data never exist unencrypted – the 20-year-old said at BT Young Scientist \u0026amp Technology Exhibition (BTYSTE) event featuring his relationship with the annual contest. He entered four times and won the overall award in 2017. Asked about the next big thing in IT, he said a lot of work is concentrated on encrypting data and processing it without ever seeing it “an up-and-coming field that companies need to do a lot more work on”.Last year Curran (20) raised $16 million (€14.5 million) from some of the biggest names in Silicon Valley investment for his data privacy technology company. They included previous investors in tech giants such as Facebook, Deliveroo, Revolut and another Irish-led tech success, Intercom.Evervault is building a ground-breaking data-privacy interface that developers can use when creating software. The idea is to ensure data is secured from day one rather than being an afterthought as they rush to market with a product, he said at the virtual event.It has its origins in his winning BTYSTE project, qCrypt, which involved research in cryptography and data privacy.Though growth in internet business is showing “some slight signs of slowing”, sheer user numbers were “absolutely crazy” at 3.5 billion – and predicted to reach 5 billion by the end of the decade, he noted. Covid-19 forced growth in those numbers at a quicker pace, which meant more digital services and data volumes.Much more products were coming on stream as a consequence, even some that did not necessarily need to go online, he believed. With Google and Apple signalling they are going more into healthcare, data safety issues were becoming even more important due to the sensitivity associated with medical data.Participating in the BTYSTE was about getting better at pitching your project over a few concentrated days, and explaining it to different audiences a process that is mirrored in real-life where there is a similar requirement. You may have concerns and worries “but you get better at masking that”.Asked about big learnings from the contest, he said, it was striking how people tend to underestimate teenagers in terms of what they can do with the right amount of ambition and support. Participants may be in their formative years, especially in terms of what they do later in life including going to college, but given the right space they were well capable of developing solutions and creating products of significance.The BTYSTE, backed by the calibre of judges it had in place, provided that opportunity, though he finds young people may be reluctant to back themselves in terms of embracing big projects. “Those that do are the ones who do best,” Curran added.On developing digital products, he believed “crazy complexities” were not involved. The most important thing was “being obsessed with your customers” rather than being caught up in raising funding. The reality of his job was that he was spending most of his time doing code, while engaging in the not glamorous task of writing “a well-crafted cold email” to a potential customer.Asked what it’s like when previous BTYSTE winners get together – as they do regularly – he referred to the Picasso quote: “When artists get together they talk about where you can buy cheap turpentine.” It is a case of hanging out together with friends, rather than trying to impress each other."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4452610.1610045526!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"vaccine scepticism among medics sparks alarm in europe and us","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA resident of a nursing home getting   the BioNTech-Pfizer  Covid-19 vaccine in Cologne, Germany. Photograph: AP PhotoMartin MeissnerSigns that a relatively high number of healthcare workers are unwilling to receive the coronavirus vaccine in some parts of Europe and the US have alarmed politicians and health experts, as countries struggle to contain a surge in infections and carry out mass vaccination.A poll released in mid-December caused surprise in Germany – the country that has been at the forefront of the race for a vaccine with biotech company BioNTech – by showing that half of surveyed nurses did not want to be vaccinated, along with a quarter of doctors. Those worries came back to the fore this week when the head of one German state said only a third of healthcare workers in his state were willing to get the jab.A high degree of reluctance among medical staff has also been observed in other parts of Europe and in the US. In France 76 per cent of senior care home staff said they did not want to get vaccinated, according to a poll of 2,000 such workers carried out last month.In Austria only half of the staff of care facilities in the region of Vorarlberg said they were willing to be inoculated, according to Austria’s public broadcaster. The Italian Federation of Medical Professional Associations said about 100 doctors were unwilling to receive the immunisation across the country.In the US a survey released last month by the Kaiser Family Foundation health think-tank found that 29 per cent of US healthcare workers would probably or definitely not get a vaccine, a slightly higher proportion than in the overall population (27 per cent). HesitantAnecdotal evidence from the first weeks of rollout in the US suggests staff at care homes are particularly hesitant to be vaccinated.Mike DeWine, the governor of Ohio, said recently he was “troubled” by the relatively low numbers of nursing home workers taking the vaccine, with around 60 per cent of nursing home staff having declined the shot.Asked about vaccine hesitancy among health workers on Wednesday, Germany’s health minister Jens Spahn said his ministry had only anecdotal data, with starkly ergent results. In some nursing homes, he said, only 20 per cent of medics received a jab, while in others it was as high as 80 per cent. But he said data showed regular flu vaccines among medics was “unfortunately very, very below average”.“Promoting vaccination of healthcare workers is very important. We work in an environment full of vulnerable people, it is our responsibility to get it,” said Uwe Janssens, the author of the German survey released last month. “If people see healthcare workers are unconvinced, how will that affect our society?”Dr Janssens, general secretary of the German Society for Internal Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine, decided to conduct his survey after being shocked to hear several nurses express concerns over the new mRNA technology, used by the two EU-approved vaccines BioNTech-Pfizer and Moderna. Among the 2,305 survey respondents, many feared long-term side effects, while female nursing staff expressed concerns over their ability to get pregnant. Many interviewed, he said, appeared to have seen anti-vaccination videos spread online.Vaccine scepticism may already be affecting healthcare in parts of Germany. On Tuesday, Bodo Ramelow, head of the state of Thuringia, cited one clinic in the city of Eisenach that stopped taking Covid-19 patients – not because it was short on hospital beds, but because 100 employees were themselves sick or in quarantine.“This leads to a real problem because we want to make sure that these people, who work so very close to the virus, have the highest protection,” Mr Ramelow told MDR television. “I plead to everyone to go get it.” Health riskGermany, which is struggling to contain a second surge in Covid-19 infections, has imposed no legal requirement to take the vaccine, though some lawyers specialising in labour rights say medics could potentially face dismissal should their employers argue they were posing a health risk to patients.In Italy authorities are investigating 13 doctors accused of anti-vaccine propaganda or playing down the severity of the virus.“I am perplexed when I hear of fellow doctors or nurses reluctant to get the vaccine,” said Pierpaolo Sileri, Italy’s deputy health minister. “I can understand it regarding a member of the public who perhaps does not have the scientific understanding, but frankly, I think that those doctors and nurses, if they still have doubts after seeing everything that’s happened, are probably in the wrong job.”Markus Söder, head of Germany’s state of Bavaria, said on Tuesday that a public campaign was needed “to drum up support, not only for more vaccines, but also willingness to accept this vaccine. This will be a subject of tense debate.”The latest polls on vaccine acceptance, however, suggest that the public is not growing more confident. In the spring, 79 per cent of respondents to Germany’s University of Erfurt survey were willing to be vaccinated, while in September that number had dropped to 56 per cent. Last month, a YouGov poll suggested 32 per cent of Germans were immediately willing to be inoculated, while another 33 per cent wanted to see how the first round of vaccination went.In France, amid a slow rollout of the vaccination campaign, only 40 per cent of French people polled by Ipsos last week said they planned to be vaccinated, down from 54 per cent in October and 59 per cent in August.Despite the wariness, Dr Janssens said he believed the tide would turn among medics after the first round. “I am hopeful then others will follow. But it’s a very important signal that we need to give these people information now.” – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2021Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4453150.1610103091!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"put the coffee on the rioters who stormed the us capitol","story":"More views from inside the mayhem, confusion and chaos at the Capitol as Trump supporters entered and disrupted certification of the Electoral College results.

Others were more anonymous, people who had journeyed from Indiana and South Carolina to heed President Donald Trump’s call to show their support. One person, a West Virginia lawmaker, had only been elected to office in November.All of them converged on Wednesday on the grounds of the US Capitol, where hundreds of rioters crashed through barricades, climbed through windows and walked through doors, wandering around the hallways with a sense of gleeful desecration, because, for a few breathtaking hours, they believed that they had displaced the very elites they said they hated.“We wanted to show these politicians that it’s us who’s in charge, not them,” said a construction worker from Indianapolis, who is 40 and identified himself only as Aaron. He declined to give his last name, saying, “I’m not that dumb.” He added: “We’ve got the strength.”As the US sifts through the shards of what happened in Washington on Wednesday, what comes into focus in the storming of the Capitol is a jumbled constellation of hardcore Trump supporters: a largely white crowd, many of them armed with bats, shields and chemical spray some carried Confederate flags and wore costumes of fur and horns inspired by QAnon they were mostly men, but there were women, too.Those who stormed the Capitol were just one slice of the thousands of Trump supporters who had descended on Washington to protest against the certification of Joe Biden’s victory in November over Trump. Their breach came with a confused and frenzied energy, fuelled by the words of Trump just minutes before and the fervour of the mob standing behind them.Washington’s politan Police Department said it had made no additional arrests on Thursday connected to the rioting, during which one woman was fatally shot by the Capitol police and a Capitol police officer suffered injuries from which he later died.On Wednesday, the politan Police detained 68 people, plus the 14 picked up by the Capitol police during the unrest. Dozens more people were still being sought by federal authorities.Rotunda selfiesTheir number included a 60-year-old gun rights activist from Arkansas who was pictured sitting in speaker Nancy Pelosi’s office, men in tactical gear taking selfies in the rotunda and a woman in the House chamber, carrying a QAnon-inspired sign about children.Some of those who had also surged forward in the crowd seemed to show a bewildered wonder at what they were seeing in front of them. A few remarked on the opulence of the Capitol building and offices, a quality that seemed to confirm their suspicions about the corruption of Washington.“Yeah look at all this fancy furniture they have,” said a man in a winter parka and red hat, standing on the west side of the Capitol and peering through the glass at empty desks, computer screens and ergonomic chairs. Several people banged on the windows with their fists, including one man who shouted, “Put the coffee on!” One man hit his head, not seeing the outer layer of glass was there, it was so clean.As people rushed inside, there was a strange mix of confusion and excitement, and the almost complete lack of police presence in the beginning amplified the feeling of lawlessness. They gawked at a place of wealth and beauty, adorned with art and marble, a domain of the powerful, and for a short while on Wednesday afternoon, the rioters were in control. For once, they felt, they could not be ignored.Aaron, the construction worker from Indianapolis, and his two friends had heard people talking about going to Pelosi’s office. So once inside they decided to instead find senator Chuck Schumer’s office. Both are Democrats.“We wanted to have a few words” with Schumer, he said. “He’s probably the most corrupt guy up here. You don’t hear too much about him. But he’s slimy. You can just see it.”Smoking cigarettesBut they could not find Schumer’s office. He said they asked a Capitol police officer, who tried to direct them. But they appeared to have gotten nowhere near the minority’s leader’s office. They ended up smoking a few cigarettes inside the building – “We can smoke in our house,” Aaron said – and one of his friends, who would not give his name, joked that he had gone to the bathroom and not flushed.A woman in a coat sat on the couch in a small room with a blue carpet and watched as a man ripped a scroll with Chinese lettering hanging on the wall. “We don’t want Chinese bullshit,” the woman said. Nearby, six men sat at a large wooden desk. A lamp with a white shade was knocked over and broken.Someone was smoking pot. “This is the pot room!” a young man said.In the Crypt, people walked around taking photographs of the statues and themselves with their phones. One man had a selfie stick, like a tourist in a foreign land. A woman in baggy jeans and a blue puffer jacket was shouting chants into a megaphone, while a man in a black T-shirt that read “Not Today Liberal” ran around the central columns in what looked like a frenetic victory lap.As authorities try to identify those in the mob, some will be less hard to pin down than others. The group included some well-known figures from the conspiratorial right, including Jake Angeli, who has pushed the false QAnon claims that Trump was elected to save the US from deep-state bureaucrats and prominent Democrats who worship Satan and abuse children.He was pictured sitting in Congress in a Viking helmet and furs. Angeli, who is known as the “Q Shaman”, has been a fixture in the pro-Trump protests in Arizona since the election, and there are indications that he and other right-wing activists had planned to spark a confrontation with authorities before Wednesday’s rally.Murder the MediaThere were also leaders from the Proud Boys, a far-right group whose participants have espoused misogynistic and anti-immigrant views, such as Nick Ochs, a failed Hawaii state legislature candidate and member of a collective called “Murder the Media”.Chris Hood and members of his National Socialist Club, a neo-Nazi group, posted photos on Telegram from outside the Capitol on Wednesday. And the Three Percenters, a far-right armed group, were seen gathered in Washington’s Freedom Plaza on Tuesday night, most wearing helmets and Kevlar vests adorned with the group’s symbol, a Roman numeral three.The mob came from the broader crowd, tens of thousands of Trump’s most loyal supporters, many of whom had driven through the night, or taken buses with friends and neighbours, to watch him speak and be part of a day that many hoped would finally hold some answers to what had been months of false claims that the election had been stolen. A number of people interviewed said they had never been to Washington before.In interviews on Wednesday, protesters in the broader crowd expressed a sense that something would happen – something that was bigger than they were. What exactly it would be no one could say. Before the Capitol was stormed, some hinted darkly about violence and the looming threat of civil war. But when pressed for what that might mean, they tended to demur, saying simply that, if called, they would serve their side in a conflict.“There’s been lots of people talking about this day coming for a long time,” said Brian Sachtleben (40), an asphalt truck driver from a small town near Sheboygan, Wisconsin, who was looking at the sea of people spreading from the Washington Monument to the Ellipse, marvelling at the numbers, shortly before Trump began to speak.When asked what he thought might happen, he said: “I don’t know. I really don’t know.” He referred cryptically to the Thomas Jefferson quote: “The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants.” Then he added: “I don’t think anything is going to be back to normal ever again.” He left town before the violence began.‘We stopped the vote!’When those who entered the Capitol later re-emerged after their rampage, many were welcomed like returning heroes. “Yeah, we stopped the vote!” screamed a man in a navy-blue zippered jacket, as he emerged, hands held high, from a tall yellow wooden door, as people outside whooped and cheered. “Murder the media” was scrawled in black marker across the other part of the double door.Many said they would not have tried to go in, but they sympathised with those who had. “I’m not going in there, but, yeah, I’m kind of okay with it,” said Lisa Todd (56), a high school teacher from Raleigh, North Carolina. She was standing with three friends, all fellow teachers.Others expressed some regret. Storming the Capitol was “probably not the best thing to do”, said Eric Dark (43), a truck driver from Braman, Oklahoma, who was tear-gassed when he got to the top of the steps to the building but never made it inside.He had been standing with Brian Hobbs, mayor of Newkirk, Oklahoma, near the top of the steps on the western side of the building around 4.30pm when officers in riot gear started moving to clear out the thousands of people who had gathered.It could have been a lot worse, he said. “We had enough people we could have tore that building down brick by brick,” he said. – New York TimesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons january 2021","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter -

Two-thirds of those assets are held in managed portfolios that belong to the bank\u0027s 15,000 clients, most of them religious orders, Vatican employees, Holy See offices and embassies around the world.The official said its bank had sent less than £725,000 to Australia since 2014, mostly for payment of salaries and expenses for the Vatican embassy, as well as pensions and travel costs.“The Holy See’s entire yearly budget is about 330 million euros. The (Austrac) figures are about four times that,” the official said. “It seems like science fiction.”Australian Catholic Bishops Conference spokesman Gavin Abraham also said it had no knowledge of the transfers and that none of the money was received by dioceses, charities or other Catholic entities.Cardinal Pell, who was Pope Francis\u0027 former finance minister, had clashed with the Vatican\u0027s old guard over his financial reform efforts. He had to abandon his work in 2017 to face trial.Cardinal Pell himself has suggested that his prosecution was related to his work trying to clean up the Vatican\u0027s murky finances and the resistance he faced, but also acknowledged he has no evidence.Pope Francis welcomed Cardinal Pell back into the fold in October, granting the 79-year-old an audience when he returned to Rome after spending a year prison for his sex abuse conviction, which was ultimately overturned.Australia\u0027s police previously said they weren\u0027t investigating the money flows Cardinal Pell\u0027s accuser has denied receiving any payment for his testimony.    More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day capitol invasion kim jong un frozen fish","story":" People enjoy the snow  in Castilla-La Mancha, Spain, where the whole contry is on alert for Storm Filomena.

The Prime Minister vowed that from next Friday “hundreds of thousands” of jabs will be delivered daily.Mr Hancock said Moderna’s vaccine “will boost our vaccination programme even further once doses become available”.The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) will submit updated advice on which groups to prioritise for vaccination before doses become available.Alok Sharma, the Business Secretary, hailed the news as “yet another important step towards ending lockdown and returning to normal life”.He highlighted that Britain was one of the first countries in Europe to sign a deal with Moderna and paid tribute to the scientists, trial volunteers, regulators and medics involved in the process.The Moderna jab works in a similar way to the Pfizer vaccine, targeting the “spike proteins” that coronavirus uses to enter human cells. Both jabs use synthetic messenger RNA (mRNA), genetic material that contains information about the spike protein, to instruct the body to produce a small amount of this protein. In this way it stimulates the immune system to produce a protective antibody response. However, unlike the Pfizer jab, the Moderna jab does not require ultra-cold storage and can remain stable at normal fridge temperature for 30 days.It will be rolled out through the same channels via which the Pfizer and Oxford vaccines are being delivered.  This includes hundreds of GP-led vaccine sites and hospital hubs, and from next week seven mass vaccine centres based out of sports stadia and other large venues.Everyone in the country will be within a 10-mile radius of an available vaccine, Mr Johnson pledged on Thursday night, amid growing fears about a postcode lottery.Nadine Zahawi, the Vaccine Deployment Minister, said: “The NHS is pulling out all the stops to vaccinate those most at risk as quickly as possible, with over 1,000 vaccination sites live across the UK by the end of the week to provide easy access to everyone, regardless of where they live.He added: “The Moderna vaccine will be a vital boost to these efforts and will help us return to normal faster.”The Vaccines Taskforce has ordered 367 million doses of seven vaccines so far. The Government has invested £230 million into manufacturing a successful jab and has made more than £6 billion available to develop and procure effective vaccines.Professor Jonathan Van-Tam, deputy chief medical officer for England, said the new vaccine would save lives once doses come onstream, but warned: “It is crucial we all continue to follow the rules to protect each other until enough people have been protected.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"radical cleric suspected masterminding bali bombings released","story":"A radical Indonesian cleric accused of masterminding the 2002 Bali bombings was freed from prison on Friday morning, stirring anxiety and grief among victims of the deadly terror attack and prompting fears that he could incite more violence. Abu Bakar Bashir, 82, is considered the spiritual leader of Jemaah Islamiyah, the militant group that targeted several nightclubs in the holiday resort of Kuta almost 20 years ago, killing 202 people, including 88 Australians – the largest ever loss of Australian life from an act of terror.  The firebrand preacher was serving a jail term for an unrelated offence of helping to fund militant training in the Southeast Asian nation’s conservative Aceh province. Convicted in 2011 and sentenced to 15 years, his term was cut due to regular early releases for prisoners in Indonesia and the risks of contracting Covid-19 due to the country’s notoriously overcrowded prisons and his age. Bashir had been previously jailed over the Bali nightclub bombings, but that conviction was quashed on appeal. He has consistently denied all accusations against him, including involvement in the Bali attacks, but he has long been suspected of links to the holiday island atrocity. Sidney Jones, director of the Jakarta-based Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict (IPAC), told ABC news that when it came to the Bali bombings Bashir wasn\u0027t the planner, he wasn\u0027t the executor, he had no operational role and he had no role in seeking funding for the action.But she added that he had not intervened to prevent it. He was in a position, when the bombers came to him to basically ask for his endorsement, to stop it and he didn\u0027t, she said. Because of his role as head of the organisation, that was tantamount to a green light. And he could have given a red light.Bashir was expected to return to his home town of Solo in Java later on Friday, where Abdul Rohim, his son said he would return to the Al Mukmin Islamic boarding school, which the cleric founded in the 1970s and whose graduates have been connected to militant network and terrorist activities. Bashir has refused to renounce his extremist views in exchange for leniency. In 2014, he pledged allegiance to the late head of the Islamic State terrorist group, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.Earlier this week, the Australian embassy in Jakarta urged the Indonesian government to ensure that he would be prevented from inciting anyone to carry out future atrocities. Marisa Payne, the Australian Foreign Minister, acknowledged his release would be deeply distressing”  to the families and friends of the Australians killed in 2002, as well as to hundreds who were injured.  Australia has always called for those involved to face tough, proportionate and just sentences. Decisions on sentencing are matters for the Indonesian justice system and we respect Indonesia’s sovereignty and the independence of its judiciary, Ms Payne said.Jan Laczynski, a Melbourne resident who narrowly escaped the attack but lost five of his friends in the bombing of Kuta’s Sari Club, told AFP the news brought back the “the horror of memories” from that night. “It hurts me a lot. I wanted to see justice done,” he said. “There are still people even next week having operations for their burns people are still suffering.” Ends More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"telegraph weekly news quiz radio show did queen congratulate","story":"In the week that Prime Minister Boris Johnson plunged England into a third national lockdown, the \u0027s weekly news quiz is here to find out how closely you have been paying attention to this week\u0027s headlines. Ryanair is under investigation for a controversial advertising campaign, it was revealed this week.

A major parcel courier halted deliveries to the EU on Friday as firms complained of a perfect storm of post-Brexit changes hitting business.    DPD UK said today it was pausing its road delivery services into Europe, including Ireland, until at least Wednesday, citing issues resulting from the EU-UK trade deal agreed last month, which came into effect on December . It came as retailers warned that a new wave of red tape and tarfs was hitting trade. Marks and Spencers and seafood companies have warned their businesses are grinding to a halt because of new rules. UK fishermen also complained that the rules mean that British-landed fish are being left to rot because of a post-Brexit aposbrick wall of bureaucracy in French ports. Labour accused the Government of poor preparation causing disruption to British businesses already hit hard by the coronavirus.Shadow transport secretary Jim McMahon said: “The Government promised it had a plan to make sure things ran smoothly for businesses and hauliers post-Brexit. “It’s clear the problems caused by its poor preparation and delaying tactics have not gone away. Ministers have to get a grip on this and make sure essential workers are actually able to do their jobs, or we risk seeing a repeat of the chaos on our roads at Christmas.” Transport Secretary Grant Shapps warned that busy times mayto UK borders as firms get to grips with new paperwork after the exit from the EU single market. Mr Shapps said: Itaposs been a quieter start to the year, a lot of thataposs to do with anticipations, so the stockpiling thataposs going on. He said the chaos seen last month while the post-Brexit transition period was still in place was due to the French closing the border because of concerns over the UK strain of coronavirus and was nothing to do with the change of paperwork.Parcel firm DPD warned that Boris Johnson ’s orce settlement with Brussels had led to more complex processes and said they were pausing deliveries in order to deal with the disruption.

People arriving in England and Scotland, and probably the whole UK, will need a negative Covid result from next week or face a £ fine. A debate has been ongoing in recent days about how the ‘Y.V’ iant, thought to have originated in South Africa, will respond. New research today said the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine does protect against the iant - as well as the second more transmissable iant rampant in the UK. The pharmaceutical giant carried out lab tests on the strains alongside researchers from the University of Texas. But Mr Shapps said there were still fears a vaccine could be rendered “less useful”other strains make it into the UK. Explaining the new travel policy, he told BBC Breakfast: “The reason we are very keen to do it now is there’s this new iant which you may have heard about called the South African iant, which is causing great concern with the scientists. “They’re not sure whether for example the vaccine will be able to deal with it in the first place. “And we’re very very keen to try to keep that out.” Speaking to LBC he added: “It may be that the vaccine doesn’t respond in the same way, or doesn’t work in quite the same way. Andthat were the case, of course, it would be a tragedy to allow that into the country.”The new requirement for a negative test comes on top of the existing need for travellers to quarantine for  days after arriving in the UK. The UK has already banned almost all travel from South Africa and last night extended the ban to Namibia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Eswatini, Zambia, Malawi, Lesotho, Mozambique and Angola as well as Seychelles and Mauritius. There are the concerns about the South African one in particular about how effective the vaccine would be against it so we simply cannot take chances,” Mr Shapps said. So today because of that iant it has become much more urgent. The new iant has emerged just as the UK ramps up its bid to give million vulnerable people their first vaccine dose by February .

The couple founded Urban Outreach  years ago and last year they helped thousands of local people - including redistributing , unwanted first class airline dishes to those in need. David is modest about his work and is keen to point out that it was the donations from the public that got  off to a flying start. “We have people donating food all the time, but in the Christmas of  we had the largest amount we’d ever seen in all the years we’ve been doing this,” he says. “We had so much, we were storing supplies in a church building, offices and food bank. “When Covid- hit, we had enough food from people’s generous donations to survive for the first four weeks of the original lockdown. It was a remarkable thing and it gave us a whole sense that we could cope with whatever was ahead. “Once, we had a delivery of , first class airline meals and we didn’t have any room for them, so a pasty manufacturer cleared a whole freezer so we could support other areas of Manchester. Of course there were tough times as David, , Christine, , and their team of volunteers worked around the clock to deliver what was needed – including providing , lunches in the school holidays, , food hampers at Christmas and , meals for the homeless over the winter period. “We’ve encountered some of the saddest parts, as well as the happiest bits during the pandemic,” says David.“We had volunteers who were really struggling, then we were sending food out and finding people had died. At one point we had  people delivering food, that was quite magnicent. “Furlough was the answer to our problems because we had so many people volunteering and their companies let them use their vans. It was remarkable. We put on barbecues, Caribbean meals and non-alcoholic cocktail bars for the drivers.” David and Christine are just two of the erse group of people who were awarded MBEs in the New Year Honours list. It’s a powerful way to say thank you to people on the frontline, who have supported the nation through the unprecedented times of the Covid- pandemic. Anyone can nominate someone that they believe has made an exceptional contribution to UK society.People are honoured for achievements such as making a signicant dference to their community and improving le for others, long-term voluntary service and remarkable innovation and entrepreneurship. The Bagleys were both surprised to be awarded MBEs and are clearly humbled by the honours. “I just happened to be at home one afternoon and I was going through some emails and I went in and said to Chris: ‘I’ve just got this email about a MBE thing.’ I read it through and realised it wasn’t a hoax!” says David. “Later, she got an email too and we had  hours to accept it. I guess at some point we’ll collect them, but we haven’t been given any sort of date yet. But getting to call my mum and tell her was the best thing. I’m adopted, so my parents made it all possible. I said: ‘I’ve got a gt for you.’ This MBE is theirs, too.“If we take an MBE, it’s not ours. It belongs to thousands upon thousands of people who have volunteered, given and supported us – children who have ridden their bikes up and down the street and got their neighbours to donate. It belongs to them. We only created a space and people filled that space.“The one thing to come out of all this is people pulling together. Evenyou only have one thing to give, it’s added to somebody ’s one thing and together we have an abundance.”Vital support for those with sensory loss  Jacquie Winning MBE, , from Falkirk is manager of the Forth Valley Sensory Centre and her work with people with sensory loss has been more important than ever during the pandemic. “Covid- has been challenging for everyone, but more so for people with sensory loss,” she explains. “Those with hearing loss are facing extra challenges due to face masks and social distancing interfering with their ability to lip read. There are also signicant challenges facing people with sight loss in maintaining physical distancing while undertaking essential trips out. “I identied these challenges and provided support with Braille copies of essential Covid- information for people with sight loss, a telephone, text and email befriending service to support those who were isolated as a result of lockdown. As well as podcasts providing the most up-to-date Covid- information for people with sight loss.” Jacquie’s dedicated and hard-working team are also supporting people living with sensory loss so they can pay their bills remotely. She shares the recognition her MBE gives with the rest of her team. “This award recognises the achievements of everyone at the Sensory Centre in what has been an exceptionally challenging year,” says Jacquie. “Thanks go to the dedication, enthusiasm and willingness to adapt by our team, volunteers and partners, and the tremendous support of our board of directors. Together we have been able to continue to provide essential services for our vision and hearing-impaired centre users, who continue to be some of the most vulnerable and hardest hit by the pandemic. I am privileged to work with such an inspiring group of people.”  Critical care on the frontline and pivotal research and tutorials in the background  Critical care consultant at Royal Gwent Hospital Dr Tamas Szakmany was made an MBE after he led the response of the Welsh Critical Care Network during the pandemic. He looked after  patients, doubling his normal clinical time spent at the bedside. On top of this, Dr Szakmany, , from Newport, South Wales, spent hours on conference calls, online tutorials and webinars to share his experience of working in ICU and rapidly built up a research programme. He also took part inthe Oxford vaccine trial. The last thing he expected was to be honoured for his work, so he was surprised to get the email informing him of his MBE. “I was completely astonished, touched and humbled. I thought I was doing my job like everybody . I didn’t think for one minute it would result in this,” he says.  “Once I was allowed to talk about it, the first thing I said was how fortunate I was to work with this team: the clinical and managerial team, the civil servants and the research team at my hospital and across the UK.  was dficult professionally. Personally, I had many successes. It was a double-edged sword. The MBE is recognition for the enormous effort everyone has made to get us through the first wave and I hope we have similar success again. “We will get through this together. I ask the public to stay at home. If you do go out, wear a mask and keep your distance. When it is offered, have the vaccine.”Decades of tireless dedication   "},{"url":null,"title":"brit couple defied covid rules","story":"NewsBrit couple defied Covid rules by sneaking woman into Barbados hotel for threesomeAndrew Luker and Julia Knightley, from Greater Manchester, were arrested after a security guard spotted Mikaela Jacas climbing over a fence and going to the couples roommirrorShareCommentsByDave Burke:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsAndrew Luker and Julia Knighley were caught sneaking a woman into their room \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

She says she was diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorderas a result of a past abusive relationship but hypnotherapy helped her deal with her trauma. And since giving birth to her son Archie, Angel, from Coventry, has been able to sleep when her baby goes down for a nap, enabling her to claw back hours of precious rest. Angel said: “It was torture. For almost two years I was walking around like a zombie. “I could barely even make a cup of tea without needing to sit down because I felt dizzy and faint. “Even though I was exhausted I couldn’t sleep because I just had the nightmares and would wake up crying.” After two two-hour hypnotherapy sessions at the start of August last year, Angel’s sleeping pattern has been restored.  Angel gave birth to lbs oz Archie in November and despite the challenges of caring for a new baby, she was still able to sleep more than she had before. She said: “Not many new mums can say they get more sleep after their baby is born but I can. “I try to sleep when Archie sleeps but even when I can’t I manage to get my head down at night without suffering night terrors. “Before I was waking up at least three times a night, sometimes cryingI’d had a bad dream. “I’ve really noticed a massive dference in the way I feel and I don’t even mind being woken up by the baby. “I’ve got so much more energy and don’t feel like a zombie any more.”"},{"url":null,"title":"family raffling 180000 home 250","story":"NewsFamily raffling off £, home for £. to raise money after daughters cancer battleThe house, situated just ten minutes from the Lake District, features two bedrooms, an open plan kitchen and living room, and a luxury bathroommirrorShareCommentsByKieren Williams:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsOonagh Wilkinson in hospital, but since recovering from cancer her family are raffling off their home to raise money for charity \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Our free email newsletter sends you the biggest headlines from news, sport and showbizWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Samantha described learning that her daughter had cancer “felt like our world had collapsed around us.” She said: “I was so shocked when they said they were looking for cancer in her blood tests. “Getting that news was just completely devastating.  “It was all a bit of shock as it was all so sudden. We never thought her tummy being swollen could be cancer. “She was a healthy baby.” The mum-of-three said. Even though the events happened very quickly from diagnosis to surgery, it gave Oonagh a fighting chance to survive. Oonagh was tested again in November,  and thankfully doctors said she was cancer free and healthy.

Geoff, who caught the virus last year, said he has been honest with his children about the current coronavirus situation and each day they sit and watch the news so they can understand what is going on.Afterwards, they ask him questions about what they donapost understand and he answers as honestly as he can. Do you think schools should be open or closed  Let us know in the comments below However, he decided to record the emotional moment on Monday as Jeffie reacted strongly to the news of schools being closed again. Geoff said: “There’s probably a lot of other kids feeling the same way, she’s over it now but you know my daughters are a bit cheesed off, for nearly a year and thereaposs been no school. “It’s absolute madness, it’s like living in a movie, it’s absolutely crazy and itaposs slowly getting worse. There’s no one to blame for it or even point fingers, there’s still even people thinking it’s fake. “It’s just a mess.”  Joking about homeschooling, he added: “We’re having to be their teachers but we’re a little under-qualied in actual fact some of the school work I’ve got no idea they’re probably better at it than me. I’ve got no idea how to do some of it, it’s beyond what I was taught but now the kids just want to play out and see their friends at school. It’s not even anyone’s fault.”On Wednesday Boris Johnson said schools will be the very first things to reopen after lockdown.But the Prime Minister admitted he would have to be very cautious about reopening classrooms despite saying he hopes theyaposll be back from February .  He said: “That moment may come after the February half term - although we should remain extremely cautious about the timetable ahead. As was the case case last Spring, our emergence from the lockdown cocoon will not be a big bang but a gradual unwrapping.” A law passed by the government this week will allow lockdown to continue until as late as March . The PM defended his dithering and U-turn on closing schools - which he did only after primaries reopened for one day, and two weeks after SAGE warned the R number could not be brought below  with them open.

The latest predictions from Imperial College London put Halton, Knowsley and Liverpool at the top of a list of the worst hotspots as a mutant strain of the disease spreads out of control in Britain and the impacts of festive season mixing are seen. They are followed by the Isle of Wight, Newry, Mourne and Down in Northern Ireland, and Dumfries and Galloway in Scotland. Infection rates are rising in many places in northern England, where doctors fear NHS hospitals will soon face the same tsunami of Covid- patients that has left their colleagues in London and the South East struggling to cope. What is going to take for UK nations to emerge from their lockdowns  Let us know in the comments section below. View the full interactive map and table here. Almost every region of the UK is currently considered a hotspot, according to an interactive map developed by Imperial College. It shows dark red across most of the country, except parts of Scotland, North Wales and the South East of England. In England, the highest infection rates are currently found in the South, but rates are rising in the North and some of the biggest week-on-week increases have been seen in the Liverpool area. Haltonaposs rate quadrupled in a week, going from . new cases per , people to . in the seven days to January , while Knowsleyaposs soared from . to ., according to data from PA. Seftonaposs rate jumped from . to . and the Wirralaposs went from . to .. The rate in Liverpool alone is now at . after sitting at . the previous week.  Eileen OaposMeara, a director of public health for Halton, told the BBC a sharp rise in cases in Liverpool City Region is extremely worrying, and she believed an increase in social mixing at Christmas and the new, more infectious iant were to blame. The region had the highest rates in England in October, forcing the Government to impose tougher restrictions just days before the second national lockdown was announced. It saw a dramatic decrease in cases after the rollout of  Liverpoolaposs mass testing programme and was placed in Tier  when that lockdown ended in December before being moved to Tier  just before the third lockdown started. Ms OaposMeara said: We are now seeing the impact of the new iant in the North West. We know it spreads up to  per cent more quickly than the previous iant.  I think there were more social gatherings over Christmas. I think a lot of people had made their Christmas plans [before any changes] and there was possibly more social gathering than we would have wanted. She expressed worry over the impact the increase in cases could have on the regionaposs hospitals and urged people to follow the rules. Steve Rotheram, metro mayor the Liverpool City Region, told the Mirror: “Like many areas across the country we are seeing rates of Covid increase exponentially in the Liverpool City Region and this is of grave concern to us all. “In the coming days we will start to see the full impact of Christmas relaxations on our Covid rates and we know that when rates go up, hospital admissions and, sadly, deaths will follow. Now that vaccines have begun to rollout, we have a clear route to ending this pandemic and we will be doing everything we can as a city region to speed up that rollout wherever possible. However, while this is happening, we still have some very, very dficult weeks ahead. “In our region we are known for our solidarity and community spirit. So, I am urging everyone to continue to do the right thing and abide by the restrictions stay at home, protect the NHS, save lives.” Imperial Collegeaposs latest research predicts that rates will continue to rise in the North of England in the coming weeks, with some overtaking those in the South. Predicted Covid- hotspots Imperial College predicts these  places will become the UKaposs worst coronavirus hotspots, based on the weekly number of cases per , people and its own modelling.Halton Knowsley Liverpool Isle of Wight Newry, Mourne and Down Dumfries and Galloway Sefton Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Mid Ulster Wirral Corby Worcester Copeland Carlisle St Helens Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Crawley Sandwell Allerdale WalsallResearchers define a hotspot as a local authority where there are more than  cases of Covid- per , of the population per week. The predictions are based on current infection rates and a modelling system created by the team at Imperial College. The projections assume no change in interventions, such as lockdowns or tier restrictions, and human behaviour since a week before the last observed data. Doctors in northern England fear the surge in cases that has overwhelmed hospitals in London and the South East will soon happen there.  A senior ICU consultant in the North of England recently told the Mirror he had “grave concerns” about the next three months after seeing colleagues in London overwhelmed. Nick Scriven, immediate past president of the Society for Acute Medicine, who is based in northern England, recently told the i newspaper: I can say that those of us who work in the North where we have been less effected by the new strain are anxiously looking to the South and Midlands to see how the iant is spreading. “Since the national lockdown finished before Christmas, our areas are now seeing a steady rise in community spread with numbers nearly doubling in the last weeks – this has just not hit the national headlines as it has been overshadowed by the rises in the South East and East of England. I am certain all trusts will have plans ready to roll out in terms of beds and rotas but how much we have ‘in reserve’ in probably much less than London had before the latest wave.” What is the rate in my local authority  Meanwhile, the latest data from PA shows the local authorities with the highest rates in England, and those that have seen the biggest week-on-week increases. Barking and Dagenham in east London continues to have the highest rate in England, with , new cases recorded in the seven days to January  - the equivalent of ,. cases per , people. This is up from ,. in the seven days to December . Thurrock in Essex has the second highest rate, up from ,. to ,., with , new cases.  Redbridge in east London is in third place, where the rate has increased from ,. to ,. with , new cases. Of the  local areas in England, have seen a rise in case rates and sixhave seen a fall. The  areas with the biggest week-on-week rise in rates are:HaltonKnowsleyIsle of WightCrawleyCorbyCarlisleSeftonWirralRushmoorTendring The figures, for the seven days to January , are based on tests carried out in laboratoriesand in the wider community . The rate is expressed as the number of new cases per , people. Data for the most recent four dayshas been excluded as it is incomplete and does not reflect the true number of cases.

City of London Police have issued a CCTV image of a man detectives would like to speak to following the incident. Detectives labelled it a aposdisgusting assaultapos as the Government ramps up its vaccine rollout for the UKaposs most at-risk people. Elderly and clinically vulnerable are at the front of the queue for the Covid- jab as authorities race to vaccinate nearly million people by mid-February. The force said the woman reported a man had door-knocked her at her Kingsmead Avenue home in Surbiton, in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames, on Wednesday. December  at around -pm.

In the weeks that followed, the Duke and Duchess worked with their furious family as well as staff and charities to work out the logistics of the progressive new role within the institution they were determined to take. It wasnapost until March  that they officially turned their back on their senior duties when they joined the royal family for one final engagement - the Commonwealth Day Service at Westminster Abbey. They also carried out several goodbye engagements behind the scenes, and Meghan gave a tearful final speech as she prepared to head back to Canada. Omid Scobie was one of a small group of journalists invited to the private meeting with Association of Commonwealth Universities scholars - during which Meghan spoke to students about their work on subjects including climate change. He writes about the emotional day in his bombshell autobiography, Finding Freedom, which hit the shelves last year. He claims that after the speech, she chatted to people inidually and hugged him, uttering the heartbreaking words: It didnapost have to be this way. Recalling the day, Omid writes: “Staff who had been with the couple from day one were mourning the end of what was supposed to be a happy story: two people fall in love, get married, have a baby, serve the Queen, the end. Instead, they were leaving the country.  “As Meghan gave me a final hug goodbye, she said, ‘It didn’t have to be this way’.” Meghan also said emotional goodbyes ahead of the Commonwealth Day service, but still found humour as she made a last joke about her hat. In Finding Freedom, Omid and his co-author Carolyn Durand describe what happened on that historical day. They write: Harry quietly slipped through the door of the  Room to say hello, and the reality - and the emotions - finally set in. Do you think Meghan and Harry were right to quit their senior royal roles  Have your say in the comments section below.  Meghan turned around to hug goodbye the last remaining people in the room, including an author of this book. With the state room almost empty except for a few familiar faces, the tears the duchess has been holding back were free to flow. She embraced some of the dedicated team members whose tireless efforts - to promote the coupleaposs work, launch landmark projects, and deal with the near-daily crisis brought on by the tabloids - had come to an abrupt end. aposI canapost believe thisapos, she said, hugging one of the young female aides she had become close with. Though Team Sussex was a much smaller operation than the more sophisticated offices at Clarence House and Kensington Palace, in the short space of a year since setting up, they had become like family. Meghan then went to change into the stunning green outfit she chose for the historical event, joking with staff that it was her last hat for a while. After their final engagements, Meghan and Harry ed to Canada, however they decided to make another move shortly before the world was thrown into lockdown due to the pandemic.  They have now bought a beautul -bedroom family home in Montecito, Santa Barbara, which set them back £.m. They moved in July after taking out a £.m mortgage and getting some financial help from Prince Charles. While the price tag might look huge, it seems Meghan and Harry may have actually picked up a bargain as itaposs said to actually be worth closer to £m, reports the Sun. One of the downsides of their new home will be living a -minute drive from Meghanaposs mum Doria, who they are very close to, but the mansion has its own two-bed guest house so Archieaposs nan will always have somewhere to stay.

Katy Toft, , from Newton-le-Willows on Merseyside, tipped the scales at st lbs at her heaviest. The mum gorged McDonaldaposs meals on the school run and snacks of crisps, chocolate and biscuits.But determined to lose weight in time for her wedding following the birth of her fourth child, Katy signed up to a diet plan, reports the Liverpool Echo.Do you have an incredible weight loss success story with before and after pictures  Email webnews@mirror After starting the : Diet by Cambridge Weight Plan, she lost an incredible three stone within just three months of starting it back in October , and went on to lose another stone during lockdown in time for her birthday in June. This takes her weight loss to four stone in total after she slimmed down to st lb and went from a size   to a size  . Katy said she now feels healthy, happy and content and she was able to enjoy her big day in October  with husband Martyn at St Peters Church. Katy said: Iaposd just had my fourth baby and I was dreading the thought of walking down the aisle feeling uncomfortable about myself in front of all my friends and family. I felt really unhealthy, I couldnapost walk upstairs without getting out of breath.  I couldnapost keep up with my children and I didnapost want to be a bad example for them. Because it went on through Covid crisis it was massively for health reasons, because when your BMI is really high you are at risk of all types of illnesses like type two diabetes and heart problems. Katy said she had previously lost some weight after giving birth to her third child but after splitting up from her partner and getting into a new relationship, everything snow balled. Katy said: It was convenience - I was eating fast food and portions that were too big. I wouldnapost just have two slices of toast I would have four slices of toast. We live really close to a McDonaldaposs and we would nip into that on the school run. If someone asked for a biscuit I would have a biscuit. Iaposve got four children and two step children. If six children are coming up to me saying aposI want a biscuitapos I had six biscuits. Eight months after the birth of her fourth child after she had stopped breast feeding, Katy signed up to the : Diet by Cambridge Weight Plan. She started the diet on an intake of  calories a day, swapping three meals with meal replacements provided by the plan. Katy said: The lowest calorie intake is  calories depending on your BMI. I started on  calories. It was full meal replacements that are nutritionally balanced with every single thing you need in a day. You have shakes, soups, for breakfast you have porridge and you have other meal replacements. Itaposs massively motivating when you see the results coming quickly as well. I lost three stone in three months then I hit a bit of a brick wall with the pandemic. Then I lost another stone before my th birthday.  Katy said the thing sheaposs enjoyed most about the plan is the one to one support she has received from consultants and she has since signed up to become a consultant herself to inspire others with their weight loss. I wanted to feel like the best version of myself. I donapost feel self conscious when I go clothes shopping anymore and I donapost struggle to tie my shoe laces. I used to get out of breath tying my shoe laces - things as ridiculous as that, Katy added. I donapost feel like that now - Iaposm healthy, happy and content. We had to bring our wedding day forward because of the next lockdown. When I took back on pictures I know the smiles are genuine - I just couldnapost believe it was me.  Everything had was such a whirlwind any way but everything was worth it in that moment, when I put on my wedding dress and walked down the stairs and saw my familyaposs faces. The national lockdown in England is expected to last until mid-February at the earliest and Katy said the next six weeks are the perfect time for people to lose weightthey want to.

The bombshell blindsided the Queen and threatened to destabilise the very fabric of the monarchy. In the days that followed, the Queen and her heirs, Princes Charles and William, ordered a series of crisis talks to deal with the wantaway couple, forcing Harry to a Sandringham Summit at the royals’ Norfolk estate. What is your view on Harry and Meghan, one year on  Have your say in the comment section The emergency meeting ended with the Queen reluctantly granting her grandson and his we permission to step down as senior royals. Agreements were put in place alongside a -month review of the thrashed-out agreement, in which they promised to “continue to uphold the values of Her Majesty” while getting their independence. Here we look at what has happened to the couple and -month-old son Archie in the  months since, and what lies ahead... Three moves  Three house moves between three countries – from Frogmore Cottage in Windsor to the Canadian wilderness and on to the paparazzi capital of the world a stone’s throw from Hollywood.Harry and Meghan plotted their escape from The Firm from a remote estate on Vancouver Island in British Columbia, Canada – a far cry from where they would end up putting down roots in the millionaire’s playground of Montecito, Calornia.As coronavirus lockdowns were enforced around the world, the couple fled the Commonwealth country to stay rent free at movie producer Tyler Perry’s £million mansion in the US. They soon bought a £million home near celebrity pals Oprah Winfrey and Ellen DeGeneres. Making millionsWith a reported £million from Netflix and £m from Spoty, the couple have more than achieved the financial independence they sought.But courtiers are privately concerned by the rate at which they are signing deals, and whether they will be able to “uphold the values of Her Majesty” and the institution as they vowed last year. Meghan’s personal investments have also “raised eyebrows” in royal circles. The vegan coffee Meghan invested in was advertised by Oprah Winfrey to her  million Instagram followers, with a cryptic caption including a crown emoji.A royal source said: “It’s hard to see how any of this fits in with the promises and there’s a lot up for discussion.” Charity work After months of largely operating away from the spotlight, Harry and Meghan announced the launch of their new charitable foundation Archewell.  Described as “an impact-driven non-profit” whose “core purpose is to uplt and unite communities”, it has an arm connected to their Spoty deal, Archewell Audio, understood to have netted them £million. The couple were also seen in Los Angeles last year handing out food parcels during several public outings with a privately hired photographer. Relations with the royals Harry and Meghan’s dealings with the royals they left behind have been limited to phone and video calls amid the pandemic.  The couple have kept in touch with the family and exchanged gts between William and Kate’s three children and their son Archie. Prince Charles has also worked hard to keep in touch with his son, although royal sources have suggested it was “noted” how he was not mentioned on the couple’s new Archewell website. The home page features a picture of a young Harry on the shoulders of his mother Princess Diana, alongside an image of Meghan and her mum Doria with the text: “I am my mother’s son. And I am our son’s mother.”  Harry was due toto the UK before the -month review deadline on March , but his plans have been dashed with the new coronavirus lockdown. The prince still plans toin the spring for several major events, including the unveiling of a commemorative statue at Kensington Palace of Princess Diana on July . He has worked on it with William since . Meghanaposs miscarriage bravery  In November the -year-old duchess bravely opened up about losing her second child while pregnant in July. In a heart-wrenching letter in The New York Times she described how she was changing Archie’s nappy at the family home in Los Angeles when she “dropped to the floor” in pain. She wrote: “I knew, as I clutched my first-born child, that I was losing my second.” She told how she watched “my husband’s heart break as he tried to hold the shattered pieces of mine”.  The article was widely praised for its searing honesty and ability to connect to millions of women and men around the world who have experienced baby loss. The tragedy reportedly helped bring Harry and William closer, as the Duke of Cambridge reached out to his brother following the news. Baby loss charity Tommy’s praised Meghan’s “honesty and openness”, saying that it had sent a “powerful message to anyone who loses a baby: this may feel incredibly lonely, but you are not alone”. Legal cases Meghan’s legal costs have soared to nearly £million as she sues Associated Newspapers, publisher of the Mail on Sunday and MailOnline, over a series of articles connected to a letter she wrote to her estranged father Thomas Markle. She is awaiting a decision on January  at the High Court where her lawyers will argue for a summary judgment. The ex-actress has also recently won a privacy case against a news agency that photographed her and Archie.

The couple said they had spent months considering the le-changing move, but a source said it came as a bolt from the blue for the rest of The Firm, who were reportedly furious.Princes Charles and William were reportedly given just  minutes warning of the Sussexesapos Instagram statement, and Harryaposs grandmother the Queen was said to be hurt. However, according to experts the Queen played a blinder and took back control of the scandalous situation with two perfectly constructed statements. The first, released shortly after Meghan and Harryaposs bombshell post, was short and snappy, explaining that there was a lot of work to be done. In just  words, she acknowledged the development and warned working out an agreement would be complicated. It read: Discussions with The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are at an early stage. We understand their desire to take a dferent approach, but these are complicated issues that will take time to work through. Speaking on Channel  documentary, The Queen: In Her Own Words, speech writer and former British Ambassador Charles Crawford said: When the Queen makes a statement, itaposs a statement with a capital aposSapos. Thataposs because there is something which needs to go on the record.  The tone was flawless, and above all it was very short. However it was with her second statement on the subject, which she shared after an emergency summit at Sandringham with Charles, William and Harry, that she really took back control. She explained that talks had taken place ands the logistics were being worked out. It read: Today my family had very constructive discussions on the future of my grandson and his family.  My family and I are entirely supportive of Harry and Meghan’s desire to create a new le as a young family. Although we would have preferred them to remain full-time working members of the Royal Family, we respect and understand their wish to live a more independent le as a family while remaining a valued part of my family. Harry and Meghan have made clear that they do not want to be reliant on public funds in their new lives.It has therefore been agreed that there will be a period of transition in which the Sussexes will spend time in Canada and the UK. However, experts claim it was the final line that really sent a message. It read: These are complex matters for my family to resolve, and there is some more work to be done, but I have asked for final decisions to be reached in the coming days. Speaking on the documentary, Charles says: When the Queen asks for something, it happens.  Do you think Meghan and Harry were right to quit their senior royal roles  Have your say in the comments section below. It also sent a public message to the people advising Harry and Meghan - aposthis is over, letaposs get down to an agreement and move onapos. It was a nicely phrased but firm statement saying this is where things stand, just so you all know, and thataposs it. Royal correspondent Roya Nikkah praised the way the Monarch dealt with the dficult situation. She said: The Queen is still the boss, and the boss had to get involved and negotiate and find a deal and a way forward.

The first sample was discovered in a person who lived near Canterbury, Kent, in September, according to scientists. The new iant has ripped through the UK ever since - prompting Boris Johnson to cancel Christmas rule relaxation plans and plunge England into a third national lockdown. Countries shut their borders to the UK after the discovery of the new strain prompted fears it would spread further abroad. The strain has since spread overseas, and is believed to be signicantly more virulent than the original iant.Its  dferent mutations is thought to make it up to  per cent more infectious as well as more transmittable by children. It originally began being detected in the south east and London, where infection rates began ramping up rapidly, before spreading everywhere  in the UK. Experts and vaccine developers have insisted the new strain is unlikely to be resistant to Covid- jabs. The UK is in a race against time to vaccinate million of the most vulnerable in the population by February .  Boris Johnson put the country on a war footing on Thursday as he promised the British Army would help speed up the vaccine programme, delivering aposhundreds of thousandsapos of doses a day. NHS Chief Sir Simon Stevens told the Downing Street press conference speed was essential as patient admissions increased at the rate of a full hospital a day. And earlier in the week, the governmentaposs chief science advisor Sir Patrick Vallance warned that it was essential the vaccine march continued apace.  Sir Patrick explained the longer the virus was in circulation, the more opportunity it had to mutate further. The World Health Organisation has since confirmed the origins of the iant now being described abroad as the aposUK strainapos - revealing the first sample of the new mutant strain was discovered in Kent on September . Data from the Covid- Genomics UK Consortium shows a key sample was found in a location near Canterbury. Kent Live has confirmed this location relates to information provided by public health agencies about where the patient lived rather than the location of a hospital or lab.  Experts also believe the new strain may have been created by mutating inside an immuno-suppressed person over a long period of time. This means they had a reduced ability to fight off infections and other diseases, normally because of their own condition or illness, such as AIDS or cancer. Dr Jeffrey Barrett, Director of the SARS-CoV- Genomics Initiative at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, said: There’s another case in London from September, so B...was present in both places early.  We don’t know exactly how many cases there were in each place in the early days.  He added: “There have been a number of reports of inidual patients who have prolonged illness, and in whom a similar pattern of mutations to B...arose. So there is a hypothesis that an event like this might have been the origin. Some, but not all, of these patients are immunosuppressed. It does seem like B... is the first example of a new iant arising in this way that went on to circulate widely.  Experts believe the first signicant outbreak was in Kent, followed by Medway. It is then thought to have spread through the London boroughs of Bexley, Greenwich and Havering, before hitting other parts of London and Essex. The speed of increase in cases caused by the new Covid- iant is a key reason touted for tougher restrictions introduced in recent weeks.  Public Health England has said the Government only realised the scale of the problem when cases continued to rise in Kent and Medway in November, despite the national lockdown in place at the time. Speaking on December , the epidemiologist Susan Hopkins said: Towards the end of November it was clear that the Kent and Medway region of the country in particular was going against the tide of the national restrictions and was seeing increases, whereas by November  almost all other parts of the country started to decline.” Ms Hopkins explained an initial review looked at whether this increase in Kent was linked to any particular group in the population or workplace outbreaks.  When this proved not to be the case, Public Health England reviewed the genomic epidemiology to look for changes. Ms Hopkins said: “On December  they found that there was a particular iant that had some mutations in the spike protein that had emerged quite rapidly and was spreading not only in the south east but also in parts of London. “So over the following  hours they rapidly undertook an investigation looking at the phylogenetic tree and the clinical details of the patients in which the cases had arisen.

Rosie and Jonathan Gill-Moss, who had already cancelled one wedding, managed to get married moments before new Covid- restrictions took hold. The couple had a tough , and were determined that  would start better after Rosie, , was forced to watch as Jon battled Covid- in a coma, on a ventilator in intensive care. As Jon, , recovered, he proposed to her by video call from his hospital bed. The couple, who have four young children between them, were determined to get married the weekend before Christmas. But their planned ceremony was cancelled at the eleventh hour with the introduction of Tier  restrictions in December, which cancelled all weddings apart from in exceptional circumstances. The couple had met in a bereavement group after both lost their spouses in tragic circumstances. Rosie lost husband Ben when he went missing during a scuba ing trip off the coast of Dover in March , leaving her to raise children Monty, Hector and Tabitha.  Jon joined the same support network after losing we Sarah to cancer, leaving him and daughter Holly.However, less than a year into their romance, Jon caught coronavirus at the start of the pandemic last year and nearly died.Rosie was warned by medics battling to save him that she should prepare for the worst. Jon says a dictaphone Rosie had filled with messages from their children, friends and family was the reason he eventually woke from his coma, or what the couple often refer to as his aposlong napapos.  He said he realised how closely I did sail to the wind. When their wedding plans were cut short in December the couple were determined to get married by any means. Rosie said: “That beacon of light that we had so, so looked forward to was blown out. “But after the news I received in March that I may never see Jon again, it was just a minor blip in comparison.  “And watching the devastating losses so many have suffered this year, it was really just a small setback.” Since Christmas the couple had been trying to rearrange their day when talk of yet another lockdown began emerging in January. In a race against time, with just hours before new tougher restrictions were brought in at midnight on Monday, the couple, armed with face masks - but having forgotten wedding rings in the rush - dashed to get hitched after registrars at The Mansion House in Tunbridge Wells said they could marry them. With close family watching via Facetime it was left to two best friends to serve as witnesses, who dropped everything and arrived in the casual clothes they were wearing when they received the call.

Not because something awkward happened during the meal but because of an incident with the waitress which put a massive dampener on the evening out. It was meant to be a pleasant meal at a restaurant, and all was going straightforwardly, until it came to payment. I dined in at a local Chinese restaurant with a friend, the anonymous man explained on Reddit. Great food, but almost no interactions were made with any of the waitresses other than being given the food, as you had to reserve your table position online in advance, as well as place your order online once finally seated . The bill came out to be just about , and I tipped just a little above %, giving . Our waitress took the bill from our table, paid for in cash, and as we were readying to get up and leave, she ed with the  bill we left to cover the tip and in a passive-aggressive tone saying, Was something wrong with the food  Whereaposs the rest of the tip . Ouch. The exchange didnapost sit well with the man - who was annoyed by her manner. I didnapost appreciate that we were even approached at all, and I was shocked and confused that an interaction as such even happened, as I recall it being the very first time I was confronted for not tipping enough, as my usual % tip suffices in past restaurant experiences, he added.  In an act of frustration, I took back the  I left as a tip from the bill and walked out of the restaurant with my friend without saying a word, despite the waitress trying to get our attention as we walked away. In the moment, we both agreed that it was an insane thing for the waitress to do, acting aswe didnapost tip at all. The waitress that had confronted us had been someone we had close to almost no contact with the entire time, as she had only been to our table once to give our food, as I had stated above. But reflecting on it, we were wondering what shouldaposve been done in that situation.

Kaelah Marlow died on Thursday at Waihi Beach with witnesses describing the horric scene as people screamed in panic. The teenageraposs aunt Kylie French told The West Australian their entire family was “in shock.” “We can’t get over there, mum can’t get over there,” she said. “You hear about shark attacks but never in a million years do you think it’ll be someone you know. “She was a lovely girl, a fun girl, always bubbly, into anything.” Ms Marlow suffered fatal bite wounds to her legs while in the water near Western Bay of Plenty. Leguards raced to the scene and dragged her from the water. Emergency services were called to the scene on where they performed vigorous CPR on the victim, according to local reports. Witness Elliot Hall said he had heard the victim was seen swimming just past the breaking waves when she started screaming. Mr Hall said he watched paramedics perform CPR on the woman for around  minutes as family and friends gathered around her.  Another witness, Tadhg Stopford, said a man and a woman standing near the victim as she was treated appeared to be in shocked distress. Despite the best efforts of paramedics she was sadly pronounced dead at the scene, reports New Zealand news site, Stuff. After CPR efforts were stopped, Mr Stopford said the man stood near the victim in distress then walked into the sea and stayed there for several minutes. As the tragedy unfolded, other swimmers in the water were ordered to evacuate as a rescue helicopter landed on the beach. One swimmer, Mark Wilson, said sharks are often seen in the area and thought it may only be a matter of time before an incident happened. Mr Wilson believed the shark involved was a pointer shark - otherwise known as a great white.  Attending the vigil held in the womanaposs honour, he said: It could have been any of us, so we just thought weaposd have a drink for the person involved. While other locals said it was not unusual for sharks to be seen in the shallow waters at the beach, they are usually not harmful to swimmers. Kina Scollay said: It is unusual. At this time of year thousands of people are swimming off that area. In general, you shouldnapost have to worry about sharks. Itaposs just so tragic. My thoughts are with the womanaposs family. The womanaposs body was transferred to the Coastguard building, where family members stayed until around :pm. Locals held a vigil at the beach on Thursday evening, local time, in memory of the victim.

Osama Abou Hajar posted a photograph of himself standing in the rubble of his decimated city in  alongside a shot of him graduating from the Institute of Technology Carlow, in Ireland, last November. The -year-old told the Mirror he hoped his LinkedIn post, which has received more than , likes, would inspire his friends back home to chase their dreams. Osama fled Syria in  after bombing flattened his home city of Maaposarat al-Nuaposman - even destroying the top two floors of his apartment block. He was studying electrical and mechanical engineering at Aleppo University when war broke out in . His city, which is near Aleppo, was one of the first places to be bombed in the country. Osama told the Mirror: In  the city was nearly empty. There were  people left compared to around , before the war. There was lots of destruction. We lived in apartments and the top two floors were blown up. My house was nearly destroyed. The bombing was so loud. Bombs would drop  metres away and destroy glass and blow the doors off. Despite the danger Osama did what he could to help the people around him who had stayed behind. In his LinkedIn graduation post, he shared a picture from  of him handing a blanket to a man in the ruined city. He finally fled the country in  to pursue a better le and to avoid being conscripted into the army.  Osama escaped to Lebanon with his family and after a year they were able to move to Ireland thanks to a United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees resettlement programme. He said: We were the first Syrian group to come to Ireland. I had one goal in my head - to get into college and to get a job at a big company. When I arrived I had very little English. I knew some words but I had never pronounced them. He said his English was so poor he was afraid to speak to anyone during his first six months in Ireland. However, his confidence began to grow after he enrolled on a computer programming course at Dublin Business School in .

Osama said he cried tears of joy when he found out he had been accepted onto the four-year course in . He finally graduated in November and secured his dream job at Erionaposs software campus in Athlone, County Westmeath, Ireland.  The coronavirus pandemic meant that the Institute of Technology Carlow scrapped its normal graduation ceremony and carried out a virtual one instead, although Osama was keen to mark the moment in person with his friend.They went to the grounds of the college and his friend took a picture of him dressed in his graduation robe.

closure in 1981 marked the end of an era for dundee jute empire","story":"The closure of Camperdown Works  years was the death knell for Dundee’s ‘Juteopolis’ empire.For  years the Camperdown complex, at one time sprawling over more than  acres, was the industrial giant of the suburb.Countless thousands of Lochee folk spun there, sons and daughters following parents, generation after generation.When the jute trade was busy, Lochee prospered.In its heyday the city was the world centre for the manufacture of the fabric, with around , people dependant on the industry for their livelihoods.The impact of the jute industry ultimately attracted more people to Lochee.Irish workers started to arrive to join the endless rows of women, men and children who made the bobbins fly and the mills bustle.They came mainly from the Irish counties where linen and yarn were produced such as Donegal, Londonderry, Monaghan, Sligo and Tyrone.By , Camperdown Works employed over , people and was one of Britain’s greatest industrial complexes.The -foot Cox’s Stack was the landmark for what became the largest jute works in the world.Underground tunnels fed it from  furnaces.The Cox family built it to ensure smoke from the furnaces was carried well above the nearby workers’ houses.The red and white brick chimney was built in  and reputedly contained a million bricks.Camperdown was so big it had its own branch line and railway station.The industry was hit by a series of booms and slumps in the th century, before falling into decline in the th century.In , Cox Brothers was one of several Dundee firms which came together to form Jute Industries , under the chairmanship of James Ernest Cox, with Camperdown remaining one of its key works.By , there were only  jute firms left out of a total of  at the industry’s peak, with polypropylene being widely used as the backing for carpets at the expense of jute.But Camperdown weathered all the storms until markets slumped to an all-time low.The announcement by Sidlaw Industries was made in January  that Camperdown Works would be closing.The  jobs which went would bring to close on , the redundancy total for jute, propylene and carpets in Dundee since the start of the s.The jute industry of Tayside shrunk to some seven firms with probably less than , of a workforce.Sidlaw Industries were left after the Camperdown closure with  textile employees and only two jute mills at Manhattan in Dundee and Selbie in Gourdon.The directors were hopeful that the closure would ensure the remainder of their jute operations would become viable after they had been running at a heavy loss.There was an atmosphere of gloom and despondency in Lochee although workers admitted the closure was inevitable.Local historian Dr Kenneth Baxter from the University of Dundee said: “Although by  its workforce was a fraction of what it had been at the start of the th century, Camperdown Works was still employing a workforce of  people when it was announced that Sidlaw Industries were ending their textile operations at the site.“Aside from the obvious financial implications for those who would lose their jobs and local businesses which had benefited from the millworkers custom the closure was undoubtedly of huge symbolic importance for Lochee and for Dundee as a whole.“Camperdown Works was inextricably linked to the growth and history of Lochee for over a century and a quarter, so its closure was always going to be felt hard by its inhabitants.“Although it was not quite the end of the jute industry in Dundee, Camperdown Works# closure cannot be seen as anything other than a blow to the city.“Camperdown Works, and its famed Cox#s Stack, can be seen as the ultimate physical symbols of Victorian Dundee#s industrial might.“The end of this iconic works showed beyond question that the era of Dundee as a great centre of the textile industry was well and truly over.“While a signicant portion of the site would eventually be redeveloped, for some time after the closure the derelict buildings and others remains of industrial activity on the site served as a rather stark reminder of the rise and fall of Juteopolis.”Following closure of the works in , some parts of the complex were sold for demolition in .The BBC used the site in  to double for a bombed-out wartime Berlin in its mini-series Christabel where Dundee High School pupils were used to portray urchins playing among the rubble.Much of the industrial heritage made way for the Stack Leisure Park which opened in .Cox’s Stack was retained as a landmark feature linking the new commercial area with the housing.The end finally came when the freighter Banglar Urmi arrived in Dundee in October  to signal the end of a glorious era in the city#s history.The  tonnes of raw jute on board represented the last consignment to be spun at the last mill in Dundee, the Tay Spinners premises in Arbroath Road.Once the consignment was spun into yarn for carpet backing, all that was left of the industry was a heritage museum and bitter-sweet memories.“At its peak Camperdown Works employed , hands,” said historian Dr Norman Watson.“It made its own machinery, had its own railway stop, fire station and school.“In its time it was the biggest and grandest jute mill in the world.“In other words, Lochee put all its employment eggs in one basket.“Its strength in Victorian times became its undoing in the th century.“There was little alternative work and in some ways the suburb has never recovered from jute’s gradual decline.“When Cox’s whistle blew and the Camperdown gates swung open, a sea of cloth-capped, shawl-clad workers spilled on to Lochee High Street.“Pictures of closing time are reminiscent of the full-time exodus at Tannadice or Dens.“Now Lochee’s streets are too often quiet.”Dundee bred Edward Cox inherited Cox Brothers, the family firm, after his father died in .He helped turn the company into one of the world#s best known jute manufacturers and the largest ever industrial concern in Dundee.His contemporaries described him as a man of great business ability.Cox was hugely influential in all areas of city le and from a young age he was involved in philanthropic and religious work.He was president of the Dundee Chamber of Commerce and also a governor of University College Dundee .Cox#s power stretched across Scotland and the UK in his post as director and deputy chairman of the Caledonian Railway Company.In addition to taking a keen interest in the university, Cox purchased the Alexander C Lamb collection of old Dundee literature and pictures and presented it to Dundee Library as a gt to the city.Cox stepped in when the collection was on the point of being dispersed to ensure it survived in the city intact.He died from pneumonia aged  in March  at his Cardean estate in Meigle, Perthshire.Cox died with an estate worth over £,, which would be about £ million after inflation today.Newsletter Get top stories

I played with Boyley at Dundee and look what he has gone and done at Hibs.“Paul is that type of player # he is quick, he is dynamic, he sets up goals, he scores goals # he brings a real attacking threat to the team.“He is only  and he will definitely improve. We are looking forward to working with him in the summer.“He will improve our team but we believe we will improve him as a player.“He is the right age and fits the right profile for what we are trying to do.“Paul will bring something we don’t have # out and out real pace. Not a lot of teams have that which was why we were so keen to get it done.”Asked whether McMullan could become a Dundee player this month, McPake replied: “The deal was done as a pre-contract and that’s what it is with a view to the summer.“This has been one we have worked on for a while. We almost got him in the last window but it fell through in the end.“United decided he wasn’t going anywhere and Paul decided he wasn’t going to Ross County.“We knew then that we would probably have to wait until now to offer him a pre-contract to get him in the summer.“He is still only  and has loads of potential. But he has already won a title and played a lot of football for someone of his age.“He is an exciting player and one that was very high on the list of what we were looking for.”McPake added: “He is a good player and I know him as a person. He is a good character and the one thing about him is he is very hungry to learn and very hungry to come to Dundee and do well.“He really fits the bill for what we are looking to do.”Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/01/2.57442686-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/01/2.57442686-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/01/2.57442686-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/01/2.57442686-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"tay road bridge to close for three nights due to essential repair work","story":"Motorists are being warned that the Tay Road Bridge will be closed overnight next week for three nights while repair work is carried out.The bridge will be closed between midnight and am on Tuesday , Wednesday  and Thursday  January.  The work will be completed by am on Friday January .The bridge will be closed for essential joint repairs on Tuesday , Wednesday , and Thursday  January .

It really is so professional.”Over the years Mr Craig # who later became a janitor at Mearns Academy # has taken part in many rescues, some of which have been successful and others which have been more tragic. He admitted those involving someone local were particularly hard to come to terms with.But among the tragedies have also been light-hearted moments, and friendly rivalry with the other emergency services # like one rescue, where both the RNLI and coastguards were keen to be the ones to take two German women back to dry land safely.The pair, who were in swimsuits, were picked up safely but caused quite a stir.It is that camaraderie that Mr Craig will miss when he steps down.“On a leboat, you have to trust your team, and the crew is like a family,# he said.#Stonehaven is a small town, everyone knows everyone and it’s great to be part of the community and do your bit. #Away from the leboat, the proud grandfather-of-two also dedicated his time to the Stonehaven Air Cadets as a flight lieutenant and was made an MBE in  for his service.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/01/2.40951265-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/01/2.40951265-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/01/2.40951265-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/01/2.40951265-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"number of people registering for north east libraries on the increase","story":"Sign-ups to libraries across the north-east has continued to increase in the past year.A freedom of information request has shown that the number of library cards signed up for in both Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire has risen compared to the last year.In Aberdeen, data for   shows that a total of , adults signed up for a library card at one of the city#s libraries, while  teens aged between  and  got a card and , children were registered.This compares to , adults,  teenagers and , children who were registered in  .The library service also saw a huge increase in the number of people signing up for online cards, as you can read e-books and listen to audiobooks through applications.So far this financial year, there has been , online sign ups, compared to  in  , and  in  .Councillor Claire Imrie, Aberdeen City Council’s mental health and wellbeing spokeswoman, said: #We are delighted with the continued increase in the number of people applying to join their local library.#Particularly given the challenging year we have all had, with library buildings closed for a substantial time during the early Lockdown.

She has travelled and trekked throughout the world but now lives in Argyll amongst the scenery she loves. www.heatheryheightsDuring wintry weather and shorter days it can be tricky fitting in longer walks and time for exploring the outdoors.What is fantastic about Knapdale and Kintyre is that we only have to go a short distance to gain truly spectacular views. The three walks in this edition y from relatively short, using tracks and paths to the lovely viewpoint of Castle Dounie, to challenging, where the terrain is tough underfoot and good route finding skills are required. All three start at Crinan harbour before climbing up through oak and birch woods to gain open vistas with views to Jura, Scarba and Mull. The convoluted ridge walks are rugged and wild, the steep sides sweeping down to the Sound of Jura where tides race and swirl. If you are lucky you may see pods of dolphins or even whales.. At the car park a signboard shows the Crinan Trail. This is the shorter of the routes but all three start and finish together. Leave the car park and turn left. Keeping to the road by the shore you will see a trail marker post ahead leading you briefly along the shore before the path heads into oak woods. After m the path bends sharply left. To the right a faint trail heads west towards the Sailor’s Grave but your route starts its steep muddy ascent to the forestry road above.. On reaching the road turn right, after m you will reach a bench and the first junction to your left. Here you have a choice either come back from the track ahead or to your left. All routes can be undertaken in either direction. I suggest for the longer routes you go straight on and for the Crinan Trail you go left.. For the Crinan Trail follow the waymark posts and arrows. After .km the route turns right onto a path and winds up and down with glimpses of views to come. Turn left at a sign for a viewpoint. This will take you up to the knoll atop which the remains of Castle Dounie, a prehistoric dun, command spectacular views over the sound towards the Gulf of Corryvreckan. There it is said the Cailleach Bheur, a giant witch, once washed her plaid in its whirlpools. Enjoy the vista before ing down to the junction and turn left. The path now meanders down to the forestry road. Turn right and head north round the coast above Adnoe Point and back to your path down to Crinan harbour.. For the longer walks, go straight ahead at the bench . Follow the track for nearly km, which leads you round a couple of hairpin bends and above Adnoe Point, before turning south. Keep your eyes open for the waymark posts and turn left onto a path. Head uphill for m. At the viewpoint sign turn right up to Castle Dounie and enjoy. To your south is the ridge that leads to Creag Mhor.. Immediately after dropping from Castle Dounie you will see a broken down wall on your right. Follow this for a short distance until you can start to work your way up onto the ridge to your right, by a couple of birch trees with coners on the skyline above. The ridge walk is convoluted, airy, rough and summits numerous lumps and bumps with fantastic views. Keep to the crest or east side as the drop-offs to the west are impressive but not to be dallied with. The highest rocky bump of Creag Mhor is parallel to the north end of the rocks offshore.. After  minutes of knobbly and exposed ridge walking #you do not fancy tackling navigation along walls in woods # this is now the time to keep an eye out for an obvious wide firebreakin the trees, below to your left. This leads you at a ° angle straight to a forestry track in the valley below. To check you have the right point look across from the firebreak and you should see a wall continue the line on the other side. Head down the firebreak to the track and turn left. This will take you back to the junction by the bench where you can turn right on the forest road then left todown the path to Crinan harbour.. If you wish to adventure on* and are confident with your route finding then continue south on the ridge # crossing over an old wall not on the map # to where it suddenly drops to a tiny col with forest directly ahead. Ahead is a steep little rise with walls on it. One drops to the right but it is the one going southwest into the forest you need to follow, for the next m. Keeping the wall directly on your right, circumnavigating the odd boulder and ducking the odd branch, you will see that the deer have created quite a path and that the way is often clear. Eventually it drops you very steeply down to a stream with another wall directly ahead. Turn left, southeast, up the stream with the wall on your right # it is boggy # until you reach a quaint waterfall on your left. A small break in the wall to your right allows you to escape the trees that have fallen across the wall higher up. Continue with it on your left across a tree harvested area and up the bump ahead. You will pop out onto a track end.. Follow this short track down to the forest road below. Turn right and almost immediately turn left onto a grassy track that crosses a stream and heads east up into the forest. After m you will come to a sharp left-hand bend. Directly in front of you a wall goes steeply up into the trees. This is your route up to Bealach na Moine. It leads up slippery, mossy rock for m, over a barbed wired fence , up a very rough and eroded track for nearly m, past a spring hidden with fallen trees, then over more pleasant grass and moss to the col. This last section makes you realise why it is worth the effort as views open up east and west. Turn right over a couple of steep little hillocks on the ridge. Suddenly ahead you will see your goal, the trig point and the summit of Cnoc Reamhar, also known as Gallachoille Hill and a Marilyn to boot. It really is a fantastic view.. Toeither descend the way you came or drop down from one of the breaks in the ridge to the north end of the small lochan on the west side of the summit, and follow the faint Landover track north to the spring. Re-join your ascent route, taking care on the way down. Turn rightat the forest road it is now an easy km back to the junction with the bench. Turn right then left after m, following the path back to Crinan harbour.*You can also drop down the firebreak and turn right on the track to join the route up to Cnoc Reamhar,continuing along the ridge does not appeal.The described routes and accompanying information are there to be used as a guide and do not replace the use of map and compass and the skills required to use them.

The sector in Scotland accounts for around  per cent of UK production and is worth about £ million annually.One fth of these exports go to the EU, amounting to more than , tonnes a year.This is clearly a disastrous Brexit outcome for Scottish farmers and like all other aspects of Brexit, foisted on Scotland against its will.A terrible negotiating failure on the part of the Tory government, and a devastating blow to an extremely valuable part of Scotland’s farming industry, I am sure it will not be the first damaging impact to be highlighted once the deal is fully analysed.Alex Orr, EdinburghSir,The report on the Piers and Harbours Asset Management Plan and Fees and Charges –  , submitted to the Argyll and Bute Council Harbour Board meeting of December ,  makes interesting reading.At a time when budgets are tight and councils have had to make hard decisions about where to cut services, it is dficult to understand why the council budget should be used to supplement the funding of dedicated ferry infrastructure for which CMAL should be responsible.The asset management plan allocates £,, for planned marine infrastructure works for the year  , of which only £, , is devoted to multi-use facilities. The remainder, £,,, is mostly allocated to single-use ferry facilities, and a huge proportion of that is to provide overnight parking for CalMac ferriesreaders will have to make up their own minds about the merits of spending £,, for an overnight berth at Fionnphort, and £, on a feasibility study for a breakwater at Lismore.CMAL pay back around half of the £,, to the council through harbour dues for the use of council-owned piers, however, that still leaves a whopping £ million gap in the required funding.If past experience of other CMAL projects is anything to go by, the planned eight per cent increase in council harbour fees and charges up to   is not going to cover it.Fergus Gillanders, KilmelfordSir,Last year, , was challenging and, although many people like to give generously to charity at Christmas time, it may have been dficult to make a donation this festive season.It#s not too late # you can still help support the Royal National Institute of Blind Peopleby collecting and donating used stamps from cards and parcels you may have received.Your stamps will be recycled and turned into vital funds that will help RNIB support children with vision impairment.

These additional consumers will need more food while Scotland’s multial land can also meet, at the same time, the growing demand for a range of goods and services that hits targets on climate change, the environment, renewable energy, bioersity, and the wider and hugely important rural economy.#To move forward urgently, let us identy all the means and mechanisms we can put in place.  Let us have credibility for farmers by investing in bioeconomy, bioenergy, agro-forestry, precision farming, and shorter food chains – support for which is within the Government’s gt.#NFUS has been promoting our industry as one that can change to meet public goods for public money requirements, with an upbeat forward-looking mindset. This outlook will empower our farmers and crofters and drive us forward to the holy grail of sustainable profit with all the environmental, welfare and standards the public expect as thefor their investment and support for our industry.#In , the black cloud of COVID- needs swept away, a process driven by the vaccines that our scientists have developed, and lessons learned on the things we should do better but also how we have adapted and adopted new methods for good.#People should be more accepting of others’ views with ambition to work collaboratively for mutual benefit. There is a belief binary tribalism is ‘the norm’ and the use of social media to promulgate the “yer either for us or agin us” culture is acceptable. It is not hard being considerate and kind.#Agriculture also urgently needs delivery of an ambitious coherent policy delivering a sustainable profitable industry that addresses climate change, bioersity and an increasing demand for nutritious high standard and welfare food. Procrastination has a price.#Brexit will go by, like foot and mouth, the oil crisis, and the great depression, but we need enough freedom and flexibility to be able to innovate and chose our own paths through it as well.#We need to throw open our doors to the public and build trust on what we do and how we do it. There is huge potential from selling our story both on farm and in the food chain. We also need to encourage more ersity in our industry across the piece it can and will add value both financially and culturally.#To quote Shihab Kazi: #The moment you need to get started is called #now#.##I wish everyone health wealth and happiness for the coming year.#"},{"url":null,"title":"golf club responds to covid restrictions","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Wearing jackets meant the school unorm was hidden so, led by school captain Jamie Blair, house hoodies were designed and ordered in time for Christmas.As the annual Christmas concert could not take place this year, the sixth year did not want to disappoint people so a virtual concert was organised by vice captain Amber Blake, with the help of Tarbert Academy’s gted students.A video was compiled to showcase their many talents. Continuing with the Christmas fun, a lot of hard work and effort was put into decorating the school into a Winter Wonderland for everyone to enjoy, which included stables for all of Santa#s reindeer.Finally, to thank the community for its continuous support throughout the year the S pupils wanted to show their appreciation by making hampers for people who may have been celebrating Christmas on their own this year.Working with volunteer community support group Team Tarbert, they created hampers containing freshly baked goods as well as non-perishables and generous donations of soup, marmalade cakes and oatcakes from Tarbert Co-op.Complying with social distancing, the sixth year pupils delivered these special hampers to people around the community.Fiona McTaggart, Team Tarbert co-ordinator, said: #We were delighted when the S pupils asked for our support with this fantastic project. This leadership class should be very proud of themselves for putting a smile on many faces.#In these dficult times, and especially when they are in such an important time of their last school year, to put others before themselves is just wonderful.#I#ve also spoken with several recipients and they were absolutely thrilled to receive their hampers with a little something from the ELC, primary and secondary children.

And it includes nursery schools, as well as primary and secondary schools.Ms Sturgeon said: \"I want to be clear that it remains our priority to get school buildings open again for all pupils as quickly as possible and then keep them open.\"However, right now, two factors mean that it is not consistent with a safety-first approach for all children to attend school in person.\"First, the overall level of community transmission is too high. We need to get transmission down before schools can safely reopen. A period of online learning will also, in turn, help us do that.\"The second reason is that there is still signicant uncertainty about the impact of the new iant on transmission amongst young people.\"We, therefore, have to adopt a cautious approach.\"So most pupils will be learning online for at least the rest of the month.\"This decision will be reviewed on January  whether they canto school on February .Meeting people outdoorsFrom tomorrow,the rule on outdoor gatherings will change.Previously, up to six people from two households are able to meet outdoors. Given the greater transmissibility of this new iant, the Scottish Government willconsider it necessary to restrict that further.From tomorrow, a maximum of two people from up to two households will be able to meet outdoors.Children aged  and under will not be counted in that limit, and they will also be able to play outdoors in larger groups, including in organized gatherings.However, for everyone  ndash including  to -year-olds - outdoor exercise should only take place in a way which is consistent with the twopeople from twohouseholds rule.Working from homeAnyone who is able to work from home must do so.It will only be a reasonable excuse to leave your home to go to workthat work cannot be done from home.The Scottish Government are asking people and businesses to take this \"really seriously\" because the situation is at least as serious now as it was then.The law already requires many businesses in certain sectors to close in Level .Every business is being asked to look again at their operations and to make sure that every singlethat can be done by people working at home, is being done in that way.Shielding advice changesIf you were shielding and you cannot work from home, our clear advice now is that you should not go into work at all.Hospitals near capacityNicola Sturgeon confirmed that thetotal number of Covid- patients in hospital is close to its April peak.In terms of hospital beds, NHS Ayrshire and Arran is currently at % of its Covid- capacity, and three other health boards - Borders, GreaterGlasgow  Clyde and Lanarkshire - are above % of their capacity.The total number of patients in intensive care in Scotland is already above normal winter levels. Indeed, all mainland health boards have now exceeded their normal intensive care unit capacity.And it is important to be clear that people who are in hospital and ICU now are likely to have been infected  days to twoweeks ago.Other restrictions will also come into effect includingplaces of worship closing,no wakes, two-metre distancing in canteens and further premises closing.The fortnightly review will not simply be a choice between opening and closing schools - we will always seek to maximise the number of pupils we can safely get back to classrooms and nurseries.What help will be provided Grants areavailable for businesses required to close as a result of restrictions.

Thorne Security says it could have a system in operation for £,, less than half the amount the  previously thought it would cost.The system would include four cameras to cover Main Street, Longrow, Burnside Square and the area around Hall Street and the cross.Four special television screens at Campbeltown Police Station would allow the police to watch the pictures from the cameras. The images would be recorded on an industrial-quality video recorder at the station. The pictures could alert the police to trouble or help them trace offenders.The team from Thorne Security will be visiting Campbeltown at the end of January to demonstrate the equipment.The secretary of the , Sergeant Douglas Reid of Campbeltown police, has already contacted the Scottish Office for more details about the funding package. Sergeant Reid said: ‘The  is fully committed, following the tremendous public response, to go in as far as possible along this road.’The  is already planning to apply to other local and national bodies for contributions towards the cost of the system.The Scottish Office’s challenge competition will make funds available for groups representing local communities to bid for money to fund CCTV systems.Applicants from dferent areas will bid in competition with each other for a share of the government cash.The first town centre security camera system in Scotland was set up in Airdrie three years ago. New research shows that in the first two years after the system was set up, the crime rate plunged by  per cent.The Scottish Office says there is no evidence that crime was simply being shted to areas outwith the reach of the cameras. Instead the total amount of recorded crime actually fell.FIFTY YEARS AGOMcCartney again!Mr Paul McCartney, ex-bass guitarist with the Beatles, has recently purchased from Mr A Revie, Loch Ranachan Farm, which comprises  acres and adjoins his other farm, High Park.Mr McCartney has been spending a few days on the farm with his we and family over the festive season.One happy Rangers fanMr Crawford Morans of  Albyn Avenue, who is employed with the Ministry of Social Security, has had a good ending to the old year.

In the Clyde, however, the Board of Trade did not insist on this in respect of vessels trading exclusively within what is known as the smooth water area.This area was within an imaginary line drawn from Skipness Point to Fairlie. On the date in question, the accused conveyed a cargo from Glasgow to Tobermory via the Crinan Canal.As soon as he had left Crinan, he was in contravention of the regulations, having entered the more hazardous waters off the west coast.On behalf of the accused, an agent stated that he had traded with the Bloodhound for nearly  years. During the war, the ship had been requisitioned by the Ministry of Shipping, and under the orders of that department had been sent outside the limits of the smooth water area.The accused had naturally thought that what he had been doing during the war, when he traded to ports on Islay and the Ayrshire coast, he was free to do now.Sherf Macmaster Campbell imposed a penalty of £."},{"url":null,"title":"leader january 1 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Many people will have been blessed by her words over the years. Our thanks go to her at this time.We are all pleased to see the end of . A year that saw so many things we took for granted taken from us – our normal family events, our employment and our interaction with our friends.In true Kintyre style, we found ways of minimising the effects of these disruptions by using technology, supporting the vulnerable and keeping in touch by telephone. But it was a scary time for all of us.When this #Thought for the Week# was in the planning stage, we imagined that in our corner of Scotland, in Kintyre, we would be well rid of strict lockdowns, have a low position on the tier system and le would be getting back to some sort of normality. We are not there yet.When parents are bringing up children, they teach them by repetition – clean your teeth tidy your bedroom I love you, you are special.God, as our Father, does exactly the same. In the Bible, more than  times He says: #Do not be afraid# or phrases that mean this. Let us take this truth into the New Year with us.Let us all pray that soon we can say we are not afraid and what a dferent year  is.#Away, then all fears.

Searching for innovative ways to reconnect with audiences at home and abroad TWTC’s creative director Sadie Dixon-Spain created the ‘Clanagram’, creating paid employment for actors, and producing virtual keepsakes for audiences.Clanagrams are personalised video greetings, sending friends and family near and far love and good cheer, as TWTC’s team of professional actors bring to le a selection of Scotland’s great names.An ideal gt for those with Scottish heritage, Scots in exile, or simply lovers of all things Scottish – it is a unique message from a Scottish hero, sent to them directly to celebrate a special occasion, or simply just to make them smile.Visit www.clanagram to become a member of Bonnie Prince Charlie’s army and receive a message from the Young Pretender himself, a recitation of poetry by the national bard, or a tale from Scotland’s most famous outlaw, Rob Roy.The arts have suffered immensely due to the Covid- pandemic, while tight restrictions continue to press pause on the live events industry. With the creation of digital performances and offerings such as Clanagrams, TWTC aims to continue finding innovative ways of performing, bringing theatre back to audiences, and offering creative professionals employment once again.WEST KINTYRE:Nothing blows away the cobwebs like a walk along Westport Beach on Kintyre#s west coast.The beach, the longest in mainland Argyll, is one of the jewels in Kintyre#s crown and usually draws surfers and tourists from near and far all year round.At the moment, however, under the strict new lockdown measures which limit travel, it is much quieter than usual and is frequented mainly by walkers, runners and dog-walkers living nearby.This photograph, taken by Mid Argyll-based amateur photographer Aileen Gillies in December, shows not only the beach#s rugged coastline but also its wild beauty."},{"url":null,"title":"down memory lane january 8 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

More than £ million of this we have been grateful to receive at Sightsavers.Money raised by players has been indispensable in helping Sightsavers to fund, in  alone, eye services for more than , people and more than  sight-saving cataract surgeries.In , funding also helped us to support the Covid- response. Children with disabilities kept learning throughout the pandemic, thanks to distance learning equipment and teacher training, PPE and hygiene kits.Children like Marie in Sierra Leone, who is blind and was in danger of being left behind when schools closed, until she was given a typewriter, a radio and assistance so that she could keep studying.So, once again, a big thank you to all the players in Scotland for your generosity.To find out about some of the lives being turned around by players# support, please head on over to www.sightsavers.org ppl or give Sightsavers a call on   .Dr Caroline Harper CBE, Sightsavers CEO.Scots have taken to online technology like never before to keep in touch during this dficult time.When we first went into lockdown, there were concerns on whether our networks would cope with this big increase in online traffic. But, although customers’ usage of data more than doubled during the period, our networks were able to stand up to the demands.I’m immensely proud of the role my colleagues have played in keeping the country connected during this crisis. From the engineers who keep our broadband and mobile networks connected, to the vital contact centre staff in Glasgow, Dundee, Greenock, Edinburgh and Thurso, helping people when they need it most.I’m proud also of the role our people played in supporting the NHS in Scotland during the crisis, including working with Scottish Government to quickly provide communications to the temporary hospitals.The pandemic has shown the vital role digital technology and internet connectivity now plays in all our lives. If all homes and businesses are going to stay ahead, we know that fast and reliable broadband and good mobile coverage is going to be essential for the post-Covid recovery.While BT Group continues to invest billions in these networks, we know that we can’t do this alone. We’ll continue to work with governments and local authorities to make sure that no areas are left behind.Jane Wood, BT Group Scotland director.The  Covid crisis has prompted a greater sense of social cohesion and solidarity but it also exposed and exacerbated some of the barriers that blind and partially sighted people still face.Access to online shopping slots, a lack of essential health information in formats such as audio and braille, and confusion over whether social distancing allowed for blind and partially sighted people to still be guided added to the distress many felt.The first lockdown came out of the blue when we had little real-le experience of managing a national emergency, but it is now more essential than ever that we learn the lessons and ensure no one falls through the safety-net. Another period of enforced confinement during the winter months could hit some particularly hard.During the first lockdown, RNIB Scotland and other charities worked extremely hard to ensure the needs of the most vulnerable were met # at a time when even the most able in society were thrown by the suddenness and uncertainty the crisis had created.We negotiated set online shopping slots for people with sight loss, worked with public bodies to ensure the often vital information they put out was available in formats accessible to everyone, and claried the rules on guiding people with a visual impairment.These gains must be reinforced  we are ing to another nationwide lockdown.Currently, around , people are living in Scotland with signicant sight loss. Although most are over the age of , around , children and young people also have a visual impairment.The RNIB Helpline remains available on    and information continues to be broadcast on RNIB#s Connect Radio station. The RNIB Talking Book library posts and downloads thousands of titles in audio and other formats.Find out more at www.rnib.org.uk scotlandJames Adams, director, RNIB Scotland.As always in such matters, the UK-EU Brexit deal will iniably throw up more than a few surprises aside from the usual headlines heralding a British #victory# in negotiations.The fact that, for example, seed potatoes are not to be included in the deal will be deeply damaging to our rural economy. Scottish seed potato farmers are one of the biggest exporters of potatoes, used in the production of chips and crisps, in the world.The sector in Scotland accounts for around  per cent of UK production and is worth about £ million annually.One fth of these exports go to the EU, amounting to more than , tonnes a year.This is clearly a disastrous Brexit outcome for Scottish farmers and like all other aspects of Brexit, foisted on Scotland against its will.A terrible negotiating failure on the part of the Tory government, and a devastating blow to an extremely valuable part of Scotland’s farming industry, I am sure it will not be the first damaging impact to be highlighted once the deal is fully analysed.Alex Orr, Edinburgh."},{"url":null,"title":"meet kintyres heroic davids","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Following enforced shut-down in March , CPH was able to re-open from September to December, one of very few cinemas in the UK to do so.At CGS, Mr Fyfe had to consider the iety of needs of the school#s children and their parents, his own needs and those of his family as he supported the entire network of staff, which includes several more Davids # music teacher David Cosgrove and maths teachers David Hamilton and David MacDonald.The heroic work of all the school#s staff through lockdown ranges from supervising vulnerable and key workers# children in the HUB and the challenges of online learning, to packing and distributing food parcels and delivering hot lunches in the community.As leboat coxswain, Mr Cox leads a crew which includes several heroic Davids # David Mullen, David Ward, David Campbell, David Colville and David Reid.Despite still having to attend all call-outs, in full kit and PPE, the team#s training came to a halt soon into the first lockdown, but they were eventually able toto training on a two-week rotation, one week on land, the other offshore.Having to physically distance proved incredibly hard for the crew, with multiple people required to safely carry out some tasks.Even small rescues using the Y-Boat # the vessel on top of the Severn-class leboat, not to be confused with the inshore rescue boat which is towed on a trailer # presented challenges given the amount of space on the boat.Masks were, and continue to be, worn inside the wheelhouse at all times and when working closely together outside on the deck.These Davids # and, of course, so many other people in the community # helped navigate the community through unprecedented and challenging circumstances in many dferent ways.If you know of a heroic David who deserves a shout-out, please let us know by emailing editor@campbeltowncourier or telephoning  .CAPTIONS:David Cox.

There was heavy traffic and, needless to say, Irsquod never driven a bus before and hadnrsquot expected to at this moment either.ldquoYou mean drive the bus  I foolishly asked.ldquoThatrsquos why you are here, isnrsquot it  he replied.I was on the bus with two other learners, as well as the instructor. We had been given some rudimentary instructions by him as hersquod driven the bus into the busy city centre, but I hadnrsquot realised we would actually have to drive the bus through busy streets.That was the first time I had driven a bus. It was, of course, an assessment of my capabilities. I negotiated as best I could and quickly learned what a tail swing was, as I nearly shaved off the nose of a woman who was standing on the edge of a pavement waiting to cross the road!The gearstick felt like it had been cemented to the vehicle, making changing gears a Herculean effort, with the engine roaring as I struggled to crunch it into gear. I drove slowly and cars began honking their horns in frustration.There was a big L on the rear of the bus, but I think when people see a bus in the city centre they assume the person driving actually knows how to drive a bus!It was a stressful  minutes and, when I finally pulled over, the instructor looked at his notes shaking his head. I cannot repeat what he said, but it was a generally negative assessment with lots of adjectives.Yet I wasnrsquot written off and was told I needed six full days of lessons as a minimum before sitting my test. Against everyonersquos expectations, including mine, I passed first time.I had done it and realised one of my lersquos dreams.There was a specic reason I needed a bus driving licence: I wanted to be a driver guide and take people around Scotland on tour. My le had undergone some dramatic changes and my le ambitions had changed as a result.It wasnrsquot, of course, about money or climbing a career ladder, but about the hopeful expectation it would make me rich in experiences and give me a new angle on le.My head and heart were full of Scotlandrsquos stories, and this seemed a perfect way to use my love of history and folklore, and share my passion for the landscape that held so many personal memories for me. I felt my le was about to be transformed and indeed it was.So that day I passed my bus driving test was a day of utter joy. Although over  years ago now, I can still feel the elation.I worked for dferent tour companies at dferent times in my le over the following  years. It was something I couldto whenever I needed it. During the last period of my time as a driver guide, a transport manager called Ronnie worked miracles as he juggled my rota to fit round my very complicated childcare arrangements. I will be forever grateful to him for his understanding.Were my expectations of the job realised or did I have an over-romanticised image of it  Irsquod say a bit of both. I tried my best to showcase Scotland, but I quickly understood people travel for dferent reasons with dferent interests.But it opened a window on the world for me. I met so many people from dferent walks of le and dferent countries and cultures. It taught me so much about the way humans behave towards each other and how we handle and respond to experiences in dfering ways.We were all on mini le journeys together, usually three days, sometimes five. In this brief fleck of time, a small group of people would be together amidst the splendour, and sometimes challenging conditions, of Scotland. When connections were made, it was because of shared values, regardless of cultural dferences.I began to see the tours as a metaphor for the way we live our lives, not just in observing others but myself as well. I had never thought the job would be a lesson on the philosophy of le, but that is partly what it became for me.It revealed to me that happiness, enjoyment and appreciation is a default within us, not something to be found, bought or acquired, or even weather dependent!That now seems so obvious but it took years for me to truly understand how we can become so easily trapped in the hedonic treadmill. I know thatrsquos a fancy term, but its meaning is simple: that as we go through le, we quickly take things for granted and so seek new and higher levels of satisfaction which we believe will give us happiness. While we can get a rush of pleasure and satisfaction in new things or experiences, we soon then take those for granted as well. So the cycle continues. We become like dogs chasing our tails in pursuit of what we think will make us happy or give us a more fulfilled le.The tours taught me that appreciation is the key to this. You donrsquot have to be a tour guide to learn this lesson, of course, as we all have our lersquos experiences that teach us. But that treadmill is so easy to fall into, even when you know it offers a  dawn. It can take a conscious effort to climb out of it.That is when we need what is called a hedonic reset: another fancy term for stopping that chase of our tail and taking time to appreciate what we have. This can be done by temporarily depriving ourselves of things we take for granted and so regaining our appreciation of them.A simple example could be when we go camping. I love it, but when I get home I appreciate my bed, my shower and central heating in ways I didnrsquot before we left on our camping trip!The virus has forced a reset on all of us it has taken away many things we took for granted: travel, staying with friends, family meals, a coffee and blether with a friend, hugging loved ones, being with loved ones, browsing in a bookshop. We will all have our list.It has been heartbreaking, with devastating consequences for so many peoplersquos livelihoods and emotional wellbeing, as well as a tragic loss of le.Itrsquos an unwanted, brutal and forced reset, but the le lesson I learnt on the tours has helped me understand that appreciation is the key to resilience and getting through this as best as we can.When times relax, as they hopefully will soon, I know how much I will appreciate hugging my daughter I havenrsquot been able to hug for  months, being able to tell stories to a live audience and have a coffee with a friend in a real cafe. And travel to the places I love within my own country.Perhapsthere is any positive out of this, I hope it will be that I will never again fall into that treadmill of taking things I have for granted.So I say Happy New Year to you, and I mean it in a heartfelt way I never meant before."},{"url":null,"title":"vet-column-consider-welcoming-new-pet","story":"ONCE your new puppy or kitten has settled into your household, there are several things to consider, ensuring your new pet is kept fit and healthy.Register with your veterinary surgeon.

One vaccine against the two agents can be given from six weeks of age. Boosters are given annually.Everyone loves a new puppy or kitten, but please be aware of unscrupulous dealers who take advantage of the kind and loving nature of the majority of people.Recently, Kimberly Mackie visited Dunedin Vetsrsquo Tranent surgery with her new puppy Poppy. Poppy is a Jack Russell cross Chihuahua, so is a very small pup. However, Poppy arrived with diarrhoea and very dehydrated, weighing only a few hundred grams.Poppy was examined by vet Chris Monk, who immediately saw how ill little Poppy was.Mum had bought her in all good faith from a family home. It was soon discovered that Poppy had been microchipped and had a vaccination in Eire. Poppy was an import from Eire, a victim of the illegal puppy farming trade.It is so dficult for new owners to know the origin of their pup, especially when the sellers can seem so plausible. Ask to see the parents or at least the mother and other pups in the litter, although they find many ways to circumvent these questions. It is also so dficult toa puppy or kitten once you have cuddled them and instantly fallen in love.The good news is that Poppy, after fluid therapy and medications, and lots of loving care from Dunedin Vets staff and, of course, his forever mum, has made a full recovery and is developing her own special character.We must also consider other preventable conditions which our pets may be susceptible to.Most puppies and kittens are born with a roundworm infestation. Worms are passed to them before birth by their mothers and through motherrsquos milk. This is obviously not very pleasant and potentially these worms pose a risk for humans, especially children.Tapeworms are rarely a problem in puppies and kittens, although one type is actually transmitted by fleas.We recommend worming puppies and kittens at eight,  and  weeks of age with a quality wormer in tablet or liquid form, which will kill most worms.Remember, there may be no obvious signs of worm infestation.Worming should be carried out every three months for the rest of your petrsquos le.Many puppies and kittens arrive at their new home with a population of external parasites. These include fleas and mites.Fleas are passed from one animal to another. Although there are dferent types of dog and cat fleas, they donrsquot mind what they jump onto to feed!Fleas are two to three millimetres long and move quickly through the coat. Flea droppings are black and gritty, and turn reddamp cotton wool is applied to them.Fleas can transmit several diseases, cause allergies and general irritation. Fleas live on your pet, and in the house.You must use a suitable insecticide spray to destroy flea larvae, which can survive for months in the environment. Your veterinary staff can advise what is best for your pet and your home.The rabbit flea is unusual in that it doesnrsquot move very fast. They are often found along the edge of catsrsquo ears and are dficult to remove, so are called lsquostick tightrsquo fleas. Cats pick them up when hunting wild rabbits.Walking dandruff mitesare very common in puppies, kittens and bunnies. They are too small to see but occasionally skin scurf appears to move, which is actually the mites, hence the name.Mange mitesare minute parasites which bury into the skin. Some are passed from mother to young and some spread from pet to pet. Some cause intense scratching, some cause hair loss. Some can be very dficult to treat, requiring specialised anti-parasitic washes or spot on treatment.Ear mites live in the ear canals, causing irritation, lots of wax production and a smell.At Dunedin Vets, we strongly recommend taking out insurance for your pet at a young age. Many breeders will provide initial insurance cover, and many vets will offer free insurance with certain companies for a few weeks. This gives peace of mind whilst you are considering which insurance to purchase. We suggest you look for a lsquolelong coverrsquo policy so your pet will always be covered.Consider a pet health club for your new arrival. Many veterinary practices, including Dunedin Vets, offer this type of scheme. Basically, you spread the cost of your petrsquos preventative healthcare over the year rather than being faced with large bills at booster time, so allowing you to budget monthly for this.Dunedin Vetsrsquo pet health club offers many other benefits and discounts. During these dficult times, many people are finding this a great way to ensure the best care for their pets without burdening themselves financially.Puppies, kittens and bunnies bring so much love to a family and help so much in your wellbeing ndash choose wisely, and look after them well, and you will have a friend and companion for le."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-peeps-past-december-29-31-1995-1970-1920","story":"lsquoPLEASE drink up... the pub is on firersquo was a headline in the East Lothian Courier on December , .Time was called early at the Auld Hoose pub in North Berwick last Wednesday after a fire broke out in the public bar.Customers spotted smoke coming from the floor near a fireplace about pm and the local fire brigade was alerted.The premises were evacuated ndash including an upstairs flat occupied by Jean Borthwick and her Labrador dog, Freeway ndash as landlord Ian McMinn tried to tackle the blaze with a fire extinguisher containing powder.But help was soon at hand in the shape of his brother Hugh, a local fireman, and the rest of the retained crew who began fighting the dense smoke and flames.Sub-officer McMinn explained that cracks in the old hearth at the pubrsquos real fire had caused joists and beams on the floor to burn.AN EAST Lothian pupil became the first from his high school to be accepted to study at the University of Cambridge, reported The Haddingtonshire Courier of December , .Ian Graham, son of Sergeant and Mrs Graham, Tranent, has been accepted for entry into Emmanuel College, Cambridge, in October .Ian is at present in his sixth year at the Ross High School.He was Dux of the School in his fth year and is at present Head Boy.He is a young man of high intellectual ability but at the same time he is an accomplished games player, playing in the School XV and also in the Badminton Club.He is an office-bearer in the Literary and Debating Society and last summer was a gold medallist in athletics at the Scottish Schools Athletics Championships.A MAN was fined pound after being caught stealing a bird from a train station, as reported in The Haddingtonshire Courier of December , .In the Burgh Court, on Friday, before Bailie Main, James Kelly, railway porter, Church Street, Haddington, pleaded guilty to having, on Tuesday, st, stolen a cockerel from a hamper lying in the booking-hall of the station.The Fiscal stated that, about eight orsquoclock on the night in question, a booking-clerk heard a person entering the booking-hall on tip-toe.On going out, he found Kelly alongside the hamper.He made the excuse that the label had been torn off the hamper, and that he was putting it on.The label was afterwards found lying on the floor, but it was discovered that the hamper had been opened and the cockerel removed."},{"url":null,"title":"7am-wait-worth-mum-bonnie-babies-champion-2020-harris-tait","story":"Harris Tait, who celebrated his first birthday on December , was announced as the winner in last weekrsquos Courier.He lives on East Lintonrsquos Longstone Avenue with mum Kirsty, , and dad Andrew, , a maintenance team leader at Torness Power Station.Kirsty described Harris as a ldquofunny and cheeky little boy with ldquosuch a little personality.She added: ldquoHe knows what he wants and is a determined little guy, which I think he takes from me and Andrew.Kirsty, who has been on maternity leave this year but is ing to work on Monday as a customer trade manager at Asda in Livingston, said Harrisrsquo win had been a boost to the family after what has been a tumultuous year.She said: ldquoItrsquos not really been the greatest year and hersquos not been able to interact with other kids and I thought, lsquoWhat have we got to lose rsquo so decided to enter him.ldquoYou never think that you are going to win competitions like these.When the results were announced in last weekrsquos Courier, Kirsty said she was ldquobuzzing and ldquoa bit emotional.

I will set out our decisions shortly.However, I can confirm now, in summary, that we decided to introduce from midnight tonight for the duration of January, a legal requirement to stay at home except for essential purposes. This is similar to the lockdown of March last year.However, before I set out Cabinetrsquos decisions in more detail, I want to explain in some detail why they are so necessary.In the last few weeks, there have been two signicant game changers in our fight against this virus.One, the approval of vaccines, is hugely positive and offers us the way out of this pandemic.But the other - the new faster spreading iant of the virus - is a massive blow.Possibly the most simple way of explaining the challenge we face right now is to compare it to a race.In one lane we have vaccines - our job is to make sure they can run as fast as possible.Thatrsquos why the government will be doing everything we can to vaccinate people as quickly as possible. I will say more about that later.But in the other lane is the virus which - as a result of this new iant - has just learned to run much faster and has most definitely picked up pace in the last couple of weeks.To ensure that the vaccine wins the race, it is essential to speed up vaccination as far as possible.But to give it the time it needs to get ahead, we must also slow the virus down.And because it is now spreading faster, that means even tougher restrictions are necessary.The evidence is now compelling that the new iant is up to % more transmissible than previously circulating strains, and that it may add as much as . to the R number.And according to recent analysis of PCR test samples, it appears that the new iant already accounts for almost half of all new cases in Scotland.That increased and faster spread is undoubtedly driving the very serious situation we now face.Todayrsquos case numbers ndash , new cases, with % of tests being positive - illustrate the severity and urgency of the situation.No new deaths were reported today ndash because yesterday was a Sunday and registration offices were largely closed ndash but since I updated Parliament before Christmas,  deaths have been recorded in the daily figures. That again reminds us of the continuing grief this pandemic is causing.But this is not just about one dayrsquos numbers.We are now seeing a steeply rising trend of infections.Indeed, it is no exaggeration to say that I am more concerned about the situation we face now than I have been at any time since March last year.In the week from  to  December, the seven day incidence of cases per , of the population increased by % - from  per , to  per ,.Test positivity has risen sharply too.The next update on the numbers of Covid patients in hospital and intensive care will be published tomorrow.I would expect these to show that, nationally, the total number of Covid patients in hospital is close to its April peak. And in some boards, the pressure is already very real.For example, in terms of hospital beds, NHS Ayrshire and Arran is currently at % of its Covid capacity, and three other health boards - Borders, Greater Glasgow  Clyde and Lanarkshire - are above % of their capacity.The number of people in intensive care is still signicantly lower than the April peak ndash which partly reflects the fact that treatment of Covid has improved signicantly since last spring.But even so, the total number of patients in intensive care in Scotland is already above normal winter levels. Indeed, all mainland health boards have now exceeded their normal intensive care unit capacity.And it is important to be clear that people who are in hospital and ICU now are likely to have been infected  days to  weeks ago.That means that these numbers reflect what the level of new cases was around  weeks ago.Given that the number of cases has increased signicantly since then, we can expect to see signicantly increased pressure on the NHS over the course of this month.Contingency plans remain in place to double and then treble ICU capacitynecessary.And the NHS Louisa Jordan continues to be available to help meet demand - as indeed it has been doing in recent months. , patients have attended there for scans and outpatient appointments nearly , NHS staff and students have been trained there and it is currently being used for Covid vaccinations.In short, NHS services are coping at present ndash although the pressure on frontline staff is considerable - but already in some areas the position is fragile, and getting more challenging.Andthe rate of increase in case numbers that we have seen in past two weeks was to continue unchecked, there would be a real risk of our NHS being overwhelmed - even with contingency plans in place.In fact, our modelling suggests that without further intervention, we could breach inpatient Covid capacity within  or  weeks.And, of course, a sharply increasing number of cases, in human terms, means many more people becoming ill and dying.All of that explains why we have to act quickly and decisively.The situation in some other parts of the UK - where case numbers are already much higher than here, and where the contribution of the new iant is already greater - shows what may lie aheadwe donrsquot.As things stand, we estimate that we are possibly about four weeks behind the position in London and the south east.The rapid acceleration in London began when it was at about  new cases a week, for every hundred thousand people. Thatrsquos the level Scotland was at a week ago.London is now seeing  new cases a week per ,. Test positivity is around %. And pressure on NHS services is acute.We have an opportunity in Scotland to avert the situation here deteriorating to that extent.But we must act quickly.The advice of our clinical advisers is clear that the increased transmissibility of the new iant means that the current level  measures may not be sufficient to bring the R number back below .It is essential that we further limit interaction between dferent households to stem the spread and bring the situation back under control, while we vaccinate more people.In short, we mustfor a period to a situation much closer to the lockdown of last March.Let me therefore set out in more detail the decisions Cabinet has reached.It is important to stress that these are not decisions taken lightly. I am acutely aware of the impact they will have and I know they will not be welcome.But they are in our judgment essential.As government, our clear and overriding duty right now is to act quickly to save lives and protect the NHS.We know that delay or preication in the face of this virus almost always makes things worse not better - evenit stems from an understandable desire that we all share to wait for more data or evidence.To turn to the decisions in detail. The decisions I will speak about a bit later on schools, let me be clear at this stage, they will apply to all parts of Scotland. However other decisions that I will outline will apply to those parts of Scotland currently at level , which of course is all of mainland Scotland, and they are effectively an enhancement to level .The island areas currently in level  will remain there for now, although we will continue to monitor them very carefully.These additional level  restrictions - essentially ing us to a position similar to the lockdown of last March - will be in place for the whole of January. We will keep them closely under review.However, I cannot at this stage rule out keeping them in place longer, nor making further changes. Nothing about this is easy.The first measure is that our fundamental advice, for everyone, is to stay at home.That is the single best way of staying safe.We consider that this stay at home message and advice is now so important that, from tomorrow, it will become law, just as it was in the lockdown last year.This means it will only be permissible to leave home for an essential purpose.This will include, for example, caring responsibilities, essential shopping, exercise and being part of an extended household.In addition, anyone who is able to work from home, must do so. It will only be a reasonable excuse to leave your home to go to work,that work cannot be done from home.We are asking people and businesses to take this really seriously ndash as we all did in March, during the first lockdown, - because the situation is at least as serious now as it was then.The law already requires many businesses in certain sectors to close in Level . We now need every business to look again at their operations, and to make sure that every singlethat can be done by people working at home, is being done in that way.Businesses have already shown a tremendous capacity to adapt during this pandemic and Irsquom very grateful to them for that - and we need them to consider their operations again, as we all work together to reduce transmissions.The Economy Secretary will be speaking to business organisations about this, including this afternoon. We will also engage with unions on these issues. And we will continue to considermore regulatory action is required.We are also providing new guidance for people who are in the shielding category.If you were shielding and you cannot work from home, our clear advice now is that you should not go into work at all.The Chief Medical Officer is writing to everyone who falls into this category, and his letter will count as a Fit Note for those who need it.Unlike the lockdown last year, the frequency of outdoor exercise is not being limited.It is important for physical and mental health that we can get outdoors for fresh air and exercise as much as possible.However, from tomorrow, the rule on outdoor gatherings will change.As of now, up to six people from two households are able to meet outdoors. Given the greater transmissibility of this new iant, we consider it necessary to restrict that further.From tomorrow, a maximum of two people from up to two households will be able to meet outdoors.Children aged  and under will not be counted in that limit, and they will also be able to play outdoors in larger groups, including in organized gatherings.However, for everyone  ndash including  to  year olds - outdoor exercise should only take place in a way which is consistent with the  people from  households rule.In addition, strict travel restrictions remain in place across Scotland. From tomorrow,you live in a level  area - as the majority of us do - you cannot leave your home except for an essential purpose. When you do go out, stay as close to home as possible and stay away from crowded places.And it remains the case ndash and let me stress this point - that no-one is allowed to travel into or out of Scotland unless it is for an essential purpose.Presiding OfficerA number of other measures will come into effect on Friday of this week.It is with real regret that we consider it necessary for places of worship to close during this period for all purposes except broadcasting a service, or conducting a funeral, wedding or civil partnership.I am well aware of how important communal worship is to people.But we believe that this restriction is necessary to reduce the risk of transmission.While up to  people will still be able to attend funeral services, wakes will not be possible during January. And a maximum of  people will be able to attend wedding and civil partnership services.Presiding OfficerI know how devastating restrictions like these are and I give an assurance that we will not keep them in place for longer than is absolutely necessary.There will also be additional measures in relation to businesses, in addition to the tightening of the essential retail definition that took effect from Boxing Day.The current  metre exemption for workplace canteens will end ndash so canteens will have to ensure that employees sit  metres or more apart, rather than  metre.The number of non-essential services which remain open will be further restricted.Premises which will need to close as a result of these changes will include, for example ski centres, showrooms of larger retailers, and clinics offering cosmetic and aesthetic procedures.I know that many businesses have already been hit by the restrictions which were put in place on Boxing Day.And of course I know that the vast majority of businesses have taken their responsibilities seriously, and have invested in Covid safety measures.In addition, the move to home working has brought challenges for workers and employers. I am hugely grateful for the way in which businesses and their staff have responded to those challenges.Grants are of course available for businesses required to close as a result of restrictions. That support is in addition to support through the UK wide furlough scheme.The Scottish Governmentrsquos financial support for businesses during the pandemic currently totals more than pound. billion.However, we will continue to assess what more the Scottish government can do ndash either in closure grants or other forms of support - to help businesses and those who work for them.We will also work with councils to ensure community and social support for those who need it, including for parents balancing work and online learning.We will confirm additional resources later this week.Presiding Officer,The final substantive issue I want to address - before giving an update on vaccination - relates to schools.We announced before Christmas that most school pupils would learn remotely ndash rather than in school ndash until Monday  January.I can confirm that we have now decided to extend that date and keep schools closed to the majority of pupils until  February. We will review this again in mid-January.The change will apply to all pupils - except vulnerable children, and children of key workers. And it includes nursery schools, as well as primary and secondary schools.There is no doubt that of all the dficult decisions we have had to take today, this was the most dficult of all and its impact is of course the most severe.The evidence to date makes clear that thanks to the hard work of school staff and pupils, schools in Scotland have been low-risk environments for Covid. We will work with our partners to ensure that remains the case.That will include ongoing work on testing in schools and discussions about when, in the context of the overall programme, it will be possible to vaccinate school staff.And I want to be clear that it remains our priority to get school buildings open again for all pupils as quickly as possible and then keep them open.However, right now, two factors mean that it is not consistent with a safety-first approach for all children to attend school in person.First, the overall level of community transmission is simply too high. We need to get transmission down before schools can safely reopen. A period of online learning will also, in turn, help us do that.The second reason is that there is still signicant uncertainty about the impact of the new iant on transmission amongst young people.We therefore have to adopt a cautious approach at this stage.So most pupils will be learning online for at least the rest of the month.We will review on  January whether they can - as we hope -to school on the  February.I know that remote learning presents signicant challenges for teachers, schools, parents and young people, and we will work to support children and parents throughout this.The Scottish Government, Education Scotland and local authorities are working together to further improve the remote learning options which are available for schools.And it is also worth highlighting that since schools ed after the summer, more than , devices ndash such as laptops ndash have been distributed to children and young people to help with remote learning. More devices are being distributed by councils on a weekly basis, and in total we expect our investment ndashwhich builds on existing local authority action - to benefit around , disadvantaged children and young people across Scotland.I also want to stress one final point.Just as the last places we ever want to close are schools and nurseries - so it is the case that schools and nurseries will be the first places we want to reopen as we re-emerge from this latest lockdown.They remain our priority.That is why we are considering whether and to what extent - consistent with our overall duty to vaccinate the most vulnerable first in line with JCVI recommendations - we can achieve vaccination of school and childcare staff as a priority. Many teachers will of course be vaccinated over coming weeks as part of the JCVI priority list.The fortnightly review will not simply be a choice between opening and closing schools - we will always seek to maximise the number of pupils we can safely get back to classrooms and nurseries.Sothe evidence tells us we can get some pupils back safely, we will do that.However ultimately, the best way of enabling more pupils tomore quickly is by reducing community transmission of the virus as much as possible.And all of us ndash by accepting and abiding by the wider restrictions I have set out today - have a part to play in achieving that.Before I leave the issue of education, let me remind the chamber that we already had plans in place for the staggeredof universities and colleges. We will be considering this week whether any further change is necessary.Presiding OfficerBefore I close today, I want to give a brief update on our current expectations around vaccine supply.The Health Secretary will give a more detailed update on vaccination in a statement the chamber next week.However, I can confirm today that well over , people have now received their first dose of the vaccine.The first doses of the Astra Zeneca vaccine are being administered today.In total, over the period to the end of January - including the more than , already administered - we expect to have access to just over , doses of vaccine. Obviously, we hope that increases.These will be split roughly equally between the Pfizer and Astra Zeneca vaccines.However, we anticipate that some of the Astra Zeneca portion will be available only in the last week of January.We do not yet have certainty on supply schedules beyond January but will keep Parliament updated as these become firmer.However, our current expectation, based on assumptions about supply and the new advice on doses being administered up to  weeks apart, rather than , is that by early May everyone over , and people under  with specic underlying conditions, will have received at least the first dose of vaccine.That is everyone who is on the JCVI priority list, and comprises more than . million people.Once everyone on the priority list has been vaccinated, we will start vaccinating the rest of the population, and will do this in parallel with completing second doses for those on the priority list.Those timetables are of course heavily dependent on vaccine supply. And for that reason, they are at this stage cautious.However, I have tasked our vaccination team with exploring and keeping under ongoing review all options to speed up the rate of vaccination and bring these timescales forward as far as possible.I am grateful for the many offers of assistance we have received and while many of them may not prove possible or practical to take up, they will be consideredThe Health Secretary will say more about all of this in her statement next week.Presiding OfficerTo conclude, this is most certainly not the new year statement I wanted to give.And I know it is a statement no one wanted to hear.But as I said at the beginning, we are now in a race between the vaccine and the virus.The Scottish government will do everything we can to speed up distribution of the vaccine.But all of us must do everything we can to slow down the spread of the virus.We can already see ndash by looking at infection rates where ndash some of what could happen here in Scotlandwe donrsquot act.To prevent that, we need to act immediately and firmly.For government, that means introducing tough measures ndash as we have done so today.And for all of us, it means sticking to the rulesIt means continuing to follow the FACTS guidanceAnd it means ndash above all ndash staying at home.That is again our central message.Stay Home. Save lives. Protect the NHS.If we do this, we give the vaccine the time it needs to get ahead and ultimately win the race.I know that the next few weeks will be incredibly dficult.Irsquom sorry to ask for further sacrices, after nine long months of them. But these sacrices are necessary.And the dference between now and last March is that with the help of vaccines, we now have confidence that these sacrices will pave the way to brighter days ahead.So ndash for everyonersquos sake and safety - please stick with it and stay at home."},{"url":null,"title":"new-lockdown-rules-scotland-covid-restrictions-explained","story":"First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced the new rules on Monday afternoon, asthe latest restrictions came into effect from midnight today in all Level  areas of the country andwill continue throughout the month.Speaking at Holyrood, Ms Sturgeon said: \"I can confirm now, in summary, that we decided to introduce from tomorrow, for the duration of January, a legal requirement to stay at home except for essential purposes.

something that definitely comes across on screen.Then there are the new characters that immerse us in the time period too, including Kit Marlow, the English playwright, poet, and translator of the Elizabethan era, played by Victoria star, Tom Hughes.\"There are elements of the real Christopher Marlowe in there theres a kind of Mercurio quality to him, and theres a hedonism to him, theres a lyricism to him,\" notes Chester-born Hughes, .\"And then bring that in with obviously whats in the books, and how thats adapted for this story, hes slightly infantilised at times.\"Something about his emotion is very, very raw, and that brings with it a plethora of dferent feelings theres volatility, theres obsession.\"That obsession is with Matthew, and it also means Kit has a fear of Diana, because when Matthew arrives back from the modern-day, the whole world has changed and shted.\"His [Kits] emotional connection with Matthew is shted, Matthews aura has shted, and the only thing that Kit can seem to identy as being the thing thats caused that is Diana.\"Bring on the drama...CASTING A SPELLIn this series, Diana doesnt have a choice other than to start embracing who she is -

It was also commended for including a system that brakes the car following a crash. The only real negative was that it could cause higher damage to other vehicles in a crash.Seat LeonThe Leon shares a  with the A and therefore scores similarly. However, it did marginally better in adult occupant protection, despite near-identical comments on injury protection. It also received a small penalty for the damage it could cause other vehicles, but otherwise received good marks for protecting passengers from injury.Volkswagen ID.Volkswagens new electric vehicle also underwent testing this year, getting full marks. It performed well in preventing injuries to its passengers, but was also noted for not causing excessive damage to the crash barrier, indicating its also quite friendly to other vehicles in a crash. The main negative was the fact that the dummy moved too far across the vehicle in the side impact test.Toyota YarisThe Yaris might be small but it scored well across the board, receiving maximum points for protecting critical body parts in the side impact test. It also gained praise for having clear information on the front airbag system, which can be disabled for rear-facing child restraints. However, an unclear manual meant it failed on the installation check for some child restraints.Honda JazzAnother small car that performed well is the Jazz, which demonstrated a stable passenger compartment in the offset frontal test. Protection of the passengers was generally good, but was rated as weak for the drivers chest. It was noted that the centre airbag protected passengers colliding with each other in a side impact.Mazda MX-Another electric car, Mazdas new MX received top marks, doing particularly well in adult occupant protection, where it scored %. The report notes that protection of passengers was strong, scoring top marks in both the side barrier test and more severe side pole impact. It was knocked for not having an advanced emergency call system or post-collision braking.Land Rover DefenderLand Rover will be pleased to learn that one of the most highly anticipated new cars of the year scored top marks in testing, despite not being outstanding in any department. Euro NCAP noted that the femur protection score was penalised, as was chest protection of the rear passenger in the full-width rigid wall test. It was also considered an aggressive partner to other vehicles in the event of a crash.Kia SorentoAnother large SUV and another five stars, the Sorento was another that didnt stand out in any particular area but did well overall. Its central airbag, whiplash protection and driver assistance were all rated highly. However, its protection of the drivers chest and right femur was rated weak, with occupant protection rated marginal in this test because structures in the dashboard could cause a risk to occupants of dferent sizes.Isuzu D-MaxThe surprise of the year was the Isuzu D-Max pick-up, which scored top marks despite competing in a segment that is not famous for highlighting safety. It received similar occupant safety comments as the Sorento in the offset frontal test, and was also penalised for how it interacts with other vehicles in a crash. However, it typically scored highly for occupant protection in a iety of crash scenarios, as well as for having an emergency call system."},{"url":null,"title":"agenda-glasgow-pupils-connected-ever","story":"MANY aspects of our lives have changed because of the pandemic, but signicant effort has been put into keeping things as normal as possible for our young people.

However, this was a journey we were already on, and its effects will be felt for generations to come.Our focus should be on what technology allows our learners and teachers to do ndash and how education can be enriched through digital learning. Consider the young people with additional support needs, or those whose first language may not be English.

We also created easy-to-use guides for parents so learning and teaching can continue just as easily at home as it can in the classroom.Our approach is being noticed across the world as an example of how we can support children and young people to become digital citizens and develop skills for the future.

It was absolutely delicious but next time ndash and there will be a next time ndash Irsquoll use cutlery.Irsquove been eating a lot of chocolates lately.

Irsquove had a fondness for brussels sprouts since we had to boil a saucepan of them in my first domestic science class. It was the only lesson in this subject where I excelled. Back then, I seasoned with pepper.Today, a drizzle of olive oil turns them into the food of the gods. Thus, as I reach for a mid-morning biscuit, eyeing up the snow clouds outside and thinking of the energy required to get me through to lunch, I refuse to feel guilty. Others, however, seem hell-bent on pricking the nationrsquos conscience and turning an innocent cooked breakfast or buttered scone into a source of shame.There are many reasons to dread the start of the new year, not least the dark and cold. One unfailing, ill-timed and unnecessary scourge is the avalanche of advice doled out around January  by nutritionists and dieticians. Even worse than the tips of health professionals is the enthusiasm of former junk food addicts who, after a Damascene conversion that usually involves a near-death experience, are messianic about their new habits.My idea of weight control is whether or not I can tuck a T-shirt into my jeans after theyrsquove been in a -degree wash. The battery on my bathroom scales died years ago, since when theyrsquove been gathering dust under the bed. This is not something to boast about , but while I can face up to many things in le ndash a leaking roof, mice under the eaves, a looming taxdeadline ndash knowing how many kilos Irsquove gained is not one of them.There seems something sadistic about exhorting people to give up comfort food at precisely the time of year it was designed for. It might be fine to start January with a health kickyou live in Alice Springs or Calornia. In Achiltibuie or Crail, however, it feels cruel. When sleet is whistling around the windows, and the streets are coated in ice, the idea of following a meagre, challenging or carefully calibrated diet does not appeal.All of us know, by now, that Covid does not just love a crowd, it is also drawn to love handles. Being clinically obese is thought to raise the risk of coronavirus complications. The unfailing appearance of New Year diets, however, seems more a lestyle adjunct than a serious medical intervention. They fall into the same category as making resolutions to give up fags or booze, or to pound the pavement, clocking up steps like a hamster on a wheel. This year, however, therersquos not even the incentive of needing to be beach-ready by summer. I doubt many of us will be mentally prepared to launch ourselves into a warmer climate and inviting sea in July, evenwe are enviably lithe and toned.Obviously,I felt I was getting too heavy, Irsquod feel obliged to knuckle down and deal with it, whatever the date. It is true also that the majority of us could probably benefit from tweaking our menus around the margins. But the longest, blackest and dreariest month of the year is not the time to begin. It is counterintuitive, and possibly even self-defeating, to ask us to turn ourselves into a new and better version of ourselves, ldquothe best me I can be, when our internal clock is on perpetual snooze, coming alive only at the smell of roasted potatoes. When night descends by mid afternoon, and we have barely enough oomph to empty the dishwasher, let alone turn the kitchen into a MasterChef set, our willpower is posted missing.Perhaps I ought simply to bypass the magazine features that show vegetable slurries greener than a David Hockney landscape, or chargrilled chicken served with an acre of al dente field. Yet it is not the promise of slimness that lures me in but the ever-changing science of food. That, and the thought of the guinea pigs who allow themselves to become living laboratories. One such group is the cohort of older women cited in the German science writer Bas Kastrsquos new book, called The Diet Compass.These grandmothers were each given a muffin a day for seven weeks. One lot was baked with sunflower oil, the other with palm oil. Unsurprisingly, everyone gained weight, but those in the second category grew fattest.

A study was published in Germany a few days ago showing a connection between birds and human happiness ndash the more birds you can see and hear around you, said the report, the more satisfied yoursquore likely to be with your le. It also concluded that the effect of more birds is as great as the effect of more money. But then I could have told them that.Irsquod also like to tell you about some of the things Irsquove learned about helping the birds: a few of the tips that experts in the RSPB and other organisations have passed on to me over the years. The first of them is that you should keep your feeders filled all year round, not just in the winter. In the summer, a lot of the birdsrsquo diet will be made up of insects, but even then every little extra bit helps.The second tip could be more dficult: donrsquot be so neat and tidy. A lot of birds feed on the scraps that humans leave behind, and use the hedges in our gardens as shelter, and for food, and for nesting ndash the ordinary garden is a birdrsquos fortress and kitchen and nursery. So donrsquot leave your hedges too trim and neat ndash leave spaces for the birds to get in and out. And put scraps and leftovers out on the birdtable. It will all be appreciated.Maybe we could check our attitudes too. We know the British people love birds, but we also know we have a confused attitude to them. We put up bird tables but put spikes on buildings to discourage pigeons. We celebrate the robin but decry the gull. The hen harrier is killed to protect the right to kill the grouse. Perhaps we could stop trying to impose our rules on the birds. Perhaps we could step back and realise they are all the same. Perhaps we could look at the birds and learn.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

If properly resourced, there is no reason why those leaving secondary school cannot have a formal extension of one or two years to continue their lost education and take their exams in further education colleges. This would require strategic organisation involving all sectors of education and I believe this would be a better solution than to allow our elderly, in which I have a vested interest, to wither away.It is clear Mr Tait does not care for Nicola Sturgeon or her regular media updates, for which there is an off switch as an immediate cure.

He echoes what seems to be accepted generally and without question that for some reason children are at low risk of virus infection and of passing it on. If that is the case, do children have some inherent immunity, which presumably diminishes as they grow up, which should be researched, identied, isolated and passed over to adults as an alternative or additional treatment to vaccination Alan Fitzpatrick, Dunlop.PUBLISH DAILY VACCINE FIGURESTHE Covid vaccination programme is probably the most vital and important public health exercise in modern history. Notwithstanding, given comments made be either Nicola Sturgeon or Jeane Freeman over the last  hours, I have heard or read at least six dferent versions of their expected Covid vaccination timetable in terms of who will be vaccinated and by when. This is a disgrace. Once again, like the flu jab fiasco, John Swinneyrsquos education mess-up last year and other examples too many to mention here, this indicates this SNP administrations complete inability to manage anything effectively or efficiently.Since March last year, Ms Sturgeon has managed to find ample resources to both compile and produce her daily political broadcast ndash sorry, Covid update ndash so why can she now not find resources to deliver a daily update on vaccination progress against a clearly articulated timetable  This is what we want to hear from her, not her ongoing, daily, repetitive political jibes, nor her monotonous and very isive independence monologue.Paul McPhail, Glasgow G.JAG ROLL-OUT MUST NOT FAILI WAS more than pleased when my -year-old brother contacted me yesterday to advise that he had just received his first Covid vaccination. He lives in Essex, where NHS England has commenced the roll-out of a major vaccination programme which is intended to immunise the entire top four priority groups by mid-February this includes all the over-seventies, NHS workers, care home staff and care home residents in addition to people with underlying health problems, amounting to more than  million people. This is an exceptionally ambitious target, but one which the Prime Minister is confident of achieving.Under the circumstances it is not unreasonable to expect that here in Scotland we can achieve similar success with a vaccination roll-out that includes the most vulnerable groups over a similar time frame. Should the Scottish Government fail to deliver a successful vaccination programme, at speed, and without similar problems to those experienced with last yearrsquos flu vaccine debacle, then it will never be forgiven by the Scottish public.Christopher H Jones, Gfnock.TRAINING IS A LONG SLOGI READ with real concern in your front-page report todaythat a number of health care staff in Glasgow yesterdayhad been unable to get their Covid- vaccine as had been originally scheduled.Undoubtedly such a mass immunisation programme requires a considerable amount of planning and effort, including recruitment of vaccinators. I have been practising as a GP for  years and I first offered to be a vaccinator as part of the hospital community hub vaccination programme on December . I received an email on December  inviting me to complete the online training, which I did ndash this taking me six hours, but which unlike as has been reported to be the case in England, did not include compulsory modules in de-radicalisation or equality and ersity. On December  I submitted my completed application and currently await to find outmy skills can be useful to the vaccination effort. Cases of Covid- continue to rise, but at this point Irsquom not too sure that the vaccine is outrunning the virus.Dr Alan Mitchell, Motherwell.WHY MESS WITH THE PROGRAMME NICOLA Sturgeon has stated that no one would be receiving a first dose of the Pfizer vaccine and a possible second dose with the Oxford vaccine. Surely no one in the health boards had even considered that scenario  I am also at a loss as to how they can suddenly change the period gap between jags, from  days to  weeks, without any check on the effect of same.There have already been some doubts on the suitability of the existing vaccines for keeping the Covid iant at bay, let alone the now additional one appearing on the scene, so why mess with the initial vaccine programme George Dale, Beith.HOW HAS IT COME TO THIS WHEN you are into ldquoextra-time in the game of le as I am, lockdown is a disaster. I know thatI catch Covid- the chances are it will kill me. Like many old fogies Irsquove been in what is essentially self-imposed lockdown for the best part of a year and as of now even that regime will be ramped up. Gone completely will be the already-infrequent outdoor visits to kids and grandkids, even a daily walk which is already compromised by being compelled to walk on the road to avoid groups of adolescents who ignore social distancing or ignorant berks who feel it more important that their dog-on-a-string walks on the pavement than a pensioner, will be threatened. Heaven forfend one runs out of milk the risk of premature death has to be balanced against having a decent cup of tea.Just how badly managed the response to the pandemic has been is encapsulated by the fact that almost a year into things only now are they considering closing the door to the country. For heavenrsquos sake we live on an island, it should have been the first thing they did. How is it possible that groups were shuttling back and forwards to European ski resorts recently  Air-bridges pathetic. Now we have a virus iant that got here from South Africa on a plane and another highly contagious mutant domestic form of Covid- that appeared in the heavily-populated south-east of England, its development and transmission facilitated by Government policy of trying to keep le as near normal as possible to protect the economy rather than the population.Less than a year into the pandemic the UK seasonally adjusted level of deaths is nearer , than the official Covid- statistics, mainly elderly poor or BAME casualties. The economy has tanked with personal debt escalating along with rising unemployment and rent arrears, but at least the rich are getting richer.I suppose depending on where you stand Government policy could be deemed to be right on target.David J Crawford, Glasgow G.ELECTION WILL NO DOUBT COME FIRSTI ENJOYED reading my mothers letter , agree with its content and admire her idealism.

An independent Scotlandrsquos relationship with the European Union would be the most consequential decision of its future foreign policy. Small states such as Finland, Denmark, or Ireland all put the EU centre stage in their international policies. And, as the UK will find, leaving the gravitational pull of the EU is challenging indeed.It could be argued that the Scottish Government goal of independence in the EU should be Scotlandrsquos longer term aim. For now, Scotland might benefit from letting the new EU-UK relationship, however problematic, settle in. Setting up a new state will take time, not least the challenges of currency and managing the fiscal deficit in the aftermath of the Covid crisis. And a dferent UK government might move back closer to the EU, changing the implications for independence.Some argue that Europe is not so important in independence debates, or suggest a transition over time via the European Economic Arealike Norway, or even favour a more Brexit-like Scexit where an independent Scotland is in neither the EU nor EEA.Yet such hesitancy may mean missing the EU boat. Awareness of Scotlandrsquos pro-remain vote is currently high across the EU. But interest in Scotlandrsquos independence debate ies: itrsquos followed more in Berlin or the Hague than in Prague or Budapest. The EU has many other more important priorities to contend with.Still, the upcoming Holyrood elections, alongside the new EU-UK deal, are also prompting substantial interest from EU media as to the prospects for Scottish independence. And EU political figures are fully aware that a fragmentation of the UK is possible.The political challenge for the pro-independence side is how to build on and dynamise these current levels of awareness and sympathy. EU member state governments will stay neutral on the constitutional question. But there are plenty of politicians, not least in the European parliament , who insist that an independent Scotland would be welcome back in the EU. Even where governments, such as in France, Spain or the Netherlands, are concerned at the prospect of a disintegrating UK, there are opportunities to engage positively with their publics ndash as the UKrsquos baffling and self-harming lsquoglobal Britainrsquo sets sail.But European politics moves on. A Scottish rejection of the UKrsquos new post-Brexit trajectory is likely to have more salience, impact and support in the coming period thanit waits a decade. By , the new EU-UK relationship will probably have settled down. Upsetting and recasting it might look more problematic then, whereas an independence referendum in , for instance, would look like another unfolding, and eminently understandable, consequence of Brexit.This is where those who caution against speed may be mistaken. Itrsquos conceivable thatScotland chose independence in , it could re-join the EU ahead of the western Balkan candidates. Certainly, dferent EU opinion-formers see Scottish accession as much more straightforward, technically and politically. While the Scottish debate obsesses around currency and deficits, many EU observers see in Scotland a country that spent  years in the EU, is still aligned to EU rules, and is a stable, ing democracy .But the independence debate needs to be alert to how it looks from the EU. And those who want a Scexit outside both the EU and EEA should explain the very dficult economics of that isolationist position. Nor does the simplistic dismissal of the EUrsquos single market as neoliberal, unfettered capitalism match the reality of the tough social and environmental level-playing field conditions that are in the EU-UK deal.Those who prefer the Norway approach need to ask themselves why no other country since  has chosen to join the EEA rather than the EU. It creates a major democratic deficit ndash a strange choice for a newly independent state, and in the case of Norway only happened after its public rejected the negotiated EU accession terms.Nor is the EEA a transitional route to the EU rather it might be taken as a signal of lack of interest. If Scotland wanted to re-join the EU that would need to be clear upfront after an independence vote. A candidate country usually agrees a specic association agreement with the EU, with the added plus of also unleashing both political support and financial assistance.Independence in the EU will certainly mean a hard border between England  Wales and Scotland . But the UKrsquos brave new world on the edge of the EU will give much insight into the implications of that border and likely costs and benefits for Scotland.All of this assumes, of course, that there is a legal, constitutionally valid referendum, including clear political agreement between London and Edinburgh. The rather inward-looking debate around lsquoplan Brsquo tends to ignore the fact that some plan Bs may be a hard sell in the EU. It might also be wise, in terms of future EU understanding, to put more emphasis on why Boris Johnson should allow a referendumthe SNP win a majority in May, rather than already weakening the impact of his potential lsquonorsquo by saying itrsquos expected.The EU choice is not a side issue in the independence debate. It would determine the type of independent state Scotland would be: one that works with others, at the table, to influence EU choices, or one that sits it out on the sidelines. Striking while the iron is hot might provoke a more positive and welcoming European dynamic than a debate that is overly inward-looking and cautious.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

The World Health Organisation still advocates that the second dose of the vaccine should take place  days after the first, so why are we messing with the timescale  I fear this is another mistake that will come back to haunt the Government like so many others during this pandemic.Shaun Murphy, Kilbirnie.LETS ALL FOLLOW THE RULESI DESPAIR.

He said: ldquoWe have MPAs. We do need space where we can harvest food.ldquoWe have not had a dialogue about which areas should be designated for food production.The academic said much of the debate on scallops had become ldquopolarised.He said: ldquoAt the green end of the spectrum a considerable number of NGOs [non-governmental organisations] would like scallop dredging banned outright because of the damage it does to dferent habitats.ldquoFrom a more scientic perspective, scallop fisheries can be considered to be sustainable because they are clams and they feed at the bottom of the food chain.There are environmental impacts but they can be managedwe control its footprint.Industrial fisherman use drag nets to scrape scallops out of the seabed.Green groups such as sustainable seafood charity Open Seas say this does huge damage to the marine environment.Fishermen, who deny ploughing through sensitive areas, counter that they focus on areas where they do not snag their gear.Mr Kaiser said more work was needed to find out where damage would be least ndash such as sandy flat areas where plants and animals are already resilient to disturbances from heavy waves or storms.Adult scallops, clams in Scots, do not move much and tend to grow in the same places year after year. So he believes areas could be set aside for their cultivation, leaving much of the sea out of bounds to dredgers.ldquoHaving a good understanding of what is on the seabed and what is located where, is fundamentally important, he said, stressing the dficulty of mapping under the sea.ldquoThat is something we donrsquot have or we have in a very patchy way. It is not like looking at farmland ndash you canrsquot just send a drone up and take a nice picture and see where all the fields and forests are.Both commercial fishers and groups such as Open Seas ndash as the name suggests ndash see the seas as a common resource and space.But Mr Kaiser also suggests that, with full Brexit on the horizon, the UK could look at setting up a system of quasi-ownership over what would become scallop fields.Essentially, he is talking about giving local fishers rights to exploit a patch of the seabed ndash infor agreeing to a range of conditions.The scheme, he said, would work like common grazing on land.He said: ldquoAt sea, as soon as you have some form of ownership, people tend to change their behaviour over time because they feel they have control over their future.ldquoAnd their rights are not likely to be taken away by somebody  who has no vested interest.ldquoThis is a very current discussion at the moment, particularly with Brexit now here.ldquoThere is an opportunity for the UK to look again at what in the jargon are termed co-management systems where groups of fishers from a defined area ndash with interests in a particular fishery ndash are given ownership and responsibility and stewardship of that resource.ldquoThat can have all sorts of conditions.ldquoThey have to participate in the science.

This will happen throughout January, so they do not need to phone and arrange this.If any patient has dficulty in coming for a vaccination in Kirkwall, they should contact the COVID vaccination phone line and NHS Orkney staff will try their best to make alternative arrangements.Patients in the outer isles will be contacted by their GP practice in early January to come in for an appointment.Unlike the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, the Oxford University AstraZeneca vaccine can be stored in a standard fridge for at least six months and can be administered within existing healthcare settings.The vaccine uses a weakened version of a common cold virus that causes infections in chimpanzees and contains the genetic material of the COVID- virus spike protein.After vaccination, the surface spike protein is produced, priming the immune system to attack the COVID- virusit later infects the body.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Those working in libraries, education and community arts also received recognition. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “In a year when so many have made sacrices to protect our NHS and save people’s lives, the outstanding eff orts of those receiving honours are a welcome reminder of the strength of human spirit and of what can be achieved through courage and compassion. “The  New Year Honours offer us an opportunity to salute their dedication and recognise many who have gone above and beyond in their contribution to our country. “As we begin a new year and continue to come together to fight this virus, may their service and stories be an inspiration to us all.” vw, px\"  Jacquie Winning’s award “recognises the achievements of everyone” at Forth Valley Sensory Centre following “an exceptionally challenging year”.The  year-old from Falkirk was recognised for going the extra mile to manage “wraparound” services to people with sensory loss during the pandemic “COVID- has been challenging for everyone, but more so for people with sensory loss.

This would normally include the leboat day and raft race in Burray in August, and a bonfire where we would normally sell soup and rolls in October.#Instead of this, in the month of January seven Burray lasses are walking the distance from the most northerly UK leboat station which is Aith in Shetland, to the most southern, St Heliar in the Channel Islands. This is a total of  miles that we will attempt to cover over the  days of January.#Helen explained that herself and Deborah Sutherland from the guild are taking part, and joining them are friends Tracy Hourston, Julie Garriock, Joanna Sutherland, Sarah Jessen and Sammy Wilson.Their fundraising and walking efforts got off to a great start this week already, with well over £ pounds raised and over  miles covered, with those walking enjoying fine weather.Helen explained that they are following all social distancing and Covid regulations, with folk keeping count of all the miles they are walking, so a total can be added together as they head towards their target.Donations can be made online at www.justgiving crowdfunding helen-davidson- Funds are being raised for the leboat stations in Kirkwall, Stromness and Longhope.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The Church of Ireland, Presbyterian Church, Methodist Church in Ireland and Roman Catholic Church made similar statements this afternoon. It follows a meeting this afternoon of the Northern Ireland Executive’s ‘Faith Leaders’ Forum’, which was convened by Junior Ministers, Gordon Lyons MLA and Declan Kearney MLA. Church leaders and other faith leaders received advice during the meeting from Dr Michael McBride, the Chief Medical Officer , and Professor Ian Young, Chief Scientic Advisor , regarding the worsening Coronavirus situation. Speaking on behalf of the Presbyterian Church, the Clerk of the General Assembly and General Secretary of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, said, “Our churches are part of the local community and we recognise the very serious situation that Northern Ireland finds itself in today. With the extremely high level of transmission of the Covid- virus, combined with the numbers in hospital and intensive care, the very clear warning from the CMO and CSA this afternoon was that over the next number of weeks this situation is going to worsen signicantly.” Mr Gribben continued, “In light of our ongoing consultations and the current serious and worsening situation, and in line with unequivocal public health guidance that people should stay at home, we have written to our congregations in Northern Ireland, informing them that all in person Sunday gatherings for worship, along with most other in person church gatherings, should cease in all PCI congregations from midnight tonight until Saturday,  February . “It is of course regrettable and disappointing that over these next few weeks our congregations will no longer be physically gathering for worship. However, because of the alarming rise of Covid- infections in the community, this is the right decision to take, both for the safety and protection of people and also to contribute to the overall reduction of inter-person contact in line with the government’s ‘stay at home’ message.” The Clerk concluded by saying, “In these dficult days, as we continue to look to God, and encourage others to find their hope in Him, let us help and pray for one another, lting up all those on the frontline, those in authority making dficult decisions and especially all who mourn and miss loved ones.” Church of Ireland Archbishop of Armagh, John McDowell, said in a statement with his fellow bishops that the escalation of numbers in hospital and intensive care is placing immense pressure on our healthcare staff. He added that the number of deaths and warnings from officials is of grave concern. We recognise that clergy and parishioners have together worked steadily to implement protocols which have ensured that public gatherings for worship have been as safe as possible since the re–opening of our buildings in early summer, said their statement. We also appreciate that the Northern Ireland Executive has acknowledged over the last  months the importance of people being able to gather in person for worship. The ongoing engagement between faith communities and the Northern Ireland Executive is warmly welcomed and is something which we believe has been, and continues to be, of benefit to wider society. However, in light of the current serious and worsening situation and in line with clear public health guidance that people should stay at home, we have decided that all public gatherings for worship and all other in–person church activities should cease for our particular denomination, until Saturday th February , subject to review in late January, with the exception of weddings, funerals, arrangements for recording and or live–streaming, drive–in services and private prayer . We note and welcome the fact that the same position has been adopted by the Presbyterian Church, Roman Catholic Church, Methodist Church and others in Northern Ireland. In making this decision for the ‘greater good’ of all within our community we continue to remember in our prayers the sick and bereaved, all who are suffering, those whose lives have been directly impacted by Covid–, praying too for those in positions of responsibility who are faced with making dficult decisions at this challenging time. A statement issued on behalf of Archbishop of Armagh, Eamon Martin, said the Catholic Church was very concerned at the current serious public health position in which Northern Ireland finds itself: with the extremely high level of transmission of the Covid- virus the continuing escalation of numbers in hospital and intensive care the number of associated deaths and, the increasingly unsustainable pressure on our healthcare staff. The statement, which was also signed by the other Catholic bishops from dioceses within Northern Ireland, added: The clear message from health officials is that this situation is going to worsen signicantly over the coming weeks. We recognise the efforts of so many in our parishes who have been working to ensure that our gatherings for public worship are as safe as possible and we welcome the continuing engagement between the faith communities and the NI Executive which has led to consensus between us on the importance of people being able to gather in person for worship. At this time, however, we acknowledge and support the unequivocal message from public health authorities that the movement and gathering of people should be minimised and that as many people as possible stay at home for the sake of health, le and the Common Good. In light of our ongoing consultations and of the current serious and worsening situation, and in line with clear public health guidance that people should stay at home, we have decided that for a limited period , the celebration of the Eucharist and other liturgies should take place without the physical presence of the faithful - with the exception of marriage, funeral, baptismal liturgies and drive-in services . Arrangements for recording and or livestreaming, and making inidual visits for private prayer are also permissible in accordance with regulations. We encourage parishes, where possible, to continue to broadcast the celebration of Mass - and other devotions and prayer services - online and on other media, knowing that faith and prayer can be a tremendous support to iniduals and society during these dficult times. We make this decision reluctantly, conscious that not being able to gather for public worship can cause pain for all the faithful, but in the hope that this limited period of sacrice will be for the protection of le and health and for the greater good of all. We once more ask for prayers for the sick, the bereaved and all those whose livelihoods have been particularly impacted by the pandemic. We keep in our prayers all health workers, carers, chaplains and other essential workers. We welcome the announcement that a similar position is being taken by the leaders of the Church of Ireland, the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, the Methodist Church in Ireland and many other denominations and faith communities in response to the unequivocal message from public health authorities that as many people as possible stay at home at this time. President of the Methodist Church,Rev Dr Tom McKnight, commented, “We made this decision in light of the clear advice from health officials that this action would be of benefit to public health and for the sake of the ‘Common Good’. As this Pandemic continues we are particularly mindful of those here and around the world whose lives are most profoundly impacted, people who are isolated, who are suffering or worried because of economic concerns, young people who carry a particular burden, those who are ill, and those who have lost loved ones. The church continues to be committed to doing all we can to support and stand with those in most need. As a church we continue to pray for those leading our country at this time."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1610110925376.jpg--uk_approval_for_moderna_vaccine.jpg?1610110925000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20210108newsuk approval for moderna vaccine","story":"The Moderna coronavirus vaccine has been approved for use in the UK.

This most consequential of acts resulted in the partition of Ireland. The genesis of the Government of Ireland Act  came in . Home Rule had been on the statute book since  and could no longer be postponed. It was scheduled to come into operation automatically when hostilities were formally concluded with the signature of the last of the peace treaties after the First World War.To prevent this, the Prime Minister, David Lloyd George, set up a committee, chaired by Cabinet member Walter Long, to draft the Government of Ireland Bill. The make-up of Long#s committee was unionist in outlook. There was no nationalist representation whatsoever, nor was the advice of any nationalists sought. Leading Ulster unionist James Craig and his associates were the only Irishmen consulted.Long#s committee proposed to create two distinct legislatures for Ulster and the southern provinces, linked by a common council, comprising representatives from both. This was the first time a British government proposed a separate parliament for Ulster.Before the end of the war, the exclusion of Ulster, or at least some of Ulster, was the only option being considered in terms of special treatment for the province. Ulster unionists desired for direct rule to remain from Westminster.The common council proposed in the Government of Ireland Bill was a Council of Ireland to be composed of  members from each parliament, which the British stated could lead to the peaceful evolution of a single parliament for all Ireland.Initially, there were many objections from Ulster unionists. The main problem was with the area to be included in the Ulster parliament: Ulster unionists sought the six counties of Antrim, Armagh, Derry, Down, Fermanagh and Tyrone, and not the nine counties of Ulster proposed by Long#s committee, as this was the maximum area they felt they could dominate without being outbred by Catholics.This decision of the Ulster Unionist Council was deeply unpopular among the , Protestants of counties Donegal, Cavan and Monaghan, who were sacriced to the southern administration.Belfast unionist MP Thomas Moles explained that the three counties had to be abandoned in order to save the Six Counties: In a sinking ship, with leboats sufficient for only two-thirds of the ship#s company, were all to condemn themselves to death because all could not be saved Even though the Ulster Unionist Council endorsed the Government of Ireland Bill reluctantly, many Ulster unionists eventually concluded that the scheme proposed in the Government of Ireland Act would cause the least diminution of their Britishness. Some, such as James Craig#s brother, Charles, began to see the great benefits Ulster unionists would garner from having their own parliament: The Bill practically gives us everything that we fought for, everything we armed ourselves for.It has often been cited that the Government of Ireland Bill was allowed to pass relatively unchallenged due to the vacuum in nationalist representation at Westminster. With Sinn Fein abstaining, there were just seven Irish nationalist MPs remaining in Westminsterafter the  general election, instead of .It could be argued that even  nationalist MPs would have made little dference, considering the make-up of the House of Commons after the election. The Conservative Party, Lloyd George#s Coalition Liberal Party and Irish unionists won over  seats, an overwhelming majority. It is doubtful that Sinn Fein#s presence would have made a dference.What little voice the seven nationalist MPs had was further diminished by the Catholic Church#s belief that they should not participate in the committee stages, nor suggest amendments to the Government of Ireland Bill.The Catholic Church was virulently opposed to partition and believed that participating in the framing of the Partition Bill would be seen as a sign of its acceptance. The Bishop of Derry, Charles McHugh, claimed Catholic Ulster would never submit to become hewers of wood and drawers of water for Sir Edward Carson.The leading nationalist MP left in Westminster, Joseph Devlin, condemned the Bill as conceived in Bedlam, ridiculous and fantastic. He voted against it, but did not contribute to its final shape. With Sinn Fein#s policy on partition almost non-existent, it chose to ignore the Government of Ireland Bill. As the Bill was making its way through parliament, the British government was waging a war with Sinn Fein and its military wing, the IRA.Sinn Fein leaders stuck steadfastly - and naively - to the view that Ulster would readily come into an all-Ireland parliament once Britain was removed from the island.That the Government of Ireland Act came into law as Britain was at open war with Sinn Fein, supported by a considerable majority on the island, shows the total air of unreality that surrounded the Act.In granting the royal assent to the Government of Ireland Act , King George V expressed the hope that it, the fruit of more than  years of ceaseless controversy, will finally bring about unity and friendship between all the peoples of my kingdom.This was a wildly optimistic reading of the environment in Ireland in  and of the likely fallout from its impending partition.Cormac Moore is the author of Birth of the Border: The Impact of Partition in Ireland Belfast Most ReadDUP#s Paisley defends Donald Trump in wake of US Capitol riotsCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Further  deaths and , new cases reportedIan Paisley and Claire Hanna in name calling row over ditching NI Protocol British Army Major General from Northern Ireland last man to attack US Capitol before Trump mobTributes to Ballymena man Alan Henry who died days after we shared emotional plea to take Covid- seriouslyLatest Northern IrelandBBC NI accused of #trolling# Jamie Bryson over Irish language street signsParamilitary style attacks down but bomb attacks rose in Second NI grammar school ditches transfer test Brexit deal ‘accelerates possibility of a united Ireland within next  years’Northern Ireland to require Covid- pre-departure testing for arrivalsLatest from Belfast Alison Hammond and Dermot O’Leary debut as This Morning hosts with awkward gaffeLondon mayor declares ‘major incident’ with coronavirus spread ‘out of control’Steve Bruce says Covid-hit clubs fielding youth teams ‘devalues the FA Cup’Sinkhole swallows cars at Italian hospital treating coronavirus patientsGlasgow Film Festival to go virtual after lockdown restrictions introduced,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Retailers like John Lewis, AO, Madee and Dunelm have all said they have put their deliveries on hold.One reader also reported a problem with deliveries from online homewares retailer Wayfair but it has not replied to a request for comment. But TK Maxx, which last week cancelled orders from customers here, said orders from here and delivery here had been restored.

Companies sending goods to Northern Ireland are required to complete new customs paperwork under the NI Protocol, which came into force as the transition period came to an end last week.While guidance from HMRC published on New Year#s Eve introduced a three-month grace period for parcels being sent to consumers, many companies had already decided to put Northern Ireland deliveries on hold before that point. A Belfastreader said they had tried to order a Peloton bike to be told by a worldwide company they cannot fulfil orders to Northern Ireland due to the Brexit situation.I tried to explain we are part of the UK but with no luck, they added.The hi-tech exercise bike, which costs around £, for the original model, has become a sought-after item for exercise at home - tapping into the surge in popularity of cycling and the closure of gyms during lockdown.The company, which was founded in the US, enables users to tune into intense spin classes or other forms of exercise online using a touchscreen integrated into the equipment.A spokeswoman for Peloton said: We have temporarily paused new sales of the Peloton Bike and Peloton Bike+ whilst we update our systems and processes in response to Brexit. Customers who placed an order on or before December ,  will still have their Peloton Bike or Peloton Bike+ delivered.

Figures from TrafficwatchNI revealed that in the week before Christmas, they were down by only -% - though that grew to % by Boxing Day.Justice Minister Naomi Long said the figures were encouraging: It#s often second nature to nip out in the car but we must all stop and ask ourselvesthat journey is essential.

Photo by Piaras Ó Mídheach Sportsfile FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueDown GAA chairman John Devaney. Photo by Piaras Ó Mídheach SportsfileFrank RocheJanuary   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailDown GAA chairman John Devaney has launched a staunch defence of his county#s track record of adherence to Covid- restrictions after controversy erupted over a gathering of senior football squad members on Tuesday night.But the Mourne County chief appeared to accept that the assembly of around  players - in two separate groups, to receive inidual training programmes for the coming weeks – may have been ill-advised.Okay, they probably shouldn’t have come together like that, Devaney told Independent.ie.But it was brief, it was light, they were responsible in terms of doing it, and they#re away again and won#t be back now until the beginning of February. Andhave not been together for the last seven weeks.The story of how PSNI officers arrived at Abbey CBS following a report from the public of people playing on the pitches was broken today by The Irish News, which reported that officers left having established that “no breaches of regulations had taken place as it was an elite team.”This is a reference to government-imposed regulations, not sporting ones, and there has been a predictable flood of criticism directed at Paddy Tally#s team. Earlier that same day, Croke Park had issued a fresh directive forbidding any indoor or outdoor gatherings of inter-county squads until the end of January at least.When contacted, however, Devaney was keen to stress several points, namely …It was not an actual training session.Iniduals were not being fitness-tested.It was the first collective gathering of Down players since they lost an Ulster semi-final to Cavan on November , and there won’t be any repeat while current restrictions persist.They have already initiated contact with Croke Park to discuss the matter once it became public news.The issue really seems to have arisen by the fact that the PSNI officer or officers arrived at the Abbey School, the Longford native said.When they arrived, they spoke with our management team they were happy enough that there was nothing untoward and they left.With the original January  date pencilled in for ato county training scrapped, he explained that Down#s management wanted particularly to bring some of the newer guys together to give them their programme … because we’ve had a change in our backroom team, we had a strength and conditioning coach and we had a physio, and now it’s the one person.So, he wanted just to outline for them what he needed them to do over the next couple of weeks, because it looks like we’re not going to be back until early February. And that was it.I have to say now, and I’ve been adamant about this, we have not ed to collective training. Again, I can’t speak for others. If there are others who are out there and have been regularly training, it certainly hasn’t been us, he said.When pressed about the GAA direction for no collective gatherings, and that any training instructions should have been conveyed remotely, Devaney replied: We have been doing some stuff remotely – with great dficulty.I mean, from a point of view of wanting to outline to players what is expected or needed of them over the next couple of weeks, that is why they came together. It was rather brief, and then they were away again and won’t be back now together until the GAA decide as to when counties are able to train again.Askedthere be no repeat of such gatherings, he said: Absolutely. And again, I want to re-emphasise, we have not been together since the Cavan game.There#s been quite a little bit of talk about, be it clubs or counties, coming together for training sessions. We haven#t - and there won’t be. That was the whole point, we will not be back together now until.Devaney expanded: We#ve already spoken to Croke Park about this, because obviously it has been highlighted as an issue so there’s no point in us deciding to sit there and wait on any communications. We have taken that decision ourselves.He did not anticipate punishment from the GAA, which issued a fresh reminder on Tuesday that breaches of any Covid- provisions would be dealt with under Rule .- Misconduct considered to have discredited the Association.I don’t think so, he said. Again, that’s not really up to us. I mean, we’re regularly in communication with Croke Park and with Ulster Council. I wouldn’t anticipate that.Again, from our point of view, not to say that we’re being held up as an example at this particular point because everybody has to take on their own responsibilities.I think we have a very sound record in being responsible in that regard. Again, as I stated earlier,others are out there and have been regularly training, I can’t answer for anybody . But I can certainly answer for Down.Independent.ieMost ReadDUP#s Paisley defends Donald Trump in wake of US Capitol riotsCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Further  deaths and , new cases reportedIan Paisley and Claire Hanna in name calling row over ditching NI Protocol British Army Major General from Northern Ireland last man to attack US Capitol before Trump mobTributes to Ballymena man Alan Henry who died days after we shared emotional plea to take Covid- seriouslyLatest NewsSinkhole swallows cars at Italian hospital treating coronavirus patientsMore than , fines handed out for Covid- breachesBBC NI accused of #trolling# Jamie Bryson over Irish language street signsParamilitary style attacks down but bomb attacks rose in Second NI grammar school ditches transfer test Latest from Belfast Sinkhole swallows cars at Italian hospital treating coronavirus patientsGlasgow Film Festival to go virtual after lockdown restrictions introducedMore than , fines handed out for Covid- breachesScott Parker set to give Fulham fringe players chance to impress against QPRMarine boss thanks Liverpool for pre-match Spurs analysis ahead of FA Cup clash,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The club have refused to confirm the departures although it is believed that the pair were informed of the decision a number of weeks ago.

Michael OKane took on the role at St Colmcilles Primary School in Claudy after Easter this year, with schools already closed by the first Covid- lockdown. He was nominated for the award by parent Fiona Garrett, who told presenter Stephen Nolan that Mr OKane had helped her children with two particularly tricky transitions. “My son Matthew was transitioning from P to big school and my daughter Oacuterlagh-Janetransitioning from nursery to P,” she said. “My daughter has a statement of special educational needs. During lockdown, she became very distressed at the sudden change of routine and Mr OKane really helped with this. googletag.cmd.push “He did this by doing videos to show her where her new classroom was going to be, what it would look like, who her new classroom assistant was going to be and how to sanitise your hands properly. “He also helped my son with the P leaving transition. My son started becoming distressed at not seeing his friends and the fact they wouldnt get a last opportunity to all be together. “Mr OKane arranged a wonderful Year  leaving mass, where he shot a beautul photo and video of the group together with his drone. “Matthews short, but positive experience of Mr OKane actually inspired him to want to become a teacher now.” googletag.cmd.push Miss Garrett said Mr OKane had gone beyond the call of duty to make sure parents were looked after too, and said he was a special person. “He is so good with children who have special educational needs. He goes above and beyond, going that extra little step just to make everything run smoothly. That takes a special person,” she said. “He goes out of his way to be so approachable and friendly. “Hes in the thick of it with the children, showing them how to use their talents and getting the best out of everyone, including his staff. “He really cares for his school family. Absolutely anything is possible with the right support and Im so grateful.”     Michael admitted it was a shock to receive a call from Stephen Nolan, initially askinganything was wrong, but he regained his composure to pay tribute to the schools staff. “I only started here at Easter and I inherited a fantastic school with fantastic staff and I dont think Ive done too much myself – everybody in the school has really pulled together,” he said. “Im just looking out the window here on a dreary Monday morning and thats the sort of thing we need to hear. Im in shock here, but Id just like to thank the staff, and in particular Fionas childrens teachers. “Theres a fantastic team in Year  who made children feel comfortable in coming back to school. “Its been tough, but everybody has gone above and beyond from teachers, classroom assistants, our building supervisors and cleaners. “Im going to relay this to all the staff because it will lt everybodys spirits,” he added.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I was fully booked and had to turn people away, and people have rebooked, so that means a lot,” she told the County Derry Post. “I didnt really know what I wanted to do until I left school, but I always knew I wanted to work with animals. “I wanted to be a vet, but after a bit of work experience I changed my mind!” googletag.cmd.push Clionas mum Joanne has supported her throughout her move into dog grooming, and said the former St Patricks College, Maghera student had an early introduction to animals. “There have always been animals around her,” she said. “Shes had dogs all her le and used to do horse riding lessons at Laura Browns in Magherafelt. When she was two and a half she asked Santa for a moo, neigh and a quack! “Her uncle built her a stable and Santa brought her a first Shetland pony when she was two and a half.” Dogs have always been part of Clionas le. After leaving school, Cliona completed a Diploma at Wizards of Dogs in Cookstown, where the experience was immersive. googletag.cmd.push “When I was training,a dog comes in that was biting or anything, we had to do it ourselves, to help us learn how to cope when we qualy,” she told the County Derry Post. “That prepared me for going out on my own when you get dogs like that you know how to deal with it. You just try your best to work with them and find a way that works better than what youve tried. “I couldnt have done it without the Wizard of Dogs, Ive learned so much. You do your first aid and start off grooming two dogs a day.     “By the end it was loads more, and I covered all the dferent cuts, so I got plenty of experience there,” she added. While dog groomers have been able to remain open throughout the latest raft of Covid- restrictions, Clionas sister, Nicole, hasnt been so lucky. “Her sister has a salon in Maghera and we were laughing that Cliona has only started and she can stay open whereas Nicole has to close,” explained Joanne. “We could maybe get her an odd dog to bath.” You can follow Fairy Tail Dog Grooming by visiting their Facebook and Instagram pages.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Several important areas of land on key entrances to the city are currently vacant. Derry City and Strabane District Council is now looking to set up the new  to ask their opinion on the design quality of any planning applications which are made for these sites. One of the sites expected to be discussed is the derelict site of the former Tillie and Henderson shirt factory at the cityside end of the Craigavon Bridge. googletag.cmd.push It emerged recently that the current owner of the site is to apply for planning permission to build an apartment complex on the land. Speaking at a meeting yesterday of the local councils Planning Committee, Eamon Molloy, the councils Head of Planning Performance and Improvement, outlined the proposal for the new advisory . He said the creation of such  had been put forward as part of a review of the Planning Service. Mr Molloy said the  would offer advice to councillors on important gateway sites in the council area.

He said he would bring a report on the matter to next months meeting of the Planning Committee. There has been much debate in recent years about the development of gateway sites in Derry. The Tillie and Henderson site, in particular, has been at the forefront of the discussions. The site has been unused since the derelict factory building was destroyed in a fire in . The owners of the site, Belfast-based Andras House, had originally planned to build a hotel on the site.     However, those plans never came to fruition and it emerged last month that Andras House has now teamed up with local developers, the Martin Property Group, to build an apartment complex on the site. Director of Andras House, Rajesh Rana, said a residential development is the most appropriate use that can be delivered at this time. Just across the road from the Tillie and Henderson site is another derelict piece of land which was also previously home to a shirt factory. This would also be regarded as a gateway site in Derry.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The decision was taken by church leaders following a meeting today with medical chiefs. In a statement, the Catholic Bishops of Ireland said they supported the decision. We recognise the efforts of so many in our parishes who have been working to ensure that our gatherings for public worship are as safe as possible and we welcome the continuing engagement between the faith communities and the NI Executive which has led to consensus between us on the importance of people being able to gather in person for worship, the statement said. googletag.cmd.push At this time, however, we acknowledge and support the unequivocal message from public health authorities that the movement and gathering of people should be minimised and that as many people as possiblestay at homefor the sake of health, le and the Common Good. In light of our ongoing consultations and of the current serious and worsening situation, and in line with clear public health guidance that people shouldstay at home, we have decided that for a limited period , the celebration of the Eucharist and other liturgies should take place without the physical presence of the faithful - with the exception of marriage, funeral, baptismal liturgies and drive-in services . googletag.cmd.push Arrangements for recording and or livestreaming, and making inidual visits for private prayer are also permissible in accordance with regulations. We encourage parishes, where possible, to continue to broadcast the celebration of Mass - and other devotions and prayer services - online and on other media, knowing that faith and prayer can be a tremendous support to iniduals and society during these dficult times.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

People will be asked to stay away from their church from today until Saturday, February . The decision will be reviewed at the end of this month. The decision was taken by church leaders following a meeting today with medical chiefs. In a statement, the Catholic Bishops of Ireland said they supported the decision. We recognise the efforts of so many in our parishes who have been working to ensure that our gatherings for public worship are as safe as possible and we welcome the continuing engagement between the faith communities and the NI Executive which has led to consensus between us on the importance of people being able to gather in person for worship, the statement said. googletag.cmd.push At this time, however, we acknowledge and support the unequivocal message from public health authorities that the movement and gathering of people should be minimised and that as many people as possiblestay at homefor the sake of health, le and the Common Good. In light of our ongoing consultations and of the current serious and worsening situation, and in line with clear public health guidance that people shouldstay at home, we have decided that for a limited period , the celebration of the Eucharist and other liturgies should take place without the physical presence of the faithful - with the exception of marriage, funeral, baptismal liturgies and drive-in services . googletag.cmd.push Arrangements for recording and or livestreaming, and making inidual visits for private prayer are also permissible in accordance with regulations. We encourage parishes, where possible, to continue to broadcast the celebration of Mass - and other devotions and prayer services - online and on other media, knowing that faith and prayer can be a tremendous support to iniduals and society during these dficult times.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It started off with the sporting fields thronged with activity, hopes and dreams. Until Covid- reached into our communities and pushed the pause button on everything. Sporting activity ed in a format nobody really recognised, before we were forced into a cycle of close, open, close, open...until we put up the Christmas stocking, sat down – inside our bubbles - and fogged mountains of turkey and champ into ourselves. One great positive of the lockdown was nostalgia and how we were able to revisit the past. Through the eyes of former players and managers, we lted the lid on their journey. Both in print and via the broadcast media, the heroes and heroines of yesterday became icons again. A reminder of where we came from and the importance of sport. googletag.cmd.push It gave them an identity and got the tongues wagging again. A is for attacking mark. Christy Young will be remembered as the first in the Derry championships. Lets hope someone in authority makes a move to bin it. It offers nothing but more hassle for overworked referees, cheap scores and shafts defenders. B is for break. The water break that was brought into our games is now a coaching break and a momentum changer. If your team is struggling, it is a Godsend, whereasyou are on a roll its as useful as an ashtray on a motorbike. Surely water bottles, clearly marked, can be laid at points behind the goals and along the sidelines for players to grab during a break in play. googletag.cmd.push C is for classic. One of the joys of this season was being present in Paacuteirc Esler in January to witness Slaughtneils All-Ireland hurling clash with Ballyhale. It is the best game, by far, that I have had the pleasure of reporting on. It had absolutely everything. Atmosphere. Passion. Skill. And entertainment by the lorry load. It was one of those days that makes sport so worthwhile. D is for Desertmartin. With the fruits of their underage coaching paying off, they made it through to the U and minor finals, on top of their seniors qualying for the junior decider with Craigbane. Then, with the second lockdown, all three games were put on the back burner. A season that couldve been the springboard for future progress was soon one of frustration.     E is for equality. One thing that  has given us, is the split season and the chance for club and county to be given an equal slice of the pie. Players know where they stand and managers can plan accordingly. If it can eradicate the lazy Derry suffer because of club rivalry myth, it will go a long way to getting Oakleaf county teams climbing back to the top. And it gives more media attention to the club game. In an interview before Christmas, Derry dual player Aine McAllister was hoping for a split season to allow her to play both football and camogie for Derry. F is for Faughanvale. After an entertaining clash with Limavady, they won a second intermediate ladies title in three seasons, thanks to Ellie McCaffreys clinching goal. Steelstown took the senior title with victory over Ballymaguigan. Coleraine were junior champions after their victory over Ballerin. G is for game...or in this case, more than a game. Local soccer club Draperstown Celtic continued to offer a sporting outlet to the youth of Ballinascreen and beyond. Its their insistence on all players getting their chance to shine – including their girls diamonds team – that deserves much credit. There is also their link with local mental health group STEPS, helping to reach out to the person inside the player. Their grassroots football club of the year award was well-deserved. H is for Hugh. In August this year, the Ballinascreen and Derry sporting community was rocked by the death of Hugh McWilliams. Derry GAA Chairman Stephen Barker said Hugh was a giant of generosity. He was Managing Director of HA Mechanical Services, who sponsored all Derry and Ballinascreen teams. I is for internet streaming. With restricted access to games, Derry GAA streamed a chunk of their games live, with the rest uploaded by midweek for subscribers to view. It raked in poundk to the Owenbeg coffers and offered those at home and overseas the chance to watch from the sofa. Alan Gunns commentary was a testament to his research and attention to detail. Along with a host of guests, the Derry PR team delivered a great service. J is for Josh. Following in Callum Devines footsteps, Kilreas Josh McErlean kept the local theme on the Irish motorsport front. McErlean was named as Irish Young Driver of the Year and recently made his mark on the international scene and made his World Rally Championship debut at Monza in December. K is for Kilrea – When you talk about reaching something into the pockets of the local community, Kilreas input was unrivalled. The GAA club clubbed together to raise poundk Chest, Heart and Stroke from a -hour relay. Then, when FIFA came calling with a pound, fine on Kilrea United, the community had it paid off inside  hours via a crowdfunding page, with the surplus used to buy kits for the local primary schools. L is for Lavey minors. After winning the Derry hurling and football championships in , they conquered Ulster last Christmas and carried on there they left off to defend their football title, but were denied a chance for another tilt at Ulster. With flawless ball retention and a maturity beyond their years, they have a bright future. M is for marathon. With a time of :., local athletics icon Tommy Hughes and his son Eoin officially became the fastest father and son marathon running duo in the world at the Frankfurt marathon. If that wasnt enough, Tommy smashed the world Over-s record at the Danny McDaid km event in Letterkenny. N is for needy. The local sporting clubs excelled this year in helping those stranded at home, in need of the essentials. They simply cant get enough praise. There was a great photo doing the rounds on social media of Ballyronan Marina centre, laid out with foot parcels as Loup delivered to the needy. Their neighbours in Ballymaguigan did something similar and it prompted one of the clubs senior citizens to write a letter of kindness to the committee, saying it was more important than any trophy. O is for Oz. Conor Glass made hisfrom a five-year career in Australia with AFL side Hawthorn and has made his debut for Derry already. He needs time to grow into the game before hopefully becoming a leader in the countys future. On the flipside, Callum Brown and Anton Tohill signed one-year deals with GWS Giants and Collingwood respectively. P is for Paddys Day. Once the year trickled into March, our sporting calendar shuddered to a halt, just as St Patricks Maghera and St Pius Magherafelt booked their places in the showpiece MacRory MacLarnon Final double header. The excitement in the schools was electric, as the players looked forward to one of the best days of their lives, only for all be pulled from their grasp. Being awarded their joint titles later in the year was a tiny consolation. Q is for quiz. With the social scene virtually non-existent,  became the year of the online quiz. We were lucky to have Joe McCloskey compiling an hour of goodness every week. Glen forward Paul Gunning, with help from his father and former Derry PRO Sean, ran online quizzes to engage club members. I am sure there were other clubs reaching out to their members in similar fashion. By the sound of recent Covid figures, we could be back to the video-conferencing mode of entertainment. R is for Rogers. It seems like ages ago when St Johns Swatragh boxer Paddy Rogers defeated Newrys Dennis Boriskins to become the Ulster Elite champion in Belfasts Ulster Hall. The affable Paddy joined his brother, Slaughtneil dual player Brendan, in the Ulster champion category, but joked that he didnt have an entire team to help him. Paddy was a very popular champion. S is for sin-bin. The black card forces a team to play with a player less for  minutes. It can lead to a tactical move, where teams can take the sting out of a game and leave it fragmented until they are back to the full . A better solution would be a  metre free regardless of where the cynical play took place. It would make teams think twice and clean the game up as a whole. T is for treble. After looking on from the outside, Slaughtneil senior footballers had their hands on the John McLaughlin Cup and took their tally of Derry championships to six. It sealed the treble. Just  hours earlier – with the hurling already won in September - the clubs camogs retained the Martin Mulholland Cup to secure another treble. U is for underage structures. Following a ruling that slipped through unchallenged to Croke Park, clubs all over Ireland have been told they must organise their teams in U, U and U gradings. And with it comes the huge void from the undeveloped underage player until the senior ranks and the physical challenges it will bring. V is for virus...and for vaccine. Covid- came along and robbed us of any degree of a normal le, tore our sporting landscape to pieces and left us going around in circles to stamp it out. Hopefully the vaccine will help  take a more familiar shape. W is for wheelie bin. There wasnt a home in the country that didnt have balls peppering towards them. Dungiven U player Ryan Moore was the king. Bouncing on a trampoline, he performed a backflip, with the ball between his legs before releasing it into the wheelie bin. Take a bow Ryan. There was also the example of McNicholl family of Glenullin, taking videos of three generations playing hurling camogie, before knitting it all into one nty movie. A lovely touch. X is for x-factor...well, this is close enough. What a year it was for county Derry. Dara McNicholl was wowing viewers on The Voice Kids. If that wasnt enough, Johnny Brooks and Brooke Scullion also took the Saturday night entertainment by storm, getting all the way to final of The Voice. They have all played on the sporting fields of Derry and it was amazing to see them put the county on the map. Brilliant. Y is for yelling. Once crowds began toto games, worryingly in more numbers than permitted, so too did the vitriol being yelled over the fence. The time away from sport didnt make one iota of dference to the level of respect on show. It was open season again, with referees, players and mentors labelled as fair game for those who paid their money to watch. Z is for Zoom. This time last year, we thought it was something you did in a car or on a camera. Now, its in every facet of our working and personal lives. And sport is no dferent. It became a tool for club AGMs, meetings and training sessions. Sideline View would like to wish all our readers, advertisers and contributors a happy new year.

I would implore that everyone plays their part, stays at home, follow the guidelines and take the vaccine.ldquoWe are absolutely slaughtered in hospitals and those big numbers of new cases will feed into admissions and we are already at capacity.ldquoA fortnight from now, a proportion of the new cases will end up in hospital and hospitals have not yet had the chance to get out of surge two and we are straight into surge three.The local councillor spoke of her personal relief at being vaccinated.ldquoAt the moment Irsquove only got the first jab which I will get the second in about  weeks time.

We want to be able to develop our coaching set-up, particularly in urban centres like Downpatrick, Newry, north Down, the Down parts of Belfast. Hopefully those opportunities will come up.Mr McAteer said the implementation of a Down training hub at Ballykinlar was a key aim when it comes to considering where spending will take place in Down GAA.ldquoThe development at Ballykinlar is a huge thing, both for Down and the community in Ballykinlar. That is one of the key fronts we are working on, he said.ldquoOf course though, we cannot take our eye of the importance of development in urban areas. We can see how much Dublin for example have benefited from utilising their urban areas, and the rewards they have reaped from that in recent years on the pitch, as well as financially.He did caution that, as ever, the availability of funding is major issue.ldquoThe GAA took a huge hit financially in  - that is likely to happen to some degree at least, again this year.ldquoIn terms of us here in Down though, we are in a stronger position to deal with the climate I would like to think, certainly when compared to other northern counties.ldquoWe have big urban centres which is vitally important. We can also explore the possibility of greater cross-border development with counties like Louth, and the use of the Dublin Institute of Technology.

A lot of those games were at an under-age level. Some clubs have got very very strong groups of kids at very young ages.ldquoWhat we need to do is to ensure that those young people who come into the GAA in Down at that stage stay with it into adulthood.ldquoOur games need to be attractive and innovative going forward.ldquoThat means we all need to keep pushing, keep the facilities as good as possible and promoting ourselves as well as we can..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th January 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Brexit deal is ‘best of both worlds’ for local fishermen  ","story":"THE Brexit fisheries deal with the European Union is good news for the Ardglass fishing industry.Thatrsquos the view of former fishermenrsquos leader Dick James, who says Ardglass and the other Co Down fishing ports can look to the future with confidence.Mr James, former chief executive of the Northern Ireland Fish Producersrsquo Organisation, says an increase in quotas for key catches will benefit fishermen.At the same time the non-imposition of tarfs on exported fish to EU markets, will underpin the future of the processing industry.Mr James that while some areas of the UK had done badly from the Brexit deal, local fishermen should be pleased with the outcome.ldquoThe deal is good news for our fishermen and should secure investment and new jobs in the industry, he said.In the Irish Sea the amount of herring which can be caught by UK fishermen will rise from the current figure of % to % in  and % in .In the crucial prawn sector, the UK quota for Area , which includes the Irish Sea, will go from % currently to % in  and % in .There will also be increases in the UK quotas for other types of fish, including haddock, cod and whiting.Mr James said: ldquoWe have got the best of both worlds.

We have in essence been in a lockdown-type situation for a long time.Even so, Craig said Newcastle League officials are not yet throwing in the towel in trying to devise a way for a season to be played.ldquoAny decision we make with regards to how and when we can get football back up and running again will be taken in conjunction with our clubs.ldquoWe need their input on how they feel about the situation, and there needs to be a want from the clubs to get back to playing as well. All of those things will be up for discussion within the league committee when we know where we stand.Amateur League chairman Terry Pateman says he has not yet given up hope of getting some sort of season put together over the next few months.ldquoWe are still essentially working blind, he said. ldquoWe are trying to devise ways of starting the new season before we know what the government are going to decide next, he said.ldquoIf there were no further stoppages beyond the dates already in place for us, we could proceed with what would obviously be a shortened season.

While the appreciation of these workers may have changed in the eyes of some their pay and conditions have not.The crisis has further illustrated the incredible work undertaken by our nurses and doctors, in addition to the work undertaken by public transport workers, cleaners and those in our emergency services.Long periods of having to work from home for others have also served to highlight that homes are our sanctuary. The lack of affordable, decent homes must be addressed in the time ahead mdash especially in areas like South Down where many young people can not chose to stay and live in their local community.So there is no doubt that challenges remain for us as we enter this new year, but there is light at the end of the tunnel.

This has served our people well.The voice of Ireland, and the concerns of the North, have been heard and heeded.And while a deal has now been agreed between the EU and British Government, our priority remains on ensuring unique protections for Ireland and the full implementation of the Protocol.Brexit has opened up a public discourse on the future of this island and exposed the undemocratic nature of partition.In , we will look back at a seminal chapter in our history mdash the partition of our island. For nationalists and republicans, the centenary of partition will not be a cause for celebration.It does, however, give us cause to look to the possibilities and opportunities for the future of the people of this island.This is a defining moment in our history and people will have decisions to make on what is in the best interests of our island.We are in a decade of opportunity where the right to decide our own future rests in the hands of our people. The conversation on Irish unity is well underway across our society.The provision for a referendum on unity is part of the Good Friday Agreement.We now have a choice between a narrow, inward-looking vision of Brexit Britain or the open inclusive vision of a New Ireland. should be about an inclusive conversation. This is a time for debate and big, bold ideas for everyone who calls this island home.Let us all begin this new year with a sense of realism about the challenges we continue to face but also optimism and a commitment to help us build a new and better future for everyone..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th January 2020 Workers.jpg","title":"Workers set for strike  ","story":"TALKS between Newry, Mourne and Down Council and trade unions have failed to stop industrial action which started on Monday.The industrial action, including a work-to-rule by all trade union members, is already having an impact with residents claiming overflowing bins have not being emptied.A second day of strike action has been called for end of the month.

Supermarkets have received a three-month grace period until April  meaning that there is not yet enforcement of that aspect of the new border.Rather, the problem is understood to be the complexity of customs declarations for every product crossing the Irish Sea, which has led to MS deciding that in the short term it is better to keep most of its more than , food products flowing by reducing the complexity of each load.Other supermarkets and food companies have seen entire lorry loads unable to make it through the new border this week.Earlier this week the News Letter revealed that Sainsbury’s has withdrawn hundreds of products from sale in Northern Ireland as a result of the Irish Sea border.However, while Sainsbury’s says that it hopes the decision is temporary, it appears to be more signicant than what MS has done because Sainsbury’s has signed a contract which will see Spar-branded products replacing many of the items no longer being sent across the Irish Sea until at least April.Read More Read MoreDays after Brexit, many products vanish from Sainsbury’s in Northern Ireland and...MS – which set up a new distribution centre to service its stores on both parts of the island of Ireland ahead of Brexit – emphasised that it is firmly committed to remaining in Northern Ireland.An MS spokesman said: “We have served customers in Northern Ireland for over  years and our priority is to make sure we continue to deliver the same choice and great quality range that our loyal customers have always enjoyed.“Stores have been receiving regular deliveries this week, however following the UK’s recent departure from the EU, we are transitioning to new processes and we’re working closely with our partners and suppliers to ensure customers can continue to enjoy a great range of products.”: Top customs expert admits: New Irish Sea border is ‘cumbersome’ and hugely complex – even for me, with  years experienceIrish Sea border which Secretary of State Brandon Lewis claims doesn’t exist empties shelves and ends business in Northern Ireland——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityMike Kingston, who this week collected his long service medal to recognise the achievement, has shared his pride and some of his memories over the years.Mr Kingston, who is married and has two children and two grandchildren, joined Penarth RNLI on November  , as a volunteer crew member ndash and quickly progressed to become leboat helm.Along with his fellow volunteer crew members, he attended hundreds of incidents, launching day and night in all kinds of weather conditions, to go to the aid of people in trouble at sea.Since his retirement from being a sea-going member of the team, he has spent the last  years as shore crew and one of Penarthrsquos Deputy Launching Authorities, liaising with the coastguards when they request assistance, and managing the leboatrsquos launch.Mr Kingstonrsquos leboat career has extended beyond the UK. In , he was a member of a crew of just eight leboat volunteers from across the UK who flew out to aid the relief effort in flood-stricken Mozambique.Together, the team faced the dangers of crocodiles, hippos, poisonous snakes and anti-personnel mines, navigating rivers that had burst their banks, in a rescue mission to bring desperately needed medical relief to , people in villages marooned by flood waters.ldquoWe had five small D class inflatable leboats, and had to ferry doctors and medical supplies to areas that had been written off as impossible, as helicopters couldnrsquot land there and they were inaccessible by road, he said.ldquoIt was so hot that the soles of my boots melted. We had to spend the night on sandbars where we took turns to keep watch, as the crocodiles were very keen to join us.Since he joined the crew, Mike has combined his volunteering with his paid job in the South Wales Fire and Rescue service. He joined the service back in , at just , and progressed from his position as a firefighter, to the lead instructor for recruit training, finally finishing his career in  as Chair of the Water Rescue group, and a member of the servicersquos all Wales flood response team.Over the past four decades, -year-old Mr Kingston has seen huge changes in the way the RNLI operates.He has seen Penarth leboat station move from its original home in the deck chair store underneath the current Coffi Co building on the Esplanade, to its current location just up the road in a purpose built, modern leboat station.ldquoIrsquom sure the people of Penarth will remember the hand held maroons that were fired off by a leboat crew member to call the rest of us to the station for a launch, he said.ldquoBut even before that, I remember when the Pier Master would get us down to the station by firing the maroons out of a small cannon.ldquoNowadays, technology has moved on and we use pagers, mobiles phones and computer systems to respond to a shout.ldquoThese systems are a lot more sophisticated, but itrsquos still the same feeling when yoursquore called out of bed in the early hours of a freezing cold January morning.ldquoNo matter how times have moved on, one thing that remains constant is the unbelievable commitment of the whole RNLI team.ldquoThere have been so many highs and lows over the past  years. As all the team will know, itrsquos good to feel that yoursquore part of a team, giving something to your community.ldquoBut there have also been some sad times when people have lost their lives. Irsquom proud to have been a part of Penarth RNLI family.Thanking him for his  years of service, Jason Dunlop, Penarth Leboat Operations Manager said: ldquoOn behalf of all at Penarth leboat station, I would like to congratulate Mike on this fantastic achievement and thank him for his commitment and support to saving lives at sea over the last  years. We are all volunteers at Penarth RNLI, we give our time freely to support our local community.ldquoMikersquos contribution to the charity over the years has not only been volunteering his time, hersquos also been happy to share his wealth of experience with the crew as we train and work together when someone needs our help.

They have done an incredible job over the past few weeks to be ready for delivery.ldquoThe secretary of state said, crucially, that this is a UK-wide effort will he give a cast-iron guarantee that not only this tranche of vaccines but future tranches will be available on a completely equitable basis throughout the UK, so that we can bear down on this virus in every part of our country It was good to get a guarantee on that from the secretary of state. I also spoke this week on the worrying reversal in progress tackling global hunger and famine.With so many struggling to access basic food needs at home and abroad, wersquove seen an extraordinary lack of compassion from this Tory government in the run-up to Christmas by failing to tackle holiday hunger in England at the same time as slashing our humanitarian relief while millions face famine.Itrsquos time for a Christmas U-turn on both.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

These projected figures are the highest we have ever seen in this County and are likely to reach almost , cases per , in the seven-day period up until Christmas Day.If you compare that with the figure of  cases per , when we entered the local lockdown, you can see how serious the current situation is. We can no longer be complacent.We know from the first and second waves that as case numbers increase, more people get seriously unwell, and we will inevitably see more deaths from Coronavirus - many of which can be avoided,we act now.We are deeply concerned that hospitals and primary care services across Cardf and the Vale of Glamorgan are now under unsustainable pressure due to COVID-, and sadly, but inevitably, the number of people who are becoming very sick is increasing daily.Each and every one of us has a responsibility to act now. We must all follow Welsh Government coronavirus regulations, butyou can also take further actions to protect those you love, then we urge you to do so.We should not meet with anyone outside our household bubble and keep contact with people outside our household to an absolute minimum until the current threat has passed, but especially in the run-up to Christmas.We know that staying away from loved ones will be painful for many, especially at this time of year, butwe do this now, we will be doing everything we can to protect our family and friends for the months to come.We know many people think that the vaccine is going to become more widely available, so everything is going to be okay. Regrettably, that is simply not the case. If we donrsquot change our behaviour now,many people will die before the vaccine is rolled out, people who donrsquot need to die, possibly people who you know.The full roll out of the vaccine will take many months, so now is not the time to be complacent. Very few of us are immune and the virus is still prevalent in our communities and our hospitals. By practising social distancing, washing our hands regularly and wearing face coverings we will all be doing our bit to help.So, our message is simple.Wash your hands regularly oryou canrsquot do that use sanitiser hand gel.Please try and stay at home and only go out for essential reasons andit is essential to go out, please do so in quieter periods.If you do go out, wear a mask when required and keep socially distanced by at least  metres, wherever possible.Please do not mix with other households or your friends.Work from home,you can do so.If you develop symptoms such as a new and continuous cough, a temperature, or a loss of taste or smell please self-isolate with your household and arrange a test.These small steps can really help us all to keep our communities safe.As a Health Board and Council, we are fully mobilised in the fight against COVID-. Doing so continues to be a huge challenge and is one that we will best achieve,we do it together, just as we did in the Spring.We are asking every one of you to achieve this challenge together.Letrsquos stop the spread, and letrsquos keep the Vale of Glamorgan, the NHS and our loved ones safe.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Hospitality businesses would have joined them on pm Christmas Day, with a level four lockdown coming into place on Monday, December . The five day lsquorelaxationrsquo period would have still been in place according to these rules, but a change from three households mixing to two.But on Saturday, December , all this changed as prime minister Boris Johnson held a press conference to update the UK on the rapid spread of the new strain of coronavirus and announcing that the South East of England, including London would be moved into tier four.Tier four means residents must stay at home with some limited exemptions ndash which includes workunable to do so from home, however, working from home is strongly advisedit is possible. Non-essential services must also close.

He announced that the tier four lockdown would come into place from midnight on Saturday, December , meaning businesses had a matter of hours to come to terms with the news and people rushed out to do some last-minute Christmas shopping before all the non-essential retail closed.Some of the supermarkets across Wales have now taken their lsquonon-essentialrsquo items off sale.The festive period bubble rule has also changed, with a maximum of two households allowed to mix on Christmas Day.MORE NEWS:Mr Drakeford said in a statement on Saturday evening that the pattern of transmission in London and the South East of England, which is linked to the new iant of coronavirus, is ldquoremarkably consistent with the rapid acceleration of transmission in Wales in recent weeks.Also in the statement, the first minister said that latest evidence had suggested the new strain is present throughout Wales and that it needed an ldquoimmediate response.After meeting with the Welsh Governmentrsquos Cabinet on Saturday and taking into consideration advice from senior medical and scientic advisors, he said: ldquoThe situation is incredibly serious.

And light does more than create a festive mood mdash light brings hope.ldquoFor Christians, Jesus is lsquothe light of the worldrsquo, but we canrsquot celebrate his birth today in quite the usual way. People of all faiths have been unable to gather as they would wish for their festivals, such as Passover, Easter, Eid and Vaisakhi. But we need le to go on.ldquoLast month, fireworks lit up the sky around Windsor, as Hindus, Sikhs and Jains celebrated Diwali, the festival of lights, providing joyous moments of hope and unity mdash despite social distancing.ldquoRemarkably, a year that has necessarily kept people apart has, in many ways, brought us closer. Across the Commonwealth, my family and I have been inspired by stories of people volunteering in their communities, helping those in need.ldquoIn the United Kingdom and around the world, people have risen magnicently to the challenges of the year, and I am so proud and moved by this quiet, indomitable spirit. To our young people in particular I say thank you for the part you have played.ldquoThis year, we celebrated International Nursesrsquo Day, on the th anniversary of the birth of Florence Nightingale. As with other nursing pioneers like Mary Seacole, Florence Nightingale shone a lamp of hope across the world.ldquoToday, our frontline services still shine that lamp for us ndash supported by the amazing achievements of modern science ndash and we owe them a debt of gratitude.ldquoWe continue to be inspired by the kindness of strangers and draw comfort that ndash even on the darkest nights ndash there is hope in the new dawn.MORE NEWS:Do you know what happened to this poor kitten How Sully came together at Christmas through the power of the artsAll the supermarket opening times over Christmas and New YearldquoJesus touched on this with the parable of the Good Samaritan. The man who is robbed and left at the roadside is saved by someone who did not share his religion or culture. This wonderful story of kindness is still as relevant today.ldquoGood Samaritans have emerged across society showing care and respect for all, regardless of gender, race or background, reminding us that each one of us is special and equal in the eyes of God.ldquoThe teachings of Christ have served as my inner light, as has the sense of purpose we can find in coming together to worship.ldquoIn November, we commemorated another hero ndash though nobody knows his name. The Tomb of the Unknown Warrior isnrsquot a large memorial, but everyone entering Westminster Abbey has to walk around his resting place, honouring this unnamed combatant of the First World War mdash a symbol of selfless duty and ultimate sacrice.ldquoThe Unknown Warrior was not exceptional. Thatrsquos the point. He represents millions like him who throughout our history have put the lives of others above their own, and will be doing so today. For me, this is a source of enduring hope in dficult and unpredictable times.ldquoOf course, for many, this time of year will be tinged with sadness: some mourning the loss of those dear to them, and others missing friends and family members distanced for safety, when all theyrsquod really want for Christmas is a simple hug or a squeeze of the hand.ldquoIf you are among them, you are not alone, and let me assure you of my thoughts and prayers.ldquoThe Bible tells how a star appeared in the sky, its light guiding the shepherds and wise men to the scene of Jesusrsquos birth. Let the light of Christmas mdash the spirit of selflessness, love and above all hope mdash guide us in the times ahead.ldquoIt is in that spirit that I wish you a very happy Christmas. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Wherersquos the robust plan to make sure our childrenrsquos education isnrsquot being ruined ldquoI donrsquot disagree at all with the decision to keep them off school, but there needs to be a plan in place.Mrs Lacey, who works full-time as well as her husband, said on Wednesday her son had received no face to face teaching by midday.ldquoI think schools are trying, but communication with parents needs to improve in our case.ldquoWersquove also had little clarity on whether the mock exams he did when he was in before Christmas will have a bearing on predicting grades later this year. Itrsquos very uncertain and the I do get the feeling the goodwill is starting to dwindle.Nikki LaceyOn Wednesday it was confirmed that internal assessments replacing next summerrsquos cancelled exams in Wales are scheduled to start in schools on February .Mother-of-three Clare Hollinshead, who has two children at primary school and one in secondary school, also says she felt the decision to extend the closure was the right one.Mrs Hollinshead ndash who is undergoing cancer treatment and is vulnerable ndash says she worried about relying on the actions of others to keep her family safe.Clare HollinsheadldquoI think the decisionhad to be made, but I do have concerns for my children, she said.ldquoThe impact on them not seeing their friends and not getting the education they deserve is something them makes me anxious.ldquoToo much time alone and in front of a screen is no good for anyone.ldquoIt will be more concerningit continues after January . Itrsquos dficult to maintain that motivation to keep going and keep balancing le with home-schooling.ldquoButitrsquos what we have to do then so be it. Itrsquos so important we protect the NHS. Irsquod hate for someone who was in my positionto not get the treatment they need because our hospitals are overwhelmed.On Tuesday Ms Williams said schools will only remain closed after January  ldquo thatrsquos the only thing we can do to suppress the virus.ldquoClearly any decision to close schools for face-to-face teaching contact for the majority of children is a really dficult decision, she said, ldquoand itrsquos a decision which has grave consequences for children.ldquoEducation has a role to play in helping suppress the virus and helping our NHS to cope, and helping those doctors and nurses and healthcare professionals who are on the front line and struggling so hard. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Mum was a real wheeler dealer and I learned so much from her in those amazing summers, travelling around Scotland and the North of England, her original home.”Maggie was born Margaret Titler in March  in Gateshead, which then was part of County Durham. The eldest of four children, Maggie lived through World War II and survived Scarlet Fever.She moved at the age of  to Northern Ireland with her family when her father, Jack, was asked to manage the Powell’s Products’ factory in Portadown. He had worked at the HQ in Gateshead until demobbed from the RAF when the war ended.Along with her mum, Maggie, and siblings, Nora, Anne and Eddie, moved in  to Windsor Avenue, a house that was built specically for the firm’s manager..After graduating from school, Maggie worked for Eagle Star Insurance, but with a strong entrepreneurial spirit she started visiting farms buying antiques and jewellery. Maggie then opened Eden Antiques a shop in Edenderry and became well known in Portadown’s business community.“Mum continued running the shop for many years, which was rented from our next-door neighbour, Mrs Bright, and the business thrived.

She continued to help after he launched his current business, ATG Group, which is based in Coleraine and has offices across the UK and Ireland.Mark said: “Often on long drives and while travelling the world she would guide me and be the most amazing sounding board. “We would often speak for hours and I loved these chats. She would put me up after my travels, when I was too tired to make the last leg home to Coleraine, and made sure I had nothing but the best steak or mince dinner!“I so loved my Mum, she was the wind beneath my wings,” Mark added. “Mum was my star and as she went shooting across the sky in the early hours of Sunday morning the th December , she is absent from this world and present with the Lord.”Editor’s message:Thank you for reading this article.

As a result, Cllr Baxter’s proposal passed with  votes in favour, eight against and one abstention recorded.However, upon discussion of the committee meeting’s minutes at December’s meeting of full council, Councillor Liam Mackle proposed that Council did not accept the recommendation put forward by the committee.This proposal was seconded by his party colleague Councillor Paul Duffy.Councillor Pope said it “was very important” that the occasion is marked and noted the need for education and cultural events to be spread throughout the borough.He also expressed his concerns about budgets and the idea of a large event taking place giving the current pandemic.“I would propose we accept the original recommendationfrom the November committee that listed the programme, including the £, budget,” said Cllr Pope. This proposal was seconded by his party’s group leader, Councillor Eoin Tennyson.Speaking about the issue, Cllr Tennyson said the programme had been discussed atand explained, from his perspective, initialdiscussions were constructive.“All parties engaged with a view to marking the centenary in a way that was inclusive and respectful,” said Cllr Tennyson. “I think the original recommendation that was presented by officers to the committee was one that did that.“It would allow us to mark the centenary in a way that was inclusive and reflective of the entire borough and also balanced against the need to be prudent in terms of the financial situation we as a council and indeed many of our rate payers are in.“I can’t in good conscience support a proposal that would see this council commit to an additional £, unbudgeted spend. The reality is that money is going to have be found through the estimates process.“We could end up in the situation where that money will have to be found through a rates hike or cuts to services. I think Councillor Pope’s proposal is an eminently sensible one and I hope all parties can see it in themselves to support that approach.”DUP councillor Darryn Causby sought clarity on what was being proposed andthe proposals tabled complied with standing orders.“Under standing order .. there should only be one amendment moved and discussed at one time, the same applies for proposals on the floor,” said Cllr Causby.“There was one on the floor, Cllr Pope then put a second one on the floor but can I please get clarity on the first one [Cllr Mackle’s proposal] it seems to be a direct negative of what is in the papers and under standing orders I am not clear on whether that is acceptable.“The other point I would raise is the budget was actually agreed at the November council meeting and we just ratied that a short time ago.“If someone is not happy with that, I suggest they look through standing orders and bring a rescinding motion to change that decision.”At this point Council’s Lord Mayor, Councillor Kevin Savage informed members he needed to speak with Council’s Chief Executive Roger Wilson and muted his microphone.Following his confidential discussionwith Mr Wilson, the Lord Mayor confirmed the budget had already been agreed before putting Councillor Mackle’s proposal, to reject the recommendation put forward by the committee, to the floor.All unionist councillors present voted against the proposal as did the three members of the Alliance Party. The members of Sinn Fein and the SDLP voted in favour of the proposal.With the votes totalled, the proposal was defeated with  members voting against the proposal and  voting in favour.The Lord Mayor then explainedthat as the recommendation of the committee stands, a rescinding motion would be requiredbefore Cllr Tennyson’s proposal could be heard.Councillor Tennyson said he was not sure he agreed with this interpretation.“The proposal was that we proceed with the programme originallyproposed by officers not the budget,” said Cllr Tennyson.“The budget may have been agreed, the programme has never been agreed therefore a rescinding motion is not required.“We have proposed that we proceed with the originalprogramme as proposed to the economic development and regeneration committee, it just so happened to be at a cost of £,.“I would be quite keen for that to be voted on as I do not share the analysis that a rescinding motion is required for a decision that has never been taken.”Councillor Baxter then said that as a matter of process given that Cllr Mackle’s proposal has fallen by “default the recommendation goes through”.“I do note Alliance are quite clearly trying to claw back as they could not bring themselves to vote for the celebration of Northern Ireland at the last committee meeting,” said Cllr Baxter.“By the very fact Cllr Mackle’s proposal has failed this recommendation from the committee is going through.”The Lord Mayor said that was his understanding as well and the recommendation as it stands has now gone through.A proposal to accept the minutes of the committee was put forward by Councillor Brian Pope and seconded by SDLP group leader, Councillor Thomas O’Hanlon.Editor’s message:Thank you for reading this article.

Infrastructure Minister, Nichola Mallon, said: “As we continue our fight against the Covid- outbreak and people are following the public health advice to stay at home, protect our NHS and save lives, I have approved a further adjustment in Translink’s service provision. As at the beginning of the Covid- outbreak, these changes will allow Translink to focus their efforts on providing travel for key workers and ensure that people have access to essential services. However, I can assure the public that no geographical area is losing services and people will continue to be able to practice social distancing on our public transport network. “My priority as always is keeping our communities safe and my Department is doing everything it can to ensure essential services and connections are maintained for those using and reliant on our infrastructure network. I will keep the public transport situation under constant review in line with the public health advice. “As we enter a further period of enhanced restrictions, I am asking for your support and would ask everyone only to traveltheir journey is essential. If you do need to use public transport for an essential journey, I would again reiterate that people must wear a face covering. These requirements are part of the continuing effort that all of us must make to reduce the risk of transmission of Covid-. All of us have a responsibility to act to keep each other safe.
