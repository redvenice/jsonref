So, seeing as spring is all about fresh starts, how about a bedroom revamp with a focus on choosing some light, bright bedding for a more restful night’s sleep as the nights get warmer? When looking for new bedding, Marks \u0026amp Spencer is a good place to start. “We see ourselves as experts in sleep, so we are always looking for new products and innovations to bring to the market to help our customers get a great night’s sleep,” says Karen Thomas, head of design home and beauty at M\u0026ampS. “We see sleep health in the same way as we see physical health or dietary health, so a really important part of how we develop products is by solving sleep problems or sleep preferences with innovative new products that improve your sleep.” The M\u0026ampS Comfortably Cool range of filled bedding, sheets, duvet covers and mattress protectors use a Tencel-rich mix, which helps to keep your body temperature cool. Tencel is sustainably crafted from the eucalyptus tree and wicks moisture away from the skin, regulating your body temperature to give you a cool night’s sleep in luxurious comfort. If you are sweltering under your current duvet, it’s worth upgrading to one from the body sensor range of duvets, pillows and mattress protectors. These include specially developed technology to keep you warm when it’s cool and cool when it’s warm, while drawing moisture away from the body to create a drier environment for a more comfortable night’s sleep. And it’s not just about temperature. Getting the darkness levels in the room right is also key to a good night’s sleep. When it’s dark, our bodies release the sleep-inducing hormone melatonin, however, light interrupts its production, which signals to our bodies it’s time to wake up. Even the LED light from an alarm clock can affect your quality of sleep. Ideally you want your room to be so dark that you can’t see from one end to the other. Now the mornings are lighter, you may find yourself waking earlier than you need to, particularly if your blinds or curtains are thin or light-coloured. To ensure your room stays dark for the hours you are sleeping you should consider curtains with an extra blackout layer, such as M\u0026ampS’s cotton bee print curtains or fern pencil-pleat black out curtains. By buying curtains that are lined with a blackout material, you don’t have to limit your curtain choice to dark colours. The next important thing you can do to ease yourself into a good night’s sleep is to turn your bedroom into a haven. Create an environment you find restful and relaxing by clearing away clutter, removing blue-light emitting technology and choosing colours and patterns that lift your mood. Why not opt for some statement bed-linen in fashionable botanical prints, such as this palm-frond bedding set, or this bright jungle one. Leaf patterns bring some of that spring growth indoors and can help you to feel calm. “Creating a calm bedroom can be done by just making simple changes,” says Jaya Myra, a mind-body wellness expert and bestselling author. “Keep the space as clean and decluttered as possible. A bedroom that is too full of stuff – including furniture – does not contribute to good sleep or relaxed energy. Secondly, have at least three things out in the open in the bedroom that make you smile.” This can be as simple as a photograph, a book and fresh flowers. Scent can also have a calming effect and can set the scene for a restful night’s sleep. Lavender has long been known to have sleep-inducing properties and you will find this oil as well as eucalyptus, vetiver and jasmine in the sleep diffusers from M\u0026ampS’s Apothecary range. There are other sensory products in the range to make your room a scented sleep space, including the sleep room spray and the calm scented candle, which is crafted with sweet orange and lavender essential oils. And if it works for babies and toddlers, it can work for you: have a soak in a warm, scented bath to relax your body before bed. Stir in a handful of Tranquil bath salts from the Apothecary range, which contain hemp seed oil to aid relaxation and then, once your fingers begin to shrivel, dry yourself off with the softest Egyptian cotton towels. These towels bring the spa experience into your home and are available in a rainbow of colours, which won’t fade because they are treated with stay-new technology. Suitably cocooned, you can return to your revamped bedroom, certain of a good night’s sleep.

Especially when armed with budget-friendly homeware collections, such as the take on 2021’s biggest decor trends from Marks \u0026amp Spencer. “If you’re keen to refresh tired decor without creating too much work for yourself, the best place to start for a quick win is a fresh lick of paint,” says Alexandra Laird, interior design manager at the Burbeck Group. But you don’t have to stop there. “If replacing furniture is over budget, bright accessories and artwork can be easily added to a room to bring in some new colour.” “A key trend that’s easy to implement on a moderate budget right now would be a modern minimalist look with a Scandi furniture scheme. Use a neutral palette with pops of bright colour added through your furnishings and artwork throughout,” she adds. Make a start by lifting your living room with an emerald green sofa scattered with ochre cushions, or brighten up the bedroom by mixing soft grey bedding with rugs and throws in ocean blue and vibrant mustard. “Keep the rest of the room fairly neutral as a backdrop to really make your bold and bright colours sing,” says Kate Hatherell, founder of the Interior Designers Hub. A simple glass-topped coffee table, for example, is a perfect finisher – style and function without adding to the noise. If you’re looking for a softer palette that’ll calm, start with neutral colours to set the tone. This year’s shades – cream, grey, navy, duck egg, soft pink – all work well together and have the added benefit of timeless appeal. “A good way to add some warmth to neutral shades without disrupting that feeling of calm would be clever use of lighting,” says Laird. “Use table lamps and floor lamps in the corners of a room to add a cosy feel. I’d also bring in textured or warm coloured throws and cushions to maximise that feeling further. Again, you can play around with artwork and soft furnishings to add in warm colourings where needed.” Carry the same peaceful palette into the bedroom with a watercolour bedspread and crisp white linen. A top tip: natural wood accents complement almost all colour combos and, according to interior designer Katharine Pooley, also tick the box for this year’s rustic-inspired trend. “Embracing traditional interiors can help to create a comfortable atmosphere, even if your home is newly-built and therefore perhaps lacks more historical features,” she says. Try rustic-look furniture such as an oak-topped coffee table, or maximise the light with a metal lampshade. If the rustic look isn’t for you, how about heritage inspired classics reimagined for today? We’re talking modern use of colour, and striking scale and pattern. From Pinterest to the high street, you’ll see myriad nods to elegant florals, rich botanical prints, plush fabrics and plenty of polished glassware. Carrying on the taste for vintage twists, art deco references are also back on trend. Looking forward to inviting friends and family over for dinner again? Now’s the time to spruce up your glassware, or add an ornate mirrored tray to your drinks cabinet. Heading down the vintage decor route does come with a warning from the experts, however. “Be careful when working with vintage-inspired pieces that you don’t aim to simply reproduce the era,” says Pooley. Laird agrees that you’ll want to keep things on the right side of Gatsby-era with this trend. “The best way to stop the room from looking too old fashioned and keep it modern is to use contemporary key pieces of furniture, such as the sofa in the lounge, or the bedroom setup, and then add vintage-inspired lamps, accessories and artwork around this,” she advises. Nail it with tactile textures such as Egyptian cotton, luxury velvet and smooth sateen, and sprinkle in a few delightfully retro nods such as cotton velvet cushions, butterfly or hummingbird details and marble accents.

The challenge now is to extend those much loved interiors into the garden to create an exciting new living space. Somewhere to relax with family or entertain friends You don’t need a massive budget to create an outdoor area infused with your personality and taste. Whether you like the relaxed Scandi vibe with its casual blues palette or are aiming to be right on trend with up to the minute rich tropical mixes, we’ve got it covered. A great starting point is to choose outdoor furniture that is built to last, such as Marks \u0026amp Spencer’s new Porto furniture range. These durable sofas, chairs, stools and loungers are made with powder-coated metal frames to withstand the worst of the British weather and are finished with stylish wooden armrests and contemporary grey cushions. They provide the perfect neutral backdrop for you to add pops of colour to, such as these bright teal leaf-patterned outdoor cushions made from a water-resistant fabric that will withstand the occasional rain shower, or water fight. If you want to make a more bold colour statement, opt for furniture such as these bright yellow Lois garden armchairs, which will brighten a dull corner of any garden, or how about a raspberry coloured parasol, such as M\u0026ampS’s Shanghai parasol, which has UPF50+ protection from UV rays to ensure you can lounge without adding lines to your face. “Don’t be too heavy-handed with lots of contrasting blocks of colour though,” says London-based stylist Katie Cordell. “Carefully layering tones, with the odd bright zesty pop, will create a more harmonious space.” Once you have your furniture sorted, it’s time to add decorative detailing. Choose a mix of flowering and evergreen plants and shrubs to soften the space and add fragrant colour. Tall plants, such as bamboo, can be used to create a natural screen for your seating area, or you can use trellises with climbing plants such as honeysuckle or jasmine to provide shade and define the area. Choose pots and planters that match your cushions, such as this teal planter in the Lois collection, or opt for neutral greys, blacks and browns. If you find too many pots untidy, then you can build deep planters using railway sleepers or reclaimed bricks to give your outdoor living area a more walled-in feel. To extend the use of the space well into the evening you might want to add the Madeira fire pit, which has a mosaic border for a hint of the Mediterranean. You can then use lamps and lanterns to create ambient outdoor lighting, such as this quirky glass butterfly lantern, which takes a tea light, or this large wooden hurricane lantern, which will take a full-size candle. Consider buying candles that contain citronella to keep the bugs away. “Hanging small lanterns in shrubs or trees will create a magical, fairytale scene,” advises Cordell. Even with the fire pit lit, you might still want to provide some blankets for your guests to wrap themselves in if the night is chilly. These lightweight herringbone throws come in a variety of colours and can be draped over knees or wrapped around poncho style. Whether you opt for picnic-style cold nibbles, a classic barbecue feast, or sausages on sticks cooked on the fire, you will need some outdoor dinnerware to create a cheerful spread. M\u0026ampS’s rainbow picnic range is made out of clear plastic with a multi-coloured tint and even comes with a matching drinks dispenser that you can fill with punch or homemade lemonade. Alternatively go for bold and playful prints, such as these bamboo and melamine jungle dinner plates, which depict bright exotic scenes to make you feel as if you have travelled farther than your own back yard. “Or bring the jungle inside and mount these plates on the wall,” says Cordell. “They would make a fabulous addition to a child’s bedroom – all you need are some simple plate hangers to attach them with.” And, of course, not everyone has the luxury of having their own outdoor space, but there are plenty of other ways you can bring a hint of a garden into your home. You could plant some herbs in a window box to create a minute kitchen garden on your window sill, or buy some colourful geraniums to provide a potted, fragrant table display. If you don’t feel you’ve got green fingers, or don’t want the hassle of looking after living plants, you can opt for faux ones. Gone are the days when fake plants looked, well, fake. These days artificial plants are very convincing and can be a great solution for a room that doesn’t get much light, such as a north-facing bedroom or a hallway. This floor-standing artificial tropical plant is a real statement piece that would require heat and humidity were it real, but will merrily suffer draughts and drought in its artificial form. Consider contrasting plants that have soft, feathery leaves, such as ferns, with harsher, more angular plants, such as aloe. “A simple shelf filled with plants above your bed is an excellent way of bringing some greenery into your bedroom,” says Cordell. “These fake plants are ideal for a position where it’s harder to water.” Alternatively you can look to bring leaf prints into your soft furnishings, or even your wallpaper, to bring the mood-boosting power of plants into your home.

The Department of Health and Social Care said those in Formby with confirmed cases of the B.1.617 variant, which originated in India, have self-isolated and their contacts are being identified. The CDC also said fully vaccinated people will not need to physically distance in most places. The agency also hopes the guidance will prod more Americans to get vaccinated, Reuters reports. “Big news from the CDC: If you*re fully vaccinated, you do not need to wear a mask * indoors or outdoors, in most settings,” the White House tweeted with a picture that said: “Fully Vaccinated People CAN STOP Wearing Masks.”Tai, speaking to the House Ways and Means Committee, said she was committed to entering negotiations that take into account concerns from all sides, including drug companies, Reuters reports. “The WTO has not got a record of moving quickly, or getting to yes, across 164 members who must all agree, very often,” Tai said. “This is the opportunity for the WTO to show its relevance for mankind.” For a second day in a row, Tai heard criticism from Republican lawmakers that the intellectual property rights waiver will give critical biopharmaceutical technology to China, Russia and other strategic rivals while failing to increase vaccine supplies.Figures published on Thursday evening show there are 1,313 cases of the VOC-21APR-02 variant in the country, up from 520 the previous week, PA reports. Dr Susan Hopkins, COVID-19 Strategic Response Director at PHE, said: “Cases of this variant are rising in the community and we are continuously monitoring its spread and severity to ensure we take rapid public health action. “A full year without revenue has unfortunately made it impossible to continue operations,” said Stuart Kendrick, senior vice president, of the firm, which is owned by British transport operator FirstGroup.

The country reported 131 new deaths from Covid-19 on Thursday for an overall toll of 107,205, the eighth highest in the world.  The gliding seven-day average of new deaths fell further to 200, the lowest since Oct 26, from a 2021 high of 450 in early February.Baker, deputy chairman of the Covid Recovery Group of MPs, said:  Major tour operators, starting with TUI, which launches direct flights to popular destinations as of Friday, have predicted that Greece will be among this year’s tourist success stories.  Theoharis, who was given a grilling on BBC’s Hardtalk this week when it was put to him that Greece was not on the UK’s initial green list, elected to emphasise health protocols as he unveiled the plans this evening.  “In 2020 Greek tourism won a difficult bet. We opened and welcomed tourists safely,” he told reporters against a backdrop of the famous temple of Poseidon in Sounio. “The big bet of 2021 is to open with security.”  With its economy so dependent on tourism, Greece has championed the idea of vaccine certificates, first proposing ‘vaccine passports’ to fellow EU member states in January.  In a bid to lure overseas tourists, the country this week begun zealously immunising entire populations on larger islands with destinations such as Corfu, Rhodes, Crete and Zakynthos – perennial favourites among Britons – expected to be fully vaccinated by the end of June when, it is hoped, the first UK holidaymakers will fly in.  Some 32 smaller islands were part of a mass vaccination campaign earlier this year with officials seeking to brand them as the first ‘Covid-free destinations’. Greece has fared better than much of the rest of Europe registering 369,554 coronavirus cases to date and just over 11,000 Covid-19 deaths, although it has struggled to suppress a third wave of the pandemic.  Earlier today it was announced the Mediterranean nation had one of the continent’s highest vaccination rates with more than four million citizens having received at least one jab. The council has now said additional clinics will be opening to help offer more jabs to those eligible: The festival marks the end of Ramadan and typically starts with people attending mosque for morning prayers followed by family and friends getting together for a celebratory meal.

Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?EMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine (also known as Vaxzevria) was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout. This was revised to people aged over 50 on April 27th.\u0026nbspHow many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2–8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st .On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.On April 20th, the EMA\u0027s review of these issues found a possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, and agreed a warning should be included in the product information.\u0026nbspHowever, it concluded\u0026nbspthe overall benefits of the vaccine\u0026nbspin preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks of side effects, and so Janssen announced it would resume deliveries to the EU. In Ireland,\u0026nbspNiac recommended that the jab be used only for people over the age of 50.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses in total,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2–8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and reported positive results from these initial phase 1 and 2 trial in\u0026nbspApril 2021, while announcing it was entering\u0026nbspphase 3 trials on 4,000 people.On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?The HSE is currently vaccinating people in the top nine cohorts:\u0026nbsppeople aged 65\u0026nbspand older who live in long-term care facilities (cohort 1), frontline healthcare workers (cohort 2), people aged 70 and older (cohort 3), people aged 16 to 69 who are at very high or high risk (cohort 4 and 7) and those aged 50 to 69 (cohorts 5 and 9).\u0026nbspThe next groups to be offered a vaccine after this will be residents of long-term care facilities aged 16-64 (cohort 8), followed by people aged 64 years and younger, alongside people aged 64 and younger who are living or working in crowded settings.

Photograph: Alan Betson  The No further deaths of Covid-19 patients have been reported by the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet). This leaves at 4,937 the total number of deaths in the pandemic.Nphet also reported 456 confirmed cases of the disease, bringing to 254,450 the total number of cases in the Republic.About 250,000 doses were being administered this week, and next week up to 280,000 people will be immunised, he said.Of the new Covid cases reported on Thursday, 189 were in Dublin, 52 in Cork, 49 in Donegal, 39 in Kildare and 17 in Galway, with the remaining 110 cases spread across 20 other counties.The 14-day incidence of the disease now stands at 129 cases per 100,000 people nationally. Kildare has the highest county incidence, followed by Donegal. Sligo has the lowest incidence.The median age of cases is 27 years and 81 per cent are under 45.On Thursday morning, 111 Covid-19 patients were hospitalised, of which 36 were in ICU. There were 11 additional hospitalisations in the previous 24 hours.As of Tuesday, 1,922,913 doses of vaccine had been administered: 1,408,105 first doses and 514,808 second doses.Chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan said: “Our key objective remains to follow the public health advice in our daily activities as we continue to chart our way through this pandemic.\u0026nbsp“I would encourage people who have been vaccinated, to safely resume your lives, mindful of the guidelines. For those awaiting vaccination, the many choices we make to stick with the public health advice will keep ourselves and our loved ones safe.”Vaccination rolloutMr Reid said there there was “joy and confidence emerging” from vaccination centres as the rollout continues.One in seven adults are now fully vaccinated while 37 per cent have received one dose.“It feels like we’re all feeling better, which is better for the health services,” Mr Reid told the HSE’s weekly Covid-19 briefing.“We’re 2-0 up and it feels like we’re winning,” he said, “but many a good lead was lost in the second half of the game.”So far, 96 per cent of those aged 85 and over have received a dose. Among 80-84 year-olds, 99 per cent have been vaccinated.Earlier, Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly described Tánaiste Leo Varadkar’s comments on the rate of rollout by June as “very ambitious”.Mr Varadkar, according to sources present, told Wednesday’s Fine Gael parliamentary party meeting that everyone who wants a Covid-19 vaccine appointment could be offered one by the end of June. His expectation was based on a view that around 15 per cent of the population would not seek a jab.Asked about the report on Thursday, Mr Donnelly said he hoped the Government could “deliver on that”.“If the vaccines that have been ordered are delivered on time then by June four out of every five people who were entitled to the vaccine will have been vaccinated. The latest analysis of figures was that everyone would have been vaccinated by September,” he told Newstalk’s Pat Kenny programme.The Government has set a target of offering or administering a vaccine to 82 per cent of the population by the end of June. As of Monday, some 35.2 per cent (1.37 million) of people aged over 16 had received a first shot, with more than 506,000 people having received both.Incidence ratesWednesday’s figures showed that Donegal, which had the highest incidence of the disease in the State for some time, had been overtaken by Kildare as the county with the highest number of new cases per capita.Mr Donnelly said the response from local communities in Donegal had been “strong” and that indicators suggested the rate of infection would continue to fall there.He also paid tribute to all members of the Oireachtas for their response to the pandemic. Although there were some who were “hedging their bets”, he said he appreciated the support of colleagues from across the political spectrum.He also defended his position on antigen testing and denied that he was supporting the sale of them while dismissing their efficacy. He said rapid testing had a role to play in emerging from Covid-19 restrictions.“I’m not saying they are useless,” he said of the tests, the sale of which in supermarkets has been criticised by some Nphet members.However, Mr Donnelly pointed out that while there was a danger that people with a negative result would think they were not infectious, if the test results were positive then antigen testing could prevent super spreader events.The HSE added the B1.617.2 variant to the list of variants of concern VoCs this week and has issued new guidance in relation to it and the three others.A variant of concern is one that is more transmissible, more lethal or that could evade the immune response.The Indian variant has been spreading rapidly in the UK, where cases are doubling weekly from a low base. Up to last week, 20 cases had been identified in Ireland.UK estimates suggest the variant is at least as transmissible as B.1.1.7, the UK variant that was 70 per cent more transmissible than previous variants and quickly became dominant in Ireland after Christmas.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"how do opposition party policies on housing stack up","story":"When it comes to the rental market, almost all of the Opposition parties were united last year in calls for rent freezes.  Photograph: iStockEradicating vulture funds. Freezing rents. Thousands of affordable homes costing under €230,000 in Dublin. Each of the Opposition parties have made eye-catching promises about how they would solve the housing crisis if they were in Government. Are these policies credible or doable? The  went through the main pledges with a number of experts and academics.Affordable and social housingSinn Féin’s success in last year’s general election can partially be attributed to its strong stance on addressing the housing crisis.On affordable and social housing, the party has promised to significantly increase capital investment in public housing to “deliver the largest social and affordable housing programme in the history of the State”.This would involve delivering 20,000 public homes each year, prioritising the use of public land. Is this feasible? Sinn Féin has been considering the impact of the pandemic on the targets it set during the election last year. Housing spokesman Eoin Ó Broin says the figure of 20,000 may not be reached in the first year but whatever is lost initially would be made up in subsequent years.Under their plans, affordable rents would be set at prices of between €700 and €900 per month in Dublin and lower elsewhere. Affordable purchases would be set at prices of €230,000 or less in Dublin and lower elsewhere. Eligibility for affordable housing would be set at a gross income of €55,000 for a single person and €85,000 for a couple and would be reviewed annually. Public housing would be delivered by local authorities, approved housing bodies and community housing trusts.Experts who spoke to The  said that while the policies are ambitious, there are many pitfalls and potential problems.They can be summarised as follows:All of these complex problems present major stumbling blocks to the plans, they say.The issue of the overall costings for the Sinn Féin plan was also raised a number of times.Sinn Féin has promised an additional €6.5 billion for the construction of these 100,000 homes.Half of those homes are already budgeted for under the National Development Plan. Sinn Féin also propose to add another 10,000 social homes to this lot and then a further 40,000 affordable homes, split evenly between affordable sale and rental, from that pot of cash.The party says the cost to the exchequer for the 20,000 affordable sale homes will be €40,000 per unit.These figures are based on calculations from sites such as the Ó Cualann development in Ballymun, Dublin. In an example such as this, a site is provided by the State, for a low and nominal cost. It is often also serviced, meaning connected to utilities, at no cost to the builder although there is a cost to the exchequer. Development levies are also waived.Multiple housing experts raised concerns about the feasibility of replicating this across the country. Some say developments like Ó Cualann may not be scalable nationally because it is not a given that the site can or will be provided on the same terms and at the same density. The “waived” fees still effectively have to be paid for by the taxpayer, they say.The remaining 20,000 homes, the affordable rental homes, could be built for €236,000 on average under information used by the party. Taken in the round and including inflation the total plan comes to just under €6.5 billion but experts have said given the number of pitfalls and complexities already outlined, sticking within budget could be a tall order indeed.There is another aspect of the party’s policy that rankles with those who keep a keen eye on the market. Sinn Féin says that when it comes to buying a €230,000 affordable home, it will be a leasehold, not freehold. So you might own the property but the council owns the land and will have a say over the future sale of the property.The question has been posed: why would a family buy a house knowing that they could never sell or rent it on the private market?“You own the house. You renovate it, extend it, amend it, pass it to your kids. They pass it to their kids. But the land on which the house rests is not your property. It is not just the first purchaser than gets the affordability, every subsequent purchaser gets it. Some people say that is not real home ownership. What I say is who else is offering you a home in Dublin for €230,000?” Ó Broin asks.RentalWhen it comes to the rental market, almost all of the Opposition parties were united last year in calls for rent freezes. Labour also favoured a scheme which would count rent payments towards deposits for houses which was proposed by Labour. Experts believe the latter proposal should be doable.Academics and housing policy wonks differ on whether any move for across the board rent freezes would be constitutional. Many agree, however, that linking rents to inflation and providing increased security of tenure could provide an adequate middle ground.‘Cuckoo’ fundsThe big issue of the month has been the existence of so-called “cuckoo funds”. Sinn Féin has said it would remove tax exemptions ued by investment funds. “They would have to pay capital gains tax. We’d also increase their stamp duty,” Ó’Broin said. Labour has also said it believes a targeted increase to the stamp duty rate would act as a deterrent once the rate increase was big enough. Industry sources are sceptical and say the rate would have to be quite high and going beyond a certain level could potentially leave the State in a legally tricky position.Some experts point towards a 2019 Department of Finance study which states that “at a local level there have been instances of investors purchasing large blocks of stock, removing some of those units from the owner-occupier segment of the market.However, at a national level, or in terms of the broader Dublin market, the advantages of institutional investment are manifold, broad-based and beginning to yield positive outcomes for the Irish housing system.” Minister for Housing Darragh O’Brien is expected to bring proposals to this end next week.Other promisesThe People Before Profit housing policy says that housing should be treated as a universal public service the same as health and education. They would abolish the income threshold limits to “make public housing available to more people on a broad range of incomes with rents set at a percentage of take home pay”. Experts say the ultimate problem with such a system would be the cost attached to it with higher taxes being necessary across society. That, they say, is a whole other debate."},{"url":null,"title":"d%C3%A1il hears call to safeguard our great fish of the sun","story":"The basking shark is known in Irish as liamhán mór Gréine. File photograph: Getty Up to 20 per cent of the global population of the world’s second largest fish, the basking shark, come to Irish waters annually and should be a protected species, the Dáil has heard.Social Democrats TD Jennifer Whitmore said basking sharks are endangered, are at very high risk of extinction in the wild and should be afforded “the same protections we afford our whales and dolphins”. They have been a protected species in UK waters since 1998 but despite their endangered status they are not a protected species under Irish national marine or conservation legislation, she said.“The Government must list this species as protected and encourage its protection to the fullest extent possible.”Ms Whitmore, a marine biologist, was speaking as she introduced her first piece of legislation, the Wildlife (Amendment) Bill. The legislation amends the Wildlife Act to include the basking shark on the schedule of animals it is illegal to injure, disturb or harass.The basking shark is known in Irish as liamhán mór gréine – the great fish of the sun. “We have a deep cultural connection to this animal and it is often a symbol of our indigenous maritime life.”Numerous threatsThe Wicklow TD said that the basking shark “continues to face a number of key threats, including boat strikes, harassment by recreational boat users and habitat alteration due to development of large-scale infrastructure”.They were first classified as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s red list in 2018. They had previously been classified as vulnerable but they are now endangered, said Ms Whitmore.She pointed out that of the eight known coastal surface “hot spots” for the shark in the northeast Atlantic, five are located off Cork, Kerry, Clare, Mayo and Donegal. She described her Bill as a “simple legislative change but it could be a matter of life and death for basking sharks. We need to treasure our natural heritage, our bioersity and our own iconic species, and afford basking sharks the same protections that other countries afford them.”"},{"url":null,"title":"david cameron defends lobbying ministers on behalf of finance company","story":"Former British prime minister David Cameron:  told MPs  the company paid him more than his salary as prime minister for a part-time role and that he also owned shares in the business. Photograph: Tolga AkmenGetty ImagesFormer British prime minister David Cameron has denied that greed motivated him to lobby ministers in Boris Johnson’s government on behalf of failed finance firm Grensill Capital. Under questioning by MPs, Mr Cameron said the company paid him more than his salary as prime minister for a part-time role and that he also owned shares in the business but he declined to say how much he earned for his lobbying.“It was the greatest honour of my life to be prime minister of this country. When my service as prime minister came to an end, I wanted to build a new career based on a mix of charitable and pro-bono work for causes that I care about, like dementia and international development, and business interests in areas of cutting-edge technology. I believe that an ex-prime minister should be able to do that and I thought carefully about the choices I made, and took extensive advice,” he said.During the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic last year, Mr Cameron sent a barrage of text messages to ministers and senior officials on behalf of the supply chain finance firm. More formal channelsHe admitted that he should have used more formal channels of communications but denied breaking any rules and he said he was not aware that the company was failing when he was pressing the government to give it access to coronavirus support programmes.“I thought very carefully before picking up the telephone and I thought the circumstances warranted it because they were unique,” he said.“I really believed in the solution that we had and thought it would make a difference. That was my motivation. My motivation for contacting ministers and others, was to help UK firms at this moment of difficulty and to ensure that fintech firms and Greensill in particular, were listened to as well as the major clearing banks.”He said that financial schemes to support businesses were being devised quickly at the start of the pandemic and he wanted to present Greensill’s proposal for how its supply chain financing could get funds to businesses more easily.‘Had a good idea’“It was a particularly acute time in the British economy,” he said. “The government was introducing plans to try and help businesses, we thought we had a good idea,” he said.“I was keen to get it in front of government but, as I said, there are lessons to learn and lessons for me to learn. In future the single formal email or formal letter would be appropriate. Obviously what’s happened is deeply regrettable and being part of a company that goes into administration is depressing, but never mind me, for the people who lost their jobs they had whole futures invested in this company being their future and it’s incredibly depressing to see it go wrong.”Labour MP Angela Eagle said the former prime minister’s frenetic texting of ministers and officials, who ultimately rejected the Greensill proposal, came across more like stalking than lobbying.“Are you at least a little bit embarrassed by the way you behaved?” she asked.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"washington appears as steadfast as ever in support of israel","story":"US president Joe Biden: Said on Thursday that he did not think there had been an overreaction by Israel towards the Palestinians. Photograph: TJ KirkpatrickThe New York TimesWhen Joe Biden assumed the US presidency in January he indicated that his first priority would be domestic concerns, primarily the coronavirus pandemic and its economic consequences. Foreign policy, it seemed, would have to wait.But the moment may have come. While Biden’s decision last month to wind down US troop presence in Afghanistan by September marked the first big foreign policy decision of his tenure, the resurgence of violence in the Middle East has catapulted the simmering region back to the centre of the global agenda. The United Nation has warned of the threat of “all-out war”.Biden showed no signs that he planned to prioritise the Israeli-Palestinian conflict before or after the presidential election. He pointedly delayed phoning Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu for several weeks after his inauguration, a decision that was seen by some as a snub, but also an indication that the region was not high on his agenda.Further, Netanyahu was a strong ally of Biden’s predecessor Donald Trump, and the Israeli leader was strongly opposed to the Biden administration’s efforts to restart the Iran nuclear deal.But the outbreak of violence has thrust the Israeli-Palestinian conflict centre stage. As the conflict escalated Biden faced criticism for not reaching out to Netanyahu or Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas earlier in the week.A phone call between Biden and Netanyahu finally took place on Wednesday evening. Secretary of state Antony Blinken spoke to Abbas shortly after. The US has despatched a special envoy to the region, deputy assistant secretary of state Hady Amr. No US ambassador to Israel (like most countries in the world) has yet been named, complicating US efforts to engage in the region.Two-state solutionWhile Biden officials – unlike the Trump administration – have again this week underlined their support for a two-state solution, supporters of Palestinian rights may be dismayed that the language coming from Washington has not strayed far from the traditional US stance. \u0026nbspBiden underlined his belief in Israel’s right to defend itself “when you have thousands of rockets flying into your territory” following his discussion with Netanyahu. Similarly, an official read-out from the White House after the call emphasised Israel’s “legitimate right” to defend its people, while making scant reference to the Palestinians, though it noted engagement by the US with neighbouring countries like Jordan and Egypt.Biden said on Thursday that he did not think there had been an overreaction by Israel towards the Palestinians.While the state department last week said it was “deeply concerned” about the potential eviction of Palestinian families in Sheikh Jarrah and Silwan neighbourhoods of Jerusalem, its language has hardened this week.Blinken, while conceding that the Palestinians “have the right to safety and security” on Wednesday, emphasised the Israeli perspective. He said there is “a very clear and absolute distinction between a terrorist organisation, Hamas, that is indiscriminately raining down rockets, in fact targeting civilians, and Israel’s response, defending itself.”The comments were welcomed by the American Jewish Committee on Thursday, which tweeted: “Thank you Secretary Blinken for standing with Israel and making a clear distinction between Hamas’s terror attacks and Israel’s fundamental right to defend itself.”Discontent on leftBut while the pro-Israeli stance of the US across the political spectrum appears as steadfast as ever, there are some murmurings of discontent from the left of the Democratic Party. Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez rebuked Biden for his statement on Israel for failing to acknowledge the rights of Palestinians. “This is not neutral language. It takes a side – the side of occupation,” she said.While there is a small but growing number of Democrats willing to challenge the pro-Israel orthodoxy of Washington politics, it is unclear how much this will weigh on Biden’s decision-making.The president has shown no signs that he intends to reverse Trump’s decision to move the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, making it one of the few countries to do so. Though Biden pledged during the election campaign to reopen the Palestine Liberation Organisation’s office in Washington, this has not yet happened.At the UN Security Council, US ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield is leading efforts to rein in UN condemnation of Israel and blocked the council from issuing a statement this week, putting Ireland and US on opposite sides of the debate.Following his phone call with Netanyahu, Biden expressed optimism that the conflict may de-escalate. “My expectation and hope is that this will be closing down sooner than later,” he said.The US president may be hoping that one of the most intractable problems in international affairs may fade from view as he focuses his presidency on other matters. This, however, could be wishful thinking.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons may 2021","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2020 by clicking here or call 0844 871 1514. To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178David Cameron refuses to disclose \u0026#39generous\u0026#39 amount he was paid by Greensill CapitalEvery patient to have right to see a GP as NHS abandons \u0026#39total triage\u0026#39Comment: Squirming David Cameron appeared to be a shorn Samson under questioning Five million EU citizens apply for UK settled status – nearly double what was predicted pre-BrexitOnline fraud up 70 per cent during Covid pandemicBoris Johnson under fire over failure to close borders to India soonerGlasgow to accelerate vaccine rollout to 18-39 year olds in bid to control Covid case surgeIndian variant ‘will get everywhere’ as cases double for second week in a rowRecord number of victims pulling out of prosecutions after losing faith in criminal justice systemNew anti-spying laws turn spotlight on academics ‘working for the enemy’Patient stories: ‘GP said I might be blocked up.

There is concern about a possible flu epidemic since the historically low rates of the disease over the past 12 months make vaccines harder to adapt.A perfectly legitimate case can be made for not having this type of inquiry at all but since Mr Johnson would have been hounded until he agreed, it was pointless to resist. However, it will last for years, whereas the lessons from the pandemic need to be learned now. Many of them are already apparent. The World Health Organisation’s panel of independent experts and senior political figures, which has reported within just a few months, set out just a few of them yesterday.We know all of this without the need for a public inquiry. As to the actions of the British Government, several parliamentary committees have taken extensive evidence from senior Government advisers and Sage scientists while auditors have looked into the speed, cost and propriety of the procurement process. Again, what has been learned must be taken on board now and not await the outcome of a public inquiry. We may have to deal with another epidemic before it reports.The inquiry chairman has yet to be appointed and the terms of reference are still to be announced. The former is likely to be a judge and the latter must range more widely than public health matters. A sterile argument over whether the country should have locked down a week or two before it did will help no one, but is likely to be the conclusion sought by Mr Johnson’s opponents.Given what has happened, it is evident that the strategy for dealing with a pandemic was flawed and the shortcomings need to be put right now. But what was not planned for at all was the impact of the lockdowns. No government had ever contemplated such action and everything – from the unprecedented restrictions on personal freedoms to the massive cost of underpinning the economy – had to be made up on the

certain neighbour might have made of the steamy goings-on taking place a short carriage ride away from Windsor Castle.But it looks as if we’ll never know.Plans to film future series of the Regency drama Bridgerton in Windsor Great Park are about to be scuppered by the local planning authority, after an outcry from councillors and residents.The plans would have entailed the construction of a set for future series of the Netflix drama in the park, allowing producers to chronicle the amorous intrigues of the Bridgerton and Featherington families.Under the proposals, the site would have seen the building of a Regency neighbourhood on the southwestern edge of the park, with a 120m by 120m central square, a Mayfair street (including the grand homes of some of the main protagonists), a modiste, tea house and a back alleyway.Plans submitted to Windsor and Maidenhead Council included 165 parking spaces, with up to 150 people on-site at a time over the next five years.Producers of the hit show said the film set would boost the local economy, with cast and crew using hotels and restaurants in nearby Windsor and Ascot and local suppliers providing their services.However, the prospect of spotting stars such as Regé-Jean Page, Polly Walker and Phoebe Dynevor at close quarters wasn’t enough to persuade locals of the plans’ merits.Sunninghill and Ascot parish council, which received several letters of objection from nearby residents, has already said the set would be damaging to the environment, stating: “The applicant has significantly underestimated the harm the development and its accesses will do to the green belt, bioersity and users of the popular footpaths affected by the proposals.“We are concerned that if permission is granted the site will be used as a filming facility for many years thereafter.Windsor Great Park has provided the backdrop to films such as Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Bridget Jones’s Baby, and Goodbye Christopher Robin in recent years, but the proposed permanence of the set upset locals.One resident said: “Access to the site will bring a great many vehicles onto what is currently a beautiful and peaceful area of land, used by a lot of walkers.“The proposed site will have an awful building because the film set will create the image of a town within, but the exterior view will have clutter and scaffolding.”Now the proposals are set to be rejected by Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead’s planning panel next Wednesday.A report by the council’s own planning officials, who recommend the set should be refused permission, describes the development as “inappropriate” and resulting in “loss of openness to the Green Belt”.It adds: “The proposal would detract from the rural character and appearance of the area and be detrimental to the recreational value of the public footpath.“Insufficient information has been submitted to demonstrate that protected species andor their habitats would not be adversely affected by the proposal.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our

millions of coronavirus ridden ‘zombie mink’ to make electricity on Thursday.17 million of the farmed critters were culled to prevent the spread of the coronavirus in November last year after 12 people were infected by a mutated strain, which passed from humans to mink and back to humans.The bodies were tipped into trenches and buried in two metres of soil but, in a gruesome twist that saw them dubbed \u0027zombie mink\u0027, hundreds began resurfacing as gas from their decomposition pushed them out of their mass graves.30 tonnes of  the exhumed, rotting beasts were shovelled into the furnaces at the Måbjergværket waste incinerator in Holstebro on Thursday. The animals were mixed with the household waste that is usually burnt for energy at the plant. “It smells of household waste, as usual,” said Niels Ulrik Nielsen, the chairman of the plant.   A further 30 tonnes from a six month old mass grave of two million mink will arrive on Friday at the incinerator for test cremations in stoves that reach temperatures of 1,100 degrees. If tests are successful, Måbjergværket could buy 1,000 tonnes of zombie mink for its in 13 incinerators around Denmark. It is hoped all the zombie mink, which were farmed for fur, could be dug up and burnt by mid-July.“We did not know in advance what problems the mink would cause but they are part of the operation now here. They must become heat for Mr. and Mrs. Jensen and electricity for the grid”, Mr Nielsen told Danish media. Jes Simonsen, a crane driver at the plant for the last 13 years, told local TV, “It is always exciting when something new happens. I do not fear it.”He added that household waste often included bones and dead animals and that the principle was the same with the gruesome arrival of thousands of decomposing mink. Residents close to the mink mass graves, which are guarded to keep scavenging animals and people away, are concerned about the health risks from the apparently undead animals. Food and Agriculture Minister Morgens Jensen was forced to resign in November after it emerged the culling order was illegal. His replacement supported the plan to burn the corpses for electricity. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"israel military draws plan ground invasion gaza","story":"Israel faces a war on two fronts as the military draws up plans to invade Gaza while the prime minister warned there was no greater threat to internal security than the waves of Arab and Jewish riots which have rapidly spread across the country.The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) said it had deployed two infantry units and one armoured unit to the border with Gaza, and its military chief of staff was assessing ground operation plans last night.We are gathering forces on the Gaza border, preparing them. They are studying the field and we will use them when we decide to,” an Israeli military spokesman said. “The initiative is ours and time is on our side.The final decision on whether to invade Gaza is up to the Israeli government, rather than the military, and carries major political implications as it would substantially increase the risk of far more Israeli casualties.As Israel continued to bombard Hamas targets in Gaza on Thursday, the Palestinian death toll rose to 87, including 17 children, while in Israel seven people have died including a five-year-old boy.The IDF has already attacked hundreds of targets and we will soon pass 1,000. We are continuing to strike Hamas while defending our citizens, said Benjamin Netanuahu, the Israeli prime minister, as he inspected an Iron Dome missile defence system on Thursday. It will take time but with great decisiveness, both defensively and offensively, we will achieve our goal – to restore quiet to the State of Israel.Separately, Reuven Rivlin, the Israeli president, strongly condemned rioting by both Arab and Jewish extremists nationwide which has led to at least 400 arrests, comparing the situation to a civil war.One attack in Bat Yam that was broadcast live by Israeli TV crews showed a Jewish mob dragging a man, whom they believed to be Palestinian, out of his car before severely beating him.“We’re watching a lynching in real time,” a TV reporter says off-camera in the footage.In the northern city of Tamra, a Jewish man was attacked by an Arab mob who nearly torched his car while he was still inside. Israeli paramedics said he was also stabbed but has survived the ordeal.  Further attacks are spreading throughout the country, including Haifa and Acre in the north, as well as Lod, Jaffa, and Tiberias.Death to Arabs was being chanted at several rallies overnight while in Jerusalem an Arab man was stabbed outside the famous Mahane Yehuda market on the western side of the city.Mr Netanyahu was reportedly considered the deployment of troops in cities hit by the unrest, and vowed on Thursday to grant police new powers to detain suspected rioters without charge for an extended period.We have no bigger threat now than these pogroms, and we have no choice but to restore law and order via determined use of force, he said. Nothing can justify an Arab mob assaulting Jews, and nothing can justify a Jewish mob assaulting Arabs.The rioting in Israel has become so serious that there are concerns it could end up eclipsing the conflict in Gaza.An Israeli police chief on Wednesday compared the unrest in Lod in central Israel to Arab riots that preceded the Second Intifada, a mass Palestinian uprising.On Thursday it also emerged that the United States has increased security at its embassy in Jerusalem, where a major police presence was on the streets including armed and mounted officers.  Throughout the day, air raid sirens sounded across Israel, including in Tel Aviv where Ben Gurion airport was closed and flights erted.One rocket, fired by Hamas from the Gaza strip, nearly landed in the holiday resort of Eilat, Israel\u0027s largest southern town. British Airways cancelled its flights to and from Tel Aviv on Thursday, the latest international carrier to avoid flying to Israel.The safety and security of our colleagues and customers is always our top priority, and we continue to monitor the situation closely, British Airways said.United Airlines, Delta Air Lines and American Airlines on Wednesday all cancelled flights between the United States and Tel Aviv. Lufthansa follows on Thursday.Incoming flights from Ben Gurion International Airport have been erted to the Ramon airfield in the country\u0027s far south, Israel\u0027s Transportation Ministry said. The airfield was designed to serve as a wartime alternative to its main international gateway outside Tel Aviv.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day catnaps eid al fitr 600 year old tapestry","story":"A lion rests at Nsinga Waterhole in Greater Kruger National Park. Photographic guide, Moosa Varachia, was on hand to capture the melancholy moment and said the lion may have been sad at the prospect of leaving his pride.

Senior judges have given Natalia Potanina, his ex-wife, the green light to pursue the 60-year-old through the English courts – despite the fact the Russian courts orced them seven years ago.If her financial claim is successful, the orce payout will be the most lucrative in British legal history and worth up to £10 billion.The  understands that Mrs Potanina is seeking half her ex-husband’s fortune, estimated by Forbes magazine at just under £20 billion, making Mr Portanin the world’s 55th richest man and, according to reports, the wealthiest documented billionaire in Russia.Mrs Potanina, 59, was awarded in the region of £30 million by a Russian orce court in 2014 but the Court of Appeal, sitting in London, ruled that she is entitled to bring a new claim here.“Everything is, however, relative. The wife\u0027s settlement represented only a tiny proportion of the vast wealth of this family, all of which had been accumulated during this very long marriage.”She said that since Mrs Potanina was still in her 50s at the time, then “arguably the sum she received would nowhere near meet her long-term needs when considered by reference to the lifestyle to which she had long been accustomed”.Mrs Potanina, who made London her permanent home in 2017, could be in line for a payout of as much as £10 billion if she wins the orce battle.That sum would easily dwarf the previous English record for a orce settlement of £453 million that another Russian billionaire, Farkhad Akhmedov, was ordered to pay his ex-wife. The world’s biggest payout is the $38 billion that Jeff Bezos reportedly paid to his ex-wife MacKenzie.The court heard that Mr Potanin and Mrs Potanina were childhood sweethearts who met as teenagers and married in their homeland in 1983 when both were in their early 20s. The couple, who have three children together, began married life impoverished but, in her ruling, Lady Justice King noted that Mr Potanin “accumulated vast wealth” in the 1990s at the fall of communism.Mr Potanin, according to Forbes, is worth just under £20 billion having made his fortune acquiring a stake in Norilsk Nickel, the world’s largest producer of refined nickel, during Russia’s privatisation in 1995. He currently owns a little over a third of the company, according to Forbes, as well as other assets. Mr Portanin reportedly owns three luxury yachts and spent $10 million on his daughter’s wedding in the south of France. He is described as an “ice hockey buddy” of President Putin.The Potanins’ long marriage faltered with Mr Potanin claiming the couple separated in 2007 although Mrs Potanina insists they did not split up until 2013, by which time “unbeknown to her”, Mr Potanin had a child with another woman – now his second wife. Mrs Potanina said her husband’s announcement that the marriage was over was a “devastating bolt out of the blue” and led to a Russian orce in 2014 and a further “blizzard of litigation”.In the English stage of their long-running court battle, Mr Potanin had won the first round by blocking his ex-wife\u0027s attempt to bring a case against him in London in November 2019, when a High Court judge ruled that her claim was an example of orce tourism.But, in Thursday’s ruling, the Court of Appeal cleared the way for Mrs Potanina to bring what could be the highest-value orce case in English legal history.Lady Justice King ruled the decision to prevent Mrs Potanina from making an application for financial relief in England should be overturned, saying: The matter will therefore proceed to trial.The judge added: The fact that the appeal has been allowed and that the wife may therefore proceed to make an application... for financial relief should not be taken by either party as an expression by this court of any view as to the merits or otherwise of that application.Mrs Potanina previously argued she was the victim of a grave injustice and was not given a fair share of the marital wealth because of her ex-husband\u0027s wealth, power and influence in Russia.Her lawyers told the Court of Appeal in January that Russian courts deal with orce settlements by equally iding the parties\u0027 assets, but do not share any assets owned through trusts or other corporate vehicles.This meant Mrs Potanina\u0027s attempts to get half of the assets ultimately owned by her ex-husband have been fruitless, the Court of Appeal said.In the court\u0027s ruling, Lady Justice King – sitting with Lords Justice David Richards and Moyland – said the High Court wrongly overturned a previous decision allowing Mrs Potanina to bring a claim for financial relief in the English courts.Lady Justice King concluded: In the event that the parties cannot reach some sort of compromise in this long-running and expensive litigation, the case will be determined with the benefit of oral and, I anticipate, expert evidence by a High Court judge in due course.The legal battle pits the two doyennes of orce lawyers against each other. Baroness Shackleton, who represented Sir Paul McCartney, is acting for Mr Potanin while Frances Hughes, who has spearheaded a number of groundbreaking orce cases, has been hired by Mrs Potanina.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"channel 4 sell under consideration","story":"NewsChannel  sell off under consideration within this Parliament, says Culture SecretaryOliver Dowden said there was a case for considering the best future operating model for the publicly owned broadcaster, which is largely commercially self fundedmirrorShareCommentsByLizzy BuchanPolitical Correspondent:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY News \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get US and UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said a decision on whether to privatise the broadcaster could be taken within this parliament. Channel  was launched in  as a publicly owned, largely commercially self-funded public service broadcaster.Mr Dowden told MPs yesterday that the rapid expansions of streaming services like Netflix and Disney+ meant ministers needed to look again at its future.“I think there is a case for considering the best future operating model for Channel ,” he told the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee.  “That will be one of the things we would consider in legislation in the next session. “We would also look at video on demand and whether there are further reforms that need to be taking place there.” Asked whether they were looking at the privatisation of Channel , he replied: “That is one of the options that is under consideration, yes.” Channel  has been contacted for comment. Mr Dowden also suggested that the Government could step in to help struggling festivalsthey cannot get commercial insurance. He told the committee that his focus was on reaching June  - the final stage of the roadmap- when remaining Covid restrictions could be lted.  If festivals cannot go ahead after that point then the Government could step in he said. Mr Dowden told MPs: “Once we get to that point,it is the case that events still can’t go ahead because of a lack of insurance and the failure of the commercial insurance market, we stand ready to look atwe can use Government intervention in exactly the same way we did with the film industry.” He added: “It has to be the case first that we know can something go ahead. If the final barrier to stop that happening is the lack of commercial insurance, that is the point in which we would contemplate acting.” But Tory MP Heather Wheeler said it was “too late” for many festivals, adding: “I just feel we’ve lost probably another summer because they can’t get insurance.” Meanwhile, Mr Dowden also confirmed that talks on hosting the Champions League final in England had stalled because UEFA wanted to bring , people for the match.  He said the Government was unable to give an assurance to UEFA we would be willing to y our quarantine rules in the way they wanted to happen. They wanted to bring a large number of people to the match, thataposs fine, itaposs the issue about quarantine, he said.

And he said he didnapost know why he signed off his texts Love DC - but admitted he did so with anyone he knew even at all well. The former Prime Minister was grilled by a Commons committee about his lobbying of ministers on behalf of the now-collapsed financial firm. He admitted: I was paid a generous amount - far more than I was paid as PM. And I had shares - not share options, but shares in the business which vested over the period of time of my contract. So itaposs important for the committee to know that I absolutely had a big economic investment in Greensill. I wanted it to succeed. I wanted it to grow. I havenapost put a number on those things, because ...the amount isnapost particularly germaine to these questions and is a private matter. But the ex-PM insisted his motivation for calls and texts to ministers asking for help on behalf of the firm was not just financial, but because he thought the firm had solutions that were in the interests of the public good.  Asked why he signed off some texts to officials with love DC - the ex-PM said: Anyone I know even at all well I tend to sign off with text messages aposlove DCapos, I don’t know why, I just do. My children say you don’t need to sign off text messages at all. Mr Cameron said he said abided by the rules that were in place, but added: Rules alone are never enough. We learnt that in this place over so many issues, personal conduct and codes of behaviour, and how such conduct and behaviour both appears and can be perceived, these things matter too. I completely accept that former prime ministers are in a dferent position to others because of the office that we held and the influence that continues to bring. We need to think dferently and act dferently. He said lobbying the Government was never intended to be part of his role at Greensill Capital until the coronavirus crisis.In his opening statement to the Commons Treasury Committee, he said: In terms of my role, I was not employed at Greensill as a lobbyist and lobbying the UK Government was never intended to be part of my role. However, in the economic turmoil caused by Covid, the Government, quite rightly, introduced several schemes to help ensure that credit would continue to be expanded to business.

The case for an independent examination of how ministers, scientists and the NHS responded to the biggest public health ­emergency for a century was incontrovertible. We need to know why Britain ended up having one of the highest death tolls in the world, why the NHS was not prepared for such a crisis, why it took so long to provide PPE. Those who have lost loved ones to the virus are rightly furious the Prime Minister has delayed this inquiry until the spring of . If there is, as Mr Johnson has suggested, a strong likelihood of a winter surge then we should have at least an interim investigation now so lessons can be learned which may help prevent further deaths. What is your view  Have your say in the comment section  By deferring the inquiry for a year the Prime Minister has clearly calculated the findings will not be published until after the next election. Not for the first time he’s putting his personal interests before those of the country. Fears of war There are concerns the violence in Jerusalem and Gaza could escalate into war. The Israeli military has responded to rocket attacks by Palestinian militants by unleashing a wave of air strikes.  Brokering a ceasefire is imperative and urgentwe are to prevent the loss of more civilian lives and stop the situation descending into a conflict which risks engulfing other parts of the Middle East. The international community must exert whatever influence it has on the Israeli and Palestinian leaders. Then work must once again begin trying to find a lasting settlement based on the two-state solution. Pay a flat fee  Despite earning £, a year it appears Boris Johnson has trouble paying some of his bills on time.

Kash Mahmood, , was described as audacious, corrupt and criminal after confiscating hundreds of thousands of pounds from traffickers during fake stops. Sentencing him at Southwark Crown Court on Thursday Judge David Tomlinson said Mahmood abused his position of power, trust and responsibility. Mahmood remained impassive as he was led to the cells in blue shirt and black facemask. Judge Tomlinson said he would have known he was putting iniduals in danger by leaving those he stole from vulnerable to reprisals from their underworld bosses.Got a story  Email webnews@mirror. Addressing the former PC and his co-defendants, the judge said: “aposIt must have been plain to all of you that these couriers were being put in harmaposs way.” Mahmood was allegedly tipped off about who to target by the Dubai based mastermind of the organised crime group who was using an encrypted EncroChat phone. Mujtaba Neazmand, an Afghani national, left the UK in  after being made the subject of a proceeds of crime order and is believed to be there now.  Detectives would not be drawn on whether he is wanted in the UK. Hundreds of top and middle level organised crime figures have been arrested after the EncroChat phone network was hacked by European law enforcement last year. The court heard how Mahmood had become the first in his family to go to university, after avoiding the pull of criminal gangs while growing up in east London.  He had been stabbed as a teenager for refusing to get involved in crime, his barrister Bill Emlyn Jones said. But after ten years as a successful officer with five commendations his “background caught up with him”, the court heard. Mr Emlyn Jones said: “He thought he had escaped it, but it pulled him back in.”  Mahmood jetted off to Dubai where he was pictured with his co-defendants and splashed out on a £, Rolex watch. The court heard he was a longtime associate of gangster twins Shabaz Khan, , and Shazad Khan, , and their brother Moshin Khan, . He misused police computers to check what intelligence was held about the brothers and Neazmand.

He was kicked out of the Met last year after a disciplinary  found he had driven a police car while his associate posed as a police officer to seize cash which was due to be laundered or was payment for drugs. Mohsin Khan was sentenced to  years for conspiracy to supply class A drugs, conspiracy to transfer criminal property and conspiracy to acquire criminal property.  Shabaz Khan was jailed for  years for conspiracy to supply class A drugs, conspiracy to transfer criminal property, conspiracy to acquire criminal property and possession of a controlled drug of class B with intent to supply. Shazad Khan was sentenced to  years and five years and four months in jail respectively for conspiracy to supply class A drugs, conspiracy to transfer criminal property and conspiracy to acquire criminal property. Ioan Gherghel, who dressed as an officer while accompanying his friend Mahmood on the raids, was jailed six years for conspiracy to acquire criminal property. Moshin Khanaposs ex-partner Maria Shah, , admitted supplying class A drugs and conspiracy to acquire criminal property and was sentenced to five years and four months. Scotland Yardaposs Deputy Assistant Commissioner Bas Javid, Directorate of Professionalism, said: “Mahmood may have been a police constable in name, but he was nothing more than a criminal who abused his position to look after the interests of organised crime.” Steve Noonan, of the Independent Office of Police Conduct, said: “This officer’s behaviour was audacious, corrupt and criminal. His actions were a complete betrayal of public trust and confidence and have no place in policing.”FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnMohsin KhanScotland YardCourt caseCrown courtPolice carCrimeTeenagersTwinsKne crime"},{"url":null,"title":"four areas india covid variant","story":"NewsFour areas where Indian Covid iant is now dominant with delay to lockdown end fearedOfficial figures set to be released on Thursday are expected to confirm a worrying threefold increase in infections of the highly transmissible coronavirus mutationmirrorShareCommentsByWilliam WalkerNews Reporter:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video chris-whitty-says-indian-covid-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:kSqXYiA,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

Boris Johnson has warned the B. strain, which is currently ravaging parts of India, is of increasing concern in Britain.Official figures set to be released on Thursday are expected to confirm a worrying three fold increase in infections of the highly transmissible mutation. Experts advising the Government believe the final stage of Boris Johnsonaposs road map out of lockdown - set for June  - could now be pushed back. And it is believed that there will be an emergency meeting of the Governmentaposs SAGE advisers tomorrow to discuss the iant. Surge testing has been introduced in areas such as Bolton, Greater Manchester to help stem the spread of cases.  The Mail Online reports analysis by one of the UKaposs iant trackers has warned the strain is focused on hotspots in Bolton and nearby Blackburn with Darwen.There outbreaks are said to have grown by  and  per cent in a week, respectively, and more than half of cases found to be the Indian strain. It is also reported to be behind half of Covid infections in London, Bedford and South Northamptonshire, but these outbreaks are still small.Citing data from the Wellcome Sanger Institute The Sun reports that Bolton is the UKaposs epicentre with  positive Covid tests caused by the Indian strain up to April , representing  per cent of Covid cases in seven days. Nearby Blackburn with Darwen reportedly saw  cases identied, representing . per cent of the areaaposs total. In South Northamptonshire nearly  per cent of cases were the India iant while Bedford saw . per cent, representing  cases.Members of the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencies will assess the threat at a meeting today, reports i news. A member of the committee told the publication that “a delay is possible” for lockdown easing in England.  Asked about a possible delay to the June  easing, Tory minister James Cleverly told Sky News: “Scientists on SAGE will make assessments, they will report that to government, and we will make decisions based on the data, the evidence they provide. “The Prime Minister and the Health Secretary have always been clear that the easing of restrictions which allows us to get back to normality will be done at a pace and in a way that is safe. “We will always be driven by the data.” With so much changing so quickly, keep on top of what is happening with the Mirroraposs news updates by email.

Louise Birchley had been taking a nice relaxing bath at home when her little girl, Ellie, came in with a dark glow on her hands and face. The -year-old mum quickly realised that the youngster must have been playing with her fake tan and hurried out of the bath to wash it off before it had a chance to develop further. Louise said: I was just in the bath when Ellie shouted to me and asked to use my moisturiser. I said yes because she asks to borrow it regularly, so I didnapost think anything of it. The next thing I know, she walks into the bathroom and her face and hands were dark brown.  I was in shock when I first looked at her. I was like aposoh my godapos and jumped out of the bath to try and wash it off as quickly as possible before it started to develop. It was a new bottle of tan that I had bought that day. I hadnapost used it before, so I had no idea what the outcome was going to be, however, the bottle said aposdark tan. lasts for daysapos so I had a feeling I wasnapost going to be able to get it off her easily. After trying to wipe off as much of the tan as possible, Louise knew it would be a case of waking up in the morning to see how tanned Ellie would be.  Unfortunately, the next day the youngster’s skin was an orangey colour, and Louise said she resembled Bart Simpson. When I woke up the next day and saw her orange face, I couldnapost believe it. It almost looked like she had jaundice,” she said. She also had a really dark patch on her chin which she obviously hadnapost rubbed in hard enough. And as she had just applied in with her hands, they were just as orange as her face. I was actually thinking about tanning the rest of her body to give her an even colour, rather than her face just being tanned, but I decided against it and hope it would quickly fade. Ellie claims she didnapost know she was using fake tan, but she definitely knew what she was doing. She is such a girly girl and loves everything about hair, makeup and tanning.  She has seen me putting fake tan on myself, so she probably wanted to experiment with it. Louise says that Ellie seemed pleased with herself and the results of her tanning session until she went to school and people kept telling her she looked tanned. When she woke up I think she actually was quite chuffed with the job sheaposd done. Although her older sister, Mia, nine, was so embarrassed that she refused to hold her hand and walk into school with her.

Kamran Khan was racing his RS at more than mph over the limit when he collided with another car, which smashed into a church. More than a dozen people were injured in the terrying incident in Leeds in , including five children. Khan, , was arrested and pleaded guilty to two counts of causing serious injury by dangerous driving. He was jailed for three years during a sentencing hearing at Leeds crown court earlier this month. Got a story  Email webnews@mirror.  The court was told that Khan was driving his powerful vehicle - capable of speeds of up to mph - in wet conditions on a busy road. He then lost control and collided at speed with a Peugeot , which smashed into a Universal Church of the Kingdom of God. This vehicle hit several people, including a baby in a pram - which was trapped between the car and a wall. Most of the injuries were minor but one woman suffered a serious injury to the foot, the court was told.

PC Steve Harrison, of West Yorkshire Policeaposs Roads Policing Unit, spoke after the hearing. He said: While sentencing him, Judge Mairs repeatedly talked about Khan’s flagrant disregard for traffic laws. On that rainy day back in September , Khan chose to drive over twice the speed limit and caused a crash which injured multiple adults and children. It is sheer luck that only two people were seriously injured and that the consequences were not even more serious. The court were told Khan had a previous conviction for a drug driving offence and had cannabis in his system at the time of this collision. Khan has been jailed for his actions and I hope this sends a clear message of the dangers and consequences of driving at excessive speeds whilst under the influence of drugs.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnPeugeotWest Yorkshire PoliceCCTVCCTV footageCourt caseCrown courtPrison sentenceDriving banDangerous driving"},{"url":null,"title":"i caught hubby searching gay","story":"NewsopinionI caught hubby searching for gay men online - what sort of man uses a women to hide A reader asks agony aunt Coleen Nolan what to do about her marriage after being shocked by what she saw on her husbands phone - something which made her feel usedmirrorShareCommentsByColeen Nolan:,  MAY NewsopinionConcerned readers husband was searching for gay men online\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

I could really do with some advice on what to do.Coleen saysWell, you can’t unsee it or forget about it, so the only way forward is to tell your husband what you saw and ask him for an explanation. He needs to answer all your questions honestly and talk about where you go from here.  He might have been confused about his sexuality for a long time or it might be something that’s more recent. The only way to know is to ask him. Of course you feel betrayed and that your relationship has been built on a lie – it’s completely natural in the circumstances – which is why it’s important to talk to him to get the full picture.

Belinda Rose, , took in the baby fox after it was brought into her vets and mistaken for an abandoned puppy. Belinda took him home to nurse him back to health and now keeps him in her downstairs bathroom which she has covered in tree branches and leaves. The fox - who she has not named so she doesn’t get attached - was so small it weighed g but after five weeks in Belinda’s home, in Newmarket, Suffolk, he has grown to .kg and has become more fox-like. What is your view  Have your say in the comment section  Belinda has now given the fox cub to a rescue centre - which has other baby foxes for them to continue to recuperate before they are let back into the wild. Belinda, a vet, said: “He was so tiny when I got him. His eyes were closed and he was just a ball of fur so he did look like a puppy. “Every day he has grown and he loves to still snuggle up for a cuddle.  “I’ve had to resist naming him so I don’t get too attached and want to keep him.” Belinda was on a night sht when the cub was brought into her vets. She realised it wasn’t a puppy as initially thought, but in fact a tiny abandoned baby fox and gave it powdered milk.  Realising it needed proper care, Belinda brought the fox to her home and made it comfortable in her downstairs bathroom. “I covered it in leaves and trees,” she said. The baby fox soon started to grow and now eats a diet of meat and dog biscuits.  “He is adorable,” Belinda said. “But he has always had an attitude. “Once I lost him for seven hours and he had crawled behind a bathroom .  “When I found him he came straight for a cuddle.” He is now lapping up milk and eating for himself and gets on well with Belinda’s rescue poodle, Arthur. “They snuggle up next to each other all the time,” she said.

But for locals enjoying the sunshine in front of the huge Covid information sign in the town hall square, testing simply isn’t going far enough to tackle the new surge in cases making Bolton one of the country’s virus hotspots. Residents here want the whole town vaccinated - and fast - to prevent another local lockdown like they had last year when most of the rest of the country saw restrictions begin to lt. The infection rate in the town was the second highest in the UK at . cases per , people last week and cases of the Indian iant have risen dramatically in the area. This and the fact infections are also increasing in the under s in the town has led to both Greater Manchester’s mayor Andy Burnham and Bolton North East MP Mark Logan to call for vaccinations for all over s. What is your view  Have your say in the comment section  Shopkeeper Mohsin Nazir, , saw his business shut during lockdown and urged everyone to get vaccinated. He said: “I’ve just heard about this new iant that has come from India or somewhere. I think they need to be vaccinating everyone now. I’ve had my vaccine. We just want to get back to some sort of normal le, no more lockdowns, everyone working again.” Carol and Peter Marsden have both been vaccinated but are still very worried about the surge in cases in Bolton.  Retired cook Carol, , says: “They definitely need to start vaccinating the younger people. It is the younger people we see not wearing masks and ignoring social distancing. If people refuse the vaccine they should have to stay at home.” The sudden rise in infections in Bolton is believed to be driven by the B... strain of the virus, often called the Indian iant. It is thought to have been brought into the town by people travelling back and forth from India and Pakistan. There is also a spike in London while an outbreak is Glasgow is also thought to be linked to the iant. With so much changing so quickly, keep on top of what is happening with the Mirroraposs news updates by email. Delivered straight to your inbox, our daily coronavirus briefing will keep you informed of what is happening with Covid, lockdown, the vaccination rollout and the impact on how we live.here.Just days before the next lting of lockdown in England is due to take place on Monday, PM Boris Johnson admitted on Thursday he was “anxious” about the new strain.Speaking at a primary school in Ferryhill, Co Durham, the Prime Minister said: “It is a iant of concern, we are anxious about it. At the moment there is a very wide range of scientic opinion about what could happen. “We want to make sure we take all the prudential, cautious steps now that we could take, so there are meetings going on today to consider exactly what we need to do. “There is a range of things we could do, we are ruling nothing out.”  Askedlocal lockdowns were possible, Mr Johnson insisted: “We want to make sure we grip it.” He added: “Obviously there’s surge testing, there’s surge tracing. If we have to do other things, then of course the public would want us to rule nothing out.” But he was confident a spike would not derail Monday’s latest planned unlocking, with Step Three of the Government’s “roadmap” due to be triggered – allowing households to mix indoors, and pubs, restaurants and cafes to serve customers inside.Government scientists were expected to meet on Thursday to discuss the rising coronavirus threat from the Indian iant in Britain. Some members of Scientic Advisory Group for Emergenciesare believed to be pushing for a delay to the final stage of Boris Johnson’s roadmap out of lockdown set for June . Leading expert Prof James Naismith, of Oxford University, said the iant may spread “way beyond” the local areas where it has been detected. “I think we should view it as a country-wide problem,” he said. “It will get everywhere. We keep learning this lesson, but we know that this will be the case.”  Prof Naismith said he did not believe local restrictions would work to contain the iant, adding: “When we tried locally having dferent restrictions in dferent regions that didn’t really make any dference. “So I don’t think thinking about a localised strategy for containment will really work.” The prospect of a potential future local lockdown is the last thing the people of Bolton want resident Carol adds. “I will be annoyedthey lock us older ones down again when we have stuck by the rules.” Her husband Peter agrees. The retired sheet metal worker, , said: “I heard that people travelled from India. But surely they should have been isolating I don’t understand why international travel hasn’t been banned - this new iant has to have come from somewhere.  “Also I think public transport is a problem in Bolton. When you get on the bus there are a lot of people not wearing masks. The drivers don’t seem to be enforcing it. The older people do, but the younger ones aren’t.” Fishmonger Lee Morris, , who works on Bolton Market, added: “I’m very worried about it - rates in Bolton are now among the highest in the country.I’ve had the vaccine and I feel more confident now that I’ve had it because I work with the public every day. “I think rates in Bolton are high because young people aren’t sticking to the rules - socialising, parties. I do think they should offer younger people the vaccine but that only worksthey take it.I think people are dodging it because they are scared of it. “If they lock us down again I will be devastated. It will have a massive impact on the market.” Students Reia Raichura and Jamiee Patel disagreed that young people were to blame for the spread of the virus - but also had quite dfering views on what to do to stop it.  Jaimee, , had Covid herself last November and lost her grandma to the virus. She has had both vaccines and believes that all young people should be offered it. She said: “I was quite ill and my grandma passed away. I had to isolate for four weeks to see her in her last days. I think everyone should be offered the vaccine now as well as antibody tests.” Her friend Reia Raichura though is still worried about the vaccine - even though cases are rising at their sixth form college. Reia, , said: “We have been sticking to the rules. But I feel it is getting out of hand now. I think they need to think about closing the schools and colleges as well. There have been people testing positive and having to isolate at our sixth form. “I’m still not sure about the vaccine though.” Yesterday the Office for National Statistics announced that seven in ten people in England now test positive for Covid- antibodies, suggesting either vaccination or prior infection. The number was closer to six in ten for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The European Medicines Agency said on Wednesday that it was “pretty confident” that vaccines currently in use will be effective against the Indian iant. Prof Steven Riley, of Imperial College London, who runs the UK’s biggest Covid- surveillance study, said there was no indication that the iant was increasing hospitalisations. He said: “I think there’s two key things that have got to be kind of evaluated -infections go up, how quickly will they go up  But then after that, are they linked to the hospitalisations  “The top-line Government policy is driven by protecting the NHS, so eveninfection starts to go up, we then need to assess whether that’s bringing a lot of new cases into hospitals, and there’s certainly no sign of that at the moment.” The B... iant is now claiming around , lives a day in India where vaccination rates are much lower.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnPoliticsCoronavirusMutant Coronavirus"},{"url":null,"title":"kate middleton channels diana polka","story":"NewsKate Middleton channels Diana in polka dot as she laughs with William on royal visitThe Duchess was joined by her husband for a series of events to mark Mental Health Awareness week, wearing an outfit that could be a touching nod to the mother-in-law she never metmirrorShareCommentsByClaire Gilbody-DickersonNews reporter:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video duke-duchess-cambridge-mark-mental-,customFields:,clearance:Site Only,source:eadbdebcffcffeafc,sourceUrl:royal pool,site:Mirror,brandSafety: Sport and specialist news – passed for ad targeting,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:vGKPDmr,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

Their first stop on Thursday was at The Way Wolverhampton Youth Zone, an organisation that provides sports, arts and recreation activities for youngsters every night of the week.  After visiting the Youth Zone, the royal couple moved on to visit Base, a charity that supports young people who have dficulties in accessing mainstream services.

The move comes hours after the first Glaswegians blocked the van this morning in protests which saw a man placing himself under an immigration enforcement vehicle.Riot police arrived at the scene this afternoon where crowds chanting leave our neighbours, let them go blocked the van from leaving. Shortly after pm Police Scotland announced that Chief Superintendent Mark Sutherland had ordered the men, detained by UK Immigration Enforcement, to be released back into the community. The crowd roared and cheered as the men were let out of the van, with the person at the front bowing forward in a prayerful thanks.A Police Scotland spokesman said: Around .am this morning, police were called to an address in Kenmure Street, Pollokshields, following a protest by a large group of people.  Mohammad As, director of the Afghan Human Rights Foundation, was one of what he said were hundreds of neighbours protesting against the action on Thursday, when Muslims across the world are celebrating Eid. The -year-old said: Weaposre here against the hostile environment created by the Tories and the British state. The same people who run from the British and American bombs put at the back of the van right now. And they are about to be deported. And itaposs on Eid you know... the guys are not even allowed to pray. How do you do that in a democratic society  Itaposs a sad day.  Mr As, who left Afghanistan as a refugee himself in , said the atmosphere amongst the protesters is peaceful.Sabir Zazai, chief executive of the Scottish Refugee Council, wrote on Twitter : Not close to the details on this but this is shocking, disgraceful and racistpeople are raided by enforcement officers amidst the pandemic on the day of Eid.Wafa Shaheen, head of services at the charity, said she was shaken and angry at the Home Officeaposs decision to force people from their homes on the first day of Eid, and she condemned the heavy-handed approach. Tom, a neighbour who joined the protest, compared the immigration operation on Eid to a police raid on Christmas Day.  The solidarity shown today shows the community will not stand for their neighbours being dragged from their homes, the -year-old, who did not want to give his surname, told PA. Iaposd ask Christians to reflect on what it would feel like to have your house raided on Christmas Day. Lotte, an artist and member of the Scottish tenants union Living Rent, lives on a street nearby. She said she joined the protest when she saw a small group outside the property on Kenmure Street at am on Thursday. Iaposd like to express my utter disgust at the brutal removal of my neighbours from their home, the -year-old said. It is an awful thing to do on any day, but today being Eid makes it  times worse. I hope they will let our neighbours go.  Scotlandaposs First Minister Nicola Sturgeon accused the Home Office of creating a dangerous and unacceptable situation with the action. Ms Sturgeon, who was sworn in on Thursday as MSP for Glasgow Southside, tweeted: As constituency MSP, I am deeply concerned by this action by the Home Office, especially today in the heart of a community celebrating Eid.  My office is making urgent enquiries and stands ready to offer any necessary assistance to those detained. Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said he was disgusted by the Home Office raids. He tweeted: It is particularly unacceptable that this is happening during a pandemic, in an area that has a spike in cases and on the day of Eid. A Home Office spokesperson said: “The UK Government is tackling illegal immigration and the harm it causes, often to the most vulnerable people by removing those with no right to be in the UK. “The operation in Glasgow was conducted in relation to suspected immigration offences and the two Indian nationals complied with officers at all times“The UK Government continues to tackle illegal migration in all its forms and our New Plan for Immigration will speed up the removal of those who have entered the UK illegally.”FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnAnas SarwarNicola SturgeonMohammad AsLabour PartyHome Office"},{"url":null,"title":"mirror newspaper tablet offer promotion","story":"NewsGet The Mirror free on tablet for two months*Its packed with breaking news, sport and entertainment - and is perfect during lockdownmirrorShareByDave MastersDigital Commercial Editor:,  APR Updated:,  APR News\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

OSSA said: “Her right to be Princess of Wales flies out the window when her brother gets the official title of Prince of Wales because a royal lady can only be a princessshe’s married to a prince or the daughter of a prince. “As George’s sister, Charlotte doesn’t fit either category.” Charlotte could become Princess Royal when William is king. The Princess Royal title comes with a lot of responsibilities and strict rules to abide by, especially when it comes to dating. Under ancient British law, anyone who sleeps with the Princess Royal before getting married to her is guilty of treason, which was once punishable by execution, royal expert Duncan Larcombe has explained in the past. He reckons it is most likely that dad William will bestow Charlotte with the Princess Royal title once she marries. Mr Larcombe previously told Town and Country: The title of Princess Royal is traditionally bestowed on the eldest daughter of the monarch. Princess Anne had to wait until  before her mother the queen bestowed the title of Princess Royal on her, even though the title had been vacant since .FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnPrincess CharlottePrince Charles, Prince of WalesPrince WilliamRoyal FamilyThe Queen"},{"url":null,"title":"pub goers hysterics after womans","story":"NewsPub-goers in hysterics after womans attempt to sneak into beer garden goes wrongThe woman flings herself over the pubs railing but the waist of her jeans becomes caught on the metalwork and she hangs upside down as witnesses chuckle into their drinksmirrorShareCommentsBySophie NorrisLorraine King:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video pub-punter-gets-stuck-upside-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:IAlJ,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

Pub-goers were left in hysterics after witnessing the embarrassing mishap as they enjoyed their drinks at The Hope and Anchor in Royton, Greater Manchester. Stunned onlooker Nicole Meadows was enjoying a drink at her local on Friday evening when she spotted the daring duo attempting to land a vacant bench. In the hilarious clip, one of the women attempts to step over the fence but appears to get her foot stuck and is trying to disentangle herself from that while her pal decided to e over herself. The second woman flings herself over the railing but the waist of her jeans becomes caught on the metalwork, flipping her the wrong way up and leaving her suspended upside down for more than  seconds.  As -year-old Nicole and other witnesses cackle in the background, the unknown woman is finally helped back over the fence by a stranger who comes to help. Once freed from her predicament, the woman announces aposIaposve hurt my vaginaapos to entertained customers before askingshe can have a seatshe walks around to the proper entrance. Nicole, from Middleton, Greater Manchester, said: It was hilarious. Iaposve never seen anything like that before. It was highly amusing. Everybody was laughing. Theyaposd closed the doors because the pub was full, but there were still a couple of empty benches outside.  The girls were trying to climb over the fence to sit at one of the benches and get served. The doors were closed and there was a sign outside saying they were at full capacity on a blackboard. But itaposs an open beer garden and you can see [the seating]. The first girl managed to get over, but the second one didnapost.  The care worker had been with her mum Vicky Meadows when the chaotic scene caught the attention of the entire beer garden, who all watched on in amusement. In her clip, Nicole can be heard laughing hysterically as the two unknown women became stuck in the awkward positions. Nicole said: Everyoneaposs going wild because everythingaposs reopened. Itaposs got a really big beer garden. Somebody sat at the back of the pub [got up to] try and help her over. [After the incident] she just accepted the fact they werenapost allowed in and tried going somewhere .  I think she wrapped her legs around it to try and save herself from smashing her face open. Margaret Newton, landlady of The Hope and Anchor, said she asked the two women to come back another time and was glad they didnapost come to any harm. Margaret said: The door was shut, she tried to get in and she wasnapost served. Thataposs the only thing I can say. I told her to come back later on when it might have died down, but she didnapost do. I havenapost seen her since. I did ask her to come back. I said aposwe are full love. Iaposm not serving youapos. Iaposm just glad she didnapost hurt herself. Itaposs a light-hearted story. I have no problems. They do tend to climb over the fence. If they climb over the fence, the rule is they donapost get served. Iaposll just be glad when we can get back to normal. Weaposll be able to welcome people back in and save all this hassle.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnPubs"},{"url":null,"title":"queens tribute philip touching choice","story":"NewsQueens tribute to Philip with touching choice of dress for State Opening of ParliamentRoyal fans noticed the Queens outfit choice for the State Opening of Parliament held a special signicance and tribute to the Duke of EdinburghmirrorShareCommentsByDanya BazaraaSenior News Reporter:,  MAY NewsThe Queen delivering the Queens Speech \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

On Tuesday, Her Majesty outlined promises from the Government as she carried out her first major public ceremonial duty since the death of her husband. Fans noticed her outfit choice held a special signicance and tribute to the Duke of Edinburgh.A tweet from a royal fan pointed out: The Queen is wearing the same dress she wore on the photograph released for Prince Philip ’s th birthday.For the Queenaposs Speech, the Queen wore a long blue coat with a matching dress adorned with yellow flowers, and a coordinating blue hat, by Angela Kelly.  It was the same dress the Queen wore in a portrait of her and the Duke of Edinburgh on his th and final birthday. For the first time in  years, the consortaposs throne that is usually placed next to the monarch for the event was absent, following the sad death of Prince Philip last month. Instead Prince Charles followed his late fatheraposs example to take his motheraposs hand and provide support during the formal event.  But it meant that much like Philipaposs funeral, the Queen was pictured alone in a striking reminder of her sad loss. The ceremony did not have all of the pomp and circumstance of a normal State Opening, with no horse-drawn carriages or page boys. Much of its pageantry was missing because of Covid restrictions still in place despite the easing of lockdown measures in England.  The Queen set out the Governmentaposs post-pandemic agenda outlining a raft of new laws the PM hopes will help him fulfil his promise to tackle inequality and level up the country. It included promises to receive more tailored and preventative care through the NHS, to provide measures to tackle obesity and mental health and to bring proposals on social reform forward. She also said proposals will be brought forward to create and support jobs, to support a letime skills guarantee and to help businesses drive economic growth.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnState Opening of ParliamentThe QueenPrince Philip, Duke of EdinburghRoyal FamilyPolitics"},{"url":null,"title":"twenty month old baby girl","story":"NewsTwenty-month-old baby girl hit by car towing caravan died in tragic campsite accidentThe toddler, who has not been named, was pronounced dead at the scene after she was hit by the vehicle on Wednesday.

Hannah Hall bought a s-era home in Nottingham with her mum and began fitting out the interior with a decor from another era, such as patterned wallpaper, old appliances and vintage furniture. The kitchen includes black and white tiled flooring, a whistle kettle, exposed wooden beams and an open pantry, and where thereaposs a working rotary phone and a stunning oak wardrobe.aposVintage-obsessedapos Hannah originally bought a working s gas cooker on eBay and has slowly given the home a makeover to match the theme, saying her interest in the wartime period was sparked when her grandparents introduced her to the fashion, film and TV of the time. Her grandparents gave her some of the furniture which now features in the home, and Hannah says - despite owning a TV - she plans to continue to strip back the home instead of turning to modern technology. Hannah said: Iaposve always been interested in vintage things and I get told that Iaposm an old head on young shoulders. When me and my mum moved into the house, it was totally dferent to what it is now and we wanted to unearth its potential. Itaposs my mumaposs first buy because sheaposs always rented homes, so I wanted to make it extra special. The theme really started to take off when we did the kitchen in a s style and we loved it so much that we decided we really wanted to go with that theme throughout the house.  The kitchenaposs finishing touch was the beautul s gas cooker - it works an absolute dream and has inspired us to live a little simpler. The house is kind of like an ode to my grandpa, who was born in . He was a signicant part of my le and really got me interested in the s era as a kid - I was enamoured by his droplets of wisdom. My nanaposs taste in vintage and eccentric fashion has also inspired me to dress quirky. I feel like my home is an adoption centre for vintage things. I absolutely love it but I know itaposs not to everyoneaposs taste because itaposs a massive niche.  After the kitchen was redone, we went a bit mad and just started collecting dferent items such as a -year-old tin opener, vintage wallpaper and old paintings. The gas cooker in the kitchen definitely comes in handythe electricity goes out on our street because weaposre still able to cook dinner. Itaposs not what you expect when you come in and every single room has vintage touches. Our family thinks the house is really quirky and is like a little time capsule. Everyone loves coming over and kicking it a little old school for a bit.  Hannah says when they bought the home from an old family friend everywhere was rather beige and needed an overhaul having lost its charm. The renovation work uncovered the original floorboards and staircase, which bought it back to le a bit.While continuing to add to her s home, Hannah posts videos of the project on her @Realvintagedollshouse TikTok account, saying: Vintage items have a bit more soul than modern things and I get a kick out of finding something that might have so much story behind it.Iaposm a big believer that we should honour the past and I donapost think younger people these days necessarily appreciate how dferent things used to be. Reminding people that it wasnapost always like this hopefully helps them appreciate how far weaposve come. Weaposre still working on the house every day and weaposre hoping to get a s-style front door and also transform the back garden, using my grandpaaposs old Raleigh bike as a flower feature.What do you think of the home  Let us know in the comments.

The woman is pregnant with her second child and had already decided on her favourite name ahead of the little oneaposs arrival. She had agreed to give the baby her motheraposs name as a middle name, but when the woman told her mum the first name, she scoffed, letting out a judgemental sigh. The soon-to-be mum was says she was offended by the reaction and as a result changed her mind on the middle name - leaving her mother furious at the decision. Taking to Reddit, the woman posted: I’m due any day with my second child and had my heart set on my babyaposs name.  The middle name is the same as my mother’s middle name and the first name is something I always liked and thought was cute. I’ve told my family this name before and that’s that. The other day, my mom had apparently forgotten what the first name was so I reminded her and she let out a judgmental aposughapos. I asked her what’s up and she said that she doesn’t like the name and thinks the kid will be made fun of for it. The name isn’t at all made up or even that unique. It’s a pretty average name. I got frustrated. Yesterday it came up again and she remembered that the middle name was gonna be the same as hers. But I told her I decided to change the middle name to something , since she wanted to be judgmental and negative about the first name. She started crying and got pretty upset. Said that I just did that to hurt her.  The woman shared the story on Reddit to seek advice, and added some background information on their relationship. She said the mother was aposextremely controllingapos, and that she never had a say on her le when she was growing up. As such, she moved out as soon as possible. The post continued: Although her reaction to her grandchild’s name may seem minor, I know her. She reacts like that because she wants a dferent name, or to have some sort of influence over the name. She uses her judgment as a way to try and control me and my decisions. That’s why I get so angry. The post garnered much discussion online, with most people agreeing that both the women were in the wrong. One user posted: Sounds like mom is an a**hole in general but in this specic situation Iaposm gonna have to say everybody sucks here because you were both hurtful to each other. That being said I understand what you did and I probably would have done the same. And another posted: Her reaction to the name was not only hurtful, but also calculated to pressure you to change the name into something she likes. That type of childish behaviour warrants a time-out, and you are right to reconsider the second name. I also would not want to honour someone who acts like that. They lost the privilege.What do you think of her decision  Let us know in the comments.

Sadly, many men didnapost heed this warning, and have been left believing that women actually peel the skin off their faces when theyaposre on their period. Well, the female body has done stranger things, it must be said.The bizarre and obviously extremely incorrect belief came from a TikTok video of model Dakota Fink peeling what we can only imagine is a face mask off her face.Throwback to when men didn’t know we had to peel off layers of our skin after our period, she wrote alongside the clip. Ah, those were the days.  The clip was quickly inundated with comments from other women who shared their ownexperiences of skin shedding during that time of the month. Youaposve really got to love the internet sometimes. This happened while I was applying makeup because I forgot and wasted so much foundation, one TikTok user commented, while another added: Someone has to slap me really hardfor it to peel off. If anyone wants to volunteer just holler. A third wrote: For those asking, itaposs supposed to start two to three years after your first period, usually one to three days out of your cycle. Letaposs normalise talking about it. Thank you so much for normalising this!! Women donapost need to be insecure about this, a fourth added. So it’s true… to every girl, woman, and non binaries that have periods. I’m so sorry y’all have to go through soo much, one extremely confused man commented. Another added: Iaposm a boy, and this is actually true !

Lindsay Grummett told of her work in a series of TikTok posts and noticed something startling which had not previously attracted her attention. On the same level as a  between stairs and the upstairs level with downstairs, she discovered a door seemingly without a . From what she could tell there was an upstairs bathroom on the other side, with no access to any other spaces in that area of the house. She could not resist finding out what was behind the door after being too scared to investigate while her boyfriend was away on a work trip.  She opened the door, which did not have a handle, and revealed boards of timber and a set of stairs that had been blocked off. On the other side of the door she described some very retro stickers She told Yahoo News: I have no idea whataposs back there. Let me knowyou think I should try to figure it out, she told people on the social media . More than seven million people have since viewed video which she called: My house may or may not have a secret passage... and probably a few ghosts.

to Dens Park on Saturday.Dundee#s biggest name player, Adam, turned up on the big night, with two trademark through balls cutting the home defence wide open.His precision, combined with the timing of McGhee’s running and cool finishing, saw the Dark Blues take a two-goal lead.More than setting up the goals, though, Adam was a leader in the middle of the park.Not only by talking his team-mates through the contest and taking charge when needed but by dishing out the verbals to the opposition players when the chance came too.Dundee’s captain hasn’t had the best few months, being out of the team for ious reasons.However, with promotion chances on the line, he’s the man for Dundee in the big moments.It’s only one game in a potential four but so far he’s delivering for his team.And boy did he deliver for the barnstorming runs of McGhee.Moving the defender into an all-action midfield role has worked an absolute treat for James McPake.In fact, Dundee have never lost a football match with McGhee in that role.A remarkable stat # but maybe not so remarkable when he puts in performances like Wednesday.He most certainly didn’t finish his chances like a defender.The first was anything but easy # but McGhee made it look simple.And when the goal was gaping in front of him in the second half, there was no fluffing of the lines.Along with Shaun Byrne anchoring the midfield, that’s where Dundee won this first leg.James McPake went for the ‘-it-ain’t-broke-don’t-fix-it’ approach to his tactics on the night.The last time the teams met, the Dark Blues came out on top.The Kirkcaldy side were far better this time around in possession early on but as the Dark Blues grew into the game, Raith shrank.Then Dundee’s quality told.Raith got most joy in the opening period down the flanks.Dan Armstrong certainly caused problems for left-back Cammy Kerr early onAfter fearing he’d be out for the season, the hope was first choice Jordan Marshall wouldin time for the play-off push.However, he managed just two training sessions prior to Wednesday night’s contest and was only fit enough to take a place on the bench.Kerr has been a more than able stand-in recently but he was up against something dferent this time around – for  minutes anyway.The first nutmeg was too heavy for Armstrong to catch but the winger pulled another off before the half-time whistle.Christie Elliott, an attacker throughout much of his career, can be caught out defensively too.Raith got a bit of joy in those areas in the first half but Dundee shut that door after the break.Their quality further up the pitch saw the Dark Blues take control of the scoreline.With it, the pressure was taken off the backline, with both Kerr and Christie subsequently playing a huge role in earning their clean sheet.Dundee most certainly have the tie in their hands ahead of the second leg at Dens Park on Saturday night.Raith, though, have shown all season they are too good a side to just go away.The first leg is in the bag for James McPake and his team – however, there can be no complacency despite their three-goal lead.There is still work to be done.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox

stocking up on whatever vice they need to relieve stress.Because this next few days are colossal ones for the future of their club.I’m no Dee but even I am glad I’ll have a laptop to hide behind when the play-off tension becomes unbearable.I can only see these two matches against Raith Rovers being cagey affairs.There will be plenty of the apocryphal hiding behind sofas and chewing of fingernails for Dark Blues unable to peel their eyes from the TV.They are very dficult games to call.And results between the teams this season only strengthens that argument – one draw and a win each.I’ve written about set-pieces, good and bad for Dundee, and I’d expect they could even be the dference come Saturday night.Four of Raith’s five goals against the Dark Blues have come, sometimes indirectly, from set-plays.While Dundee have the newly-crowned award king of Dens Park Lee Ashcroft powering in on every delivery.And his partner Liam Fontaine hasn’t been found wanting in the goals stakes either.Saying that, former Dee Kyle Benedictus has scored three goals this season, two of them against his old side.Play-off football is often about the slim margins. With that comes nerve-shredding tension and a desperate need from players not to be the one that messes things up at this late stage.That sort of pressure seems simple to talk about for us.For the players, it could be a moment that spoils – or indeed elevates – an entire year’s work.But that drama is why we love football.And the introduction of the play-offs a few years back injected much-needed le into our lower leagues.That’s for next week, though.A next week Dundee need to ensure they are still alive and kicking for.I’ve very much enjoyed the ‘pressure’ talk between the two managers, James McPake and John McGlynn trying to ramp things up on each other.There’s no doubt, though, that the Dark Blues are expected to get through.The question is now whether the Dundee squad has the characters to stand up in the face of that sort of expectation.From my personal viewpoint, they do – but the only way it can be proved is by winning this tie.Over the league season, Dundee showed they are a better team than Rovers by finishing above them.They have better, more experienced players.For a lot of the season, though, I’d say Raith had a better team. As in a collective unit working together.A big test for me will be how the Dark Blues begin the game after  days without a match.Whatever happens, it’s going to be a tense  minutes .Get prepared Dees.Dundee United’s season is over now, isn’t it I had big hopes they’d be able to rise to the occasion on Saturday.However, they didn’t really give themselves a foothold in the semi-final against Hibs.It was a performance that badly needed an inidual spark from somebody.But there hasn’t been a huge amount of that this season from the Tangerines.It’s been a decent campaign from Micky Mellon’s men, don’t get me wrong.However, attacking style and verve hasn’t been a word associated with them often.The quarter-final apart, I guess – and I don’t buy the ‘Aberdeen were awful’ story either.Yes, the opposition was poor but United most certainly weren’t.However, that day has only been a flash in the pan it seems.By the time I write my next column, their season will be over with games against Motherwell and St Mirren left tonight and Saturday.A weekend clash between the two beaten semi-finalists does not sound a cheery affair.What United need to do now, though, is look ahead to next season.Give some youngsters a chance in these two games to show they can be part of the squad next term.And try to finish off what has been a definite step in the right direction on a positive note.It’s always a shame to see players miss out on major tournaments through injury.Sadly it’s been a story Scotland fans haven’t had to put up with for a long, long time!Looks like Kenny McLean and Ryan Jack will miss the Euros.Disappointing for them but thankfully we are very well-stocked in quality central midfielders.Whether either of those would make Steve Clarke’s first XI is up for debate.What it does is open the door for the likes of Billy Gilmour and David Turnbull.Players like those two are the future of the team. LEE WILKIE: I wouldn#t be surprisedLee Ashcroft is Dundee#s main man again for the play-offs and disappointment after Dundee United#s lacklustre semi showing\" title\"#LEE WILKIE: I wouldn#t be surprisedLee Ashcroft is Dundee#s main man again for the play-offs and disappointment after Dundee United#s lacklustre semi showing# #

A magnicent diagonal pass picked out the run of McGhee and the midfielder side-footed his volley beyond the exposed Jamie MacDonald.Raith slowly recovered and built up a head of stead as the half-time whistle approached.And they thought they had hauled themselves back level in the nd minute only to be left cursing a mistaken offside flag.Rovers built up brilliantly down the left to buy Ross Matthews space. His cutback was swept into the six-yard box by Lewis Vaughan and Reghan Tumilty hammered in from close range.However, referee Nick Walsh cut short the celebrations.Raith would have harboured a sense of injustice as they came out for the second-half, but their task got even harder just nine minutes after the break.Again, Adam was the creator with another stunning pass from the centre of the pitch and once more it was McGhee who was the willing runner.The midfielder outstripped the Rovers rearguard and slid a composed finish beyond MacDonald.With Raith forced to desperately seek a way back into the tie, Dundee hit them with a sucker punch.Adams fed Max Anderson and he picked out the run of fellow substitute Sow, who fired high into the net.Fans will be back inside Dens Park NEXT WEEK #Dundee find a way past Raith Rovers\" title\"#Fans will be back inside Dens Park NEXT WEEK #Dundee find a way past Raith Rovers# #

after anger at the Conservative nominee for the job.A rapid meeting of the urgent business committee unanimously agreed Councillor Jenny Laing would become sole leader of the Tory, Labour and Independent Alliance administration.Councillor Ryan Houghton withdrew his candidacy for co-leader after outrage over historic online comments he made around a decade ago.However, he has been appointed convener of the powerful city growth and resources committee, which controls the Town House purse strings.And he remains the leader of the Aberdeen Conservative group.Unearthed in  during the general election campaign, the Conservative was suspended by the party for the comments regarding the Holocaust, Muslims and homosexuality.Having apologised, he was cleared and readmitted six months later following a QC-led investigation.The vacancy, which has not been filled, arose as Councillor Douglas Lumsden MSP gives up the job of co-leader and steps down as convener of the city growth and resources committee.The Conservative was elected to the Scottish Parliament on the list vote on Saturday.He plans to continue on as a councillor, splitting his time between the Town House and Holyrood, arguing a by-election would cost too much to hold to find a replacement for less than a year.Fellow councillors-turned-MSPs, the SNP#s Jackie Dunbar and Audrey Nicoll, are understood to be doing the same.Aberdeen Labour leader Mrs Laing has already served as council leader during the previous council session – when her group was the largest within the ruling coalition.She replaced now Lord Provost Barney Crockett as leader in , remaining in place until after the  election while the legal practicalities of installing co-leaders were ironed out.Mrs Laing said she was #delighted# with the unanimous agreement to the new allocation of the top positions and said she would focus on Aberdeen#s #social and economic recovery# from Covid-.“Councillor Houghton has made clear what his position was earlier in the week,# she added.#He felt that the speculation around his position was a distraction from focusing on that recovery, and therefore we have put forward the positions we have.“I look forward to working with colleagues inside the council and partners from outside the council to make sure we are delivering on that recovery agenda for the people of Aberdeen.#It’s vitally important we get that right over the next year.”With Mr Houghton heading up the resources committee, Mrs Laing has been appointed vice-convener.The Aberdeen Labour chief has given up her job as commissioning convener to be replaced by John Wheeler.Mr Wheeler had been operations and education convener, but has now been replaced by his deputies Philip Bell and Tauqeer Malik respectively.While the local authority now has a solely Labour leader, the Conservatives now oversee two of the three main financial levers of the council.The third, the capital committee, remains under the control of Marie Boulton, the leader of the Independent Alliance group within the political administration.Mrs Laing will remain convener of the urgent business committee and Mr Houghton will be vice-convenerThe Tory leader, who is retaining his £, council business manager salary, told us: #I am looking forward to working with my coalition colleagues on the regeneration of the city.#News Mr Houghton#s -strong group had given up the council leadership to Mrs Laing, one of nine Aberdeen Labour members was seized upon by opponents.SNP group leader Alex Nicoll, who voted for the new council structure at the meeting said afterwards: #The Tories in Aberdeen are clearly in turmoil given they have relinquished they spot of co-leader of the Council even though they remain the largest party within the Administration#s ruling coalition.##We have previously heard that Councillor Laing was the de facto leader of Aberdeen City Council and that has now been rubberstamped today # even though Aberdeen Labour were rejected by voters at the last council election with that being reaffirmed only last week with the electorate rejecting Labour once again at the Scottish Parliament elections.#Liberal Democrat councillor Martin Greig, who also voted for the new leadership structure, said: “It has clearly been dficult for the ruling coalition to find a satisfactory replacement that reflects the changed power relations from the Conservative, Labour and Independent side.#A solution has been found that gives the Conservatives more influence in council business infor not acting as co-leader.  The appointment of committee chairs is a matter for the coalition to agree. They have chosen to increase the prominence and role of the Conservative group in the work of the Council.#By working together the Conservatives, Labour and Independents are free to let Aberdeen Labour take this step backwards.#It is useful to see how their internal power struggles are working out.”He added: #The Conservatives are clearly in disarray.#The Labour leader has been able to take advantage by elbowing out a Conservative from the top job of co-leader.#For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/syndicatenews/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/05/WMX_120521_03-7_38941099-558x372.jpg ","title":"aberdeen woman who lost sight in freak accident given life transforming device","story":".dct-cta@-webkit-keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate@keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate.dct-cta__title.dct-cta__content p.dct-cta__content p:not.dct-cta__content p:last-child.dct-cta__label.dct-cta__input.dct-cta__input::-webkit-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::-moz-placeholder.dct-cta__input:-ms-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::placeholder.dct-cta__label:hover.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__label:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__input:hover,.dct-cta__input:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__btn .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn.dct-cta__btn:disabled.dct-cta__btn:not.dct-cta__btn:not:hover.dct-cta__btn:not:hover,.dct-cta__btn:not:focus.dct-cta__btn-text.dct-cta__btn:before .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn-loadingborder-top:px solid #fffborder-radius:%width:pxheight:pxbox-sizing:border-box-webkit-animation:dctSpinner .s linear infiniteanimation:dctSpinner .s linear infinite.dct-cta--signup.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--signup__dialogs.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--success.dct-cta--signup__dialog--error.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__grid.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and @media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap+.dct-cta__content@supports or.dct-cta__flex:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--js-active.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and @supports or.dct-cta__grid:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label,.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__gridgrid-template-columns:fr minmaxgrid-gap:.rem .remA woman#s le has been transformed by a state-of-the-art device after losing her sight in an accident on a night out.Mother-of-one Donna Shinnie, , was severely injured after a fall in Aberdeen five years ago.She spent  months in hospital and mysteriously lost her sight and is now registered blind as a result.Her story was highlighted in the Evening Express in February, where it was revealed she was hopeful of being able to access new technology # known as the OrCam MyEye Pro # to help her gain more independence.It is a voice-activated device that attaches to the side of glasses and is activated by an intuitive pointing gesture or simply by following the wearer#s gaze – allowing for hands-free use without the need for a smartphone or Wi-Fi.The device can instantly read text from a book, smartphone screen or any other surface.It also recognises faces and banknotes, helping wearers shop on their own, work more efficiently, and live a much more independent le.The device is being used by tens of thousands of people across the globe, in more than  countries and  languages, with users ranging in age from  to over .And it is now being used by Donna in Aberdeen who can now read books and text on the screen of a mobile phone.The Mastrick-based family raised the funds to buy Donna the device with the help of local charity North East Sensory Services .And her mother, Linda Girling, said it is already making a huge impact on her le.Linda said: “The things the OrCam MyEye can do are just amazing. Even in the early days of getting used to the device, it’s making an incredible dference.“Donna knows where she is, what’s around her and now the device even recognises all of our faces.“This will give her back so much of the independence she lost after the accident. It’s great news for us as a whole family # it’s le-changing for her.”The latest device Donna uses costs over £, and she is one of more than  people in the north-east who owns one.Graham Findlay, chief executive of North East Sensory Services, said: “I am very proud of the hard work of NESS staff who, as always, have gone the extra mile for Donna in helping her gain independence and supporting the fundraising efforts.“Increasing the independence of blind and deaf people is the focus of all our work, and we’re delighted for Donna and her family.”Tsachi Moshinsky, UK director at OrCam Technologies added: “Our founding principle at OrCam Technologies has always been transforming the lives of people with vision challenges with sophisticated ‘AI-as-a-companion’ technology that is used easily and intuitively.“The OrCam MyEye will help Donna gain increased independence following her accident, enabling her to carry out everyday activities that sighted people often take for granted.#We’re looking forward to following Donna’s story as she achieves the ability to enjoy things that she never imagined she’d do again.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/syndicatenews/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/05/KFX-040321-02-06_38116158-558x372.jpg ","title":"drink driver flipped car while more than four times limit","story":"A drink-driver crashed and flipped his car onto its roof while more than four-and-a-half times the legal alcohol limit.

public to avoid “light-hearted banter” with its road crews as they carry out a major programme of pothole repairs.As a result of the pandemic last year, the council’s roads maintenance programme was suspended as frontline staff were instead redeployed to assist in more crucial services like household waste collections and burials.Although the local authority dealt with all road defects that posed an immediate danger, the long period of suspension, coupled with a long period of wintry weather has resulted in an “increasing number of emerging issues with the road network condition being reported”.Over the summer months ahead, the council’s roads teams will be conducting a “major effort” to repair potholes and other defects, and carry out surface-dressing work.But to limit the spread of Covid, the authority has instructed its road workers to not engage in banter with the public while they carry out their important duties.Philip McKay, the council’s head of roads, urged the public to be patientroadworks inconvenience them.He said: “We appreciate that working on roads can cause some inconvenience to users, but I would ask that you bear with us as we carry out these essential repairs which deliver long-term benefits across our ,-mile roads network.“We know that many of you enjoy a bit of light-hearted banter with our road crews when you pass which is normally great, but we must stress that while they continue to follow strict Covid safety procedures, they won’t be able to interact with you in the same way.”Councillor Peter Argyle, chairman of the council’s infrastructure services committee, highlighted the roads teams for their flexibility in assisting the council in delivering its most important services in the worst months of the pandemic.He said: “We have all felt the challenges around the Covid- pandemic and the impact has been particularly felt by our Roads colleagues – many of whom were redeployed last year to support vital services such as waste collections and burials.“We fully acknowledge that our roads maintenance programme was signicantly hampered and that there have been more reports of potholes and other surface defects requiring attention.“We are investing additional revenue to carry out these critical repairs during the summer, but it will take longer to complete.“I would urge all motorists to please be patient as we undertake the very repairs you have quite rightly demanded and above all, please be respectful of our roads crews who are undertaking that vital work on your behalf.”Motorists have been urged to take extra care and reduce speed when crossing sections of roads where surface dressing work has been carried out, as there is a risk of skidding.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our

programme now under way, we#ve put together a collection of Covid vaccine tracker charts to monitor the progress of the Covid- vaccine rollout across the UK.How many people have been vaccinated How many people have received the vaccine in my area Which demographics have received the vaccine When will I receive my coronavirus vaccine The Covid vaccine tracker below shows an at-a-glance view of the current proportion of the Scottish population who have received the first and second dose of either the Oxford AstraZaneca or the Pfizer BioNTech vaccination so far.The table below is an at-a-glance view of the total figures by group.Data on the number of people vaccinated was initially provided in a weekly report from Public Health Scotland, however there was immense pressure to keep the public more regularly informed so on January  the statistics began to be provided each day.The chart below shows the daily numbers of first and second doses provided.The chart below shows the cumulative number of people who have received each dose since the vaccination programme began on December .It#s also helpful to look at this data as a proportion of the Scottish population so you can see how the percentage of people vaccinated grows over time.The chart below shows the progress for each UK country.On January , Public Health Scotland provided this data broken down by vaccine type which is shown in the chart below.The map below shows the available data on the regional rollout of the vaccination programme.January  saw the release of data by local authority area for the first time, which is shown in the map below.Regional data was originally available on a weekly basis but moved to a daily upload on February . The chart below contains data on the daily number of doses provided and the population covered. Use the drop down box to select your area and the buttons to move between daily vaccinations, cumulative vaccinations and the percentage of the population who have received first doses.Similarly to the regional data, data by demographics were originally provided in the weekly PHS report # however on February  they moved to a daily publication schedule.The chart below shows the daily number of people who have had first doses in each age range, as well as the percentage of that population, covered.Public Health Scotland began reporting daily statistics on vaccinations by JCVI categories in mid-March. The chart below shows the percentage of each group who have received their first and second doses. The vaccines are being provided in accordance with the priority list drawn up by the joint committee on vaccination and immunisation .

Retailers in Scotland have invested tens of millions of pounds on safety measures including plexiglass screens, queue management systems, social distancing signage and floor markings, better ventilation, cleaning and hygiene. Shop workers have ensured the nation was supplied and fed throughout the past thirteen dficult months.The reopening of non-essential shops and ability of food-to-go retailers to resume welcoming customers in-store will mark a crucial milestone for Scottish retail and the wider supply chain. Retail is Scotland#s largest private sector employer. So-called non-essential stores have been compelled to close in Scotland for  consecutive days.The SRC and Usdaw encourage shoppers to:Across Scotland, thousands of shops which have been shuttered for four long months are looking forward to getting back to doing what they do best — serving their customers.Reopening is good news for our economy, for jobs and for our local communities. It has never been more important to play our part in keeping our towns, cities and retail destinations vibrant.Every purchase from a shop helps support jobs in local retail and throughout the supply chain. Retailers and their colleagues continue to work around the clock to maintain a safe shopping experience, so customers can have the confidence toto their favourite stores.If we all follow the necessary physical distancing and hygiene measures and show consideration to those around us, including shop staff who are doing a dficult job, then everyone will be better off.The reopening of stores on Monday offers a leline for many retailers. That is good news in terms of helping to safeguard jobs, but the virus is still out there.We expect employers to conduct full risk assessments, follow the agreed guidance and ensure that customers are fully informed of the necessary safety measures.Shoppers need to play their part in helping to limit the spread of the virus and avoid further lockdowns by following the rules and respecting staff.Regrettably, throughout this appalling pandemic, incidents of abuse towards shop workers doubled and Covid safety measures have now become signicant flashpoints. Abuse should never be part of the job and shop workers – who played a vital role in getting food and medicine into our homes during the pandemic – deserve our thanks and respect.In January, the Scottish Parliament unanimously voted for a ground-breaking new law to protect shop workers. Usdaw campaigned for many years to secure these legal protections and we will continue to work hard to ensure that shop workers are protected and treated with the respect they deserve.The national charity for older people is encouraging people to get moving every day next month as part of a new fundraising activity challenge.Throughout May, Age Scotland is asking people across the country to Spring into Action to help support older people in Scotland.Fundraisers can take part however they choose, but the most important thing is to make sure they are active every day.All funds raised by Spring into Action participants will go towards Age Scotland#s vital services, including the national friendship line, which offers a place older people can turn tothey are in need of support, comfort and reassurance or even just missing a friendly voice.Running and walking events have always been a great way to help raise vital funds and, even with many regular events unfortunately cancelled over the past year, we#ve been overwhelmed by the kindness and generosity shown by fundraisers still going above and beyond.We hope to see as many people as possible taking up our challenge to Spring into Action this May.

My other son is into blacksmithing, which is also in the family.#And while she has never visited Argyll, Clare would love to at some point once Covid restrictions have eased.#I had a look at images of Loch Awe and have been reading up about the area.

A big decision has been swept under the carpet.#The budget was reduced by £,, from £, to £,.Douglas Hendry, executive director of customer services, said: #Our process is not to fund routes where there is alternative transport available or where there are less than , people travelling annually.#TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGOPiper#s march wins prizeThe Campbeltown piper who won a competition to compose a tune to mark a battle in which many of his comrades fought was presented with his prize on Tuesday # the battle#s rd anniversary.Mr George McIntyre from Meadowburn won a competition run by the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders to compose a   march in memory of the Battle of Longstop Hill in .On Tuesday, Longstop Day, Major Hamish Clarkof the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders travelled to Campbeltown to present George with a specially engraved quaich at a ceremony at the Argyll Hotel.Many Kintyre men fought at the battle which was one of the decisive moments in the Second World War against the Germans in North Africa.Major Duncan McMillan, who won the Military Medal at the battle, attended the ceremony along with many of George#s other old army friends.Before he handed the quaich to George, Major Clark said: #I really can#t think of anyone more appropriate to have won the competition than George McIntyre himself.#If George had not been taken prisoner in  he may well have fought at Longstop.#Receiving the quaich, George said: #It gives me great honour to achieve this.#Then Mr Ian McKerral from Kintyre and District Pipe Band gave the first public performance of the tune.FIFTY YEARS AGOThe end of the road for PaulPaul McCartney, who is at the moment staying at High Park Farm, Campbeltown, has just made one giant step forward towards severing all his connections with the other three Beatles.John Lennon, George Harrison and Ringo Starr abandoned their appeal against a High Court order on Monday, putting the affairs of their company, Apple, in the hands of a receiver. The three now face a legal costs bill estimated at £,.Mr Morris Finer, QC for John, George, Ringo and Apple, told the appeal court on Monday that they now considered it was in the common interest to explore ways of allowing Paul to free himself from the partnership by agreement.Mr David Hurst QC on behalf of Paul said: #He will most willingly enter into the proposed negotiations to achieve his freedom from the partnership by consent rather than by court action.#Well, it looks very much like the end of the #long and winding road# to quote a well known McCartney ballad.What does Paul himself feel about the rise and fall of the Beatles Two Courier men drove up to High Park Farm — which has a long and decidedly bumpy road leading to it — to find out what the man in the centre of it all felt about things.Apart from being obviously excited about his latest and most important success, Paul did not like saying anything about the matter.Though very polite and friendly, he made it quite clear that he does not see any point in giving interviews or saying anything remotely sensational.After ten years of being harried and hustled by journalists and photographers never having a minute#s peace to himself always having been the centre of attraction never having been able to pop in to the #local#, is it any wonder that Paul is determined to live as quietly as possible He seemed as happy as a sand-boy, out there in the wilds.When we approached him, he had obviously been brushing down one of his horses because he still held a horse brush in his hand.His we Linda looked the essence of happiness as her golden hair mirrored the warm sunshine. The children yelled and gurgled contentedly and even Martha, the English sheepdog, seemed happy.The farm house itself has been extensively renovated, a new roof having been constructed and the farm work appears to be progressing normally.Paul himself has changed. Outwardly at any rate. Gone is the Beatle mop, the style which was copied the whole word over. Gone is the boyish grin, which once sent screaming thousands into ecstasy.What has taken the place of these characteristics  Paul now sports a beard the hair remains longish but it is brushed back, revealing the full extent of his forehead the smile is no longer boyish.The former bass-guitarist song-writer with the most influential and certainly most famous foursome the world has ever known has changed.Paul will probably continue to compose such brilliant songs as Maybe I#m Amazed and Another Day but to millions of people, from Campbeltown to Honolulu, pop music will certainly never be the same again.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOSparks and flashesThere would be some fluttering this week among the ladies in the town who are liable to serve on a jury, summonses to appear on the occasion of a forthcoming jury trial having been issued to  ladies and  gentlemen. These are first jury summonses issued to women in this district.The th Argylls Defence Battalion, raised in connection with the present emergency, is encamped near Bridge of Allan.The customary assemblies which mark the close of Mr J B M#Ewen#s dancing classes will be held in the Town Hall on Friday May .A generous gentleman who has a business connection with the town and country has given the Governor of Campbeltown Poorhouse £ to be expended in tobacco for the smokers and tea and sugar for the others in the Institution.The contract for the daily motor mail service between Campbeltown and Tarbert — the existing one expires in July — has been secured by Mr A M M#Conachie, Low Dunashery, Tayinloan."},{"url":null,"title":"leader april 30 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Eight designs will be chosen to become stamps which will be on sale across the UK.Children may choose to illustrate frontline workers in health or social care.They may want to celebrate other key workers who have kept the country going, such as refuse collectors, cleaners, teachers, supermarket workers, public transport staff, delivery drivers or, indeed, postmen and postwomen.Or they might highlight the volunteers who have helped in their local communities or raised money for charity, such as the late Captain Sir Tom Moore.The competition is open until Friday May . A special  of judges will select the winners. As with all special stamps, the final eight designs will be sent to HM The Queen before they can be printed and issued as stamps. The winners will be announced in the autumn.We cannot wait to see who children choose to honour on their stamp.

If you are taking a long-term view then a garden full of reliable flowering shrubs is also an option.Whatever garden you have, watering and weeding are the key watchwords for May. It is essential to water newly planted fruit trees, roses and shrubs regularly to help their root systems get established.It is also the time of year when many plants# demand for water increases as they start their major growth period. Top watering tips include – every time you plant something, water it in well, make a moat of soil round newly planted plants so that water doesn#t run off and goes to the roots, water pots and containers so that water appears right to the top of the pot and get a water butt.If you have a drainpipe, you have a natural water supply so a simple garden solution for May is to ensure that you have adequate water storage. If you buy and fit a water butt, it will provide you with water for the garden in an environmentally friendly way and on a regular basis.Annual weeds will be popping up now, so weeding borders once a week to prevent weed seedlings establishing is a good idea. The problem with the most common weeds such as nettles, dandelions and bindweed, is that they are very, very tough. They can continue to grow in conditions that make most garden plants simply fade away – and they do that, in part, by using the moisture, nutrients and light of the plants around them.A great plant to get you into the summer gardening spirit is the pretty petunia – perfect for containers and hanging baskets and a great choice for instant colour. It can flower all summer long, providing you deadhead regularly, and comes in a iety of colours to suit any garden palette.Petunias are also available in dferent blooms including single, double, ruffled or smooth petals. They can be striped, veined or solid in colour and most sold today are hybrids developed for specic design purposes such as fragrance.They need full sun and can#t tolerate frost but can grow in a wide range of soils and thrive in multipurpose compost when planted in containers.Keeping on top of garden maintenance is crucial in May. The garden is coming alive so there is plenty to keep you busy. Here are some jobs you should be thinking about this month from the Royal Horticultural Society:"},{"url":null,"title":"liveargylls leisure facilities and libraries reopen","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Campbeltown Harbour Office said that the Europa was #arguably the biggest boat to come into Campbeltown for a long time#.The chairperson of Campbeltown Community Council, Mrs Nancie Smith, hoped a special gala day could be organised to mark the ship#s visit.She said: #This is an opportunity we should grasp with both hands. I anticipate there will be some form of civic entertainment laid on.#Mrs Smith added that she hoped many shops in the centre of town would not close for the half day to make the visitors feel welcome.She told the Courier: #It is important that the visitors see the town looking at its best and we hope this will be supported by all the businesses and shops which will stay open for business that day.#The local director of Argyll, the Isles, Loch Lomond, Stirling and the Trossachs Tourist Board, Mr Bruce Urquhart, hailed the Europa#s planned visit as a great opportunity for Campbeltown.FIFTY YEARS AGOFarmer#s heroic effort to save barnFire dealt a cruel blow to a local farmer yesterday afternoon, for the second time in three years.As fire fighting units raced from Campbeltown, a barn at Low Tirfergus Farm near Drumlemble was ablaze from end to end. Flames were fanned by a fresh easterly breeze.And despite a heroic effort by the farmer, Mr Roderick Morrison, son-in-law of the farm#s owner Mr A Barker, the fire had a firm hold by the time the fire brigade arrived.The alarm was raised by Mr Morrison#s we who alerted him.Armed with a pitchfork, Mr Morrison tried to separate the blazing straw, which was being used as feeding, from the rest of the barn#s contents, but it was in vain.Firemen had to jump clear as the roof caved in with a tremendous crash.The straw inside the barn was totally destroyed.The £ barn was erected three years ago after  tons of hay and  tons of straw were destroyed in a blaze at the same farm.It stood on its own, some distance from the other farm buildings.Labour back in control – by one seatLabour retained control of Campbeltown Town Council at Tuesday#s municipal elections, though they lost one seat to the Progressives.The composition of the council now reads: Labour nine seats, Progressive eight seats.Provost Daniel McKinven and Councillor Edward Scragg, who formerly sat under the Independent Socialist and SBP banners respectively, fought the contest as Progressives. Both were re-elected.And -year old William Crossan, of Kinloch Road, Campbeltown, became the youngest member ever to sit in the council chambers.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOCoal strikeAttention should be paid to the announcement in our advt. columns regarding the pressure of gas from the local works, special arrangements commencing on Saturday night with the object of conserving the stock of coal.A coal laden schooner, carrying about  tons of household coal, which arrived here just at the beginning of the coal strike and was prohibited from discharging by the customs authorities, had the embargo removed this week, the cargo being transferred to one of the local coal merchants.One hundred tons dished out in half-cwt lots, which is the household allowance for a week, will help a bit to keep the home fires burning.The coal fight drags on without the smallest sign of either side giving way. Apparently the nation will have to suffer much more before a settlement is reached, and unfortunately there is no very clear guarantee that even a settlement of the coal dispute would restore us to anything like prosperity.Every minute of the clock-round stocks are being reduced, andthe dispute lasts much longer, the miners will produce a general lock-out of their fellow-workers, which will have all the dire effects of a general strike without any of its heroics.

She deserves the bright future she looks set to enjoy.Dog fouling is always unpleasant but it is particularly nasty when it occurs on and around children#s play equipment.Tayinloan Villagers# Association worked very hard to raise the funds required to replace the village#s dilapidated and abandoned play equipment and for people to treat it with such disregard is appalling.Dog poo can be dangerous to humans as it sometimes carries parasites that can lead to toxocariasis, an infection that causes a cough, high temperature, headaches and stomach pain.The villagers are keen to welcome visitors to enjoy the equipment but it has to be a safe environment.

The dip now is actually worse than when the cattle grid was in place.To make matters worse, the damaged cattle grid, which is now mangled metal, has been left on the adjacent roadside verge.It is my strong belief thatcattle grids are damaged, the roads department should replace them with new fit-for-propose cattle grids, not get rid of them all together.Not only should road repairs be made to last but at the very least the roads department should clean up after itself and remove old damaged materials such as this left behind.If a private company or an inidual member of the public left a large amount of scrap metal at the side of the road they would be in trouble.I have contacted our roads management through member services and asked them to recty this matter as soon as possible.I am a GP in one of Argyll#s rural practices. Last week I was having a busy morning so was a little later than usual getting back to my car, which I had left charging at an electric charge point.That evening I was surprised to see that I#d been charged £ over and above the normal charging rate per KwH.I checked through the Argyll and Bute website and discovered that there is now an overstay charge – hence the surcharge.I had received an email back in April saying that Argyll and Bute Council would now be charging users at its charge points – the cost being p per KwH. Fair enough.However, there was no mention of a penalty for overstaying. Nor is there any notice at the charge points themselves, save a tiny notice stating #charges apply#.Those seeking to charge in Argyll and Bute are additionally confused by the lack of clarity over what type of charge point is being used: is it a  Kw, Kw or a  Kw. There is no notice on the chargers. This is important because the overstay timings y according to the dfering units.When I buy petrol at a filling station, I clearly know what the charges are when I buy a ticket at a parking meter, I buy a ticket and know exactly how long I am able to park there.But it seems that for electric vehicles you have to search the internet to find out the rules – and in my village there is no local WiFi and I cannot get G on my phone.As a responsible democrat I thought, when this election was called, that I would write to the candidates to ask them a few questions before deciding how to vote.We had no hustings this time, even in Campbeltown, and our MSP has not visited the town for ages. So election time seems to be the only opportunity to enter into dialogue with those who want to represent us.Last year I published a book about the uncertain future for the rule of law in Scotland. The irreducible basis of a rule-of-law society is reciprocity between those who make the laws and those who have to obey them. Without dialogue, that is impossible.Only two parties sent me a leaflet with enough time to allow an exchange of emails: first the SNP and then the LibDems.I started by asking the SNP candidate, Jenni Minto, for a CV. That was initially refused, then a redacted one sent. Next, I asked about the Hate Crime Act. I got a long answer ending with a quotation from the English philosopher, Karl Popper: #In order to maintain a tolerant society, the society must be intolerant to intolerance.#I wrote back quoting Bertrand Russell, who said that enforced morality is not morality at all it is pure obedience. Likewise, enforced tolerance is not tolerance, just obedience. I asked what she thought of the criminalisation of dinner-time conversations and other aspects of the Act. It was at that point that the dialogue broke down.I changed the subject to independence. This time I did get a reply, but it was evasive.For example, I had asked what the most important features of the UK were that made her want Scotland to leave it. Ms Minto replied that an independent country would get the government it votes for. That implied thatScotland and England voted for the same party, there would be no need for independence. So, by extension, whatArgyll wanted a dferent government from that in Holyrood  Should it declare independence from Scotland, as Orkney and Shetland have said they willthe UK breaks up  I wrote for clarication, but Ms Minto did not reply.I also wrote to Alan Reid of the LibDems. He sent a CV, but when I replied to that with questions about LibDem policy, I heard nothing more.That, in Scotland, appears to be the limit of dialogue between the rulers and the ruled. Perhaps that explains something about the parliament itself.With Sun Awareness Week taking place this week, Cats Protection would like to advise cat owners to be aware of the risks posed to their cat by the sun.Pale-coloured cats, or those with unpigmented white noses or ears, are particularly at risk from the sun#s rays which can cause sunburn and skin cancer.Those affected can suffer long-term damage including, in severe cases, having to have their ear tips removed to prevent the cancer from spreading.Following a few simple tips owners can help protect their cat from the harmful effects of the sun.These include keeping them indoors on sunny days between am and pm, asking your vet for advice about suitable sunscreen and ensuring you provide plenty of shade to enable your cat to shelter from the sun#s rays."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week may 7 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Yet, at the same time, we are becoming increasingly suspicious that the label on freedom has been switched.For some people appear to be devaluing freedom. They seem to think it means no constraints on their behaviour. They have the right to do whatever they want, evenit causes damage to themselves, to others and to the environment.Jesus makes it clear that freedom is something quite dferent. It is being set free from the tyrannical oppression of our own self-centredness – what the Bible calls sin – empowering us to be free to love God by willingly obeying his Word and to love others by humbly looking out for their best interests.Not only did Jesus tell us in his teaching and show us by his example what label freedom should have, but by his real death on the cross, his physical and historical resurrection and the gt of his Spirit, he made it possible for us to experience it.We must not be conned by the switch that has been made to freedom#s label.Instead, let us restore its label back to its correct, Jesus-defined and le-changing setting, and through faith in Jesus alone, value and enjoy the freedom he secured by his death."},{"url":null,"title":"happy lockdown birthday joanne","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Any forward player will tell you that. If you have a terrible game and score a goal or play fantastic and not score ndash you are judged on your goals as a forward.ldquoHopefully, I will get another goal but I need to make sure I am in the team. I would love another goal and I love the Scottish Cup. I loved it with East Kilbride and Gala Fairydean Rovers ndash it is great and you love those big moments in competitions.Paton moved from Dublin to East Lothian after signing for Hibs around his th birthday.He lived with Helen Leslie and her two sons, Darren and Jonathan, off Tranentrsquos Waterloo Road and attended Ross High School, where he studied physical education, English and sports leadership.The striker was quick to praise both the family and the school for helping him develop. He said: ldquoThey took me in asI was part of their family.ldquoThey were absolutely fantastic to me and made me feel so welcome.ldquoI went for dinner with them and they were brilliant.ldquoIn my first year, I spoke to Sean McPartlin, education and welfare officer, and he askedI wanted to do something. I agreed to it and they said I would train some days.ldquoIt is the best thing I ever did.That saw Paton ide his time between attending school and training at Hibernian Training Centre at East Mains on the outskirts of Ormiston.The -year-old spent two years at the secondary school and told Courier Sport how much he enjoyed the experience. He added: ldquoIt was brilliant ndash the best thing I ever did, honestly.ldquoI was not too keen going to school at that age with football andI had not then I would not have made many friends.

Not all animals are the same some cats and dogs enjoy noise and excitement, but to others this would be very stressful.Others like peace and quiet ndash but to some, being left quiet and alone is stressful.I think most of us are aware that sudden, unusual noises can frighten pets for example, thunderstorms and fireworks. These are sounds which are strange to your pet and can result in a great deal of stress.In a recent survey carried out by the PDSA,  per cent of owners said their pet was scared of fireworks. The main signs the owners reported were cowering and hiding, trembling and shaking, disinterest in food and barking.Pets left alone either at home or in a cattery or kennel, which are unusual occurrences, can result in severe stress, as the pet feels abandoned by their family.Bringing in a new pet or moving home can also feel terrying for a pet which is used to constancy. Sometimes the dynamics of the pets within a home can change and one or more pet can feel threatened.At Dunedin Vets, at the beginning of lockdown, we saw many problems, especially with cats who were not used to their owners being at home all the time.Cats are notoriously sensitive to change. They may hide their stress but it can manest in other ways.This can include bladder problems and over-grooming and itching.Please contact your vet for adviceyou feel your pet requires some help to overcome their stress-related problems.It is wonderful to be out and about in the spring sunshine, albeit it is a bit chilly at the moment.Remember, there are a few hazards to avoid when walking your dog.Do not throw sticks for them to catch or retrieve. These can cause terrible injuriesthe dog runs onto them and injuries occur in their mouth or, as I have seen, penetrate their skin and damage structures in their necks.Last month, we mentioned the collie dog who was chasing his ball and accidentally swallowed it.Recently, our senior veterinary nurse Nicole saw a young couple rush to the front door of our Tranent surgery, carrying their dog. The owners were obviously very distressed, so Nicole spoke with them and discovered that they were sure Loki, their three-year-old cockapoo, had tried to swallow the bouncy ball toy he had been playing with.Mrs Pamela Masson explained it was a hard rubber ball with rubber spikes on it.Nicole could hear Loki making strange noises when breathing she checked he was able to breathe and called the vet to examine Loki. Gently opening his mouth, they could just glimpse something blue at the back of his mouth.Nicole had previously been involved in dealing with a dog which had choked on a ball. She knew this dog was somehow managing to breathe, unlike the previous one she had dealt with, which was unable to breathe and had been rapidly turning blue.She reassured the owners and admitted Loki for treatment to extract the ball. As choking animals are very distressed, they are likely to panic and bite, although Loki was remaining remarkably calm. The team prepared short-acting intravenous anaesthetic and several pairs of dferent-sized forceps to help extract the ball. Once a catheter was placed in Lokirsquos leg vein, everything had to be performed rapidly as soon as the anaesthetic injection was administered, to prevent the ball falling further into Lokirsquos larynx or dropping into the oesophagus. With Nicole supporting his head and a light being shone into the mouth, the blue spiky ball was seen. Grasping it with forceps, and with some tension and rotation, the vet extracted the offending ball from Lokirsquos throat.The ball had a central hole, or tunnel, running through it. This was the reason Loki was able to breathe, albeit in a laboured, noisy fashion.The ball had lodged with its central tunnel in line with Lokirsquos mouth and larynx. The rubber spikes caused a bit of damage to the soft areas around his larynx, but these would soon heal. Loki recovered quickly from his short-acting anaesthetic and was soon heading home with his parents.It is great to play ball with your dog but make sure youdo play with a ball large enough that your dog cannot swallow or choke.If you are playing with a solid rubber ball, please ensure it does have a central hole right through it.This was undoubtedly the reason why Loki was able to breathe.It also makes it much easier for the vet to remove, as there is something to grab onto. A smooth rubber ball completely stuck in the throat is surprisingly dficult to grasp and remove.I think Loki will be playing with footballs from now on."},{"url":null,"title":"musician-records-sounds-north-berwick-new-album-series-depicting-seven-continents","story":"Ted White, who was brought up on Cromwell Road, where parents Sally and Andrew still live, was approached by music distribution service Platoon to co-ordinate field recordings he had gathered around the world over several years and release them via Apple last month.Each of the seven albums is dedicated to a dferent continent, and the sounds of North Berwickrsquos beaches and harbour feature on the Europe: Earth Sounds album.Ted, , said: ldquoI travel a lot, recording sounds around the world, and Platoon and I collectively came up with the concept of collating my recordings of the past seven years into continents of the world.ldquoI did a bit more travelling to record the bits I didnrsquot have.A former student at Loretto now splitting his time between Liverpool and London, Ted came back to North Berwick to capture the seaside townrsquos night-time atmosphere.He said: ldquoI grew up there so I knew where I could get good sounds without the noise pollution that you get in London.ldquoI recorded lots of midnight sounds on the beaches.

Bees and other pollinating insects will be on the hunt at other times of year too,\" says Perry. \"Spring nectar sources can help pollinators to refuel after their hibernation period, and in autumn it can help them build energy reserves for the winter months. Be sure to plant with the widest range of blooming periods in mind, so the wildle never goes hungry.\"The calendar is designed to help gardeners of all abilities turn their outdoor spaces into a pollinator paradise all year round, buzzing with a riot of colour, texture and scent and a perfect way to contribute to World Bee Day .These are some of the plants which Perry recommends to help bees through all four seasons...SPRINGLungwort - the lovely lungwort flower grows low to the ground, and blooms early to bring food to the first pollinators of spring. They grow best in containers, so theyre great for planting in a small space.Peony - these pink beauties are rich in pollen, and pollinating insects love their single blooms. Plant your peonies in rich, dry soil in the sun.Magnolia - our buzzing buddies are drawn to the magnicent magnolias saucer-sized blooms, and love to snack on their sweet nectar. Magnolias love sun and acid soil with lots of moisture.Pussy willow - pussy willow pollen is high in protein, and the spring bloom provides an early source of nutrition for our busy friends.SUMMERLavender - At home in a Mediterranean style garden and also in pots or as a low hedge for potagers, lavender produces both pollen and nectar, making it a great food source for honey bees. They even create lavender-flavoured honey from the plant. Lavender does well in full sun in sandy or chalky, well-drained soil - nothing thats too rich.Foxglove - honey bees and bumblebees work together to pollinate this classic cottage garden favourite. The bumblebee creates holes in the side of the flower to make it easier for the honey bee to swoop in and access the flowers pollen.Hawthorn - our hive heroes can make dark and rich honey from hawthorn nectar. This flower grows best in sunny conditions and is tolerant of all soil types.Marjoram - marjoram is a favourite of humans and our pollinating pals alike - these nectar-rich flowers are actually a perennial herb and close relative of oregano.AUTUMNAster - these pretty perennials with daisy-like flowers ying from purple, violet, and lavender to pink with orange-yellow centres, need lots of water. Its worth adding a mulch to retain the moisture, but theyre worth it to keep the bees happy and help honey bees build up reserves of pollen for winter to get them through the cold months. Plant asters in full sun for them to shine.Honeysuckle - This fast-growing climber, which can be deciduous or evergreen, bearing blooms ranging from creamy-white through yellow to red, is famed for its powerful scent and is a magnet for bees. It starts to flower in the summer but can continue to autumn, given the right conditions. It prefers a sunny spot and isnt fussy about the soil.Single-bloom dahlias - If youre wanting to attract bees, go for the single bloom types of dahlia such as the Happy Single Series over the other ieties such as pompoms or balls, which are less accessible to insects.Sedum - Their pretty flowerheads are full of nectar which makes these low-growing perennials perfect for the front of a border or in prairie plantings, flowering right through to October. Sedum flowers are perfect for honey bees as a late source of pollen and nectar, helping to build up honey stores for the colder winter.WINTERWinter aconite - these low-growing small tuberous perennials from the buttercup family produce bright yellow cup-shaped flowers which are good for ground cover and provide a burst of winter and spring colour under shrubs and roses.Mahonia - Clusters of highly scented bright yellow flowers appear in winter on these tough, spiky evergreen shrubs which are easy to grow, produce lots of nectar and also provide purple to black berries in the autumn, a feast for the birds.Helleborus - hellebores provide sugar-rich nectar and high-protein pollen to help keep the bees energetic and strong through the middle of winter. They thrive in alkaline soil and their subtle shades ranging from cream to deep purple will bring le to a darker area, as they are tolerant of shade.Snowdrop - these pint-sized beauties are among the first bulbs to emerge in winter, providing rich nectar when other food is hard to find. Plant dferent ieties which flower at dferent times in winter to give the bees a longer foraging season.Crocus - these hardy flowers can break through ice and snow to bring food to winter honey bees. Plant them in the sun so that the flowers will fully open and make it easier for the bees to forage on the nectar.

When a lot is at stake, a lot of people turn out.Results still to come, of course. But let us work for now on the very reasonable assumption that Nicola Sturgeon will be ing to work on Monday as the First Minister of Scotland. What will immediately confront her Self-evidently, the Covid crisis ndash and its concomitant economic challenges. However, along with that, she will have to form a new Cabinet. One third of the previous team stood down at the election.Read more from Brian Taylor: Parties united by one thing: a desire for voters to just move onSo Ms Sturgeon will have to govern in future without the sagacious counsel of Aileen Campbell, Roseanna Cunningham, Jeane Freeman and Michael Russell.Ms Sturgeon may also take the opportunity to reshape her Cabinetrsquos structure and responsibilities, while preserving gender balance.That Cabinet exodus is matched in the lower Ministerial ranks and on the back benches. In addition, elections tend to generate involuntary departures. Democracy would notwithout such Parliamentary churn, however hard it is for iniduals.All the newbies ndash on all sides of the chamber ndash will need to learn, and quickly: not least because the anxious citizens of Scotland want speedy action in the continuing contest with coronavirus. When will we be safe  Where can we go on holiday Those decisions are urgent. Ms Sturgeon previously promised that there would be a further liberalisation on May , with Scotland generally ing to Level  constraints. If we all obey the rules.As for international travel, the UK Government has now set out its thinking. The Scottish Government has tended to favour a more cautious approach. Again, urgently, Ms Sturgeon will seek to revive a four-nation UK deal.Why four nation  Because it is simpler to explain and administer, it deters Scots from heading south of the border to get round Scottish rules: and, bluntly, it provides additional protection for the FM against complaints from Scots who might be super-angryEngland gets a more open deal.In tandem with action on the virus, Ms Sturgeon willto Ministerial briefing boxes brimming with information about the economy. Here is a hint: the data will not be universally positive.No doubt her attention will be drawn to a report from the Bank of England forecasting that the UK economy will enjoy record economic growth in , perhaps around . per cent. That is founded on expectations of higher confidence among consumers, happy with the vaccine numbers.However, Nicola Sturgeon will need no reminding that this possible uplt follows a calamitous slump last year, when the economy shrank by nearly ten per cent the most precipitous drop in three centuries.She knows too that the voters will expect delivery of the spending promises made in her manesto: more money for health, education, housing and social care. All within a balanced budget, constrained still further by a pledge to freeze Scottish income tax rates and bands.That promise, mirrored by other parties, was designed to reassure fretful voters. Starting today, it too has to be delivered.Then there is the related issue of securing Parliamentary support for budget proposals. That depends on the final Holyrood numbers.If she gains an overall majority, then she has only to sustain discipline in her own ranks. However,she is dependent once more upon the Greens for budgetary support, there could be some trouble ahead.The Greens tend to push for radical fiscal change for example, arguing during the campaign that Scotland should seek ways to tax wealth as well as income.They will also press Nicola Sturgeon to support swter curbs on the extraction of North Sea oil. Ministers back a move away from fossil fuels but worry about the immediate impact on jobs, arguing for a justtransition.If it comes to it, they may have to remind the Greens that big parties have rights too.Then the fundamental contest. Independence. Boris Johnson is expected to reach out to Scotland with measures designed to promote the Union and stress UK clout. One or two Tories mutter privately that such an initiative might have been handy before the election, not after.The Prime Minister will also face pressure to spell out whether he would consent to indyref. But not perhaps immediately. Ms Sturgeon herself is in no particular hurry.She knows that anxious voters will expect a laser focus on recovering from coronavirus.More, the FM fully understands that the independence offer in Scotland has always been predicated upon confidence. On taking back control,you like. Rather than fleeing from a perceived threat.That is why SNP Ministers have been so keen to govern moderately and sensibly, within existing devolved powers, while simultaneously promoting independence.Read more from Brian Taylor: Why Nicola Sturgeon offers her supporters Paradise DeferredBrexit, in particular, may create the conditions for revisiting the independence prospect, not least because Scotland was told that staying in the UK was the only way to retain EU membership.However, add Brexit to the virus and economic worries. That does not equate to a confident public. Quite the contrary. Voters might feel inclined to keep a-hold of nurse for fear of finding something worse. They might, at the very least, prefer to delay the decision.Finally, from the political to the personal. Nicola Sturgeon must be simply exhausted. A bizarre yet enervating election on top of endless endeavours to counter coronavirus and sustain the economy.All that plus Alex Salmond, seemingly at her shoulder for months, leading up to his unwanted offer of Holyrood help in pursuit of independence.For Nicola Sturgeon, then, time for rest and recuperation.

It is a scenario that will be familiar to many Scottish voters, for this has been the  Days Later election for these pandemic times.Anything that involved coming within two metres of a stranger was out of the question . So cheerio doorstep debating, rallies, walkabouts, all the usual fun and games, and hello masks and Zoom.The battle began in routine fashion with the dissolution of the Scottish Parliament. Some MSPs were not seeking re-election, among them Ruth Davidson, who was leaving to spend more time with her ermine.For everyone  it was off to the constituency or region to prepare for government. Or,you were a Scottish Labour candidate, to prepare your excuses. With Anas Sarwar in charge there was a certain spring in the partyrsquos step, with the new leader even joining in with an outdoors exercise class dancing to Uptown Funk. Yes sir, he can boogie.Willie Rennie continued his quest to stage the most ridiculous photo op ever, with shots of the LibDem leader at a penguin parade, in a giant deckchair, and boxing. Not wishing to be left out, Scottish Conservatives leader Douglas Ross continued his partyrsquos tradition of clambering on to the nearest military vehicle, in his case an armoured personnel carrier. And he wasnrsquot even campaigning in Castlemilk.Mr Ross received a lot of help from his predecessor, Ms Davidson, who even fronted the party political broadcast. Her omnipresence contrasted with the complete absence of Boris Johnson. Having said that wild horses wouldnrsquot keep him away, the Prime Minister preferred to stay in London and dodge questions about gold wallpaper rather than take his chances with rebellious Scots .Try as the parties did to generate excitement, the campaign was proving as empty and devoid of interest as Celticrsquos trophy cabinet. Then it happened. Cue movie trailer voice guy: ldquoThe sky darkened. Birds ceased singing. Jaws dropped. HE was back. And this time HE had brought a whole new party with him. After the initial shock of Alex Salmondrsquos , observers turned to more serious matters, like how to pronounce the Alba Partyrsquos name. Some said ldquoAlapa others ldquoWallopers. Mr Salmond came bearing the promise of a ldquosupermajority of independence-supporting MSPs who would make Johnson an offer he could not refuse.The media was delighted to see theof Mr Salmond, and reporters were soon asking SNP leader Nicola Sturgeonshe would work with her predecessor. Ms Sturgeon gave the impression she did not wish to be on the same continent as her old boss, never mind in coalition with him.The SNP leader conducted a lot of her campaign from her by-now-famous conservatory. FDR had his fireside chats, Nicola has natters in the greenhouse. Consensus had it that the election was in the bag for her. It only remained to be seenshe would win a majority, and which party would take second place to the SNP, the Conservatives or Labour.The TV debates gave voters a chance to see the party leaders in action. Not all the leaders, however. BBC Scotland and STV limited participation to the five largest parties in the Scottish Parliament, which meant no podium for Mr Salmond or George Galloway, the leader of the All for Unityparty.Mr Galloway tried to whip up interest in a mano a mano with the Alba leader, moderated by Andrew Neil. Viewers might have been interested had David Attenborough not featured extensive scenes of walruses fighting in his last televisual masterpiece.So five went off to debate, with Sarah Smith and Glenn Campbell holding the jaikets for the BBC, and Colin Mackay doing the same for STV. Channel rsquos Krishnan Guru-Murthy came all the way from London town to show us he was as familiar with Scottish politics as Donald Trump was with third-wave feminism.The televised debates were missing a live audience in the studio, and turned out to be horribly dull in consequence. Scottish Greens co-leaders Patrick Harvie and Lorna Slater ided the debate work between them, though Steve Arnott-dress-a-like Harvie hogged more of the limelight.Anas Sarwar adopted a ldquoWhy canrsquot we be friends approach to the debates, albeit the offer clearly did not extend to the Conservatives, who were the focus of everyonersquos attacks. Douglas Ross seemed spectacularly cross in most of the encounters, while Ms Sturgeon tried hard not to look humongously smug or bored.Election day arrived, and with it the chance to exercise that age-old right to take a photie of the dug at a polling place and post it on Twitter.The one million Scots who had registered to vote by post had already done their bit, quietly and without fuss, in keeping with the mood. In one final insult from the heavens, the counts were not starting till the morning after, so voters were denied the thrill of spending the night with Kirsty Wark and Bernard Ponsonby.It had been that kind of election, that kind of year. May we never see its likes again."},{"url":null,"title":"pro-union-parties-indyref2-obsession-fuelling-debate","story":"In part, this obsession has led to the SNP being let off the hook for its failures in government as was reflected in this weekendrsquos election results and perpetuated by every media outlet across the country zoning in on constitutional questions.Over the past few weeks, the majority of pro-Union politicians have used every sound clip offered to them to exclaim their anti-independence thoughts rather than explain how they propose to get this country back on its feet and how they could work with the Government to put recovery first.With all eyes focused on the constitution, it has worked in the favour of the SNP who have managed to be elected to Government with a record number of votes, despite their failings over the past  years in charge.The First Minister herself admitted during the campaign that she had taken her ldquoeye off the ball as Scotland racked up the highest drugs death in Europe. But there doesnrsquot appear to have been any rebuke for the drugs deaths crisis, their failed education record, missed hospital waiting time targets, rising child poverty rates, the exam results scandal, or failures in local policing.The next Scottish Government has an opportunity over the next five years to make amends for past failures and getting caught up in an independence campaign will only take the SNPrsquos eye off the ball once again.However, the SNP did not win a majority in the election and as a minority government will require support from other parties to pass budgets and any major reforms.The Scottish Greens will likely prop up the SNP in future policy discussions, but this will requirepolicy trade-offs infor budget support.With COP firmly in the sights of both parties as an opportunity to showcase Scotland as a leader in tackling climate change on the global stage, will the Scottish Greens be willing to lend support to independence which could risk the SNP taking its focus off meeting its emissions reduction targets of % by  ndash which it has done for the past two years in a row.They have already said they want bold action from the Scottish Government and now they are in a position to bargain for this.Read more:Indyref and a blinkered green agenda could harm Scottish farmings futureDuring Sundayrsquos Andrew Marr programme, a suggestion of next spring to hold another referendum was put to the First Minister, to which, of course, she said she was contemplating. Nicola Sturgeon hasnrsquot officially committed to a timescale, other than the first half of the next parliamentary term, but it would appear that the media is setting the ball rolling by proposing such a timeline. As much as I have criticised the SNP for pedalling talks of Indyref during a pandemic, journalists are also guilty of fuelling the debate and diminishing print space or airtime for more immediate and pressing issues.Over the past week I have been moving into my new house, which has involved many hours of deep cleaning whilst tuned in to my radio and coverage of the election.Hats off to BBC Radio Scotland team for managing to fill three daysrsquo worth of election coverage with very little to report on other than the one major news story: would the SNP gain a majority Although they covered results and reaction across the entire country, the main topic on every reportersrsquo lips was whether the SNP would have a mandate to hold another referendum. So, for every listener tuned in, we are being told that this is the discussion we need to be having, this is the headline we should all be taking away.In between googling tutorials on how to sand kitchen worktops, I checked in to the community Facebook page for my local village and was struck by the fact that none of the members were remotely engaged in discussions over the election, let alone independence. Like many other communities across the country, this village is still in the grips of a pandemic, so quite understandably, most posts and discussions revolved around Covid advice and best practice, information about the local youth club reopening, as well as a series of church services.Read more:Scottish election: Indyref cant continue to dominate the next five years mdash there are bigger issuesMembers were posting aboutfitness camps and slots which had come available for hairdressers and beauty salons.

It didnrsquot even rain. Alba failed to register even % in the election ndash yet because of defections it has representatives in the House of Commons and Scottish councils.The two MPs are Kenny MacAskill and Neale Hanvey. The case around Hanvey is a little more complicated than MacAskill, whorsquos a straightforward defector from the SNP to Alba.In , Hanvey was the SNPrsquos candidate for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath. He was dropped in November over using anti-semitic language on social media. Despite his suspension, Hanvey appeared on the ballot next to the SNP name as the deadline for candidates to be nominated had passed.After election, he initially sat as an independent. He apologised for anti-semitic language and was readmitted to the SNP. In , he was appointed the SNPrsquos spokesperson for the Westminster Health and Social Care Select Committee. This March, Hanvey, together with Kenny MacAskill who was elected as the SNP MP for East Lothian, and a number of SNP councillors, defected to Alba. NEIL MACKAY: The Alba effectClearly, voters represented by Hanvey, MacAskill and others ndash such as the Inverclyde councillor Christopher McEleny ndash didnrsquot vote for them as members of Alba. So surely, the only honourable course of action is for these defectors to stand down immediately and submit themselves to by-elections. If the people they currently represent still find them suitable as representatives, then all well and good. However, to cling on to position, power and a public pay cheque in the current circumstances is surely morally untenable, even cowardly.This week Neale Hanvey denounced the SNP as toxic, aggressive and hostile, saying he ldquodetested what the party had become. It would evidently be best policy, perhaps, for all concernedhe makes a clear and irrevocable split with the SNP, putting himself up for re-election on an Alba ticket so he cannot be accused of riding into a job on the coattails of a party he evidently loathes.On a wider stage, matters are currently going very badly for prominent Alba supporters. Craig Murray, a former British diplomat who became a blogger and cheerleader for Alex Salmond, was sentenced to eight months in prison this week for contempt of court relating to the trial of the former First Minister. Judges ruled Murray in contempt relating to material capable of identying four complainers in the case.The future looks shaky too for the nationalist marching organisation All Under One Banner. One of its key figures, Neil MacKay , made great play on social media of showing support for the Alba Party, attracting ridicule and rage from mainstream Yes voters. Some people who previously took part in the rallies have sworn never to attend again, seeing the organisation tainted by Alba support.Itrsquos also a rather embarrassing time for whatrsquos been termed the lsquoalt-nat blogospherersquo which rallied to Salmondrsquos party. Their role was seen as a major turn-off factor when it came to Alba, with ordinary voters repelled by a toxic mix of conspiracy theories, hate and bigotry.Therersquos speculation that Salmond could have done somewhat better at the polls ndash despite his own low approval ratings ndashhersquod wisely kept clear of such characters.Kenny MacAskillThese online voices are really left with nowhere to go now, but further down the rabbit holes theyrsquove been digging for themselves and their diminishing bands of followers for years. They imagined Nicola Sturgeon ousted from office in the wake of the Salmond inquiries and Alba holding seats in Holyrood. Theyrsquove been repeatedly proved wrong.The more tricky question regarding the aftermath of Alba is what Sturgeon should do about those thorns in her side, and the side of the SNP, who many suspected of planning to jump ship to Alba, but when the crunch came seemingly lacked the courage to defect.Although it was all rumour and zero proof, there was intense speculation MPs Angus MacNeil and Joanna Cherry would defect. Both dismissed the idea.However, previous interventions by Cherry and MacNeil have made le dficult for the SNP and Nicola Sturgeon. Both are seen as having undermined Sturgeonrsquos leadership, and ndash whether they like it or not ndash perceived as central to the long-running civil war within the ranks of the SNP which caused considerable damage to the party.Whatrsquos clear now, though, is that with the defeat of Alba and its rejection by the electorate, Sturgeon is in a strong position to crack down on any dissent in the ranks. It might well become a rather tough season for the SNPrsquos erstwhile awkward squad.There were recent reports that Alex Salmond claimed he could have lsquodestroyedrsquo Nicola Sturgeon. The only thing which has been destroyed is Albarsquos hopes of gaining any traction with the Scottish people. Salmond, however, insists that his party will ldquobloom. The former First Minister is entitled to think what he wishes, but his hopes seem unlikely to be fulfilled. NEIL MACKAY: Salmonds Trumpian circusSalmond is on much firmer ground with his recent warning that ldquoonline warriors are a problem in modern politics. Hersquos undoubtedly correct. So it was a little discomfiting to see him in a online discussion say ndash in jest, it appeared ndash that ldquoone day Irsquom going to unleash myself on Twitter now that Donald Trump has created a vacuum for me.Salmond still casts a long shadow. The husband of one of the women in the Salmond case recently said that the former First Ministerrsquosto the political spotlight had left his we ldquoincapacitated by depression. We must remember Salmond was cleared of all charges.Salmond could change a lothe took just a few simple steps. Apologise for his past behaviour as Nicola Sturgeon has advised him to do, and distance himself from the coterie of extremist voices which surround him. He could also advise the defectors from the SNP to Alba to show the courage of their convictions and face by-election.

We unionists, on the other hand, should get on with fixing the backlog in the NHS, with addressing the year of lost schooling, and with the rising tide of unemployment that, one fears, has been delayed rather than reversed by the Treasuryrsquos highly successful furlough scheme.I hear the force of that argument, but I take a dferent view. I think governments can do more than one thing at a time. Our focus should be on the recovery but, at the same time, we do need to start having a more serious conversation about independence than we have had until now. Again, this is what focus groups will tell you.WestminsterA lot of Scots are indy-curious. Itrsquos an interesting and potentially attractive idea, but they want to know much more about it. Their instinct tells them that it will come with costs ndash and their experience of Brexit tells them their instinct is right. Leaving the United Kingdommay or may not be worth it, they think, but we need to know more before we can decide.Indeed, we need to know more before we can be fairly asked to decide.It is true that the UKrsquos union of four home nations is held together by consent. If one part of the UK wishes to withdraw, it has been our constitutional understanding that the other parts will not stand in the way. We are not Spain, held together by force of law. But the consent that holds us together needs to be informed consent. And we know that there are certain key, critical issues that will have to be addressed before we can really understand what we are being asked by the question ldquoshould Scotland be an independent country Top of the list, now as ever, is currency. What would be the currency of an independent Scotland, and how would it work  An old question, but one to which we still donrsquot know the answer.Every bit as pressing is EU accession. We know what the process would be ndash that is set out in the EU treaties. But what would the price be  How would an independent Scotland reshape its economy such that it complied with the Maastricht convergence criteria  There is no question that Scotland could transition to become a Member State ndash of course we could. But, equally, there is no question that it would be a mighty dficult and expensive process. All this needs to be set out and explained, not after any repeat referendum on independence, but before.And then there is the border ndash not just the land border with England but the sea border with Northern Ireland. With Scotland in the EU and theUK out, what consequences for trade, for freedom of movement, for the unhindered supply of services that we all take completely for granted  Brexit may have made the case for independence stronger, to some minds at least, but it has also made the reality of independence far more complex.:Independence must be about changing lives...not flags. So lets hear the visionNow is the time for these questions to come to the fore. The UK Government should start asking them. Ministers should perhaps even commission some trusted independent experts to think about answering them ndash the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, for example  Select committees could open inquiries into these matters, perhaps even joint committees of MPs and MSPs combined  You know, we could even have a citizensrsquo assembly on these topics.It matters less what the process is. It matters more that,Scots are to be asked the independence question again, whether during the course of this parliamentary session or not, we have answers we can trust on the core issues that will be facing us. We need a conversation, not about the aspiration of independence, but about its reality.Adam Tomkins is a Professor of Law at the University of Glasgow.

It provides a counter-narrative to the idea that these languages, and by extension their speakers, are somehow deficient. Gaelic and Scots did not become minority languages because their speakers fancied a change.Itrsquos not that English is an inherently superior language, itrsquos that English became the only means by which people could access an education. The  EducationAct provided education for all the children of Scotland, but provided it only in English. Between  and , Gaelic wasnrsquot even taught as a subject in areas where it was the first language of the majority of the population. Instead of being taught to read and write in their mother tongue, children were physically punished for speaking it. Parents were told that persisting in speaking Gaelic or Scots to their children was preventing them from becoming fluent in English, and thereby hampering their education.This isnrsquot in the dim and distant past, it was happening less than a century ago. Even now, although the SQA has a Scots language award, there is no National  or Higher available. These things are important for the status of a language.

Simply because until you have planning permission you don’t have a product.“And the market moves, so a figure now could be out of date in six month’s time. I have been encouraged, though, by the new five per cent deposit mortgages the government are backing. I hope that could be really helpful.“Lenders are also starting to offer mortgages at five and a half times buyers’ earnings as opposed to four or four and a half times, so that will also help with how much people can borrow.”He added: “Because of the proximity to the schools and Portree it is not going to appeal to people who are looking to buy a holiday home. They want to be in the middle of nowhere.“I think it is going to appeal to people who are looking to buy it as their main home and want access to the schools and decent internet so they can work.”As an extra incentive the developer plans to connect all the houses via a full fibre GB broadband connection to the nearby BT exchange.“This connection will be provided by us completely free of charge for the first five years,” he added.“This is possible because the capacity we will have for the hotel is well beyond what we will need. This is still subject to BT surveys, though, but it is a realistic aspiration.”The housing scheme, which Mr Garton Jones describes as “an amalgam of Highland and Scandinavian culture” has been designed by Plockton-based architect Olli Blair, who caught the eye of the developer with his work on the Raasay Distillery building.Mr Garton Jones said he hoped to get on site by September October this year.The Bracken Hide Hotel is scheduled to open in April .If anyone is looking for more information on the homes or to register an interest they can contact Mr Garton Jones via charlie@gartonjones"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/WATERNISH-CYCLE-1.jpg","title":"waternish youngsters raise more than 7000 with","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoinePat Matheson from Halistra lost her husband Campbell to the illness, and her family thought it would be a good idea to raise funds for the charity in memory of Campbell and to raise awareness of AMMF.

There was a huge amount of rope and all sorts of litter.“Beyond that there was general litter such as Coke bottles, beer cans, and a few face masks. The only odd thing we found was a massive oxygen tank.”Highlighting the volume of rubbish encountered during the clean, he added: “Nearly everyone who came along was from the community and they had seen this litter building up over the last two years.“The beach clean is an annual event we tend to do in April but we had to cancel last year’s so this year is basically two years’ worth including two winter storms’ worth.”When asked how much of the responsibility for the mess he believed lay with local people, he went on to say: “Some of the litter will certainly be from local industry but so much of it will be dropped from people on the island – whether locally or swept in.“The problem is not just local to here, it’s a UK-wide issue.”Addressing the challenges facing the village more broadly, Mr Watson said: “On Friday one of our contractors pulled up two trailers of fly-tipped metal down the side of one of the bridges away from the beach.“That has been years’ worth of local people dumping bikes, climbing frames and all sorts of bits and pieces. Both the Woodland Trust and the Uig Community Trust were speaking today about how we can make a bigger impact through this event, and how we can cover the whole of the community.“There is real potential for the event to be an Uig clean as a whole and not just a beach clean.“A lot of people were saying that it was the first event that they had been to in well over a year, while some of the older people hadn’t seen anyone for months.“It was a real feel-good event from that side of things.“There was a mixture of working-age parents through to retired folks.“It was great to see the kids there and have a chat with their parents.

Personally I would think social housing should be a priority.”While Helen Grianan said: “Will these houses be £, or under  If not, they are not affordable housing for locals or key workers.”Calum J Morrison from North Uist was in favour of the scheme saying: “Sounds like a good type of thing in my opinion, the dude seems to know what he’s doing, good luck to him I say!”Annie B Campbell, meanwhile, highlighted broader issues with housing on the island, stating: “Key workers, like some NHS and teachers, are being outbid for most of the houses that come on the market in Skye.“They are not ‘officially’ homeless so do not have enough points to qualy for council housing.“Some are forced to skip between illegal short term lets. This is not simply a locals versus incomers issue.“Key workers coming to fill essential jobs on the island and local families need somewhere to live. There is a very real housing crisis.”Mr Garton Jones said the price of the houses could not be confirmed until planning permission was obtained.However, in the last few days, he took to social media to try to address worries that people on the island will be priced-out of buying the properties.“There has been a lot of focus on the larger family house we are hoping to build but  of the  houses we are building are smaller, three bedroom, houses,” he commented.Kevin McMahon simply asked: “Will there be a first refusal for locals and the children of local families ”In response, Mr Garton Jones said: “I am happy to confirm that the properties will not be sold via the Scottish ‘sealed bids offers over’ system but will be sold at a fixed price on a first-come, first-served basis.“Obviously until we have planning, we cannot sell the houses, but we have opened up a ‘waiting list’., which is the only place the houses have so far been mentioned or advertised – have emailed me to express their interest in the houses.“Many of them do, indeed, appear to be locals, although we will not be checking birth certicates as part of the sales process.”He added: “There are  houses in total, soyou would like your name added to the list, please email me via charlie@gartonjonesChisolm talked about his own chances of finding a home, questioned the effectiveness of the Highland Council in its current form, and underlined the importance of investing in smaller communities on the island.“I am living with my parents, and with my work I am fortunate to still live on Skye,” he said.“Saying that, I haven’t taken any steps to purchase a home as the prices do not justy the property, or are just too expensive.“I know people who have taken steps to purchase but were outbid either at the start or last minute.”Chisolm has worked for CalMac since  and says he has thought about moving to the Western Isles due to his poor prospects of finding a home on Skye.He said: “I have strong family connections to Lewis and Harris, and I might have the possibility of moving across as house prices haven’t been affected as much as on Skye in terms of second homes and holiday homes. However, it is now on the rise as on other neighbouring islands.”Chisolm believes a revamp of the local authority is needed to force meaningful change.“Skye is facing issues linked to the lack of investment and communications. That makes me question why are we governed by people in Inverness and not the people of Skye and the surrounding islands.“I look at the Western Isles, and I’m seeing housing developments across the islands in dferent areas with the goal of helping local people stay where they are from, sustaining school numbers — including Gaelic communities — and helping small areas grow.“That should be critical here and not just developing in Portree. Roads, housing, harbour investments are just a few aspects that link together and time is critical.”He added: “It’s very important for young people and young families to stay on the island with the support of affordable housing, whether that’s purchasing or renting.”Chisolm said he had been encouraged by responses to Iomairt an Eilein’s call to action.“Political responses ahead of the election have been very welcoming and we are grateful for the support,” he added. reported on plans to build a new -home private scheme on the outskirts of Portree.Commenting on the merits of the proposal, Chisolm said: “I welcome the new development in Portree, I’m sure many young people and families from Skye will benefit from thesethey are available at an affordable price.“That being said, I do question why we’re only developing in Portree. I can name many schools in surrounding communities that would benefit from even a half of a development like this.”Painting a stark picture of the dficulties facing townships such as Staffin, he said: “Smaller communities are missing out and our school numbers and Gaelic communities are suffering. This should be a wake-up call to our government and ‘our’ council that more housing investments in rural areas will have more of an impact and better outcomes.“We all have a right to articulate our viewpoints and opinions. Not everyone will agree but that’s what makes a community – having dferent voices for the benefit of our island.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1620825021322.jpg--covid_19___wed_12th_may_figures.jpg?1620825021000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20210512newscovid 19 wed 12th may figures","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows No further coronavirus related deaths and  new positive test results.

It truly is a wonderful place and there is nowhere  Id rather be at this stage of Jessicas Journey.”Jessica also asked her mum to share pictures of her with her frame on, saying it will give people the chance to see what she looks like now.Mum Julie recalls the day of surgery, describing it a “bit of a blur” for her.“The Team came to the Ward to see me. Professor Dunaway, the lead surgeon, was smiling, they all were. He said they were finished and all went exceptionally well. I sobbed, happy tears, tears of sheer relief that it was over. He went on to say that there had been absolutely no complications. In fact Jessica had sailed through the surgery. She hadnt even needed a blood transfusion which is almost always a given with this type of surgery. The team advised that it would be another two hours before Jessica would be in recovery.”Julie said those last two hours “were definitely the longest of the day.”“Around pm the nurse took me to recovery, nothing could have prepared me for what I was about to see. Jessica bruised, swollen and had wires, tubes and drains everywhere. But there in the middle of it all her little voice said Mummy can I have something to eat,” recalled Julie.Mum explained that over the next seven days they had “good days and not so good days.”“But the staff on the High Dependency Ward were nothing short of amazing. They looked after me as much as they looked after Jessica. They actually made us feel like we were the only family on the ward, They are very special people who go above and beyond every day for families like ours.”Jessica has amazed staff, surgeons and family with her recovery.On Day  Professor Dunaway told Julie in his entire career he has never seen a recovery like it, describing it as “amazing.”“I replied Our God is amazing, it really has been nothing short of a miracle,” said Julie.As the week progressed the Surgical Team gradually informed Julie of what they had done in theatre.They explained that because Jessica was coping so well under the anaesthetic, they decided to do a little bit extra to ensure that Jessica had the best possible outcome from the surgery.“They didnt just fit the frame as planned, they bone grafted her a new nose, they gave her a cheek lt and plated her forehead. So, in light of all of this it made her recovery even more of a miracle,” smiled Julie“It also re-iterated to me that these surgeons are very special people, who go above and beyond on a daily basis for children like Jessica. They want the very best for them and they will do everything in their power to improve their quality of le. Thank you just doesnt go far enough, we will be eternally grateful to that Team.”Husband Lawrie was able to join Jessica and Julie for the weekend - “to help us with the move”, quipped Julie.“We’ve managed to accumulate quite a bit of ‘stuff’ over the last seven days, but it was horrible having to say goodbye.”Julie reports that Jessica has started to eat and drink more orally so not requiring as many tube feeds, swelling is going down gradually and continuing to improve daily!Regarding her frame, the screws will be turned twice a day for the next few weeks, gradually changing the shape of Jessica’s face.Mum Julie is always very mindful to thank all those who have sent texts, cards gts and prayed for them.“It has been absolutely amazing and were so thankful to have the first week done with no major complications. As someone said to me ‘first week done , a road never to be traveled again’.“It was tough, there were tears . There were good days, there were not so good days but we’ve done it and know that God was with us and will continue to be with us in the days and weeks ahead,” said Julie.And Julie makes no secret of the fact that faith has got her through this very challenging time.“Obviously our faith has been a major factor in how we, as a family, have been able to cope with all of this. And the outpouring of prayer, practical and emotional support from our own church, Ballyloughan Presbyterian, Connor Presbyterian where Jessica attends GB and Youth Club and Woodlands Presbyterian in Carrick who have adopted us, along with many other churches and iniduals from every denomination has been special. And we would like to thank everyone whos been praying and offering practical support, it has meant so much to us and it has been wonderful to see so many people being the church.”Julie said they had every faith in the Surgical Team, and “and more importantly we knew that Jessica and that team were covered in prayer leading up to and for the duration of the surgery. Churches of all denominations, iniduals and groups of people from all faiths had prayer rotas going throughout the day, and so we had a peace about this surgery from the outset.”Indeed, a verse of scripture that was very poignant in the week leading up to this surgery was Isaiah : -  So do not fear, for I am with you, do not be dismayed, for I am your God, I will strengthen you and help you, I will uphold you with my righteous right hand.“This verse was in my head as I walked out of the anaesthetic room that morning, it was the most dficult thing I have ever had to do. But I knew that God was in complete control and would carry Jessica, the team and me through that day and in the days to come,”said Julie.The Jessicas Journey Facebook and Instagram pages have been a real source of encouragement to them as a family over the last couple of weeks.“We currently have .K followers and so I think we have achieved our aim of raising awareness of Craniofacial conditions. The comments, well wishes, prayers and support of thousands of people on the page have carried us through the dark days - thank you to each and every person whos taken the time to comment or message, you really have made a dference and you have restored our faith in humanity,” concluded Julie.

most indoor settings.“Today is a great day for America,” President Joe Biden said during a Rose Garden address heralding the new guidance from the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention .“If you are fully vaccinated, you no longer need to wear a mask,” he said, summarising the new guidance and encouraging more Americans to roll up their sleeves. “Get vaccinated — or wear a mask until you

President Joe Biden speaks in the Rose Garden of the White House The guidance still calls for wearing masks in crowded indoor settings like buses, planes, hospitals, prisons and homeless shelters, but it will help clear the way for reopening workplaces, schools, and other venues — even removing the need for social distancing for those who are fully vaccinated.“We have all longed for this moment — when we can get back to some sense of normalcy,” said Rochelle Walensky, director of the CDC, at an earlier White House briefing.The CDC and the Biden administration have faced pressure to ease restrictions on fully vaccinated people — those who are two weeks past their last required Covid- dose — in part to highlight the benefits of getting the jab.The country’s aggressive vaccination campaign has paid off – US virus cases are at their lowest rate since September, deaths are at their lowest point since last April and the test positivity rate is at the lowest point since the pandemic began.Ms Walensky said the long-awaited change is thanks to the millions of people who have got vaccinated and is based on the latest science about how well those shots are working.“Anyone who is fully vaccinated can participate in indoor and outdoor activities – large or small – without wearing a mask or physically distancing,” Ms Walensky said. “If you are fully vaccinated, you can start doing the things that you had stopped doing because of the pandemic.”\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news world-news d .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_fa-eb-c-ba-eeafd_embedded

I got chatting to him and thats how I got involved with Sinn Feacutein in our area. Learning about British influence in Ireland and all the damage that had done, and the hurt and pain that had been caused through the generations as a result, I could see Irish unity as the solution. Thats what I became focused on the reunication of the country and seeing this place recognised as it should be, in my view. googletag.cmd.push  LT: What has been your biggest achievement  ES: I would say the wins for people on the ground. When somebody contacts you about a care package, or a big pothole outside their house which is a safety issue, those are the biggest wins. If someone comes to you with a problem that is causing them anxiety, and you can do something that gets that sorted, the sense of satisfaction is great.  LT: And your biggest challenge  ES: It really winds me up when we get compared to the DUP and characterised as a green version. We are polar opposites in every way. googletag.cmd.push Were a left-wing progressive party, but we get characterised as another version of the DUP, and that easy narrative is completely inaccurate. Were not opposed to the British monarchy because of iniduals within the British royal family, were opposed to it because it sets one group of people above everyone .  LT: You were co-opted in  for Ian Milne. Your first election campaign will be coming up – are you excited or apprehensive  ES: Elections are always an interesting time, there is high pressure, hard work and long days, but Im relishing the opportunity to get out and get chatting to people.     The idea of getting involved in the discussion is one thing, the idea of being up for election itself is obviously daunting. Im there as a member of an incredible team. We have  class councillors in Mid Ulster, so its not like Im going in without support. Emma Sheerin with fellow Mid Ulster MLAs Michelle ONeill and Linda Dillon. LT: As a young woman in politics, have you faced any online abuse from anonymous trolls  ES: I do get troll accounts and faceless people. I remember the night I was selected and people were on social media congratulating me and welcoming me to the MLA team. This one person put up a meme of a wee pig running around with the caption oh great, another pig in a skirt. I cracked up laughing. get more frustrated on social media when its people that I know parroting out something that isnt true than I would be about faceless accounts calling me names.  LT: Youre the Equality Spokesperson for Sinn Feacutein. Did it sit comfortably for you abstaining in the recent vote on the Severe Foetal Impairment Bill in the Assembly  ES: We had a lot of conversations about how to handle that, and the reason we abstained was because the British government had made it very clear that they were going to uphold the law in the North. We knew this bill, whilst making its way through the Assembly, wasnt actually going to affect any material change, because the British government were going to overturn it. The DUP were playing politics. They used sensationalised versions of peoples stories to make political gains and appeal to a certain base. If we were going to start voting for or trying to amend, we would be engaging with them. The people that are affected by this issue have been traumatised enough and we didnt want to see that carry on. The debate has been had, the law has been set in order to be human rights compliant. Its a very sensitive issue and people have very strong feelings on one side or the other.  LT: Youre rooted in South Derry. How dficult is it to balance the constituency work with Stormont business  ES: It can be trying at times, because when Stormont is running at full tilt, its fairly full-on. At the minute, the schedule is cut slightly, but outside of Coronavirus, you could be here til ,, at night. Youre trying to fit in chasing up constituency stuff around that and then on a Friday, youre in the constituency, but youre trying to meet with groups and organisations too.  LT: Until a few weeks ago, three of the main parties had female leaders. Do you think Arlene Foster was unfairly treated by those within her party  ES: Arlene herself, in the cut and thrust of politics, was never a progressive. She was never out there leading from the front, trying to break the glass ceiling for women. I would be fearful of where the DUP are going next, but Arlene didnt vote to ban conversion therapy, she just abstained. On the surface, it looks like Arlene got a raw deal but we didnt see massive steps for progression under her stewardship. Emma Sheerin says Arlene has done little to help the cause of women in politics. LT: Sinn Feacutein have had dficulties in Derry City over the last few weeks. Does it leave a possibility they could concede further ground to the SDLP in Foyle  ES: We would have election reviews in every area and I really dont know how we saw such a big loss in Derry two years ago. We cant worry about what anyone  is doing, we focus on ourselves. We wouldnt like to pre-empt what the results would be in a years time but we hope totwo Sinn Feacutein MLAs in Derry. I know Karen and Martina are hard, hard workers and have been active on the ground. Obviously the results weve had have shown weve had problems and that has led to the decision.  LT: Finally, is there anything youre hoping to achieve in the remainder of this term  ES: Im working on a Private Members Bill at the minute around gender budgeting. Its about identying decision making for the government in the North where they dont factor women in.

I got chatting to him and thats how I got involved with Sinn Feacutein in our area. Learning about British influence in Ireland and all the damage that had done, and the hurt and pain that had been caused through the generations as a result, I could see Irish unity as the solution. Thats what I became focused on the reunication of the country and seeing this place recognised as it should be, in my view. googletag.cmd.push  LT: What has been your biggest achievement  ES: I would say the wins for people on the ground. When somebody contacts you about a care package, or a big pothole outside their house which is a safety issue, those are the biggest wins. If someone comes to you with a problem that is causing them anxiety, and you can do something that gets that sorted, the sense of satisfaction is great.  LT: And your biggest challenge  ES: It really winds me up when we get compared to the DUP and characterised as a green version. We are polar opposites in every way. googletag.cmd.push Were a left-wing progressive party, but we get characterised as another version of the DUP, and that easy narrative is completely inaccurate. Were not opposed to the British monarchy because of iniduals within the British royal family, were opposed to it because it sets one group of people above everyone .  LT: You were co-opted in  for Ian Milne. Your first election campaign will be coming up – are you excited or apprehensive  ES: Elections are always an interesting time, there is high pressure, hard work and long days, but Im relishing the opportunity to get out and get chatting to people.     The idea of getting involved in the discussion is one thing, the idea of being up for election itself is obviously daunting. Im there as a member of an incredible team. We have  class councillors in Mid Ulster, so its not like Im going in without support. Emma Sheerin with fellow Mid Ulster MLAs Michelle ONeill and Linda Dillon. LT: As a young woman in politics, have you faced any online abuse from anonymous trolls  ES: I do get troll accounts and faceless people. I remember the night I was selected and people were on social media congratulating me and welcoming me to the MLA team. This one person put up a meme of a wee pig running around with the caption oh great, another pig in a skirt. I cracked up laughing. get more frustrated on social media when its people that I know parroting out something that isnt true than I would be about faceless accounts calling me names.  LT: Youre the Equality Spokesperson for Sinn Feacutein. Did it sit comfortably for you abstaining in the recent vote on the Severe Foetal Impairment Bill in the Assembly  ES: We had a lot of conversations about how to handle that, and the reason we abstained was because the British government had made it very clear that they were going to uphold the law in the North. We knew this bill, whilst making its way through the Assembly, wasnt actually going to affect any material change, because the British government were going to overturn it. The DUP were playing politics. They used sensationalised versions of peoples stories to make political gains and appeal to a certain base. If we were going to start voting for or trying to amend, we would be engaging with them. The people that are affected by this issue have been traumatised enough and we didnt want to see that carry on. The debate has been had, the law has been set in order to be human rights compliant. Its a very sensitive issue and people have very strong feelings on one side or the other.  LT: Youre rooted in South Derry. How dficult is it to balance the constituency work with Stormont business  ES: It can be trying at times, because when Stormont is running at full tilt, its fairly full-on. At the minute, the schedule is cut slightly, but outside of Coronavirus, you could be here til ,, at night. Youre trying to fit in chasing up constituency stuff around that and then on a Friday, youre in the constituency, but youre trying to meet with groups and organisations too.  LT: Until a few weeks ago, three of the main parties had female leaders. Do you think Arlene Foster was unfairly treated by those within her party  ES: Arlene herself, in the cut and thrust of politics, was never a progressive. She was never out there leading from the front, trying to break the glass ceiling for women. I would be fearful of where the DUP are going next, but Arlene didnt vote to ban conversion therapy, she just abstained. On the surface, it looks like Arlene got a raw deal but we didnt see massive steps for progression under her stewardship. Emma Sheerin says Arlene has done little to help the cause of women in politics. LT: Sinn Feacutein have had dficulties in Derry City over the last few weeks. Does it leave a possibility they could concede further ground to the SDLP in Foyle  ES: We would have election reviews in every area and I really dont know how we saw such a big loss in Derry two years ago. We cant worry about what anyone  is doing, we focus on ourselves. We wouldnt like to pre-empt what the results would be in a years time but we hope totwo Sinn Feacutein MLAs in Derry. I know Karen and Martina are hard, hard workers and have been active on the ground. Obviously the results weve had have shown weve had problems and that has led to the decision.  LT: Finally, is there anything youre hoping to achieve in the remainder of this term  ES: Im working on a Private Members Bill at the minute around gender budgeting. Its about identying decision making for the government in the North where they dont factor women in. You end up with these sort of systemic, built-in inequalities from a starting point, so its trying to tackle that at root cause so outcomes are more likely to be equal. The impact of Covid- on women has shown up they are more than likely to carry the burden of domestic responsiblities or caring responsibilities.

This year more than ever, it is important to celebrate the incredible contributions that nurses make to our society. One such inidual who deserves a special mention is Macmillan lung cancer nurse specialist Margaret Carlin who was named Cancer Nurse of the Year  at the Royal College of Nursing Awards NI. Margaret is from Magherafelt and is based at Antrim Area Hospital. She has been caring for local people for almost  years and has just retired from her full-time post. googletag.cmd.push Margaret took up her role as a Macmillan Clinical Nurse Specialist in the Mid Ulster Hospital in . “My post was created as a result of collaboration between Macmillan Cancer Support and what is now the Northern Health and Social Care Trust,” recalls Margaret. “It was important to have a full-time nurse specialist who could provide expert advice, support and information to patients who were living with cancer or a le limiting illness.” Following Margaret’s appointment, her sterling work in the community was well known. Funds, however, were needed to continue to support her role and this inspired a group of iniduals in the Magherafelt area to form a fundraising committee. googletag.cmd.push In their time, Magherafelt Fundraising Committee raised over pound,, pounds for Macmillan Cancer Support in Northern Ireland. “Over the years I have met and cared for many people with cancer and other le limiting conditions, often at times of great distress for them, their families and loved ones,” explains Margaret. “They have allowed me into their lives and to be with them throughout their illness. They have shared their thoughts and feelings with me and told me about their hopes and fears for the future. We laughed together and sometimes we cried together. “Throughout the years, I continue to meet people who I met at the time when they were diagnosed with cancer.     “I am always glad to see them and it makes me really happy to see the quality of le they continue to have. I also meet many families whose loved ones I cared for, who sadly have died, and I am always touched that they remember me and the times we spent together. “They tell me about their lives now and changes there have been. “They tell me how their children and grandchildren have grown up and are doing well and this reminds me that I will always be part of their memories and how privileged I am to be a Macmillan nurse.” Margaret initially trained as a nursing student in Mid Ulster Hospital from - and following this worked as a staff nurse in the Mid Ulster Hospital. It was in October  that she became a Macmillan nurse, delivering chemotherapy to patients as well as helping to set up and establish palliative care services. In , Margaret moved to Antrim Area Hospital as Macmillan Lung Cancer Nurse Specialist. “Since Margaret moved to Antrim Area Hospital, she has worked tirelessly to raise the standards of the care delivered to patients diagnosed with lung cancer,” explains Sally Convery, Macmillan Service Lead for Palliative Care. “Margaret is passionate about caring for the inidual and is very focused on ensuring patients are recognised as people and not by their diagnosis. “She encourages them to focus on the positive aspects of le and not on their diagnosis. Margaret is an excellent role model to the other lung cancer nurses and demonstrates her passion for ensuring safe and effective care. “She continually strives to improve the patient’s quality of le and has shown outstanding commitment to the creation and delivery of a pulmonary prehabilitation self-management programme for patients with lung cancer. “Margaret believes it is important services are delivered with patients and relatives at the forefront and because of this she is involved in and promotes ious lung cancer support groups in the area as well as co-ordinating a support group that is regularly reviewed by patients. “As well as this, she has driven forward a campaign to increase the awareness of lung cancer symptoms and has lead a team of her colleagues to visit local shopping centres and share leaflets ensuring members of the public are aware of the signs and symptoms of lung cancer. She is always looking at ways to get the message out there in innovative ways.” Sally continued: “Margaret is a wonderful resource of expert knowledge and she has certainly shown outstanding leadership in cancer and palliative care for almost  years’ service. “We are delighted that she has agreed tofor a short time following her retirement to ensure the service continues to deliver high quality care and we wish her the very best in her future, we will miss her.” Margaret concluded: “Although I have officially retired from my full-time post, I will continue in my role as a Macmillan lung cancer nurse specialist two days a week for another year. “I will really miss my colleagues and all the people that I have met and cared for over the years.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It was a day when injury time was a game all of its own. Derrys plight was outside their own hands. News of Down trailing in Cork filtered through to Brewster Park where Carlus McWilliams stoppage time point grabbed victory. But it wasnt enough. Jerome Johnston saved Down with a thminute equaliser. Derrys inferior score dference saw them drop below Clare and Down, to the drop zone, and out of the top half of Irelands football rankings. Of the six teams in Division  that weekend, Dublin, Kerry, Donegal, Tyrone and Monaghan remain there. Since then, Derry have dropped to Division , bounced back and fell victim to a horrendous start last season that keeps them in Irelands bottom half. googletag.cmd.push If eight team leagues arent competitive enough, Derry are stepping into the fire this weekend, in the Covid- induced four-team leagues. In the distance, Fermanagh and Ulster champions Cavan come down the tracks, but Saturdays trip to Longford will tell a lot in a -day period that will define Derrys season. Mention Longford to any Derry fan, and it will generate that sickening feeling in the pit of their stomach. Digging deeper, since the turn of the millennium, the sides have played eight times in league and championship, with Derry winning three of them. Of the five Derry played on their travels, you have to go back to a  All-Ireland series for their only win. It was a day when current Longford manager Padraic Davis kicked six points, as Derry hammered them in just the second year of the qualiers, thanks to two Anthony Tohill goals. googletag.cmd.push More recently Derry tanked them at Celtic Park last year, but they were without experienced trioMichael Quinn, Barry McKeon and David McGivney. Speaking to the County Derry Post last week, Rory Gallagher reported an almost clean bill of health.

After expressing a desire to , he is back in the fold.     In the off-season, Chrissy McKaigue and Brendan Rogers had knee operations, after years of wear and tear, with Padraig Cassidy going through a rehabilitation programme on a troublesome hip injury. There is a greater consistency to the . Of the  players Rory Gallagher gave inter-county debuts to last year, only Eoghan Duffy and Alex Doherty are no longer on the . Of the current squad, only newcomers Conleth McShane and his Bellaghy teammate Ronan McFaul have yet to make their debut. The championship will take care of itself when it comes around. Before that, its hard to imagine it even being discussed in the group. Getting off to a winning start is the only show in town. Momentum is sports most useful tool. With it, so much of everything  follows. Derry are well-placed. Having almost everyone fit for selection is one plus. The squad are in tip top shape and there has to be positives from elements of the Armagh performance in last years championship. Defensively, there are vast improvements to be made. With McKinless in the mix and with Karl McKaigue ing, it will create more competition and with it, the standards will rise. Thats the first improvement. Those early exchanges left Armagh playing the game on their own terms. Any shot Longford get away this weekend, will need to be under more than token pressure. Longford have only failed to hit the net in six of the  games under Padraic Davis in the last two seasons. Secondly, getting a medium to long-range kick-out option is another thing Derry need to find. Working the ball out short is okay to an extent, but it is energy sapping and doesnt ask enough questions of the opposition. Half the Derry squad come from Glen , Slaughtneiland Magherafelt , teams with their goalkeepers going short more often than not. A more ied Derry at midfield, will give them so many more options up front. This is where many of the gains are to be had, but it plonks responsibility on Emmett Bradley and the untested Conor Glass. Yes, the former minor captain was a professional athlete, but he has been away from the game for the last five years. Thirdly, in attack, Shane McGuigan is the star of the show and getting him a regular wing-man up front is a must. If Derry can improve in these three areas, they can go one better than last season and gain promotion. But it will be far from easy.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

With new movie Stealth due to premiere before the end of this month, the company is currently working on Grief, a film detailing the pain and loss caused by the Covid- pandemic. The second instalment of Long Shot, entitled Long Shot’s Letter, is also due for completion. After Grief is shot and edited by mid-June, its on to West Banksy which will deal with drug addiction and abuse. googletag.cmd.push The groups alternative news programme, It’s News To Me, will be launched in September and it is hoped three more short films by the end of the year, one of which will focus on bullying in the secondary sector. Joseph McCarthy, writer, director and producer with Black North, which he founded, said: “We have already sourced school ties and shirts and will need to source jumpers, trousers and skirts too. “In between times, we will complete the third part of our Troubles’ Trilogy, so we will be very busy for some time. We will also be casting for new members when the lockdown lts.” googletag.cmd.push Joseph said Black North Productions was formed to get the message out there that the North of Ireland is not a place to avoid, not a place of hate and despair. He added: “The North of Ireland is a beautul place, populated by friendly people who have been trapped by history that is not of our making. We aim to show the positive aspects of Northern Ireland, that is second to no other place in artistic talent.” Joe explained how Black North came into being. “We came about due to a marked lack of opportunity for people who had artistic ability, but in essence no real outlet. I began writing poetry and plays some years ago and I wrongly assumed that long established arts venues would nurture new talent.     “A good example of this was when I tried to get one of my plays performed in the city. I approached the then chief executive of that venue and spoke with a  of their governing body regarding getting some assistance to have my play produced. Unfortunately, I quickly discovered that there was an insular attitude and mercenary outlook, which left me both surprised and disappointed. “Needless to say, I have had no contact with either that venue or those art experts since. It’s interesting to note, that the play I approached them with which was called Enough is Enough won the University of Ulster’s Greer Garson Award for Theatre soon after that meeting. I formed the impression that I was being grilled on that occasion and that in itself, was an unpleasant experience. “I came up with idea of forming Black North Productions and at that particular time, the North of Ireland was being avoided by many people from the Republic of Ireland and the UK. The Nordies were cast in a dark light that we simply did not deserve to be in that position. I set out to show that we in the North, and in particular our city, can produce poetry, plays and short films that can be deemed as artistic works of the highest quality. “There was never any formal meeting or expressions of interest highlighted at that time. I came up with idea, developed the idea, enlisted the help of others who were of the same mind-set, both regarding the attitudes of outsiders to the North of Ireland and the dismal lack of assistance that prevailed in the city and unfortunately still does to a large extent.” Black Norths first film was Wish You Were Here. Joe explained its storyline: “It revolved around a writer played by Greta McTeague, who whilst writing a detective novel gets, side-tracked by the historic events that have happened in the city. The film opens in  and in her mind she imagines she is speaking with the people from that time. The central character is the likeable and fair- minded Michael Quinlivan. I intended to produce a Trouble’s Trilogy moving from  to  and then to present day. “The theme was in essence about the Trouble’s children, who lived through that period, suffered so much and yet seamlessly formed bonds with total strangers who shared the same experiences and through those experience formed bonds that still exist today.” To date, Black North has made six films – as well as Wish You Were Here, there has been Right Reasons For Wrong, Long Shot, F-, Unlucky Lucky and andSnowflake Generation. Joseph added: “We will premiere Stealth by the end of the month and have quite a lot of work completed on our final Troubles film, Half Ticket No Return. but due to such a large cast and the urrent restrictions, we have had to put that one onhold.” Joseph said Stealth was a really interesting piece. He added: “It is set in both present day and the future and shows our technical abilities and innovations through an intriguing storyline that will make people sit up and think. It is very much an Orwellian piece with a modern twist.” Black North is currently working on Grief, telling the story of loss due to the pandemic. Joe said it came about for a number of reasons. He added: “Having known so many people who have lost loved ones and listened to their heart-wrenching stories of not getting to say that final goodbye, or to be there when they felt they were most needed, made me feel that there needs to be some kind of closure. A chance to say that final farewell.” Joseph conceded the films topic was dficult topic to deal with it. He said: “As we all know, Covid- has had a devastating effect on so many people and has brought entire countries to a standstill. “It was a dficult topic to deal with in a sensitive and constructive way, I have done my best to alleviate the sense of loss and hurt that this terrible virus has caused. “I really hope that we, as a team, have done that. From our extras, who will play mourners, to the bikers who will escort the coffin into the city, to our choir and central characters played by Jamie Coll, Chantel Carlin, Gabriel White, Kieran Dallas, Corey Hanna and Dean O’Donnell, I really hope we have.” So, how did the bikers become involved  Joseph explained: “Gerry McGeady, a leading light with Centurions MC, is the main man when it came to organising bikers. “Gerry is a well-respected biker of many years and has strong connections to the world of bikers and, in particular, the local clubs. “I have to thank him for all his efforts in bringing together a dedicated bunch of bikers in the form of The Exiles RC and The Centurions MCC. “The bikers are a great team to work with and they are keen to become involved in Grief as they too understand the immense sense of loss felt by so many people.” Joseph said Black Norths was very proud of its wide range of cast members. He said: “The pandemic has made casting for parts very dficult for us, but we have done our best to continue to bring in new members and Grief will comprise of several new member and a younger cast. “Quite often, a member will suggest a family member who would suit a part or a friend or relative and once we give that person a piece to perform and have a chat with him her, we then film them and take it from there. “We are proud of our wide and ied cast members. “We have people from all backgrounds such as: bricklayers, plasterers, council workers, accountants, health care workers, secondary school pupils, students, basically from every walk of le. “Some people were hesitant and lacked confidence, those same people are now much more confident and outgoing. “Indeed, this has been one of greatest achievements to date, to see people develop and grow in confidence, people who would never have had an opportunity to become involved in film.”                                         --  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Dr Glynn said he is hopeful that additional measures will not be required for the county in the coming weeks and he is confident that the situation in Donegal will improve quickly. He was speaking at a press briefing for the media in Donegal on Wednesday following the fallout from comments made by chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan last Friday about the high incidence of Covid- in the county. googletag.cmd.push There has been a backlash in Donegal to the tone of the comments Dr Holohan made when he said there were concerns about things happening in the county that “even the dogs on the street” know shouldn’t be happening. Figures released at the press briefing put the national incidence rate in the county at  cases per , people compared to a national rate of . The highest rates are in the Milford local electoral area at . and the Letterkenny area where the rate is .. The lowest rate in the county is in the Donegal LEA at .. The briefing was told there were  GP referrals for testing in the county on Tuesday, an increase of % on the same day last week. googletag.cmd.push Dr Glynn said the concerns were raised last week so that people can take protective measures and ensure the situation does not get worse. He said there is a bigger number of smaller clusters in Donegal than in other parts of the country. “It was not meant as blame. It certainly was not made as a threat,” he said. “It would be very strange for us to preside over a situation where incidence is very high and increasing in a county and not draw attention to that.” At the briefing, director of public health for the HSE in the north-west, Dr Anthony Breslin, highlighted a number of clusters that have occurred due to events in the county in recent weeks, including awake, a family gathering and an th birthday party.     The events resulted in dozens of cases and infections in workplaces, in families and at a school. One social gathering has been linked to  cases of Covid-, he said. Dr Glynn said that there are concerns about the situation in the county and that some people in Donegal have “pushed the boundaries”. “We are concerned about the current incidence. That is not to say that Donegal has not come a very long way over the past number of months, just as the rest of the country has, and that can only have happened because the majority of people are trying to do the right thing,” he said. “This is not in any way a reflection on the majority but clearly there are a number of incidents where people have pushed the boundaries. “We have seen that in other counties, it is not just in Donegal. But I suppose the dference at the moment versus some other places where we have particularly high incidences, is that there are large clusters driving incidences. “In Donegal, it seems to be a little bit more widespread with a bigger number of smaller clusters which makes it that little bit harder to control. Sowe can continue to emphasise, andwe can get people who have been pushing the boundaries a little bit just to comply that bit more over the coming weeks, we should see incidence drop quickly in Donegal.” He said we can not get away from the fact that the high incidence rates in parts of the county are due to the fact the disease is being transmitted from person to person. “It gets transmitted from person to person when people come into contact with one another and when for whatever reason masks are not worn, distance is not kept, people who are symptomatic don’t self-isolate. “Right now we are seeing a higher incidence in Donegal than we have in other parts of the country and in that regard, it is incumbent on us as doctors to point out our concerns so that people can take proactive actions because there are many people who remain very vulnerable to this disease over the coming weeks,” he said. “All we are asking people in Donegal to do is to protect themselves and their families. We are not proposing any dferent measures for any one part of Donegal as things currently stand, and I would be hopeful and optimistic given the level of engagement over the past number of days that we wont be looking at some sort of additional measures for the county or any part of the county over the coming weeks.” He said the priority for people over the coming weeks is to meet people outside. “As far as is possible at all, do not meet up with friends or extended families or do not have parties inside. Inside gives this virus such an advantage in terms of transmission,” he said. “Last January Donegal had an incidence of , per ,. It is now  per ,. It is the highest in the country but it’s an order of magnitude lower than where it was and that’s down to the work of the majority doing most of the right things most of the time.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Fairhill and Plantin areas of Draperstown are set for a major overhaul as part of the scheme, with the latter having been plagued by anti social behaviour in recent years. Sinn Feacutein councillor for the area, Catherine Ellatar, has said she hopes the work will be the first step in ing the Plantin to its former glory. “Unfortunately the Plantin has a long history of anti social behaviour,” she said. “I would love for that to change and for people and especially our young people to see it as a communal resource that we can all spend time in, enjoy nature and be proud of. googletag.cmd.push “Vandalism destroys this area for everyone in the village and the cost of repairs has to be met by local rate payers, who are the parents and grandparents of those causing the damage. “They should think of our local area as an extension of their homes and treat it and local residents with the respect and kindness they would expect to be treated with themselves. “I realise the pandemic has meant that young people have not been able to get out and take part in the sporting and social activities they would usually do, over the past year. “I would encourage them to see themselves as the important part of our local community that they are and join with us all in contributing to the great community spirit that exists in Ballinascreen.” googletag.cmd.push The Fairhill is a historic site in the centre of Draperstown, and Cllr Ellatar is hoping it can become a valuable part of the village once again. “The Fairhill has been in a state of disrepair for some time and its great to see work starting to make it a valuable part of the village again,” she said. “It used to be where the sheep sales took place and on a market day, it was a central part of the village. It will be lovely to see it being used again by residents and visitors. “Council officers and our local Sinn Feacutein team have worked hard to secure a lease for the Fairhill and the funding to carry out the work to it and to the Plantin.     “We live in a beautul part of the Sperrins and over recent years we have seen a lot of visitors to the area and hopefully that will continue. “Our local businesses are opening up again and I’m sure would welcome more visitors and potential customers.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Strong partnership working, sharing information and joined up messaging are key across the North West was the message from the Mayors of Derry City, Strabane and Donegal, attending a meeting to discuss the Covid- response in the region. The meeting this week was co-chaired by the two Mayors, Cllr Brian Tierney Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council and An Cathaoirleach Cllr Rena Donaghey of Donegal County Council It was set up to discuss the cross border approach to the COVID  rates across the North West. googletag.cmd.push It was attended by the Chair and Vice Chair of the North West Regional Development Group, Cllr Sandra Duffyand Cllr Ciaran Brogan , as well as the Chief Executives of Derry City and Strabane District Council and Donegal County Council, John Kelpie and John McLaughlin, along with senior Council officials from both Councils. Those attending the meeting were provided with details of the current Covid- infection rates across their respective Council areas and heard about the proactive work being done by both Councils to support the statutory agencies in responding to the pandemic and how they are adapting services and providing support as the NW reopens at the ying stages of recovery. googletag.cmd.push While concern was expressed at the high infection rate in both Council areas, there was general acknowledgement that compliance was high across the region with the majority of the public adhering to the guidelines and taking all the necessary steps in order to keep each other safe. Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council Cllr Brian Tierney said the region faced challenges as a result of the iance in the lting of restrictions but that he was confident people on both sides of the border were acting responsibly. He thanked the public for their commitment and support to date urging them to continue to make good decisions.     As the restrictions are lted gradually on both sides of the border, he said it is important everyone continues to act cautiously and adhere to the messages around social distancing, wearing face coverings and regular hand sanitisation. He said: The people of the North West have been amazing throughout this pandemic. They have rallied around one another and supported each other in dficult times. However, its important that we understand that Covid hasnt gone away – its still here and its still spreading. Its still important that we dont let our guard down that we continue to look out for one another. There are small things we can do to protect each other – when we are out walking and see friends we must stand back and keep a distance, when we are going to the shops we must remember to take our face masks and our hand sanitiser and give other customers some space. An Cathaoirleach Cllr Rena Donaghey acknowledged the huge amount of work being done by the two councils, the statutory agencies and health bodies on both sides of the border. She said the strong partnership approach and collaborative work to respond to the Covid- numbers in the region was key in reducing the rate of infection. She said the roll out of the vaccination programmes was hugely positive in providing hope for the future and that all this was good news in providing support to businesses as the Councils work together to rebuild the NW economy. Cllr Donaghey said: We are a region that relies on one another. We have strong family and business connections and our lives are intertwined in everything that we do. It is important therefore in the days ahead and coming weeks and that we avoid attributing blame but work together towards a common goal of protecting our communities from this virus. The people of Donegal, Derry and Strabane are one community, we look out for one another and support one another through thick and thin. Lets continue to do that and work together to keep each other safe so that we can look forward to a better future for all of us. It was agreed at the meeting that the Councils and statutory agencies would continue to share information and work collectively in the weeks and months ahead as the North West region takes small cautious steps towards recovery.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Even so, he was also at pains to point out that he was not attacking the minister.ldquoThere are numerous issues regarding the Downe and Daisy Hill that need to be dealt with face to face with the minister, he said.ldquoWe have engaged with health trusts until we are blue in the face and we are getting nowhere.

Mackerel and Irish Sea herring continue to be landed in Ardglass.The report says there is inadequate space for growing the inshore fleet at the port as the quayside is dominated by the larger demersal fleet and occasional visiting pelagic vessels, with the adjoining marina for the exclusive use of leisure craft.A constraint to the landside development of the harbourrsquos estate is the mixed ownership of existing properties which prevents the Fishery Harbour Authority from having full control over activities at the port and limits the ability to plan strategically.As a result, the Fishing and Seafood Development Programme proposes a poundm budget to purchase properties and prepare buildings and land within the harbour for redevelopment.With the cost of the work at the main harbour estimated at poundm, the report explains the figure can only be revised following the completion of a bathymetric survey.Ardglass councillor Dermot Curran said he was keen to meet with Mr Poots to discuss the detail of the report and the level of work required.ldquoThe report highlights the development of an lsquoIrish Sea hub in Kilkeel and I know that many in Ardglass will be keen to hear from the minister what exactly this means. Ardglass plays a critical role in the Co Down fishing industry and its contribution to this key sector must be expanded, he said.ldquoThere are two major processing factories in Ardglass and work to dredge the harbour to facilitate larger vessels is a critical component of the investment that is required.Cllr Curran said investment was required to meet the needs of the existing fleet and future vessels.He added: ldquoThe village fleet has increased over the years and those who work in the industry say while they are not necessarily expecting a huge increase in the number of boats, they do anticipate an increase in the quality of boats and for that to happen, the harbour must be fit for purpose.Mr Poots said he hoped the publication of the report ldquomarks the beginning of a new chapter in the history of the provincersquos fishing industry.ldquoThe report highlights the considerable investment that is required to help the industry adapt to the challenges it faces and grasp the opportunities presented following the United Kingdomrsquos exit from the EU, he explained.ldquoWe need to build a stronger and more resilient fishing and seafood industry that can adapt to change. Of course, this will not be easy but I hope that with government and industry working together we can build new infrastructure, become more prosperous, improve the marine environment and enhance our reputation as suppliers of quality sustainable seafood.Mr Poots said his department will be engaging with stakeholders to discuss the findings of the report over the next few weeks and hopes that the next phase of work towards harbour investment can proceed shortly.He also confirmed that later in the year DAERA will be consulting on plans for a future fisheries fund to address the wider needs of the fishing industry..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/12thMay2021-Cara.jpg","title":"Cara opens first ever Irish Roots festival  ","story":"A CARRYDUFF schoolgirl was honoured at the weekend when she was asked to open the inaugural global Irish Roots online festival.Twelve year-old Cara Mailey is no stranger to appearing in television having appeared in several CBBC programmes over the last two years.However, on Sunday she became a storyteller for the festival which seeks to celebrate Irish people around the world with dferent skin colours.Along with Orla McKeating, the founder of Still I Rise Diversity Storytelling, Cara read two stories mdash Happy in Our Skin and I Am Whole.Both books celebrate dferent skin colours and celebrated the uniqueness of peoplesrsquo skin colours.Cara, who attends Assumption Grammar School in Ballynahinch, was born with achonlasia, a form of dwarfism.She also had the opportunity to share her story, what she likes about her skin and then she also talked about what it was like being dferent to other children her age.Orla also read a third book called the The Little Crayon, a childrenrsquos story book written by -year-old Amelia Kai, also from Belfast.The daughter of Tricia Mailey, a teacher at Cedar Integrated Primary School in Crossgar, Cara has a big personality and has appeared on CBBCrsquos Dengineers and Crafty Party.Tricia said: ldquoCara has read for Still I Rise now for about a year.

Interested developers have already been informed of the pending opportunity to submit their proposals.Councillors were told that all of the work to date has focused on site access via current access routes from Market Street and Irish Street, with officials reaffirming that as part of the feasibility study, one option that was explored mdash but subsequently rejected mdash was providing a road access linking Irish Street with St Patrickrsquos Avenue.ldquoTo explore the purchase of additional lands at this stage would mean that the development brief process would have to be suspended and the business case revisited in line with land valuations, councillors were told.ldquoThe development brief has been drafted in such a way to allow developers to bring additional lands that they may choose to acquire to enhance their plans.The council paper added: ldquoAs part of the development brief, car parking provision will have to be demonstrated and how it is achieved will again be up to the innovation of bids brought forward. Car parking will be a key requirement in the assessment process and indeed planning approval process.Moving forward, there is an acknowledgement that the current Irish Street car park is badly laid out and that the redevelopment proposal provides an opportunity to address this, paving the way for it to be used for future events, markets and festivals, with the DfC and local council prepared to provide additional funding to allow this to happen.Signicantly, developers interested in the prime town centre site are being asked to focus on how their chosen scheme can potentially contribute to Downpatrickrsquos night-time economy post Covid, providing a boost for residents and help attract visitors to Downpatrick.As part of continuing work on the Irish Street revitalisation programme, graphics recently appeared on the front of the former police base, while the archway at the entrance to the Irish Street car park will be painted.Downpatrick councillors say they are acutely aware that the opportunity to redevelop a huge area of town centre land will not happen again, with the redevelopment plan having the potential to provide a boost for existing traders who have been at the heart of the town centre economy for decades..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/12thMay2021-DundrumCricket.jpg","title":"Dundrum thirds make historic league debut  ","story":"SUNDAY was a momentous day in the history of Dundrum Cricket Club.For the first time the club have been able to enter a thirds team into league cricket and the Meadow was the venue as Dundrum took the field against Ards seconds with a team packed with experience and plenty of youth too.Dundrum captain Neil Reilly won the toss and elected to bat on a super wicket that the ground staff had prepared for the seconds the day before, but had not been used due to bad weather.In the first over, opener Eoin Moag nicked a gooddelivery which was caught frombehind by the Ards wicketkeeper,.This was followed in the second over by a Jack Calvert drive catching the edge of the bat and flying straight up to be caught, leaving Dundrum on  for .The tricky start was made worse when the captain was run out by a sharp piece of fielding from Ards, leaving the hosts on  for .This brought together a partnership between Keba Butler and Kristofer McNeill which finally found traction and started to produce a decent score.By the time Kristofer had been bowled for , the score had risen to  for  with some cracking shots by both batsman which on another day would have produced even more runs, but on a damp outfield restricted the number of fours.Andrew Hammond came in and produced a fast hitting nine to supplement Kebarsquos continued run chase which culminated in a not out score of  by the end of the allotted  overs.Ards came into bat and had a fast start, reaching  without loss after only three overs,.The captainrsquos second over proved to be a turning point in picking up two wickets for just a single run.

Ireland did not hesitate to police the border when it thought it appropriate.Yet Northern Ireland is, in effect, not allowed to police the border in , even when we are far ahead on vaccinations.Stormont should today confirm the May  reopening of outlets such as restaurants, and outline a clear route to changes in mixing of households, travel and tourism, including the essentialof free movement within the Common Travel Area.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityVale of Glamorgan council put forward Aberthaw, a recently closed coal-fired power plant, as a potential site for a fusion prototype.The UK government last year called for suggestions for possible sites to pioneer the technology which could generate electricity with low carbon emissions.But opposition councillors on the Vale council have claimed the cabinet has ldquorushed through its decision to suggest Aberthaw as a site.More NewsCardf Tomasz Waga murder investigation sees two more arrestedFour coffee shops in Penarth for meeting a friend outdoorsThings to do in South Wales on May Bank Holiday weekend Plaid Councillor Ian Johnson said: ldquoIt was strange that the council leadership did not consult with other parties or ask a cross-party scrutiny committee to consider issues before making the expression of interest about a possible future use of the Aberthaw plant.ldquoEven though it is an early point, many people will have questions about the technology, the impact of the development and the process, and discussing this in scrutiny would open up the debate and ensure transparency.Fusion technology is still in its infancy and no fusion reactor has ever created more power than it consumes. But scientists say it could be cleaner and safer than fission, the nuclear technology currently used to generate electricity.If Aberthaw is chosen, the council is hoping the power plant could bring lots of high-tech high-paid jobs to the region. Westminster should decide on a site by the end of next year, and the power plant would be built by , costing about pound billion.But the Valersquos cabinet used controversial emergency powers last month to put forward Aberthaw as a site, without consulting the full council or any scrutiny committees. Council leader Neil Moore said this was due to the deadline for suggestions at the end of last month.     However, Westminster made the initial call for suggestions in December last year, meaning the council had four months in total to debate and scrutinise the decision to put forward Aberthaw. The council debated the issue in a meeting this week, after the deadline passed.Conservative Cllr Gordon Kemp said: ldquoThis is being dealt effectively without allowing any proper consideration or scrutiny. Itrsquos an extremely signicant matter, evenwe ignore the issue of public concern over such a proposal.ldquoWersquore looking at potentially a colossal, massive investment in the Vale. It could create many jobs, so I think itrsquos something that should have been discussed.ldquoI appreciate there are always deadlines on this. But Irsquom very concerned and surprised this wasnrsquot put before cabinet and scrutiny committees [earlier].Cllr Moore said the issue was ldquonot a debate, but promised to meet with the leaders of the opposition parties on the council, and to give a cross-party scrutiny committee a chance to consider the plans.He said: ldquoThis is just for noting. We used the emergency procedure because it had to be in by a deadline. This is not a debate about what we can do.ldquoBut Irsquom more than happy to have a meeting with the group leaders, and Irsquom more than happy to ask for an information report to go to the environment and regeneration scrutiny committee. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

During my  years as a community campaigner I have passionately campaigned for education, creating more opportunities for young people, tackling the housing crisis and the climate crisis. I was the regeneration officer for the Loudoun Square and Trowbridge redevelopment, and was selected as the Wales delegate for the International Association for Community Development and Commonwealth Games in Glasgow . Over the last  years Irsquove supported young people in Cardf South and Penarth to develop their skills in the arts and creative industries and to participate in a wide range of opportunities. I successfully gained the London  Olympic Cultural Inspire Mark for Butetown Community. I entered politics because of the increasing injustice around me - increasing food banks, homelessness, education, climate crisis, lack of opportunity for our youth, lack of affordable housing I was sick and tired of our communities being treated like second class citizens by the London elite. I want a fair deal for our communities for Cardf South and Penarth and for Wales.Alan Golding - Freedom Alliance. No Lockdown. No CurfewsRaised in Tonyrefail, Rhondda Cynon Taff, I have since lived in Brighton and Glasgow, moving to Cardf in . Since my early twenties Irsquove been interested in the workings of society and how we treat each other, animals and our planethellip and in the process Irsquove come to completely mistrust virtually all career politicians. I believe a new way of doing politics is needed in Wales with a new set of values across the whole system. I donrsquot believe the current political structure and its controllers have the interest of the people at its heart with regard to their mental and physical health, their quality of le and spiritual and economic well-being.     Paul Campbell - UKIPHello Im Paul Campbell and Im standing in the Cardf South and South Wales Central area for UKIP in the Senedd elections on MAY TH.Being. Born in Cardf and lived most of my le there I appreciate the Greatv Potential the pride and the Welsh Identity in Cardf and the Valleys towns. and I have seen how things have changed over the years with parts of the area unrecognizable from the place I remember.Areas of Cardf have become run down and standards have fallen with a loss of community spirit The surrounding Towns have been neglected with. A lack of investment and job creation initiatives.Mass immigration in the UK has put tremendous strains on cities like Cardf Newport and Swansea with wage depression and overstretched public services.. The Conservatives claim to be in control of immigration but they will only ever talk about it and under there watch in the in the last  years  million more people have come to our shires thats  cities the sthe size of Cardf . Increasingly they are choosing to come to Wales as Labour has encouraged them by a making Wales a Nation Of sanctuary.Helen Westhead - Green PartyOur current administration has ignored the climate emergency and has left so many people vulnerable and excluded. As we recover from the pandemic we have unique opportunity to create better ways of working - the influence of an elected Green in the room will be transformative.We see from across the UK, Europe, and beyond the incredible dference Greens make, holding government to account, speaking out against inequality, and representing real people and their communities, not political or corporate interest. Wales is long overdue that representation in the Senedd.We know that the way we recover from this pandemic and build back stronger is through investing in communities and public services, ensuring everyone has access to local facilities, and supporting small business. If elected, one of my main priorities would be better walking and cycling routes, connected to affordable public transport and green outdoor spaces that communities can enjoy. Advocating for a Universal Basic Income would ensure no one is left behind in our bold plan to transform Wales.With the more proportional voting system on the regional ballot in Wales, Labour cannot win regional seats. A Green vote on your second ballot is the only progressive option.Matt Friend - PropelPropel has led the campaigns on two of the most important issues affecting Barry, Penarth and Cardf.Wersquore the only party that has committed not to allow any nuclear mud to be dumped in our waters, including the mud dredged from outside Hinkley nuclear reactor in Somerset.And wersquore the only party that even mentions the scandal of dangerous fire risk cladding on so many of our flats and buildings. Through our Contract with Wales we have committed not to issue new building contracts to any housing developer involved in the scandal, until they have paid to fix the problem they created.Wersquoll also end the way leaseholders are getting rinsed by introducing a service charge cap, linked to the Retail Price Index. That will stop the double digit increases in service charges that leaseholders have had to put up with.Most importantly, wersquoll introduce a Coronavirus Recovery Act to end Welsh lockdowns, save lives and restore freedoms. We canrsquot just hope wersquoll get our freedoms back, we have to vote for them.The ten laws in our Contract with Wales will transform our nation. Wales needs champions. Vote Propel.Alex Wilson, Liberal DemocratsI live with my family in Penarth and I became involved in politics because of the widening isions that seemed to occurring our community. I feel that with the Liberal Democrat core values of tolerance and understanding we can bring people back together. We can cut through the shouting of partisan politics and once again listen to what people want in their community.The next five years is going to be critical and I feel the Senedd must put recovery first. That means recovering from the Covid pandemic, the recovery of our economy, better healthcare services and a happier community which can be achieved by better transport links, saving our environment and ato community values.Irsquove been around long enough to know a political status-quo without a strong opposition can breed complacency. Wersquove seen this in national and local government. If I am elected I will ensure that the voice of the people is heard. If yoursquove ever wondered how we almost lost the Kymin or how they plan to build over  homes on contaminated land at Cosmeston Farm in Sully, well itrsquos because our current political leaders often lack empathy with local communities.Other candidates standing are:Vaughan Gething - LabourAngus Hawkins - Gwlad The Welsh Independence PartyLisa Peregrine ndash Abolish the Welsh Assembly Party Alan Pick ndash Reform UKDavid Rolfe ndash IndependentLeighton Rowlands ndash Conservative article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Otherwise a coalition must be attempted.:Who can vote Anyone over the age of  can vote in the Senedd election provided they are:- registered to do so- living in Wales- not legally excluded from votingThis is the first time  and -year-olds have been eligible to vote. What impact that has on the result remains to be seen.How do I vote There are three ways - in person, by post and by proxy - however, the deadlines for latter two options have already passed.Voting at the polling booth with take place until pm today.Polling stations will be kitted out with hand sanitiser and distancing markers to help voters remain safe from coronavirus.Most crucially, voters are being asked to bring their own pen or pencil.Face coverings must also be worn, unless exempt.How does the voting system work Each voter will have two votes - one constituency vote and one regional vote.Youll be represented in the Senedd by five Members. One for your constituency and four for the region of Wales where you live.Constituency vote - this is for the person you want to represent you and your local area. Wales has  constituencies, with each being represented by one MS in the Senedd. Constituency votes are counted in a first past the post system - so the candidate with the most votes is elected.     Regional vote - This is for who you want to represent your region of Wales - South Wales East, South Wales Central, South Wales West Mid and West Wales and North Wales. There are  regional Senedd Members, elected by the additional member system.When will results be announced As with a lot of things this past year, the election has been hit by Covid restrictions.While voting will happen today, counting will not take place the same night as is usually the case on election night.Instead, the votes will be taken to the counting locations and kept secure until morning.They will then be veried - spoiled ballots removed - and counted.Due to Covid restrictions, this will likely take longer than in normal counts, but results are expected within two days of polls closing.Keep an eye on the Argus website for the latest, and results. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Jemma McGowan, , was given the nightmare news that her chemotherapy would be stopped after medics found new tumours in her pelvic area and pubic bone on Monday. After researching alternative therapy to try and prolong her le, she is planning to travel to Mexico - but she needs at least pound, to do so. On Thursday morning, over pound, had been raised on her Go Fund Me page. In an update, Jemma said: My husband Clive and I have been just so overwhelmed by the generosity of family and friends and the whole community over the past few days. It really has brought a sense of hope back to me since I got my scan results on Monday, to have not only achieved my target figure but surpassed it by an insane amount - my miracle. I have received thousands of messages from people that are in similar situations, people that have battled and are winning as well as family members of the unlucky victims of this indiscriminate disease. I want to take this opportunity to thank everyone that has donated, shared my story and prayed for me and my family, I am truly blessed to have had this unimaginable support in such a short period of time. Hopefully in the next few days I will know a timeframe of the next stage of my journey.
