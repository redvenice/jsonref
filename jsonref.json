They do not appear to have sat on committees which dealt with their cases.In 2016 a knighthood went to Martin Donnelly, permanent secretary of the business department, despite sitting on the economy and education committees.Malcolm McKibbin, ex-head of the Northern Ireland civil service, was knighted that year while on the education and sport committees. Tom Scholar, permanent secretary at the Treasury, was knighted in 2017 while on the economy committee. Chris Wormald, permanent secretary at the Department of Health, was knighted last year when on the health committee.And this month Sue Owen, permanent secretary of the culture department, was made a dame while on the arts, economy and sports committees.           It is believed recommendations for civil servants come from the state committee, which none of these people sat on.The revelations came just weeks after the furore surrounding the Queen’s Birthday Honours. The list was dubbed ‘rewards for failure’ after figures such as Mark Carne, the outgoing boss of Network Rail, received a CBE amid travel chaos for millions of commuters. It also emerged that three honours went to clients of a prominent literary agent who sits on one of the committees.These include historian Simon Schama, who received a knighthood, and author Jeanette Winterson, who was given a CBEThe Cabinet Office said systems were in place to ensure people were not involved in decisions regarding themselves or professional colleagues. The rules state people should declare an interest if they have a professional relationship with a potential recipient. If a committee member is put forward, they are not involved in discussions regarding the case – and should not even know it is being discussed.A spokesman for Dame Rosie said: ‘Rosie Winterton was nominated by the Labour Party. She did not play any part in the nomination process and was not present when her nomination was discussed.’Mr Rittner said: ‘I was not aware that I had been nominated for an honour, nor was I part of any discussions relating to my nomination ...

Even tea has a 20 per cent mark-up.Happy Meal with hamburgerRugby: £2.49          Watford Gap: £2.99Price increase: 20.1 pcHow many parents on a long journey have thrown healthy eating out of the window? It probably shouldn’t be a surprise that McDonald’s appears to take advantage of pester power to levy a premium on food for kids. A Happy Meal comes with either small fries, fruit or carrot sticks, and a drink.Chicken nuggets 20-piece share boxRugby: £4.19Watford Gap: £4.89Price increase: 16.7 pcThere are very few inidual items at McDonald’s that cost more than £4. This is one of them: 863 calories of battered chicken. If you choose this at Watford Gap, expect to pay a 70p premium.Big MacRugby: £2.99Watford Gap: £3.19Price Increase: 6.7 pcThe most famous McDonald’s burger, the 508-calorie Big Mac — two beef patties, with a bun in the middle, cheese, pickles and lettuce — is nearly always sold for £3. Unsurprisingly, it is above that benchmark at the side of the M1.COSTA COFFEEMany drivers would struggle to be enthusiastic about Watford Gap services. But Costa, Britain’s biggest chain of coffee shops, controls arguably its nicest corner — an area with big windows, armchairs and the morning’s newspapers. The one on Rugby High Street is fairly typical, with a narrow shop front and an interior that stretches deep into the outlet.Pepsi, 500mlHigh Street, Rugby: £1.55Watford Gap: £2.29Price increase: 47.7 pcPepsi, like all other sugary drinks, is subject to the new sugar tax.           A half-litre of Pepsi costs 12p more than before April — but that doesn’t affect the mark-up at Watford Gap as the levy’s applied regardless of where you buy it.Large AmericanoHigh Street, Rugby: £2.60Watford Gap: £3.49Price increase: 34.2 pcAn Americano is one of the highest-margin products a coffee shop sells. It makes the 90p mark-up in Watford Gap rather galling.Flat WhiteRugby: £2.60Watford Gap: £3.49Price increase: 34.2 pcThis may not cost as much as a flat white at The Savoy, which charges £6, but for £3.49 I’d expect a nicer view than a big car park.          Tyrrell’s salt and vinegar crisps, 40gRugby: £1.00Watford Gap: £1.29Price increase: 29 pcA pack of these upmarket crisps usually costs about 75p from a supermarket. There’s a mark-up on Costa’s food of about 20 to 30 per cent at Watford Gap.Millionaire’s shortbreadRugby: £1.95Watford Gap: £2.49Price difference: 27.7 pcA 396-calorie slab of shortbread coated in caramel and topped with chocolate. At the Rugby High St branch (as at all Costa sit-down branches) most of the food is given two prices — a takeaway price (excluding VAT) and an eat-in price.           If you bought this to take away at the Rugby Costa it would cost you just £1.65, making the Watford Gap premium 51 per cent. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/23/10/00D18FAE00000190-5876873-The_Forces_Sweetheart_101_pictured_here_in_1947_had_no_idea_what-m-65_1529744589864.jpg","title":"Dame Vera Lynn demands removed 75th anniversary D Day concert website","story":"Dame Vera Lynn, pictured here in 2017, has demanded her name be removed from a 75th anniversary D-Day concert after veterans slammed it as \u0027dancing on the graves of the dead\u0027  The Forces\u0027 Sweetheart, 101 (pictured here in 1947), had \u0027no idea\u0027 what kind of event was planned when she joined Liberty Concert\u0027s \u0027board of recommendation\u0027 as an honorary member last yearThe petition reads: \u0027They will be partying on the very ground that hundreds of men lost their lives 75 years before fighting for our freedom, where families have scattered ashes of loved ones who fought on that beach, and where returning veterans want to go but will be unable to.\u0027An additional 75,000 people in an already very busy area will become a liability.\u0027Let them have their concert, but NOT on any of the beaches in Normandy and preferably NOT on the June 6, 2019.\u0027 Last U-boat captain dies: Submariner who brought WWII to the...Gay army veteran, 40, who has served in Iraq and Northern...Share this articleHer daughter, Virginia Lewis-Jones, told the Telegraph that Dame Vera had \u0027no idea\u0027 what kind of event was planned when she joined the concert\u0027s \u0027board of recommendation\u0027 as an honorary member last year. A statement released on Dame Vera\u0027s behalf reads: \u0027When she gave her written support to the Liberty Concert last October, the precise venues, dates and types of performances were unknown.\u0027As Michiel Florusse the organiser himself suggested, Dame Vera\u0027s name will be removed from the Board until the organisers have, not only spoken to the various veteran organisations and the veterans themselves on July 21, but also have had a meeting with Dame Vera to clarify the situation.\u0027          Jean Ellwood said: \u0027There are human remains that still lie buried there.

You got this, but it still was not enough. PayPal’s next demand was for a ‘seizure document’ from Trading Standards or the police. This would guarantee a refund, you were promised. You arranged this with your local authority’s Trading Standards Office in Milton Keynes and told PayPal, but the next day you received an email saying this was again not enough. Worse was to come.

As I pointed out to PayPal, if the seller was indeed a crook, he would likely deny ever having received the watch if you returned it. Or, he could claim that the watch you returned was not the same as the watch he supplied. Either way, you would then be without both the watch and the £9,000.A final twist in the tale came when Trading Standards pointed out that as Rolex had confirmed the watch was a fake, if PayPal released your money to the fraudster, this could be regarded as money laundering, which is an offence in itself. I asked officials at PayPal to look into all of this. It told me: ‘We never ask a buyer to return goods when we have been given proof they were counterfeit.’          Let down: Ryanair is currently investigating a phone call one reader had with a \u0027rude employee\u0027It said it received that proof from Trading Standards on May 30. Now, I am not sure what proof that was exactly since I have seen a statement sent to PayPal by Trading Standards as long ago as March 26. It confirmed Rolex itself had judged the watch to be a fake. No matter, though. The important thing is that PayPal has now refunded the £9,000 back to the credit card you used. It has also made a goodwill credit of £100 to your PayPal account. Perhaps it might be best to avoid buying expensive second-hand watches.Why have my tax letters been ignored for months?S.T. writes: My tax office asked me to obtain official confirmation from the Department for Work \u0026amp Pensions showing the amount of my state pension for the tax years 2016-17 and 2017-18.

A month later I submitted a written complaint, but I received no reply to this either. I am 83 years old and can do without these problems.Tony Hetherington replies: It really is frustrating to have one Government department asking you to get information from another one, only to find that the second department simply ignores you, even when you complain.

I sent all the documentation Ryanair requested to obtain a refund and received an emailed acknowledgement. Since then there has been nothing. I telephoned but was fobbed off by a rude employee who told me it was not possible to contact customer services by phone because, ‘Who would want to listen to that all day? Anyone can make up a plausible story.’Tony Hetherington replies: Ryanair was concerned at the way you were treated when you called. I have given the airline the contact number you rang so this can be investigated. As for your refund Ryanair agrees you cancelled your flight and requested a refund, but it says you were asked to complete a claim form and failed to do this. You have told me that you submitted the claim form at least three times along with a copy of a doctor’s note about your husband’s illness. After I asked the airline to look into this, it emailed you to say the refund would go ahead. You have now received £233.I never agreed to be guarantor on policyM.H. writes: My son was learning to drive and was insured on a learner policy with Adrian Flux Insurance Services. I was paying monthly for this, and part of the policy was that it would be cancelled once he passed his test. He did pass and the policy was cancelled, but when he took out a new policy he found he could not have a monthly payment plan as he is only 17. Adrian Flux then put me down as guarantor and opened a finance agreement in my name, without my signature or consent. It says they are allowed to do this, but is it legal?Tony Hetherington replies: THE answer of course is no. You cannot be held to a finance agreement that you never authorised. But you told me that when you protested to Adrian Flux, you were informed that the Financial Conduct Authority was aware of this practice, and if you cancelled the cover it would cost £486.I do not believe the regulator would ever accept this, but it does not matter now as the insurer has told me there has been ‘a simple misunderstanding’. It seems that when your son took out his new policy, your details were mistakenly transferred over from the old policy. The company told me that naming you as ‘guarantor’ was ‘incorrect and a human error’. The agreement has been scrapped and Adrian Flux has made a goodwill offer which you have accepted. £50 bonus to openNo fees to use abroad£150 Expedia voucher or top end tech to join"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/23/19/4D8F556700000578-5877813-image-a-18_1529778479194.jpg","title":"Get sold new builds Mail Sundays property special","story":"    Hot spot: The Boiler House development in West LondonThen there’s the fact that new homes are built to the latest specifications, so major repairs should be unnecessary for the first few years. They tend to be more energy-efficient, too, so you could benefit from lower utility bills.If you buy off-plan, you might be able to choose your fixtures and finishes, and of course there’s no upward chain to contend with when you buy a new-build.About 145,000 new homes have been bought so far using the Government’s Help To Buy equity loan and London Help To Buy schemes.But new-builds can also appeal to existing homeowners. Some house-builders, such as Bellway, run part-exchange schemes, which allow people to buy a new-build and use their current home as part payment. Bellway also offer Help To Buy, plus an ‘express mover scheme’ in which they work with a local agent to market your property. While you agree the selling price on your existing home, Bellway chase the agent to encourage them to find a buyer as quickly as possible and also pay the estate agents’ fee.At The Boiler House, which was completed this month and is part of the huge Old Vinyl Factory conversion in Hayes, West London, the developer, HUB, is offering to pay the stamp duty on the new-build homes for sale.          For a start, new-build homes come with a ten-year National House-Building Council warranty covering structural defects. Most developers also provide their own two-year warranty (stock image)The Boiler House consists of 54 studio, one- and two-bedroom homes and has rooftop allotments for residents to grow their own vegetables and plants. The £250 million Old Vinyl Factory development is regenerating a 17-acre former EMI site that produced records until the late 1970s.Other kinds of new-builds gaining popularity include homes in garden villages, where sustainability is key and green spaces are a priority.Crest Nicholson Strategic Projects are behind garden villages at Monksmoor Park in Northamptonshire, Tadpole Garden Village in Wiltshire and Kilnwood Vale in West Sussex.Public space is a large feature of garden villages and homeowners pay an annual service charge to fund its maintenance.Chris Tanner moved to Tadpole Garden Village in June 2016. ‘The fact that community engagement has been made a priority is the icing on the cake,’ he says. ‘We get to guide and shape our own community.’ Today, Chris helps organise community events at the garden village, from wildlife walks and meet-your-neighbour get-togethers to Christmas carols and Easter egg hunts. ‘The events are really important in helping us feel a strong sense of community,’ he says. ‘They offer a chance to get to know each other and what’s planned for the development. Everyone feels a part of it and in turn we’re proud of where we live.’  In with the new... and the oldAs the Old Vinyl Factory development at Hayes in West London shows, new-builds don’t have to be devoid of history. Pristine new flats can be on the site of – or even housed in – buildings of historic significance.First-time buyer Wahab Ahmed, 28, an analyst in the City, feels he has the best of both worlds: a new flat he bought off-plan but within the Royal Arsenal Riverside development in Woolwich, South-East London, which has 20 converted listed buildings, some dating from the 17th Century.The Royal Arsenal was a huge area used for weapons manufacturing that grew on the south bank of the Thames over centuries. ‘It’s steeped in history and the mix of old and new really makes it stand out,’ says Wahab. He had been renting in Hoxton and Shoreditch in East London before buying his first property in Royal Arsenal Riverside’s Cannon Square, above the new Crossrail station.He says: ‘Each time I thought I’d found somewhere, something would make me doubt I was making the right decision.‘As soon as I stepped foot on the Royal Arsenal Riverside development, I knew this was the right place for me.‘One of the main reasons I bought my home was to be close to the River Thames – for me it’s the heartbeat of London.‘Waking up each day to see the sun rise over the Thames, and to see it set at night, really is something special.’Wahab’s two-bedroom property is on the second floor of the Naval House building. He has a spare room for his brother and the property has a terrace that stretches the length of the flat.          Royal Arsenal Riverside will be home to one of only two Crossrail stations south of the river once the line opensRoyal Arsenal Riverside will be home to one of only two Crossrail stations south of the river once the line opens. Wahab believes Crossrail will have major economic benefits for everyone in the area.‘The development is already really well connected, but I think Crossrail will bring even more businesses, shops and bars to Woolwich. It feels the perfect time to move here as I get to see the area change and grow.’Alongside existing rail links and the DLR, the Thames Clipper provides another way to travel through London, with the O2 arena only an eight-minute boat ride away. City Airport is just two stops on the DLR.Wahab adds: ‘Unlike my previous rented properties, this home is more sustainable and my bills are considerably lower. It’s also very low-maintenance, which is what I was looking for from the start.’          Wahab (pictured) believes Crossrail will have major economic benefits for everyone in the area  ‘I wish I’d been taught that in school’ is a refrain many of us repeat time and again over the course of our lives.Since 86 per cent of us want to buy a home – and for everyone who does, there has to be a first time – purchasing a property is likely to be high on the list of topics that many wish had been on the curriculum when we were younger.Well, for everyone daunted by expressions such as ‘completion date’ and ‘exchanging contracts’ – and which order they come in – estate agent Yopa has produced an advice guide to talk property virgins through those tricky first stages, where everything seems like a step into the unknown.1 GET YOUR MONEY IN ORDERIt is likely you will need both a deposit and a mortgage, so try to build up as much as you can for your deposit, maybe asking your family for help. The mortgage you can get will depend on how much you earn, so have your bank statements – and details of other financial affairs – to hand.2 CHOOSE YOUR NO 1When you know how much a mortgage lender will give you and what you can afford to pay, settle on a property and view it more than once – during rush hour, during the evening, and during the school run. Get a surveyor’s report done if you’re unsure about anything.3 MAKE A SENSIBLE OFFERMake an offer – and offer what you think it’s worth, not what the owner believes it’s worth. Check similar properties in the area to make sure that you’re in the right ball park.4 SPREAD THE WORDTell the agent your offer, but don’t worry too much – it can be altered later. It’s not set in stone until you pay your initial deposit and exchange contracts.5 SIT BACK AND WAITVendors can take a long time to respond to your offer, but should normally come back within two working days.6 GET A SURVEYOR AND A LAWYERIf your offer is accepted, find a surveyor as soon as possible. If the surveyor’s report is acceptable, move on to what’s called conveyancing – the legal transfer of the property from one owner to another.7 LET THE WHEELS TURNDeal with the contracts for the purchase, and the disbursements (such as the cost to register your name against the title). Or rather, let your legal representative do it for you.8 EXCHANGE CONTRACTSPaying the initial deposit and exchanging contracts commits you to moving into the property. There’s no going back now.9 COMPLETE THE DEALCompletion day is when you transfer the remainder of the money and pick up the keys to your new property. Try not to make it the same day as when you exchange. A little breathing space is advisable.10 TIME TO MOVE ITIt’s all yours.

Is the property still in the good condition it was in when you bought it?”’ She also says: ‘You need to know the state of the market. If the Queen put in bi-fold doors on the back kitchen of Buckingham Palace, would it increase in value by ten per cent? No. But if you take the average family house with a narrow old-style kitchen, sitting room and dining room, classic semi-detached style, and you knock down a wall and put in bi-fold doors and a family kitchen then, yes, it will add ten per cent. I’ve no fear in saying that.’Be careful to consider the state of the whole house though, if your budget is limited. ‘If something big needs fixing, such as the roof needs replacing, then do it. But let’s say Granny dies and her whole house is just very dated. There’s no point only doing the kitchen. People will say: “Oh yes, a new kitchen but I’m going to rip it out because I’m doing the whole house anyway.” It’ll also show up just how much the other rooms need work. It’s about balance.’Allsopp may be the daughter of a baronet and live in upmarket Notting Hill – with her partner, property developer Ben Anderson and their two boys Bay and Oscar, aged ten and eight – but she is passionate about the struggle moving home can be, having spent more than two decades speaking to families across Britain, rich and poor, about their own difficulties in doing so. So what else will ensure your home sells – especially as the market slows?First impressions count, says Kirstie: ‘Sometimes it’s difficult to see what needs doing when you live in a place, so ask a friend. Your agent won’t tell you, because they’re afraid they’ll offend you and you’ll fire them. Chipped tiles, scruffy unfinished DIY jobs, damp and mould. It’s not always necessary to get someone in – there is a lot you can do yourself.‘But be practical – big jobs, such as rewiring the house, will also mean you need to re-plaster and repaint. You may well not need to get into that.’    Spread the word: A quality extension can add 11 per cent to the value of a home4 INVEST IN BATHTIMEReplacing a bathroom is a job most people don’t want to do themselves. While cost can range from £2,000 to £20,000, at the top end of that scale, a smart new bathroom could add as much as £25,000 or more to the value of your home. Even spending a small amount on an update – from £500 upwards – can add at least three per cent to the potential selling price of your home, according to GE Money. To the average UK homeowner, that’s £6,800.5 DIG DEEPDigging out a new basement to create a whole extra floor is generally deemed to be a good idea, although there is some debate whether it adds to a property’s value. I think it can, but it depends on where you live and how much the work costs. Expect to pay on average from £200 a square foot to convert something already there and from £250 to £300 a square foot if starting from scratch. Not every house suits a subterranean extension, but an estate agent will tell you the local value of property per square foot. That will help you work out whether the cost justifies the expense.6 SPLASH OUT ON WARMTHCentral heating almost always more than pays for itself. The cost to install central heating ranges from £1,000 to £3,000 depending on the system you choose, but value added can be as much as £5,000. Double-glazing likewise doesn’t cost a great deal – anything from a few hundred pounds to a few thousand, depending on the size of the task – and it can add £10,000 or more in value.7 BANK ON GARDENINGEstate agents reckon a garden is one of the best value-adders, swelling value by 20 per cent or more. In cities and large towns, a simple balcony, terrace or patio can augment a home’s value. In the country, buyers tend to expect a property to come with a garden. As with interiors, spend money on the structure of the garden if you can. Buying lots of expensive plants might add less value than working out where a good big feature tree can go, along with a patio and pathways. Installing decking or a patio can add two per cent (£4,538 on the average house price) to a house’s value, says GE Money.9 GO GREENInstalling sensible green devices such as solar panels or wood turbines could certainly add value to your home. Research by the Energy Saving Trust shows that a third of those polled said they would be willing to pay more for a home that uses energy from renewable resources, such as wind, solar or hydropower.10 STAGE A TAKEOVERIf there is a patch of land nearby – big or small – it is always worth doing your research to find out who owns it and see whether you can rent or buy it. There are so many options for how you might use it – including a kitchen garden, an office, a pool, tennis court or a children’s play area – and it will certainly return your investment. 8 STORE THAT BIKEWith more people cycling to stations, work or school these days, secure, waterproof bicycle storage is becoming as important to buyers as parking space or good public transport. A ready-made bike shed costs about £400, and a simple bike rack less than £100.SPREAD THE WORD: A quality extension can add 11 per cent to the value of a home                                                                Your perfect place - at the right priceNo one has exactly the same idea of a dream home – with period, location and space varying according to who is doing the dreaming. Which makes sense, considering the huge variety of housing that we live in.Some might love the community feeling and historic details found in the terraces that so many of us have as our homes or were brought up in. Others might like the quieter life offered by more suburban houses some might crave the wide-open spaces of the countryside, while others might prefer more modern houses with eco features.So, here, Life’s property experts have handpicked a selection of five homes from across the country, all on the market, to give a flavour of the range of housing on offer in Britain. And we have let Kirstie Allsopp loose on them to tell us what she really thinks, and where they each have potential. Because, whether dating back to the 1400s or having been built in the past few years – and whether costing less than £400,000 or £2 million – they all have room for improvement.Kirstie says: ‘One of these could be your dream home but, as I always say, only if it’s in the right location. If the area you live is where you feel happy, then almost any property there will be the right one. I think what happens is that, sometimes, we look for a home that we feel projects our aspirations. But really, you should just think, “Where do I want to live?” And then go for it…’          SUFFOLK - £775,000 Bedrooms: 5-6Unique features: Grade II listed, timber-beamed property called the Flying Chariot in the town of Hadleigh four reception rooms separate contemporary studio covered parking area parts date back to 1400 murals and gargoyles contained within the building.KIRSTIE SAYS: People are nervous of listed properties because they come with so many regulations, but this is an enchanting house.

The three double bedrooms all have small balconies, and there are two bathrooms.The villas are part of a complex with three outdoor swimming pools, some with water slides, as well as basketball, volleyball and tennis courts, plus 24-hour site security.Julian Walker, of Spot Blue, says that Turkey is proving particularly good value for British holidaymakers because of the favourable currency rate between the pound and Turkish lira. He also points to the area around Bodrum becoming more accessible as Turkish Airlines has launched a new summer Gatwick to Bodrum route, running every Wednesday and Saturday until September 8.Across the Mediterranean, the property market in Ibiza is booming. Entry prices for villas, fincas and apartments in some of the most desirable locations increased once again in 2017.There have been increases of up to 17 per cent for fincas in the north of the island and 11 per cent for villas in the west. Florian Fischer, managing partner of Engel \u0026amp Völkers estate agents, which has two outlets on Ibiza, says the luxury end of the market is strong: ‘The number of properties coming on to the market is growing in the luxury segment,’ he says.Engel \u0026amp Völkers cited the sustained growth of private air traffic to Ibiza – it rose by 8.5 per cent in 2017 – and an increase in the number of wealthy visitors drawn to the island’s marinas as indicators that the rich are favouring the island more and more.The company anticipates that residential properties on Ibiza will continue to have a high level of interest, particularly among international buyers and clients from the Spanish mainland, with the current new construction activity resulting in a higher availability of quality properties on the market.However, it feels strict building regulations will mean that a scarcity in supply can be expected in the long term.

In which case you could enter the buy-to-let market. One way to do this with the confidence of knowing that you will have a guaranteed income is to buy in a development that promises a certain yield.Developer Crest Nicholson say that investors will receive a return of six per cent for two years if they buy an apartment in Bath Riverside, a collection of flats and penthouse apartments a short walk from the city centre. The variety of accommodation – set on the banks of the River Avon – stretches from studios to four-bedroom homes.Just across the river is the Royal Victoria Park, a substantial green area that includes botanical gardens, children’s play area, tennis courts and Victorian landscaping.However, it is northern England that is regularly top when it comes to percentage profit from buy- to-lets. The cities of Liverpool, Manchester, Sheffield and Leeds have properties that can command yields of eight per cent.It’s surely no coincidence that these cities also have high student populations, and in recent years landlords have profited from the need for housing for the increasing numbers of students in the areas.But if there is someone in your family moving to another part of the country for further education, why not buy a property for him or her so you know they have somewhere decent to live when they are there? And after they have left it could be let to other students.On pages two and three of this supplement we have already dealt with the benefits of new-builds, particularly for first-time buyers.Many of those incentives are transferrable for the buy-to- let market.While you won’t be able to take advantage of Help to Buy, there are other measures that developers offer that might bring down the cost of your investment.Companies such as Galliard Homes have a number of incentives, such as properties coming fully furnished – as many of their new-builds do, including Harbour Central in London’s Docklands.There, Galliard provide Smeg integrated kitchen appliances and free furniture packages that include 40-50in LED TVs, Sonos playbars and mood-lighting.Across the Thames at Surrey Quays, Galliard are specifically targeting investors with their offers at the Marine Wharf East development.Galliard are offering a three per cent discount, a service charge allowance plus a free parking space with three-bedroom apartments there.And in Shoreditch, at their Stage development, Galliard are offsetting the extra three per cent Stamp Duty surcharge that investors pay if buying additional residential properties within England, Wales and Northern Ireland.The Stage also has a unique history to it – the 37-storey tower will include 412 apartments designed around the remains of Shakespeare’s original Curtain Theatre.  Discover the joys of lodge life When it comes to holiday homes in Britain, park homes can work out very cost effective. Because of how they are constructed, they are often a lot cheaper than traditional bricks and mortar houses. And some are located in the most spectacular settings.One example is Palstone Lodges, in the pretty village of South Brent in Devon’s beautiful South Hams. The site includes a collection of contemporary cedar lodges set among landscaped grounds which boast more than 1,000 species of rare and exotic plants, trees and shrubs from around the world.          One example is Palstone Lodges, in the pretty village of South Brent in Devon’s beautiful South Hams (pictured) It extends to five and half acres on the edge of Dartmoor and, as the grounds were established more than 25 years ago, the plots have the privacy that a mature woodland setting can afford.Co-owner Matt Morgan grew up on the farm where the lodges now sit and has been planning the site for more than 30 years.Six lodges are currently available to buy, starting from £175,000 for a two-bedroom and rising to £255,000 for a three-bedroom lodge.Peter and Yvette Cheeseman, both retirees from Dorset, say they made a lifestyle investment when they purchased their Palstone lodge and claim their family now saves £10,000 a year on holidays.‘We had money available from our pension and we were trying to think about what we might be able to buy,’ says Peter.‘We liked the idea of escaping to Devon to get away from our busy lives in Dorset where I still have business interests and Yvette competes with her horses.’          Devon delight: One of the Palstone lodgesWhat really stood out for Peter and Yvette were the secluded plots the lodges were sat on and how they are exclusively for the use of owners, their friends and family only.‘That gave us the added confidence that we were making the right decision,’ says Peter. ‘It meant that we could have certainty and peace of mind that people buying at Palstone Lodges genuinely cared about their property and who stays there.’Peter and Yvette’s four children also enjoy their Devon bolt-hole. ‘For them, it’s a free holiday,’ says Peter. ‘We take pleasure in the fact that we’re giving them something special as part of our family unit.’Each plot has a 125-year licence and annual service charges of £2,750, plus VAT, which covers garden and grounds maintenance and general insurance. Each property is free from Stamp Duty and Council Tax.The lodges are designed as holiday homes and not places of permanent residence.          Regulars: Phil and Rebecca Grant with their children Rory and OscarRebecca and Phil Grant, from Harpenden in Hertfordshire, often come to their Palstone lodge with their children Rory and Oscar.‘For me, working in horticulture, the attraction came from the setting, with established planting and carefully curated landscaping,’ says Rebecca. ‘It seemed to suit us perfectly. We wanted a gentle, soft green space.’Since buying more than ten years ago, they have visited the lodge most months, taking extra time there in the summers.Rebecca and Phil have made good friends with the neighbours and even socialise with them away from Palstone Lodges. Rebecca feels this has been of vital importance to them, and even more so now they have a young family.‘When we visit now we know people are there, some of whom have become great friends, but we can’t hear or see them from our lodge,’ says Rebecca.‘It’s really nice to have a sense that everyone who has a home there wants a similar way of life.’"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/23/19/4D62E26B00000578-5878117-image-a-5_1529780104780.jpg","title":"Boom Boom Boris blasts Becker insists hes not broke","story":"    Boris Becker has been declared bankrupt and forced to sell his precious trophies to begin paying off a rumoured £54 million debt, while his nine-year marriage to Lilly, the mother of his eight-year-old son, has collapsedIt has been a tumultuous year, to say the least, for Boris Becker.The former Wimbledon champion has been declared bankrupt and forced to sell his precious trophies to begin paying off a rumoured £54 million debt, while his nine-year marriage to Lilly, the mother of his eight-year-old son, has collapsed.Then, in a farcical twist to an already bizarre story, he was accused of falsely claiming to be a diplomat for the Central African Republic in a bid to wriggle out of paying his debts. On Friday, even the country’s foreign minister, Charles Armel Doubane, called Becker’s diplomatic passport a fake.So it’s a surprise to see the tennis legend so ebullient. He’s frustrated, yes, but still instantly recognisable as the irrepressible, confidently –and often bluntly – outspoken Boris whose BBC commentary will again entertain and inform Wimbledon fans when the tournament starts next week.And in a series of volleys of the same ferocity that earned him the nickname Boom Boom Becker during his stellar tennis career, he hits back, saying:He’s not bankrupt – in fact he makes ‘more money than 99 per cent of the world’ and has paid the money he owesHe is a genuine diplomat with the passport to prove it, and he took the role purely because of his ‘passion for humanitarian affairs’Divorcing his second wife at the age of 50 makes him ‘conservative’ compared to other celebrities.          In a series of volleys of the same ferocity that earned him the nickname Boom Boom Becker during his stellar tennis career, he insists that he is not bankruptBoris admits that since the High Court declared him insolvent on June 21, 2017, ‘it’s probably been the most difficult year of my life. \u0027The case has put a lot of pressure on me. \u0027I know how it looks from the outside. Whatever I owe, the price I’m paying is much higher.’But after reading the torrent of stories about himself – in which he claims ‘the only thing they did write correctly was my name’ – he’s here to set the record straight. And, he says, the true picture is very different from what’s been reported.                            This has been the most difficult year of my life                         First and foremost, he says: ‘I’m not broke’ – emphasising he’s been made personally bankrupt, not professionally bankrupt.‘Boris Becker plc is doing very well. We are still making more money than 99 per cent of the world, let’s be realistic. \u0027I have plenty of money in my account, my credit card works and everything’s normal.‘Yet the whole world is asking, “But how can you pay for dinner? How can you pay for your flat? We thought you were bankrupt.” \u0027But as far as I’m concerned, I’ve paid all I owe. I’m not running from my responsibilities. \u0027On the contrary, I would like to close the insolvency book as quickly as possible.’          Boris denies that his split from Lilly, with whom he has a son, Amadeus, has anything to do with his financial woesMost of what’s happened is, he insists, a big misunderstanding, which he describes in detail during our meeting at his agent’s office. His blue eyes fix me with an intense gaze throughout the conversation, but when he smiles, his face transforms back into that of the good-natured boy from Germany who won Wimbledon aged just 17 in 1985. Wearing an expensive suit paired with red Puma trainers, his hair slicked back and a smattering of sunburn, he looks relaxed, but says he is ready to do battle.‘I’ve never been afraid of a fight,’ he says, with a flash of the grit that won him six major singles titles.He triggered a collective raising of eyebrows earlier this month when it was reported that he had become a diplomat for the Central African Republic. As his lawyers pointed out to the High Court, this would make him immune from bankruptcy proceedings under the 1961 Vienna Convention. To critics, the timing of his appointment as sports ambassador to a tiny nation seemed a little too convenient.Cherubin Moroubama, chief of staff for the nation’s foreign ministry, said: ‘The diplomatic passport that he has is a fake’, adding that its serial number corresponded to a batch stolen in 2014. The country’s prosecutor is now investigating.But according to Boris, his appointment is real and he has the paperwork to prove it.‘I was approached by the ambassador of the CAR in March and consequently met the President who asked if I’d be interested in representing the country internationally, and I was very honoured,’ he says. ‘I was inaugurated by the president in April in Brussels, witnessed by dignitaries from the CAR and my own legal advisers as well as the ambassador who gave me the diplomatic documents and a passport which is currently at the US embassy in Brussels for visa applications, so I don’t have it with me.‘I agree that the comments from the foreign minister and his office are confusing and perplexing. I’m very keen this should be resolved.’And he insists: ‘My appointment has nothing to do with my insolvency case. Humanitarian affairs are something I care deeply about.’          He’s aware some people assume a major reason for his money troubles are the payouts he’s made to women, first to Barbara (pictured), mother of his two eldest sons, in 2000, then to Russian model Angela Ermakova, with whom he fathered a daughter, Anna, after a tryst in a London restaurantBut Boris, I ask, have you ever been to the Central African Republic? ‘No, not yet, I was only recently appointed,’ he says, adding quickly: ‘We’ve been looking at dates, but the President is a busy man.’He says the reason the High Court was told of his new diplomatic status was purely because he was bound to disclose his new, official address in Brussels. Can he see, though, how it could be viewed as a scheme cooked up to help him out of his predicament?‘I can see why it could look like that,’ he concedes. ‘But that’s why I’m talking to The Mail on Sunday now, to put the record straight.’Boris denies that his split from Lilly, with whom he has a son, Amadeus, has anything to do with his financial woes. ‘A marriage break-up doesn’t happen overnight – it’s a long process,’ he says.Love split Lilly turns her back on Boris Becker after nine...Share this article‘We are moving on and ultimately, there will be a orce.

In a farcical twist to an already bizarre story, he was accused of falsely claiming to be a diplomat for the Central African Republic in a bid to wriggle out of paying his debts. He is pictured left with President Faustin Archange Touadera‘That’s absolutely not accurate,’ he says. ‘I had a pre-nup with my first wife and a orce in Germany so whatever people fantasised about a double-digit million number, not true. \u0027But more importantly, we’re on great terms. And Anna is on great form and my relationship with her mother is intact.’He’s found recent reports about his mansion in Majorca being taken over by squatters perplexing ‘because I sold it two years ago. \u0027It’s terrible that squatters are there, but it’s not mine’.Becker’s problems stem from a loan taken out with private bank Arbuthnot Latham, who launched the insolvency case over a reported £9 million he owes them.          Becker’s problems stem from a loan taken out with private bank Arbuthnot Latham, who launched the insolvency case over a reported £9 million he owes themBecker puts the figure at £3.4 million and claims that the bank charged him 25 per cent interest – claims the bank deny.He also claims the bank has used his celebrity status to demand more, and says he tried to find a solution before the bankruptcy judgment last June, such as moving the loan to another bank. ‘But there was no chance for me to negotiate a settlement. They refused to meet me and my advisers and they kept moving me into insolvency.’But the bank say: ‘Mr Becker’s colourful version of events simply does not tally with the facts and has already been dismissed by a judge. Arbuthnot Latham has at all times dealt with Mr Becker in good faith.’The £54 million figure bandied about for Boris’s total debts – including a claim for £34 million from a Swiss businessman – is absurd, he says. ‘How can you spend that much? Do you see any yachts?’But he says. ‘I have a good income and can spend whatever I want.’He can’t deny he’s made some poor business decisions over the years. In 2002, he received a two-year suspended sentence in Germany for tax evasion. Some of his businesses, including the website Sportgate, have failed. ‘Mistakes have been made, but Sportgate was almost 20 years ago. That’s business.’He adds: ‘I’ve never been driven by money. I won my first Wimbledon and forgot to take the pay check because it wasn’t important to me. I just wanted to win.’ Still, he was ‘completely taken aback’ by the High Court judgment, which he says, in typical Boris-speak, ‘happened to me like a baby to a virgin’.He believes the assets which have been collected from him in the past year by the court-appointed trustees from law firm Smith \u0026amp Williamson, which total £4.4 million, more than cover the debt. ‘I’m happy to pay back what I owe,’ he says.Theoretically, he should have been discharged from bankruptcy last week, a year after the ruling. However, the situation is rumbling on. ‘The trustee wants to prolong the insolvency for at least another six months because he doesn’t believe I’m co-operative,’ he says.    Speaking of his orce from Lilly, Boris said: ‘A marriage break-up doesn’t happen overnight – it’s a long process\u0027Boris does not believe the trustee is as neutral as he should be. ‘For some reason, they were fascinated with selling all my trophies, although I explained to them that they have strong emotional value but very little financial value. \u0027There was no need to do it, but that’s just taking the knife and digging it into my heart and saying, “We have you and we can do what we want.” ’The trustees, however, say their job is to act in the best interests of Boris’s creditors and say the sale of his trophies and memorabilia should raise more than £200,000, ‘not a sum we consider immaterial’.Becker says he is preparing a counter-suit against the bank for malpractice and gross negligence. ‘The fact is we’re going back to court soon to fight this and expect to win. I strongly feel that they were taking advantage of my fame and they thought I couldn’t afford to go to court so I would probably agree to pay a much higher sum.  Becker says he is preparing a counter-suit against the bank for malpractice and gross negligence. Becker says he is preparing a counter-suit against the bank for malpractice and gross negligence and right victorious‘If you want to blackmail me, you’ve picked the wrong guy because I’m happy to fight.‘What they are doing isn’t right. It’s probably the toughest match of my life, but I’m not afraid. Let’s play. I’ve never been known as someone to run away.’He now has until July 30 to present evidence that he has paid what he owes and he hopes his insolvency will be over in October. ‘I’m looking forward to having this difficult year out of the way,’ he says.He’s also excited about Wimbledon, which begins on July 2. ‘It’s the best part of the year for me, working for the BBC and talking about tennis. This country has adopted me, it’s my home and I love it.‘I’ve had to concentrate at times on keeping my spirits and sense of humour up by remembering what my passion is.’He says his ordeal has made him more reflective. ‘Some of what has happened I think is because I’m Boris Becker, a celebrity. But that’s the price to pay for all the opportunities I’ve had.‘I have a chance now to wipe the slate clean, to learn from my mistakes, to associate myself with better people perhaps. I’m not bitter. I’m healthy, I have a job I love and a wonderful family. I have a lot going for me.’"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/23/20/4D8F5E1300000578-5878161-image-a-39_1529781037200.jpg","title":"The downsizing lowdown make moving smaller home","story":"    Home comforts: The Greenhouse and Pavillion at Wadswick Green in WiltshireCraig Gibson, a partner at WDM Chartered Accountants, says: ‘Homes are a massive asset for people who have been committed to them for decades, so understanding your options is essential, especially when you’re selling.’And if you’re tempted to hand over your house or large chunks of money to your children, he says, ‘there are some ways to give your children cash or your home, but it’s very important to get good independent financial advice’. For instance, the annual allowance for tax-free gifts to children (or anyone else) is £3,000 per person. But parents can give up to £5,000 to children as wedding or civil-partnership gifts tax-free. Regular payments are exempt from inheritance tax, as long as they come from your income and not your savings and don’t significantly affect your lifestyle.When downsizing, it is important to consider what would be left to your children when you die.The inheritance-tax threshold currently stands at £325,000, and the rate payable on estates of more than that is 40 per cent of the amount above £325,000. The exception is if you are married, as you can pass your full estate to your spouse in the event of your death without paying inheritance tax. By doing this you also pass on your £325,000 inheritance-tax exemption, so £650,000 of your combined estate would then be free from inheritance tax.          Luxury living: One of Birchgrove\u0027s apartments in SidcupIf you go into residential care, you may have to sell your home to pay for it. One way to hold on to your home so you can pass the proceeds on to your children is to buy in a retirement development, like Wadswick Green in Wiltshire, where help is on hand for that care. However, exit fees that the development takes when you die will deplete any money you can pass on – as will service charges.Another option to free up money from your home is equity release. You have to be over 55 to go down this path, but it allows you to release money as a lump sum, or in several smaller amounts, or as a combination of both. And while equity-release products give you access to the cash in your home, they tend to be more expensive than regular mortgages and have associated fees. Triggering equity release may also affect your ability to claim state benefits.With so many people’s money in bricks and mortar – and with, these days, so many options available to those reaching retirement age – it’s no wonder that experts say it’s more important than ever before to look at ‘succession planning’.  Rent your way to riches In America, Australia and on the Continent, renting in retirement is much more popular than here. The British obsession with home ownership means we are keener than those in other countries to tie up our money in property.But there was 13 per cent increase in retired renters here between 2012 to 2016, according to the National Landlords Association, and Scottish Widows recently predicted figures will double to nine million by 2022.

Perched on top of the dome was a statue of Neptune, which protruded from the lake’s surface and was the only part of the structure visible from land.An air vent emerged through Neptune’s mouth and wisps of smoke were sometimes seen drifting out of it when Wright and his friends were enjoying cigars.To ensure clear views, Wright hired ers to keep the dome free from algae. Spellbound guests were able to watch fish and sometimes swimmers overhead. On summer nights, he switched off the lights so his friends could watch firework displays or gaze at the stars magnified by curved glass and water.A short flight of steps led to another underwater room with concrete walls and a curved ceiling supported on cast-iron columns. Lit by porthole-shaped skylights and equipped with a billiards table and card tables, this was the Lord of the Manor’s secret gaming room, where the men could head off for post-prandial fun.Run-down farmhouse which was bought for £300,000 then...There’s not much SPACE! Boatbuilder creates tiny...Share this articleThe ladies were catered for, too. From the gaming room, another staircase led to a stone viewing platform on the surface of the lake, where on summer afternoons his wife Anna and her friends could take tea.Wright’s tale has fascinated me ever since I first encountered this underwater hideaway while researching architectural follies. I wondered what sort of person could have built such a place. And the answer, I found, was a man the Victorians called the Napoleon of Finance, whose epic story – the subject of my new biography – was in many ways a forerunner of more modern financial disasters.Corpulent, grandiose and bull-necked, James Wright was an unlikely tycoon. Born in 1846, the eldest of five children of a Methodist preacher, he, too, became a minister before setting up a printing business in Halifax with his brother that promptly went bankrupt.The pair narrowly avoided prison, and on their father’s death, both emigrated to Toronto. Wright – by now using his middle name Whitaker – was lured by an oil boom to Philadelphia, where he met and married Anna in 1878. He set up a series of businesses, again sailing perilously close to the wind. In 1877, he and four partners were accused of making false claims in the prospectus of a new company and charged with conspiracy to defraud stockholders. Yet Wright escaped prosecution and, ever the adventurer, decided to became a prospector in America’s Wild West. An outgoing man with a quick wit and a ready charm, he made friends freely in saloons and gambling dens. Indeed, he enjoyed the rough-and-tumble boomtown life and later claimed he had witnessed ‘fierce revolver fights in the dancing halls’.          Deep secret: The underwater dome\u0027s 200 panes of glass were kept clean by a team of ersIt was in Leadville, Colorado, that he made his first fortune, talking up the prospects of a silver mine in 1880 and floating the company for $5 million (about £85 million in today’s money) on the New York stock exchange.By the time the business went bust, Wright had made a fat profit and was long gone. He repeated the trick in Utah, California, Nevada and New Mexico, where he set up a company that initially, at least, rewarded its investors handsomely.For the first five months it paid out $100,000 a month in idends as more than $1 million in silver was brought to the surface. The company’s share price soared, but again the bonanza did not last. In 1889, with his reputation tarnished and creditors breathing down his neck, he decided to reinvent himself in the land of his birth. Wright began promoting West Australian gold mines on the London stock exchange and, as the money rolled in like never before, he looked for a country property befitting of his enormous wealth, in part to prove to himself and his family that he had left that early disgrace in Halifax far behind.With money no object, he bought two tracts of land at Witley, near Godalming, paying £150,000 for the Lea Park estate, which included a 19th Century manor house, and £100,000 for the adjacent South Park Farm estate.Striding through his 9,000 acres, which contained 90 miles of roads and lanes, five lodges and ten farms, he set his swirling imagination to work. A small tributary of the River Wey meandered through the grounds, but Wright envisaged a series of great lakes, complete with islands. Most of the exotic ideas were his own. Under the direction of London architect Paxton Hood Watson, two wings were added to the existing manor house at the stupendous cost of £400,000.          Whitaker Wright was convicted of fraud in 2004The new west wing was adorned with a vast conservatory, which alone cost £10,000 (about £1 million today) and a large central glass dome filled with trees and exotic plants from across the world – a rival to Kew Gardens. The east wing, meanwhile, accommodated a domed observatory with a revolving copper roof.Between these two great embellishments were 32 bedrooms, 11 bathrooms and seven reception rooms, the largest of which, at more than 2,600 square feet, was the cedar-panelled ballroom, with a dancefloor capable of accommodating hundreds. Wright even found room for a small private hospital and, oddly, one of Britain’s first private velodromes.The stable block, capable of holding 50 horses, was a centrally heated equine palace with a viewing space from which visitors could admire their mounts from the comfort of leather-upholstered settees shaded by palms. Months of work resulted in the creation of the square lake, the bathing lake and the big lake. A boathouse was home to a flotilla of electric launches, sailing craft and rowing boats.It all came at quite a cost. Over the years his improvements to the estate cost an estimated £1,115,000 – then an extraordinary amount of money. But the overblown and impossibly extravagant house – he had a staff of 77 – was a perfect expression of his creator.In Queen Victoria’s diamond jubilee year of 1897, government Ministers and peers were among those who rushed to buy shares in his booming London and Globe Company and other mining-related companies.To impress investors, Wright made a point of appointing Establishment figures as directors. Future prime minister Arthur Balfour and members of the Spencer-Churchill family all invested. Even the Royal Family was said to have benefited.Whether or not these rumours were true, they were widely believed and Wright did nothing to dispel them. He established another Royal connection when he struck up a friendship with the spendthrift Sir James Reid, personal physician to Queen Victoria – in 1896 he sought Wright’s advice on how to make a killing on the stock market.To the world at large, it seemed he could do no wrong.But like the latter-day conman Charles Ponzi, inventor of the fraud scheme that bears his name, Wright’s business acumen was not as it seemed.          A dolphin\u0027s head water feature in the grounds of the estate which included lakes and islandsJust as in America, many of his much-vaunted mining prospects turned out to be duds and he used accounting tricks to make them appear solvent in annual accounts All such frauds must, eventually, come crashing down.And in a true fin de siècle moment, his house of cards collapsed on the last day of trading of the 19th Century.Panic spread in the stock market. Shares in Wright’s companies halved and 20 firms of stockbrokers were ruined.Wright fled to France and boarded a liner to New York, only to be arrested on arrival thanks to a transatlantic cable from Scotland Yard. He was brought back to London to stand trial.On January 26, 1904, he was convicted of fraud at the Royal Courts of Justice and given a seven-year prison sentence, but he evaded justice by swallowing cyanide in a court anteroom almost immediately afterwards.Magnificent as it was, Wright’s great project at Lea Park was never completed. After passing through a variety of owners, the big house burned down in 1952 and the buildings were demolished.The underwater dome, still watertight after 120 years, is now a Grade II-listed building – a monument not merely to folly, but to a life of extraordinary excess.lUltimate Folly: The Rises And Falls Of Whitaker Wright, by Henry Macrory, is published by Biteback at £20.

Ms Ardern is set to make history as the first New Zealand Prime Minister to give birth while in the top seat          Following the birth, the government will be led by Winston Peters, 73, for six weeks.

They do not appear to have sat on committees which dealt with their cases.In 2016 a knighthood went to Martin Donnelly, permanent secretary of the business department, despite sitting on the economy and education committees.Malcolm McKibbin, ex-head of the Northern Ireland civil service, was knighted that year while on the education and sport committees. Tom Scholar, permanent secretary at the Treasury, was knighted in 2017 while on the economy committee. Chris Wormald, permanent secretary at the Department of Health, was knighted last year when on the health committee.And this month Sue Owen, permanent secretary of the culture department, was made a dame while on the arts, economy and sports committees.           It is believed recommendations for civil servants come from the state committee, which none of these people sat on.The revelations came just weeks after the furore surrounding the Queen’s Birthday Honours. The list was dubbed ‘rewards for failure’ after figures such as Mark Carne, the outgoing boss of Network Rail, received a CBE amid travel chaos for millions of commuters. It also emerged that three honours went to clients of a prominent literary agent who sits on one of the committees.These include historian Simon Schama, who received a knighthood, and author Jeanette Winterson, who was given a CBEThe Cabinet Office said systems were in place to ensure people were not involved in decisions regarding themselves or professional colleagues. The rules state people should declare an interest if they have a professional relationship with a potential recipient. If a committee member is put forward, they are not involved in discussions regarding the case – and should not even know it is being discussed.A spokesman for Dame Rosie said: ‘Rosie Winterton was nominated by the Labour Party. She did not play any part in the nomination process and was not present when her nomination was discussed.’Mr Rittner said: ‘I was not aware that I had been nominated for an honour, nor was I part of any discussions relating to my nomination ... The honours committee has robust procedures in place to ensure that the selection process is fair and transparent.’A spokesman for Mrs Hindmarch declined to comment. Dame Julia was contacted for response."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/23/00/4D89093500000578-5876215-image-m-49_1529710459305.jpg","title":"Identical twin horse foals born Exeter 10 000 1 chance surviving","story":"    The larger foal has been named GFS Shockwave and the smaller one GFS Masta Blasta (the GFS standing for Gassons Farm Stud where they were born a fortnight ago near Exeter)           Pictured here (with their mother) displaying their matching buckskin blanket spot markings as they happily trot about, the colts are both in good health          GFS Shockwave and GFS Masta Blasta\u0027s father is this Czech kinksy warm blood stallion called GFS Fire and Ice \u0027The Farm from hell\u0027: Hundreds of animals were left to die...Villagers save a massive BULL from well by hauling it out by...\u0027Dead\u0027 boar gives hunters the scare of their lives after...Share this articleTania Mackee, who runs Gassons Farm Stud near Exeter, where they were born, said yesterday: \u0027Horses are only really designed to have a single foal each pregnancy.

The increase in weight misperception in England is alarming and possibly a result of this normalisation.’There has been a rise on the high street in ‘vanity sizing’, where dress sizes are inflated for women with larger waists and hips and bigger busts, to flatter them that they wear a smaller size. Experts say this can ‘undermine’ action to lose weight.The study analysed the Health Survey for England, to find the answers of 23,459 people asked whether they were about the right weight, too heavy or too light.          A study of more than 23,000 people has found more than half of men do not recognise they are overweight or obeseThe results, analysed for five years between 1997 and 2015, show the proportion of overweight men in denial has leapt from 48.4 per cent to 57.9 per cent in that period. At the same time, the proportion of overweight women misjudging their weight has jumped from 24.5 per cent to 30.6 per cent.The study, published in the journal Obesity, says the normalisation of being large has become ‘widespread’ in England, with men most likely to ignore their weight problem.On the Marks \u0026amp Spencer range, Dr Muttarak wrote: ‘By introducing a new design and styling tailored for plus-size customers and using carefully selected fabrics complementing fuller figures, Curve primarily contributes to promoting body positivity.‘While this type of body-positive movement helps reduce stigmatisation of larger-sized bodies, it can potentially undermine the recognition of being overweight and its health consequences.’Among people who were overweight and obese, 38.5 per cent of men and 17.2 per cent of women thought they were ‘about the right weight’. The proportion of obese men misperceiving their weight in 2015 was almost double that seen in 1997.People who underestimated their weight were 85 per cent less likely to try to lose it, with only 51.8 per cent of those who were overweight in the study telling the Health Survey they were trying to shed the pounds.Almost two-thirds of adults in Britain are overweight or obese, with the study focusing on those with a body mass index (BMI) of 25 or over, classed as overweight, and of 30 or over, classed as obese.Dr Muttarak, a senior lecturer in UEA’s School of International Development, said: ‘Identifying those prone to misperceiving their weight can help in designing obesity-prevention strategies targeting the specific needs of different groups.’ "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/23/18/4D8F0A0400000578-5877091-image-a-19_1529773261931.jpg","title":"Starters orders bar Champagne Pimms flow Ascot","story":"    Autumn Phillips and the Queen smiled and seemed to be enjoying each other\u0027s company during the iconic racing event  Autumn Phillips and the Queen enjoying the final day of Ascot together, peering over the balcony decorated with bright pink flowers          Look over there!

She says: ‘It’s a percentage game. You have to ask yourself honestly, “Did you overpay in the first place? Is the property still in the good condition it was in when you bought it?”’ She also says: ‘You need to know the state of the market. If the Queen put in bi-fold doors on the back kitchen of Buckingham Palace, would it increase in value by ten per cent? No. But if you take the average family house with a narrow old-style kitchen, sitting room and dining room, classic semi-detached style, and you knock down a wall and put in bi-fold doors and a family kitchen then, yes, it will add ten per cent. I’ve no fear in saying that.’Be careful to consider the state of the whole house though, if your budget is limited. ‘If something big needs fixing, such as the roof needs replacing, then do it. But let’s say Granny dies and her whole house is just very dated. There’s no point only doing the kitchen. People will say: “Oh yes, a new kitchen but I’m going to rip it out because I’m doing the whole house anyway.” It’ll also show up just how much the other rooms need work. It’s about balance.’Allsopp may be the daughter of a baronet and live in upmarket Notting Hill – with her partner, property developer Ben Anderson and their two boys Bay and Oscar, aged ten and eight – but she is passionate about the struggle moving home can be, having spent more than two decades speaking to families across Britain, rich and poor, about their own difficulties in doing so. So what else will ensure your home sells – especially as the market slows?First impressions count, says Kirstie: ‘Sometimes it’s difficult to see what needs doing when you live in a place, so ask a friend. Your agent won’t tell you, because they’re afraid they’ll offend you and you’ll fire them. Chipped tiles, scruffy unfinished DIY jobs, damp and mould. It’s not always necessary to get someone in – there is a lot you can do yourself.‘But be practical – big jobs, such as rewiring the house, will also mean you need to re-plaster and repaint. You may well not need to get into that.’    Spread the word: A quality extension can add 11 per cent to the value of a home4 INVEST IN BATHTIMEReplacing a bathroom is a job most people don’t want to do themselves. While cost can range from £2,000 to £20,000, at the top end of that scale, a smart new bathroom could add as much as £25,000 or more to the value of your home. Even spending a small amount on an update – from £500 upwards – can add at least three per cent to the potential selling price of your home, according to GE Money. To the average UK homeowner, that’s £6,800.5 DIG DEEPDigging out a new basement to create a whole extra floor is generally deemed to be a good idea, although there is some debate whether it adds to a property’s value. I think it can, but it depends on where you live and how much the work costs. Expect to pay on average from £200 a square foot to convert something already there and from £250 to £300 a square foot if starting from scratch. Not every house suits a subterranean extension, but an estate agent will tell you the local value of property per square foot. That will help you work out whether the cost justifies the expense.6 SPLASH OUT ON WARMTHCentral heating almost always more than pays for itself. The cost to install central heating ranges from £1,000 to £3,000 depending on the system you choose, but value added can be as much as £5,000. Double-glazing likewise doesn’t cost a great deal – anything from a few hundred pounds to a few thousand, depending on the size of the task – and it can add £10,000 or more in value.7 BANK ON GARDENINGEstate agents reckon a garden is one of the best value-adders, swelling value by 20 per cent or more. In cities and large towns, a simple balcony, terrace or patio can augment a home’s value. In the country, buyers tend to expect a property to come with a garden. As with interiors, spend money on the structure of the garden if you can. Buying lots of expensive plants might add less value than working out where a good big feature tree can go, along with a patio and pathways. Installing decking or a patio can add two per cent (£4,538 on the average house price) to a house’s value, says GE Money.9 GO GREENInstalling sensible green devices such as solar panels or wood turbines could certainly add value to your home. Research by the Energy Saving Trust shows that a third of those polled said they would be willing to pay more for a home that uses energy from renewable resources, such as wind, solar or hydropower.10 STAGE A TAKEOVERIf there is a patch of land nearby – big or small – it is always worth doing your research to find out who owns it and see whether you can rent or buy it. There are so many options for how you might use it – including a kitchen garden, an office, a pool, tennis court or a children’s play area – and it will certainly return your investment. 8 STORE THAT BIKEWith more people cycling to stations, work or school these days, secure, waterproof bicycle storage is becoming as important to buyers as parking space or good public transport.

Which makes sense, considering the huge variety of housing that we live in.Some might love the community feeling and historic details found in the terraces that so many of us have as our homes or were brought up in. Others might like the quieter life offered by more suburban houses some might crave the wide-open spaces of the countryside, while others might prefer more modern houses with eco features.So, here, Life’s property experts have handpicked a selection of five homes from across the country, all on the market, to give a flavour of the range of housing on offer in Britain. And we have let Kirstie Allsopp loose on them to tell us what she really thinks, and where they each have potential. Because, whether dating back to the 1400s or having been built in the past few years – and whether costing less than £400,000 or £2 million – they all have room for improvement.Kirstie says: ‘One of these could be your dream home but, as I always say, only if it’s in the right location. If the area you live is where you feel happy, then almost any property there will be the right one. I think what happens is that, sometimes, we look for a home that we feel projects our aspirations.

In a series of volleys of the same ferocity that earned him the nickname Boom Boom Becker during his stellar tennis career, he insists that he is not bankruptBoris admits that since the High Court declared him insolvent on June 21, 2017, ‘it’s probably been the most difficult year of my life. \u0027The case has put a lot of pressure on me. \u0027I know how it looks from the outside. Whatever I owe, the price I’m paying is much higher.’But after reading the torrent of stories about himself – in which he claims ‘the only thing they did write correctly was my name’ – he’s here to set the record straight. And, he says, the true picture is very different from what’s been reported.                            This has been the most difficult year of my life                         First and foremost, he says: ‘I’m not broke’ – emphasising he’s been made personally bankrupt, not professionally bankrupt.‘Boris Becker plc is doing very well. We are still making more money than 99 per cent of the world, let’s be realistic. \u0027I have plenty of money in my account, my credit card works and everything’s normal.‘Yet the whole world is asking, “But how can you pay for dinner? How can you pay for your flat? We thought you were bankrupt.” \u0027But as far as I’m concerned, I’ve paid all I owe. I’m not running from my responsibilities. \u0027On the contrary, I would like to close the insolvency book as quickly as possible.’          Boris denies that his split from Lilly, with whom he has a son, Amadeus, has anything to do with his financial woesMost of what’s happened is, he insists, a big misunderstanding, which he describes in detail during our meeting at his agent’s office. His blue eyes fix me with an intense gaze throughout the conversation, but when he smiles, his face transforms back into that of the good-natured boy from Germany who won Wimbledon aged just 17 in 1985. Wearing an expensive suit paired with red Puma trainers, his hair slicked back and a smattering of sunburn, he looks relaxed, but says he is ready to do battle.‘I’ve never been afraid of a fight,’ he says, with a flash of the grit that won him six major singles titles.He triggered a collective raising of eyebrows earlier this month when it was reported that he had become a diplomat for the Central African Republic. As his lawyers pointed out to the High Court, this would make him immune from bankruptcy proceedings under the 1961 Vienna Convention. To critics, the timing of his appointment as sports ambassador to a tiny nation seemed a little too convenient.Cherubin Moroubama, chief of staff for the nation’s foreign ministry, said: ‘The diplomatic passport that he has is a fake’, adding that its serial number corresponded to a batch stolen in 2014. The country’s prosecutor is now investigating.But according to Boris, his appointment is real and he has the paperwork to prove it.‘I was approached by the ambassador of the CAR in March and consequently met the President who asked if I’d be interested in representing the country internationally, and I was very honoured,’ he says. ‘I was inaugurated by the president in April in Brussels, witnessed by dignitaries from the CAR and my own legal advisers as well as the ambassador who gave me the diplomatic documents and a passport which is currently at the US embassy in Brussels for visa applications, so I don’t have it with me.‘I agree that the comments from the foreign minister and his office are confusing and perplexing. I’m very keen this should be resolved.’And he insists: ‘My appointment has nothing to do with my insolvency case. Humanitarian affairs are something I care deeply about.’          He’s aware some people assume a major reason for his money troubles are the payouts he’s made to women, first to Barbara (pictured), mother of his two eldest sons, in 2000, then to Russian model Angela Ermakova, with whom he fathered a daughter, Anna, after a tryst in a London restaurantBut Boris, I ask, have you ever been to the Central African Republic? ‘No, not yet, I was only recently appointed,’ he says, adding quickly: ‘We’ve been looking at dates, but the President is a busy man.’He says the reason the High Court was told of his new diplomatic status was purely because he was bound to disclose his new, official address in Brussels. Can he see, though, how it could be viewed as a scheme cooked up to help him out of his predicament?‘I can see why it could look like that,’ he concedes. ‘But that’s why I’m talking to The Mail on Sunday now, to put the record straight.’Boris denies that his split from Lilly, with whom he has a son, Amadeus, has anything to do with his financial woes. ‘A marriage break-up doesn’t happen overnight – it’s a long process,’ he says.Love split Lilly turns her back on Boris Becker after nine...Share this article‘We are moving on and ultimately, there will be a orce.

In a farcical twist to an already bizarre story, he was accused of falsely claiming to be a diplomat for the Central African Republic in a bid to wriggle out of paying his debts. He is pictured left with President Faustin Archange Touadera‘That’s absolutely not accurate,’ he says. ‘I had a pre-nup with my first wife and a orce in Germany so whatever people fantasised about a double-digit million number, not true. \u0027But more importantly, we’re on great terms. And Anna is on great form and my relationship with her mother is intact.’He’s found recent reports about his mansion in Majorca being taken over by squatters perplexing ‘because I sold it two years ago. \u0027It’s terrible that squatters are there, but it’s not mine’.Becker’s problems stem from a loan taken out with private bank Arbuthnot Latham, who launched the insolvency case over a reported £9 million he owes them.          Becker’s problems stem from a loan taken out with private bank Arbuthnot Latham, who launched the insolvency case over a reported £9 million he owes themBecker puts the figure at £3.4 million and claims that the bank charged him 25 per cent interest – claims the bank deny.He also claims the bank has used his celebrity status to demand more, and says he tried to find a solution before the bankruptcy judgment last June, such as moving the loan to another bank. ‘But there was no chance for me to negotiate a settlement. They refused to meet me and my advisers and they kept moving me into insolvency.’But the bank say: ‘Mr Becker’s colourful version of events simply does not tally with the facts and has already been dismissed by a judge. Arbuthnot Latham has at all times dealt with Mr Becker in good faith.’The £54 million figure bandied about for Boris’s total debts – including a claim for £34 million from a Swiss businessman – is absurd, he says. ‘How can you spend that much? Do you see any yachts?’But he says. ‘I have a good income and can spend whatever I want.’He can’t deny he’s made some poor business decisions over the years. In 2002, he received a two-year suspended sentence in Germany for tax evasion. Some of his businesses, including the website Sportgate, have failed. ‘Mistakes have been made, but Sportgate was almost 20 years ago. That’s business.’He adds: ‘I’ve never been driven by money. I won my first Wimbledon and forgot to take the pay check because it wasn’t important to me. I just wanted to win.’ Still, he was ‘completely taken aback’ by the High Court judgment, which he says, in typical Boris-speak, ‘happened to me like a baby to a virgin’.He believes the assets which have been collected from him in the past year by the court-appointed trustees from law firm Smith \u0026amp Williamson, which total £4.4 million, more than cover the debt. ‘I’m happy to pay back what I owe,’ he says.Theoretically, he should have been discharged from bankruptcy last week, a year after the ruling. However, the situation is rumbling on. ‘The trustee wants to prolong the insolvency for at least another six months because he doesn’t believe I’m co-operative,’ he says.    Speaking of his orce from Lilly, Boris said: ‘A marriage break-up doesn’t happen overnight – it’s a long process\u0027Boris does not believe the trustee is as neutral as he should be. ‘For some reason, they were fascinated with selling all my trophies, although I explained to them that they have strong emotional value but very little financial value. \u0027There was no need to do it, but that’s just taking the knife and digging it into my heart and saying, “We have you and we can do what we want.” ’The trustees, however, say their job is to act in the best interests of Boris’s creditors and say the sale of his trophies and memorabilia should raise more than £200,000, ‘not a sum we consider immaterial’.Becker says he is preparing a counter-suit against the bank for malpractice and gross negligence. ‘The fact is we’re going back to court soon to fight this and expect to win. I strongly feel that they were taking advantage of my fame and they thought I couldn’t afford to go to court so I would probably agree to pay a much higher sum.  Becker says he is preparing a counter-suit against the bank for malpractice and gross negligence. Becker says he is preparing a counter-suit against the bank for malpractice and gross negligence and right victorious‘If you want to blackmail me, you’ve picked the wrong guy because I’m happy to fight.‘What they are doing isn’t right. It’s probably the toughest match of my life, but I’m not afraid. Let’s play. I’ve never been known as someone to run away.’He now has until July 30 to present evidence that he has paid what he owes and he hopes his insolvency will be over in October. ‘I’m looking forward to having this difficult year out of the way,’ he says.He’s also excited about Wimbledon, which begins on July 2. ‘It’s the best part of the year for me, working for the BBC and talking about tennis. This country has adopted me, it’s my home and I love it.‘I’ve had to concentrate at times on keeping my spirits and sense of humour up by remembering what my passion is.’He says his ordeal has made him more reflective. ‘Some of what has happened I think is because I’m Boris Becker, a celebrity. But that’s the price to pay for all the opportunities I’ve had.‘I have a chance now to wipe the slate clean, to learn from my mistakes, to associate myself with better people perhaps. I’m not bitter. I’m healthy, I have a job I love and a wonderful family. I have a lot going for me.’"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/23/20/4D8F5E1300000578-5878161-image-a-39_1529781037200.jpg","title":"The downsizing lowdown make moving smaller home","story":"    Home comforts: The Greenhouse and Pavillion at Wadswick Green in WiltshireCraig Gibson, a partner at WDM Chartered Accountants, says: ‘Homes are a massive asset for people who have been committed to them for decades, so understanding your options is essential, especially when you’re selling.’And if you’re tempted to hand over your house or large chunks of money to your children, he says, ‘there are some ways to give your children cash or your home, but it’s very important to get good independent financial advice’. For instance, the annual allowance for tax-free gifts to children (or anyone else) is £3,000 per person. But parents can give up to £5,000 to children as wedding or civil-partnership gifts tax-free. Regular payments are exempt from inheritance tax, as long as they come from your income and not your savings and don’t significantly affect your lifestyle.When downsizing, it is important to consider what would be left to your children when you die.The inheritance-tax threshold currently stands at £325,000, and the rate payable on estates of more than that is 40 per cent of the amount above £325,000. The exception is if you are married, as you can pass your full estate to your spouse in the event of your death without paying inheritance tax. By doing this you also pass on your £325,000 inheritance-tax exemption, so £650,000 of your combined estate would then be free from inheritance tax.          Luxury living: One of Birchgrove\u0027s apartments in SidcupIf you go into residential care, you may have to sell your home to pay for it. One way to hold on to your home so you can pass the proceeds on to your children is to buy in a retirement development, like Wadswick Green in Wiltshire, where help is on hand for that care. However, exit fees that the development takes when you die will deplete any money you can pass on – as will service charges.Another option to free up money from your home is equity release. You have to be over 55 to go down this path, but it allows you to release money as a lump sum, or in several smaller amounts, or as a combination of both. And while equity-release products give you access to the cash in your home, they tend to be more expensive than regular mortgages and have associated fees. Triggering equity release may also affect your ability to claim state benefits.With so many people’s money in bricks and mortar – and with, these days, so many options available to those reaching retirement age – it’s no wonder that experts say it’s more important than ever before to look at ‘succession planning’.  Rent your way to riches In America, Australia and on the Continent, renting in retirement is much more popular than here. The British obsession with home ownership means we are keener than those in other countries to tie up our money in property.But there was 13 per cent increase in retired renters here between 2012 to 2016, according to the National Landlords Association, and Scottish Widows recently predicted figures will double to nine million by 2022.

Perched on top of the dome was a statue of Neptune, which protruded from the lake’s surface and was the only part of the structure visible from land.An air vent emerged through Neptune’s mouth and wisps of smoke were sometimes seen drifting out of it when Wright and his friends were enjoying cigars.To ensure clear views, Wright hired ers to keep the dome free from algae. Spellbound guests were able to watch fish and sometimes swimmers overhead. On summer nights, he switched off the lights so his friends could watch firework displays or gaze at the stars magnified by curved glass and water.A short flight of steps led to another underwater room with concrete walls and a curved ceiling supported on cast-iron columns. Lit by porthole-shaped skylights and equipped with a billiards table and card tables, this was the Lord of the Manor’s secret gaming room, where the men could head off for post-prandial fun.Run-down farmhouse which was bought for £300,000 then...There’s not much SPACE! Boatbuilder creates tiny...Share this articleThe ladies were catered for, too. From the gaming room, another staircase led to a stone viewing platform on the surface of the lake, where on summer afternoons his wife Anna and her friends could take tea.Wright’s tale has fascinated me ever since I first encountered this underwater hideaway while researching architectural follies. I wondered what sort of person could have built such a place. And the answer, I found, was a man the Victorians called the Napoleon of Finance, whose epic story – the subject of my new biography – was in many ways a forerunner of more modern financial disasters.Corpulent, grandiose and bull-necked, James Wright was an unlikely tycoon. Born in 1846, the eldest of five children of a Methodist preacher, he, too, became a minister before setting up a printing business in Halifax with his brother that promptly went bankrupt.The pair narrowly avoided prison, and on their father’s death, both emigrated to Toronto. Wright – by now using his middle name Whitaker – was lured by an oil boom to Philadelphia, where he met and married Anna in 1878. He set up a series of businesses, again sailing perilously close to the wind. In 1877, he and four partners were accused of making false claims in the prospectus of a new company and charged with conspiracy to defraud stockholders. Yet Wright escaped prosecution and, ever the adventurer, decided to became a prospector in America’s Wild West. An outgoing man with a quick wit and a ready charm, he made friends freely in saloons and gambling dens. Indeed, he enjoyed the rough-and-tumble boomtown life and later claimed he had witnessed ‘fierce revolver fights in the dancing halls’.          Deep secret: The underwater dome\u0027s 200 panes of glass were kept clean by a team of ersIt was in Leadville, Colorado, that he made his first fortune, talking up the prospects of a silver mine in 1880 and floating the company for $5 million (about £85 million in today’s money) on the New York stock exchange.By the time the business went bust, Wright had made a fat profit and was long gone. He repeated the trick in Utah, California, Nevada and New Mexico, where he set up a company that initially, at least, rewarded its investors handsomely.For the first five months it paid out $100,000 a month in idends as more than $1 million in silver was brought to the surface. The company’s share price soared, but again the bonanza did not last. In 1889, with his reputation tarnished and creditors breathing down his neck, he decided to reinvent himself in the land of his birth. Wright began promoting West Australian gold mines on the London stock exchange and, as the money rolled in like never before, he looked for a country property befitting of his enormous wealth, in part to prove to himself and his family that he had left that early disgrace in Halifax far behind.With money no object, he bought two tracts of land at Witley, near Godalming, paying £150,000 for the Lea Park estate, which included a 19th Century manor house, and £100,000 for the adjacent South Park Farm estate.Striding through his 9,000 acres, which contained 90 miles of roads and lanes, five lodges and ten farms, he set his swirling imagination to work. A small tributary of the River Wey meandered through the grounds, but Wright envisaged a series of great lakes, complete with islands. Most of the exotic ideas were his own. Under the direction of London architect Paxton Hood Watson, two wings were added to the existing manor house at the stupendous cost of £400,000.          Whitaker Wright was convicted of fraud in 2004The new west wing was adorned with a vast conservatory, which alone cost £10,000 (about £1 million today) and a large central glass dome filled with trees and exotic plants from across the world – a rival to Kew Gardens. The east wing, meanwhile, accommodated a domed observatory with a revolving copper roof.Between these two great embellishments were 32 bedrooms, 11 bathrooms and seven reception rooms, the largest of which, at more than 2,600 square feet, was the cedar-panelled ballroom, with a dancefloor capable of accommodating hundreds. Wright even found room for a small private hospital and, oddly, one of Britain’s first private velodromes.The stable block, capable of holding 50 horses, was a centrally heated equine palace with a viewing space from which visitors could admire their mounts from the comfort of leather-upholstered settees shaded by palms. Months of work resulted in the creation of the square lake, the bathing lake and the big lake. A boathouse was home to a flotilla of electric launches, sailing craft and rowing boats.It all came at quite a cost. Over the years his improvements to the estate cost an estimated £1,115,000 – then an extraordinary amount of money. But the overblown and impossibly extravagant house – he had a staff of 77 – was a perfect expression of his creator.In Queen Victoria’s diamond jubilee year of 1897, government Ministers and peers were among those who rushed to buy shares in his booming London and Globe Company and other mining-related companies.To impress investors, Wright made a point of appointing Establishment figures as directors. Future prime minister Arthur Balfour and members of the Spencer-Churchill family all invested. Even the Royal Family was said to have benefited.Whether or not these rumours were true, they were widely believed and Wright did nothing to dispel them. He established another Royal connection when he struck up a friendship with the spendthrift Sir James Reid, personal physician to Queen Victoria – in 1896 he sought Wright’s advice on how to make a killing on the stock market.To the world at large, it seemed he could do no wrong.But like the latter-day conman Charles Ponzi, inventor of the fraud scheme that bears his name, Wright’s business acumen was not as it seemed.          A dolphin\u0027s head water feature in the grounds of the estate which included lakes and islandsJust as in America, many of his much-vaunted mining prospects turned out to be duds and he used accounting tricks to make them appear solvent in annual accounts All such frauds must, eventually, come crashing down.And in a true fin de siècle moment, his house of cards collapsed on the last day of trading of the 19th Century.Panic spread in the stock market. Shares in Wright’s companies halved and 20 firms of stockbrokers were ruined.Wright fled to France and boarded a liner to New York, only to be arrested on arrival thanks to a transatlantic cable from Scotland Yard. He was brought back to London to stand trial.On January 26, 1904, he was convicted of fraud at the Royal Courts of Justice and given a seven-year prison sentence, but he evaded justice by swallowing cyanide in a court anteroom almost immediately afterwards.Magnificent as it was, Wright’s great project at Lea Park was never completed. After passing through a variety of owners, the big house burned down in 1952 and the buildings were demolished.The underwater dome, still watertight after 120 years, is now a Grade II-listed building – a monument not merely to folly, but to a life of extraordinary excess.lUltimate Folly: The Rises And Falls Of Whitaker Wright, by Henry Macrory, is published by Biteback at £20.

These plaits and elaborate structures take anywhere between 30 minutes and five hours to create and can mark special occasions such as weddings and birthdays, denote a particular family or region or respond to political and artistic movements of the day. The acclaimed Nigerian photographer JD ’Okhai Ojeikere spent 40 years immortalising nearly 1,000 of these hairstyles, until his death in 2014. “Apart from being fascinated by their beauty and the artistic nature of each hairstyle, he documented them for posterity,” says his son, photographer Amaize Ojeikere. There is a danger, he adds, that these skills will be lost. “Particularly now the younger generation think it is ‘old-school’. That is one of the reasons the images were taken: to showcase the beauty of our people.” Structures of Identity will be at the Foam photography museum in Amsterdam from 29 June to 29 August.

Like her narrator, Mackmin grew up in a kind of commune in 1970s Norfolk. Both Mackmin and Nearly Thirteen had a poet father, a younger sister and an agoraphobic mother who drove a white Saab. Both were precocious, home-educated and excellent cooks. And both endured the spectre of abuse as they came of age in a rackety era of bohemian self-discovery.So the passage in Devoured in which Mummy runs out of Swallow’s Farm and bares her breasts in protest at a crop-spraying plane must, I assume, be true. “I made that up,” laughs Mackmin in triumph when we meet near her London home. “There are profound resonances with mine and my sister’s childhood, and massive acres of made-up stuff. I’d never written anything before and it was a visceral pleasure to invent stuff.”At this stage Mackmin is best known as a theatre director, acclaimed for productions of Tom Stoppard’s The Real Thing, Brian Friel’s Dancing at Lughnasa and a version of Arthur Miller’s The Crucible, as well as new plays by the likes of Amelia Bullmore and Charlotte Jones. Bullmore’s Di and Viv and Rose tackles themes of women and work, and it was when Mackmin became a mother seven years ago, adopting a child in her mid-40s, that she turned to writing.“I stopped work thinking, ‘Great, now I’m going to be a mum’, and I woke up the next morning thinking ‘Urrrgh, I am my work,’” she says. “This bomb had exploded in my heart – who was I if I wasn’t working?” Writing, she says, “was the rope that I threw myself – clambering up this slippery wet rope out of the horror of it all”.Mackmin had been “pretending” she was going to turn her “crazy childhood” into a novel for years and now, having a wakeful child, she began writing in three-hour nocturnal bursts. “I know this sounds very unlikely and pretentious but I really didn’t imagine a single other person reading this book,” she says. “I just knew I had to keep doing something in all those awake hours that was properly me.”It is Mackmin’s fourth creative career, and all have been self-taught except her first, acting, for which she studied at the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama. She and her sister Scarlett, a choreographer to whom Mackmin remains very close, then became clothes designers, successfully teaching themselves to make wraparound clothes that fitted both their contrasting body shapes. Mackmin believes everyone is creative, but her fending-for-herself childhood bequeathed her a bewildering array of practical skills. “I can sew, I can make my own clothes, I can make my own shoes, I can build a bonfire from nothing, I can drive a tractor. Rabbit skinning? Boom! Job done. Disgusting but I can do it,” she laughs.She took the same approach to writing as directing. Mackmin says she always knew she wanted to direct a new play if she read it and could visualise exactly how she would do it. She pictured Devoured this way too. Throughout the novel, the narrator, Nearly Thirteen, looks down upon herself, as if she’s directing herself. Speech appears before the speaker is identified, and sentences are staccato short. This style is as experimental as Mackmin’s childhood, and she isn’t sure whether to attribute it to a lack of formal education or her dyslexia. “There was an urgency of breath and rhythm in using short sentences. When I read it out to myself, I felt, ‘That’s. What. I. Thought. Like’ as a child.”Its originality ensured it was rejected by dozens of cautious publishers until it reached Henry Layte, the Norfolk-based publisher and bookseller who discovered and co-published Eimear McBride’s A Girl Is a Half-Formed Thing. “He gave one absolutely brilliant editorial note,” says Mackmin, suggesting “one big tweak. I will be grateful forever. He’s my kind of person. He’s funny and he’s direct to the point of almost rudeness which gives me enormous pleasure.” By coincidence, Layte lives a mile from where Mackmin grew up and loves cooking as much as she does.Devoured is rare among novels for being studded with recipes for everything from homemade glue to “chocolate idiot biscuits”. “They are all very good recipes,” says Mackmin – all from her childhood. Just as in Devoured, Mackmin’s father and mother and assorted friends were too busy making poetry or pots to cook for their children. “I could cook a six-course meal easily by the age of 10,” she says. “We didn’t know that we were running the house but we wanted to eat. Why would you not, if the ingredients are in the fridge and you’re starving and everybody else is too drunk or stoned?”Of all Devoured’s excoriating comic portrayals of wayward hippies, Nearly Thirteen’s Mummy – a matriarch who challenges norms of work, motherhood and marriage – is the most nuanced. One day, Nearly Thirteen hears a noise coming out of her bedroom like a lorry reversing. “Eurngh eurngh eurngh” Mummy is sleeping with other residents of Swallow’s Farm.Mummy is “a literary creation” says Mackmin, but her own mother, who recently died after developing Alzheimer’s, “inspired it, utterly and totally”. Two weeks before her mother died, Mackmin had a conversation with her in hospital. “I told her: ‘I’ve written a book, you are in it, it would’ve never happened without you, and I am so very grateful.’ She gave me one of those laser looks right to the back of my head, nodded, and turned away to carry on looking at an old bloke covered in trifle.” Could she have published Devoured if her mum was still alive? “I don’t know. Fortunately for us all, life doesn’t work like that. The origami shape of life allows things to be folded round a corner that you’re not quite sure about and then – ‘Oh look, I’ve made a swan.’”Devoured portrays a time when a generation of parents were preoccupied with their own liberation at the expense of providing children with the space or safety to be children. It is a funny book but an angry one too. “Yes, I have been angry but I’m not blameful,” says Mackmin. “I don’t blame my mum. My mum and indeed my dad were victims of that moment in history, of supposedly women’s emancipation and the psychotherapeutic generation – ‘oh me, me, me’ – putting themselves at the centre. Despite this ideology, they were still dragging behind them an idea of women where their bodies and sexuality were really the only thing that had any currency – and that’s what I was interested in.”Without giving too much away, one hippy befriends Nearly Thirteen in a way that today would be called grooming. I’m surprised when Mackmin says it’s not. “He’s doing what those adult children were doing – working out who he is by saying what he thinks in the moment. All of them are feeling themselves – feelings, feelings, feelings are everything. ‘I feel this and therefore I am,’ rather than ‘I feel this and therefore I’m going to think about it, and the cake I make out of the mix of those two will lead me forward.’”Did she experience abuse in her childhood? Mackmin speaks carefully. “I was around a reckless level of lack of care from the ‘adults’ to the children. I knew of too many children who were having sexual encounters with adults, far too many, and yes, it impacted upon me.”Mackmin believes she was saved from trauma by work, not therapy – and perhaps laughter too. She has poured all her good jokes, and knowledge of theatrical comedy, into Devoured. “Laughter is breath, it alters your being, and it allows you to move on, and keep living. I hope people find it funny but I hope they see that’s the point – it’s laughter as its most important function. It’s not just ‘ha ha ha, crazy hippies’, it’s ‘laugh or you’re going to end up full of bitterness and blame and picking the spot of your childhood forever.’”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a4af83d8b8b26c4b59ea9b70c3845b33039d656c/0_4_3000_1799/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=24a50c8fdf49a1a1f2121ef9a22a30e3","title":"book clinic which books best explain why life worth living camus sartre aristotle","story":"Which books can tell me, from a philosophical standpoint, what makes life worthwhile or worth living?Shamsheer Bakaf, 27, doctor and global health scientist, PakistanPhilosopher and author Julian Baggini writes:Surprisingly, few of the world’s great philosophers have directly addressed this question.

Aside from the occasional bit of scatological humour (scatology being the study of faeces … delightful), most of us happily steer away from regularly talking about it, for fairly obvious reasons.But, if you push past the initial icky revulsion of talking about human waste, you’d find out that it actually contains a vast amount of potential value in terms of energy, providing a sustainable form of fuel that we could all help supply.In 2015, research by the United Nations University found that human waste was a potential fuel source and if all of it was collected worldwide, annually it would be “great enough in theory to generate electricity for up to 138m households” – which is all of Indonesia, Brazil, and Ethiopia combined. An equivalent amount of natural gas would cost $9.5bn (£6.7bn).Poo-powered innovations are already happening, too. Earlier this year, a Worcestershire man made headlines when, fed-up with seeing bags littered across the scenic Malvern Hills, he designed a street lamp that runs on dog poo – two hours of light for every 10 bags of poo.There are companies across the UK that are also starting to explore the potential of poo power on a larger scale. Bristol-based renewable energy company GENeco is using sewage waste from the city to create green gas, which is then supplied to homes across the UK by Bristol Energy.“When sewage waste arrives at GENeco’s treatment plant in Bristol, it is treated and turned into what’s called ‘sludge’,” explains Bristol Energy renewables and origination manager Simon Proctor. “This forms the raw fuel for the anaerobic digestion plant.”During anaerobic digestion, organic matter – in this case, the sewage sludge – is broken down by microorganisms in an airtight container Proctor compares it to “the way a cow’s stomach breaks down grass”.This process produces methane-rich biogas, which is treated to remove impurities and ensure emissions are odour-free. The enriched biomethane is then injected into the gas distribution network. “It has the same quality as natural gas, and can be used in our homes as an alternative to fossil fuels,” Proctor says.The results are impressive. According to Bristol Energy, an average household’s weekly flushes could produce enough biomethane to cook a fry-up two weeks’ flushes could cook a roast dinner and annual flushes from every household in Bristol could fry 83m eggs.Biomethane was also used as fuel by GENeco to run a “Bio-Bus” shuttle to and from Bath and Bristol airport and also on a regular bus service within Bristol, aptly named the “number two route”. The bus travelled more than 180 miles on a tank of gas produced by the annual food and sewage waste of just five passengers.Sustainability is at the heart of the entire process. “Producing biomethane from sewage waste means that we don’t have to use fossil fuels,” Proctor says. “Burning fossil fuels is one of the biggest sources of CO2 emissions in the UK. Switching the average UK home to renewable energy can save more than 1.5 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions a year, that’s equivalent to taking a car off the road for six months.”He also points out that while we can try to reduce other forms of waste, such as packaging, plastic or food, reducing the level of sewage waste “is obviously going to be more difficult” – making the process an important step towards a more sustainable world.Bristol Energy will also invest its profits back into the city, creating what Proctor calls a “circular economy”. “Sewage waste from Bristol is recycled into green gas our customers switch to a locally owned company and save money – and then our profits will go back into the local community,” he says.That doesn’t mean there aren’t drawbacks, however, particularly in terms of the adoption of the process. Installation and maintenance costs for anaerobic digestion systems can be high, and many companies have been forced to rely on government initiatives to keep running. Proctor says that support under such schemes has been “very ambiguous at times”, which could be, in part, what is preventing more companies from adopting similar systems.Prof Chris Metcalfe, director of the Institute for Watershed Science at Trent University in Canada, worked on the UN study into human waste. He believes that biogas should be considered a resource not only for energy production, but also as compost “for improving agricultural productivity” and for the recycling of water for irrigation.“In most cases, we’re wasting this resource by either putting the solids into landfill or by discharging the liquid sewage into lakes and rivers,” he says.The main issue, Metcalfe believes, is not the technology – in fact, he says there are no real technological barriers to the use of human waste as fuel. Instead, it’s “people’s attitudes about using human waste” that causes problems. “In many countries, the idea of collecting and using human waste is not culturally acceptable, even though animal manure is often used for biogas production,” Metcalfe explains.But Proctor says human waste is already being used more widely than we may think. This is evident across the world, where the process is increasingly being used to improve sanitation in developing countries. In India, where $20bn (around £14bn) of government funding has recently been put towards building sanitary toilets, social project SHRI (Sanitation and Health Rights India) uses an anaerobic biodisgestion system to provide electricity to pump ground water that is later filtered and sold, with profits paying for the ongoing maintenance of the toilets.It may not be glamorous, sexy or particularly futuristic it may still seem slightly icky. But it’s undeniable: whether it’s being used to fuel cars, buses or homes in the UK, or to improve sanitation conditions across the world, poo has the power to change lives.To find out more about how you can support green energy and save money on your bills, visit bristol-energy"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc1da99d694643adfb07bbd517c57d36d0e9db1b/0_260_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b6172cc5ba8dac0e10f53e142b7e447","title":"dont wait worried workers call shorts on wages","story":"The bargaining power of the average British worker should be back to where it was when Tammy Wynette topped the charts with Stand By Your Man and the Rolling Stones announced an upcoming American tour with a performance from the back of a truck on Fifth Avenue.So much for the era of union power. By 1975 it was already waning. It’s true, the situation might have been worse without unions, but a general sense of impotence was felt by the wider workforce.These days there is a view that trade unions are not necessary for wages to rise at an accelerated pace. Andrew Haldane, the chief economist at the Bank of England, is one of those who put little store by union power and more on the dynamics of the labour market.There are surveys that support his view. For instance, the latest feedback via the IHS Markit survey of household finances shows that people have not felt so secure in their jobs since this particular survey began in 2008.A sense of security is one of the building blocks of bargaining power. When workers believe they are unlikely to be made redundant and they look around to see huge numbers of advertised vacancies, a hefty wage rise should be in the bag.Haldane voted for a rise in interest rates last week along with two other members of the central bank’s monetary policy committee, largely, it seems, to calm down runaway wage rises, or at least the imminent threat of an inflation-inducing pay bonanza.Surveys are one thing, hard data is another. And David Blanchflower, the labour market expert and academic, says the data points in the opposite direction. His reasoning can be found in his latest assessment of global employment trends, co-written with Stirling business school professor David Bell.That’s because the Bank is blinded to the effect of under-employment, says Blanchflower, just as the US Federal Reserve fails to consider the impact on the labour market of a low participation rate and the huge number of workers who neither have a job nor claim benefits. In both cases, there is in effect an army of under-employed people who are ready to take work and thereby limit the potential for wage rises.Under-employment can be seen in the figures showing the amount of extra hours people want to work, and especially part-time workers who want full-time employment.Why? According to Nobel economics laureate Ned Phelps, the 2008 financial crisis is to blame. It shook workers to their core and robbed them of any confidence.Blanchflower, a former MPC member and professor at Dartmouth College in the US, says in-depth breakdowns of official data show the demand for extra hours is growing and keeping pay in check. It means the age of anxiety trumps the unemployment rate. It means the central bank’s chief economist is wrong."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/12c32b8c92c3f3f30ffa40040ac068051db126e4/183_22_3433_2060/master/3433.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=42a6bc9041264bf445fe011dc7781b04","title":"love island is a rorschach test see what you want to see","story":"On Friday, an evicted Love Island contestant appeared on Daily Politics alongside Nigel Farage and Alastair Campbell to talk about Brexit. Hayley Hughes, from Liverpool, has achieved fame and notoriety beyond the show’s traditional audience for not knowing what Brexit means, before asking on the reality TV series whether it will lead to fewer trees in the UK. But her appearance on Daily Politics had more to do with the fact that, for those in Westminster not preoccupied with the World Cup, a not insignificant proportion of the political class is obsessed with another summer knockout tournament: the grafting, coupling up and mugging off of a group of suntanned under-30s in a villa in Mallorca.This obsession is not confined to Westminster: this year’s Love Island is bringing in record audiences for ITV2. Its opening programme was watched by a peak of 3.4 million viewers, surpassing the audience for last year’s final by a million and making it the highest-ever for the channel. It is becoming such a hit that people are starting to look for hidden meanings behind its popularity. Love Island has turned into a Rorschach test, revealing to the viewer what they want to see, only maybe with a splodge of Fake Bake fake tan instead of an inkblot.Sir Michael Wilshaw, the former head of Ofsted, sees the Bafta-winning series as an “appalling” indictment of England’s education system. He may have been talking about Hughes’s comments about Brexit, although who can blame her for not really knowing what’s going on when the negotiations have been so tortuous? He may have watched long enough to hear Hughes confuse the concept of a city, county and country, and wonder whether Spain is part of the UK. Or perhaps he couldn’t follow what Dani, the daughter of actor Danny Dyer, meant when she said: “He mugged you off but you mugged him off harder.” But then Sir Michael would also have to admit he knows Alex is an A\u0026ampE doctor and Zara is a policy adviser at the Department for Education.For feminist MPs such as Jess Phillips, Lucy Powell and Stella Creasy, some of Love Island’s biggest fans in Westminster, there are plenty of moments of female empowerment, most notably when Adam, the villa love rat, is called out twice by his partner Rosie for his philandering. It was after the second\u0026nbspof these confrontations, when Adam smirked at Rosie for getting upset and blamed her for his bad behaviour, that Women’s Aid issued a statement highlighting emotionally abusive behaviour and gaslighting.Rosie’s parting shot to Adam – “Enjoy the next bombshell that walks in because this one’s done” – won her an army of female fans. Adam’s bad behaviour was uncomfortable to watch yet this was not, as some have suggested, the producers normalising emotional abuse, but, rather, them exposing it. Everyone, including Rosie, could see what it was. For the audience, Adam is the No 1 hate figure who will be voted out at the next opportunity.No one can possibly claim that Love Island holds a mirror up to our society, unless that society is largely white, heterosexual and does two hours in the gym every morning with 36kg kettlebells. If it is anything, it is the walking, talking version of the Instagram influencer class. There are problems with a format that hothouses sexual attraction, often at the expense of real people’s feelings. While the islanders have devoted many hours to finding Alex a woman to couple up with, nobody in the villa seemed to care that Samira, the only black woman on the show, was also without a romantic partner – until she was chosen by newcomer Sam. One of the contestants, Niall, had to leave the show for personal reasons within days of arriving in the villa. There are psychologists, as well as first aiders, on standby.But we shouldn’t overanalyse Love Island as an excuse to watch it. Maybe the inkblot is just an inkblot. Anyone can pretend to be only interested in watching Inspector Montalbano on BBC Four. It’s harder to openly admit that the highlight of your evening is someone sitting up from their sunlounger to declare: “I’ve got a text!” or to wonder why Dani dries her eyelashes with a hairdryer. Maybe it is best to treat Love Island like a holiday romance: don’t take it too seriously, just enjoy it while it lasts."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/997c651d2161867e8ecbed261a4cd4e1b9a4fd46/0_32_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b9bf38019ef0d1870f6cab68fe2f43d3","title":"michael curry how can america call itself a christian country if it treats children like this","story":"Bishop Michael Curry damns Trump’s immigration policy and its malign effects on familiesThe screams of children being taken from their mothers and fathers at our border, under our flag, haunts the nation. Across political and religious ides, the nation – and the world – is aghast and Americans are refusing complicity in all the ways they can. Millions of people are crying, protesting and praying in our houses of worship and in the public square. In a moment of national shame, huge swaths of people are acting in love.The families making treacherous and often dangerous journeys to seek refuge in the US are desperate. They face extreme violence, persecution and poverty in their home countries. You cannot deter people\u0026nbspwho are fleeing for their lives, even with policies\u0026nbspas cruel as taking children away from their parents. People who come to our borders only hope to give their children a chance. We should be meeting these\u0026nbsppeople with compassion.Christians have recoiled against the notion that ripping children from their parents – euphemistically called “family separation” – in any way comports with the teachings of Jesus Christ. Jesus of Nazareth, his mother, Mary, and Joseph were refugees who fled persecution and emigrated to Egypt. Love thy neighbour\u0026nbspis the Christian way. There is no biblical mandate or warrant for what is occurring on our borders. Christianity must never be confused with\u0026nbspcruelty.While the president has rightly declared families will no longer be separated at the border, he wrongly continues to promote a hurtful immigration policy greatly devoid of human compassion. Even with the new\u0026nbspexecutive order, immigration officers will keep families who are legally seeking asylum in detention.The agony of migrant parents at our border is immense. Every parent has feared the unthinkable: my child is gone. For me, it was a flash of dread in an everyday experience while shopping with my two young\u0026nbspchildren in a department store. My oldest daughter wandered away and for the 10 seconds before I\u0026nbspfound her nestled between hanging clothes I felt a panic I had never before imagined.Those remain the longest 10 seconds of my life and are seared in my memory. I can still taste the fear and I relive that sick feeling in my body remembering what it was like to be physically shaken by the fear that I had lost my daughter and would not be able to find her. Imagine those seconds multiplied by days and weeks and months.In April 2018, the US attorney general, Jeff Sessions, announced a “zero tolerance” policy under which anyone who crossed the border without legal status would be prosecuted by the justice department. This includes some, but not all, asylum seekers. Because children can’t be held in adult detention facilities, they are being separated from their parents.Immigrant advocacy groups, however, say hundreds of families have been separated since at least July 2017.\u0026nbspMore than 200 child welfare groups, including the American Academy of Pediatrics and the United Nations, said they opposed the practice.\u0026nbspThey are supposed to enter the system for processing “unaccompanied alien children”, which exists primarily to serve children who voluntarily arrive at the border on their own. Unaccompanied alien children are placed in health department custody within 72 hours of being apprehended by border agents. They then wait in shelters for weeks or months at a time as the government searches for parents, relatives or family friends to place them with in the US.This already overstretched system has been thrown into chaos by the new influx of children.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspAdvocates for children have said they do not know how to find parents, who are more likely to have important information about why the family is fleeing its home country. And if, for instance, a parent is deported, there is no clear way for them to ensure their child is deported with them.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWhen an influx of families and unaccompanied children fleeing Central America arrived at the border in 2014, Barack Obama’s administration detained families.This was harshly criticized and a federal court in 2015 stopped the government from holding families for months without explanation. Instead, they were released while they waited for their immigration cases to be heard in court. Not everyone shows up for those court dates, leading the Trump administration to condemn what it calls a “catch and release” program. By\u0026nbspAmanda Holpuch\u0026nbspToday, there remain thousands of children scattered in foster homes and child prison camps with no system in place for reunification. Each of these children needs our prayers, our voices of outrage and our help to reunite them with their families and heal from this terror. And the children who came before them, those who have crossed the border as children alone and some\u0026nbspwho were remanded to youth prisons that are under scrutiny for abusive practices – these children also need our intervention.The rhetoric from our government leaders, which casts “the other” – in this case, families seeking refuge – as dangerous, inhumanely violates the Christian tradition. Selfishness is a sin. We cannot live up to our country’s ideals if we embrace only our own desires and put our needs above all others – even above God. Being a US citizen does not make us more human than people on the other side of our border.We are in the midst of a global migration crisis, where millions of families have been separated after fleeing their homelands due to violence, conflict and persecution.This crisis touches almost every continent in the world. The US is on track to resettle the fewest refugees since the refugee resettlement programme began in 1980. God does not condone our attack on immigrants. Jesus says: “Love your neighbour.” Jesus says: “Love your enemy.” Jesus says: “Welcome the stranger.” We ask that our friends in Britain continue to pray for our country in hopes that we may continue to follow a moral compass pointing in the direction of love, compassion, goodness.What is the Christian way to manage borders? Strength does not require cruelty. Indeed, cruelty is a response rooted in weakness. Jesus was clear about what true strength is and it always is driven by love. There may be many policy prescriptions, but the prism through which we view them should be the same: does the policy treat people with love, acknowledging our common humanity? If the answer is no, it is not a Christian solution.Detaining and separating families – children and their parents – is not just happening at the border. Some immigrant parents and care-givers who have lived in the US for decades – and have children who are US citizens – are being rounded up and deported, leaving a trail of countless children in this country without their parents.President Trump’s executive order has not quieted the cries of the children still separated from their parents. It has not comforted the parents still panicked because they cannot see their babies. It does nothing to stop the heartless deportations of immigrants who are longtime neighbours and members of our communities.All of those families weep. And so we must respond to the weeping by working to help America to live out one of its core ideals, enshrined in words on the Statue of Liberty.• The Most Rev Michael Bruce Curry is presiding bishop and primate of the Episcopal church"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/617b3c389dca853889294d2e32bf195c1551340b/70_0_1812_1087/master/1812.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e23339b65b100f7f4571a6df21b56e13","title":"steve hiltons silence speaks volumes about hollow men on the right","story":"TS Eliot didn’t get it quite right. The world doesn’t end with a whimper but a giggle, which reveals that cruelty and lies can pass unchallenged. What was once outrageous is now just a joke at the expense of humourless moralists who don’t understand how obsolete their scruples have become. The laughter comes loudest from the “left behind”. Not the working class, but the left-behind elite who attach themselves to far rightwing (and on occasion far leftwing) movements because they boil with resentment that they no longer have or were never offered the status they took to be their entitlement.Donald Trump, Rupert Murdoch and, to an extent, Boris Johnson are examples that walk among us. As are so many rightwing “contrarian” journalists who show their independence of mind by never contradicting their readers’ prejudices. The origins of their bitterness are wholly obscure to outsiders: how can Murdoch, for example, believe a British establishment that fell at his feet has “slighted him”? But the psychic wounds are real enough in their minds and allow them, however deceitfully, to connect with the humiliations of their base.If today’s radical rightwing movements are filled with sore losers – nervous members of the left-behind white working and middle classes, who see immigration destroying their culture and economic stagnation destroying their security – they are led by sore winners. Unlike the 20th-century fascist movements, the leaders of the “alt-right” were either born to wealth, as Trump, Murdoch and Johnson were, or, like Hungary’s Viktor Orbán and Putin, have been in power so long they have nothing to feel insecure about. Their privilege ensures that laughter in the form of the sneer of the victor and the snigger of the abuser comes naturally.If you’re from the old world, nothing could be less funny than the overmighty state tearing immigrant children from their parents and locking them in cages. The imprisonments were not a bureaucratic error but the result of a deliberate act by the Trump administration to create a “hostile environment”, as British conservatives would put it. Migrants would not think of coming to America if they knew that child snatchers would circle their kids. Such premeditated inhumanity demands honest reporting so that everyone, especially its supporters, understands the moral consequences.If you want to see the authentic mentality of fascism old and new, watch the clip of Trump ideologue Ann Coulter asserting on Murdoch’s Fox News that the stolen toddlers sobbing “Daddy! Daddy!” were “child actors”.Lies bind a political or religious tribe together. Fox News viewers and perhaps Coulter herself might know what she is saying is not true. By acting as if they believe outrageous falsehoods, they announce they are so dedicated to the conservative cause they will believe anything its propagandists produce and so determined to insult Latinos they will endorse any lie told about them. The reaction of Fox’s host was more telling than standard self-deceit. Steve Hilton, a privately educated Englishman, considered challenging Coulter. He mumbled a few words as if he were about to protest. But then he pulled himself together and did something as shocking as the oppression Trump had enforced and the calumnies Coulter had advanced: the little creep giggled, made a lame joke, then called for the ad break.Any competent surgeon could locate Hilton’s wound. He was once at the centre of power. He helped draft David Cameron’s modernising conservatism and was all for caring about the environment and using the internet to empower citizens. His thought was largely vacuous: Hilton was against big bureaucracies and in favour of children being free to enjoy “wholesome play” (I haven’t made this up). He was banal, but his was not the banality of evil.His career fell apart in 2012. Cameron lost patience with him and he left Downing Street. The former Tory guru, who was once the centre of attention, had joined the left-behind elite. If he was known, he was known because of his wife, a successful Silicon Valley executive – and not all men are happy with being upstaged by their partners. Once a somebody, Hilton was a nobody. He did what yesterday’s men have always done and jumped on the next big thing, which in the case of rightwing politics was the Trump movement. A job at Fox followed and the nobody was a somebody again.I’ve saved the best for last. Hilton is the child of Hungarian refugees who fled communist oppression and found a safe home in Britain. Now he can do nothing but stretch his mouth into an inane grin when the bureaucracy he once abhorred cages the children of today’s refugees and his fellow conservatives slander its victims as actors.The far right’s laughter recalls Sartre’s comment in 1944 that antisemites amuse themselves and “delight in acting in bad faith”. The calculation that embracing Trump is the smart career move recalls Dorothy Thompson’s warning in her 1941 essay, Who goes Nazi?, to watch out for the man who has risen beyond his real abilities and “whose sole measure of value” is success. If the Nazis were a minority movement, it would not attract him. “As a movement likely to attain power, it would.”Not that Hilton or even Murdoch have found power by attaching themselves to Trump. If Hilton had spoken out, Fox News viewers would have turned on him. I have heard wistful liberal Republicans say if only Murdoch and his sons would tell Fox to drop Trump, American conservatism could crawl out of its sewer. They do not understand how deep the rot has set. If the Murdoch family tried to change course, Fox would lose its audience, as surely as Republican politicians who challenged Trump have lost their seats. The iron law of autocracy is that the strongman rules and his courtiers, however grand, obey.All they can do is to fix a smile on their sagging faces and giggle."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e83a593cb0c571d783419052bb8481e173629bc/0_152_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7ef9a78f0f7a93ef1f328c46d59e5d62","title":"a level maths paper leaked online night before exam edexcel","story":"Watchdog investigates after Edexcel C4 paper allegedly offered for sale at £200An A-level maths paper was allegedly leaked on the internet the night before thousands of students sat the exam.The exams watchdog Ofqual said it was working with Pearson, the company that owns the Edexcel exam board, “to establish the facts” after the C4 maths paper apparently appeared for sale online on Thursday night. Students reported seeing the paper for sale at £200, with sellers said to be offering the first question for free to prove they had it. Ofqual said in a statement on Friday: “We are aware of the allegations of malpractice or wrongdoing in relation to Edexcel’s C4 maths paper taken today.

We are also contacting the police on this issue. “We’d like to reassure all students that the planned exams next week will continue as scheduled and that we have established processes in place to ensure no students will be advantaged or disadvantaged in any way.” Students who sat the exam discussed on social media their fears that they may be forced to resit, and their anger at the exam board over the leak. “I am actually so angry. Some of us gave our all to these exams so we could be proud of the grades we get at the end,” one student tweeted. Another said: “This is disgusting.

They have found that most are incapable of growing quickly enough to compensate for rising sea levels triggered by global warming.The study suggests that reefs – which are already suffering serious degradation because the world’s seas are warming and becoming more acidic – could also become overwhelmed by rising oceans.Sea levels rose by several inches over the past century and measurements indicate the speed of this increase is now rising significantly. Two key factors are involved: climate change is making ocean water warmer and so it expands. And as ice sheets and glaciers melt, they increase amounts of water in the oceans.At the same time, reefs are being weakened by ocean warming and also by ocean acidification, triggered as more and more the seas absorb more and more carbon dioxide. These effects lead to bleaching events that kill off vast stretches of coral and limits their ability to grow.“Our predictions, even under the best case scenarios, suggest that by 2100 the inundation of reefs will expose coastal communities to significant threats of shoreline change,” said co-author Prof Peter Mumby of Queensland University.This point was backed by US marine scientist Ilsa Kuffner writing in a separate comment piece for Nature. “The implications of the study are dire.

The British designer mined the Dior archive for inspiration to pay tribute to the man who established the fabled brand in 1946.“The collection is really based on Mr Dior’s personal life,” Jones told the Observer at a preview in the Rue Marignan atelier. “It is the idea of looking at different parts of his life.”Jones made his debut in Paris on Saturday afternoon as artistic director for Dior Men, the rechristened Dior Homme, completing the changing of the guard for the springsummer 2019 season. In a tribute to Dior and to his own heritage, Jones invited Prince Nikolai of Denmark to start the show. “I’m half Danish and Mr Dior always had that thing with royalty, and so I thought it would be nice to open with a prince – quite glamorous isn’t it?”Jones had only been at the brand for three months, following his departure from Louis Vuitton in January, and admits he didn’t have much time to dig deep. The elements he focused on in this first collection, however, will resonate with aficionados of the fashion house. Toile du jouy patterns from the wallpaper in the first Dior boutique were used on jacquards and leathers botanical emblems referenced Dior’s love of horticulture the famous cut used by Dior himself inspired the tailoring and the name of the new jacket, the Tailleur Oblique and pink and grey, shades synonymous with the brand, were used throughout.This aesthetic approach lends itself to a softer, more relaxed Dior Men than we are used to seeing. Jones’s predecessor, Kris Van Assche, who has since moved to fellow LVMH-owned brand Berluti, favoured dark palettes and sharp tailoring during his 11-year tenure. Before him, Hedi Slimane was lauded for his skinny suits – Chanel designer Karl Lagerfeld was said to have lost more than 40kg to fit into one of Slimane’s creations.The show notes said that this was about “translating a quintessentially feminine couture identity into a masculine idiom.” This intention mostly resonated with the striped tailoring that appeared to be similar to the lining of a suit, but had sheer organza overlays.There were, however, sportswear influences footwear featured trainer, shoe and boot hybrids, while baseball pumps and caps completed most looks. In the new Dior Men world order, this is representative of “contemporary masculinity”.To elevate the collection, Jones featured couture techniques with pieces such as the appliquéd feather and bead-embellished shirts. Trench coats were crafted from embroidered tulle and organza, while hand-sewn florals were layered with screen printed silk. Through transparent vinyl, florals and feathers – representing the ceramics found in Dior’s personal archive – could be seen. “We wanted to have very light touches, so that it has an ease to it and makes it effortless,” explained Jones.The bags will be a main takeaway from the collection. The brand’s famous Saddle bag has been made for the first time for men, and came in taupe and black backpacks, cross-body and belt-bags. The latter swung as the models walked to the sounds of Underworld’s Born Slippy and Orbital’s Halycon in a soundtrack mixed by the DJ Diplo. There were plenty of playful accessories that will, no doubt, attract a young audience. Dior’s favourite dog was called Bobby, so Dior Men’s jewellery designer, Yoon Ahn, created rhinestone-embellished dog-bone keyrings, as well as a perfume dispenser in the shape of the dog and its owner. Double rings (for two fingers) are made from precious stones, such as lapis lazuli, onyx and amethyst, while iPhone cases have finger grips spelling out the brand’s name so that “when you take a selfie in the mirror, you can see Dior”. Jones has also collaborated with New York-based artist Kaws, otherwise known as Brian Donnelly, on reimagining the famous Dior bee, the emblem synonymous with the house. This came embroidered on floral shirts, as well as accessories. Donnelly created a BFF doll (already popular on Instagram) dressed in clothes from the springsummer 2019 Baby Dior collection. He also created the set for the show, with an imposing 10ft floral BFF version of Mr Dior – made from pink, white and black roses and peonies – holding a white version of the Bobby perfume bottle. Elsewhere, Matthew Williams of 1017 Alyx 9SM made the metal buckles seen on accessories, while milliner Stephen Jones reimagined headwear from the archive also.Jones is happy to share the limelight with his collaborators and encourages new design talent. The London-born Central Saint Martins graduate has been prominent on the fashion scene since his teens. After setting up his eponymous label shortly after graduating, Jones was headhunted by Dunhill to be its creative director, only to be poached by Louis Vuitton to design its menswear line three years later, a role he held for seven years.Only two weeks before his Saturday debut, the 44-year-old was in London supporting friends Edward Crutchley and David Beckham at their London fashion week men’s shows. (Beckham was the first person to wear one of Jones’s Dior creations, at last month’s royal wedding).There’s a lot of love for Jones. Models Kate Moss and Naomi Campbell, who both walked the lap of honour with Jones as he took his final bow at Vuitton, Victoria Beckham, rapper A$AP Rocky, actor Gwendoline Christie and Kim Kardashian were among friends who arrived early in Paris to congratulate Jones in the Dior atelier as he completed final fittings.So too, was Virgil Abloh, Jones’s Vuitton successor, who showed his first collection on Thursday. Jones, who was there cheering, told the Observer that Abloh and his mentor, rapper Kanye West, used to sleep on his sofa 12 years ago when they were all trying to make it. “It’s nice to go full circle with friends,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc17f6c79d149fc986480406620fb78ec568a740/0_507_3658_2195/master/3658.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a9e99d0c19f760fc5d179b608e4d71aa","title":"the edit summer blouses","story":"Pretty tops were everywhere at the springsummer shows.

He talks about his four marriages, why explaining his films is a ‘crime’, and what makes him a happy camperDavid Lynch seldom smiles in photographs. His etched Easter Island statue of a face doesn’t glower so much as brood lips pursed and eyes hooded, he looks every inch the auteur in winter. The quiff completes the effect, its lush swirl seemingly frozen in place by alarming, Lynchian thoughts.In his 40 years of film-making, the director has taken audiences from sunlit American idylls to surreal dimensions populated by demons, doppelgangers and psychotic killers. His are scenes you can’t forget: the whimpering, deformed baby in Eraserhead, the severed ear in Blue Velvet, the blood-spattered, skull-crushing violence of Wild At Heart, the nuclear explosion in Twin Peaks: The Return. Google “David Lynch creepy”, and you get 5.5m results.Lynch works from a studio on a slope above one of three adjacent homes he owns in the Hollywood Hills, just a stone’s throw from Mulholland Drive. He is reclusive and seldom leaves this little realm, let alone grants audiences to journalists – but he is prepared to now, on the eve of publishing an unconventional memoir-cum-biography, Room To Dream. An assistant escorts me through the house (sleek concrete walls and surfaces, floor-to-ceiling shelves of VHS cassettes and CDs) and up through the garden to the studio. A snake slithered across the path earlier this morning, the assistant says.Lynch sits in a corner, hunched over a lithograph. The tabletop brims with paint pots, lotions, chemicals, gel formula cement, lithographic paper, pneumatic drills, cables, wires and paintbrushes. There is a mug of coffee, a pack of cigarettes. The director wears cracked, ancient boots, ragged chinos and the remnants of a black buttoned-up shirt that looks to have been shredded by a badger.It’s a scene that might be intimidating were it not for a great, largely untold secret: David Lynch is a cheery, congenial soul who rivals the Simpsons character Ned Flanders for howdy-doody niceness. “Hey, bud!” he greets the assistant, offering me a handshake and wide smile. He laughs, often, and yearns for peace on Earth. “I love my life and I’m a happy camper,” he says. “It would be nice if we were all able to fulfil our desires and live good, long, happy lives.”The studio is a bunker-like structure of concrete and glass that overlooks a panorama of trees, bougainvillea and villa rooftops. You can feel the morning sun and hear birdsong. “I like it up here, the trees,” Lynch says, speaking with the halting lilt of Gordon Cole, the FBI agent he plays in Twin Peaks (only without the deafness). “It’s a feeling I get in LA, a feeling of freedom. The light, and the way the buildings are not so tall. You can do what you want.” Would he like a coffee, his assistant asks? “Yeah, I’m about ready for a hot one, thank you.” There is no toilet up here, so to save trekking down to the house the boss pees into a sink built into the wall. “See that thing with the handle? It pulls out,” Lynch explains. “You can pee right in there. Then you run the faucet.”A large canvas standing in the middle of the studio, an unfinished work, depicts a tree with children. Closer scrutiny reveals that the boy standing at the base is holding a knife. A girl on the branch above is cowering. Another girl is dangling from a noose. Neither look like candidates for good, long, happy lives.You can find suffering and death anywhere if you look, Lynch says. The other day, a spider’s web next to his desk snagged a bee. The bee broke free, only to get snagged again. “The spider came out, started wrapping him, and pretty soon the spider had him wrapped completely. And I think bit him, too. Then he undoes the packaging and drugs him and drags him.” Lynch smiles at the memory. “Man, that is a violent thing.” LA is glorious, he says, “but you see things.”What Lynch sees, and then puts on screen for us to see, is one of the great enigmas of cinema, one that has launched a thousand film studies PhDs. When the director looks at a manicured lawn, his mind’s eye tunnels beneath it to hidden mystery, mysticism and depravity – visions he has turned into mind-bending television and film. It’s an oeuvre people tend to love or detest, and even devotees don’t claim to fully understand. With the exception of The Elephant Man (1980) and The Straight Story (1999), his films are oblique and non-linear. Who is the chipmunk-cheeked Lady in the Radiator who crushes sperm-like worms while singing to the father of the mutant baby in Eraserhead? How much of Mulholland Drive is real, or dreamed by Naomi Watts’ aspiring actor? And is the ending really the beginning?Lynch is the last man to provide any answers but now, at the age of 72, he has opened up – sort of – in his 577-page doorstopper of a book. Room To Dream declares itself at the outset to be a chronicle of events, not an explanation of their meaning. Chapters alternate between Lynch’s own recollections and those of his friends, relatives and collaborators, as told to his co-author Kristine McKenna. There is his boyhood in 1950s middle America, his early painting career, his four marriages – to Peggy Lentz, to Mary Fisk, to his longtime editor and producer Mary Sweeney, to the actor Emily Stofle – as well as his relationships with other women. What emerges is not so much Lynch, but two very distinct Lynches: the single-minded and reclusive visionary who is also a savvy media player the hermit who very consciously nurtures his brand.He is at his most animated when discussing ideas. “They’re like fish. If you get an idea that’s thrilling to you, put your attention on it and these other fish will swim into it. It’s like a bait. They’ll hook on to it and you’ll get more ideas. And you just pull them in.”When he puts a story on screen, he does not think in term of beats or plot points. “No, it’s a feeling, more of an intuition. It’s the idea that you’ve fallen in love with, and you try to stay true to that. You see the way that cinema can say that idea, and it’s thrilling to you.”He is not about to make a big-screen film any time soon: while he loves the superior sound and picture quality of cinema, Lynch thinks theatrical releases have become too short. “I would not make a feature film in today’s world because the kind of films I make couldn’t be on the big screen for very long.” Better, then, to make shows for television, a medium that is more comfortable with loose ends and narrative culs-de-sac, where he can tell a “continuing story”.There is a theory that Lynch himself doesn’t always know what is going on in his stories. He shoots this down. “I need to know for myself what things mean and what’s going on. Sometimes I get ideas, and I don’t know exactly what they mean. So I think about it, and try to figure it out, so I have an answer for myself.”Audiences, however, must do their own figuring out. “I don’t ever explain it. Because it’s not a word thing. It would reduce it, make it smaller.” These days he rarely gives interviews, not even during the hugely hyped return of Twin Peaks last year – a show that is still debated as either the best or worst TV of 2017. “When you finish anything, people want you to then talk about it. And I think it’s almost like a crime,” he explains. “A film or a painting – each thing is its own sort of language and it’s not right to try to say the same thing in words. The words are not there. The language of film, cinema, is the language it was put into, and the English language – it’s not going to translate. It’s going to lose.”Lynch takes a cigarette, lights up and inspects his work table, perhaps wishing he could express himself with the gel formula cement rather than these slippery, inadequate words.A film or TV show is like a magic act, he continues, “and magicians don’t tell how they did a thing”. He hates the idea of behind-the-scenes footage or making-of films about special effects. “People do it for sales, for money. But the film is the thing and should be protected.”So no guidance on Twin Peaks: The Return’s finale, which fleetingly resolved some storylines only to fracture them and create new puzzles? Even diehard fans yearned for clarity.He does, however, squash the theory, much loved by some Peakers, that the last two parts of the 18-hour series should be watched simultaneously on two screens, with dialogue overlapping. “Yeah, I heard that. It’s bullshit. See, it’s beautiful that someone came up with this. You could double-expose scenes in lots of films and it could conjure some fantastic thing.”I heard plenty of other theories at Twin Peaks: The Return’s gala premiere last year, a glitzy affair in downtown Los Angeles where the guests drank cocktails and wore tuxedos and gowns. Lynch and his co-creator, Mark Frost, had such tight control over the script and the edit that the audience had no idea what to expect – not even the Showtime studio executives who had paid for the entire series. Tight smiles masked a collective thought: please God, don’t let it suck.Lynch made a gnomic speech about trees, then the curtains parted and the first two hours rolled, reuniting Agent Cooper, the Log Lady, Laura Palmer and other characters last seen in 1991. Kyle MacLachlan’s Dale Cooper was still trapped in an extra-dimensional Black Lodge, amid an even stranger universe a school principal was arrested on suspicion of beheading a librarian a young couple were violently killed by a ghostly entity which sprang from a glass box. There was also a talking tree.When it ended there was a hush, followed by thunderous applause. The most popular adjective at the after-party was “mind-blowing”. Nobody understood the plot or seemed to like the characters, but it didn’t matter: Lynch was a genius.I found one heretic, a Dutch journalist, who confessed he had been bored. Other guests bristled: could he not see the brilliance? The Dutchman filed a negative review but his editors ran a different one, proclaiming a television milestone. The Lynch train was rolling.As Twin Peaks: The Return progressed, even fans acknowledged there was a kind of masochism to watching it – witness a two-and-a-half-minute scene in which a man does nothing except sweep a floor. When Cooper finally escapes the Black Lodge back into the real world, the FBI agent is reborn as a dullard insurance salesman – a character so slow and monosyllabic it is sometimes physically painful to watch his scenes opposite onscreen wife Naomi Watts.“This withholding of pleasure is Twin Peaks’ new secret weapon, and it works,” wrote the ’s Stuart Heritage. Others disagreed, the Hollywood Reporter branding the reboot a “self-indulgent, pointless, meaningless… exercise in misplaced nostalgia and auteur idol-worship”.When I ask Lynch if this kind of thing stings, he says he tends not to read reviews. “The good ones aren’t good enough, and the bad ones will depress you.”Nor does he see much other TV or cinema. When I ask what he likes to watch, Lynch says crime shows and car shows, but declines to elaborate. His favourite film of the past year? He goes silent and scrunches his face, thinking, thinking, thinking. The silence stretches. He puffs on the cigarette. Later I check the tape. Not a word for 46 seconds.He must have seen some. The Shape Of Water?Does he have any curiosity about them?“Not really. I never was a movie buff. I like to make movies. I like to work. I don’t really like to go out.”But these days you can watch them at home.In Room To Dream, Lynch says he used to be angry and thought this gave his work an edge. Then he took up transcendental meditation (TM), lost the anger and gained better focus. He has evangelised about TM ever since, dedicating his book to the late Indian guru Maharishi Mahesh Yogi “and the world family”. Sceptics take note: this highly caffeinated, pack-a-day smoker is possibly the least jittery person in Hollywood.He also believes in reincarnation, which keeps him Zen about growing old and losing friends and colleagues, including Twin Peaks: The Return collaborators Harry Dean Stanton, Miguel Ferrer and Catherine Coulson (the Log Lady), all of whom have died since filming. “Life is a short trip but always continuing,” he says, tapping ash. “We’ll all meet again. In enlightenment you realise what you truly are and go into immortality. You don’t ever have to die after that.”Politically, meanwhile, Lynch is all over the map. He voted for Bernie Sanders in the 2016 Democratic primary and thinks – he’s not sure – he voted Libertarian in the presidential election. “I am not really a political person, but I really like the freedom to do what you want to do,” says the persecuted Californian smoker.He is undecided about Donald Trump. “He could go down as one of the greatest presidents in history because he has disrupted the thing so much. No one is able to counter this guy in an intelligent way.” While Trump may not be doing a good job himself, Lynch thinks, he is opening up a space where other outsiders might. “Our so-called leaders can’t take the country forward, can’t get anything done. Like children, they are. Trump has shown all this.”Room To Dream contains no Rosebud revelation, no key to unlock Lynch, though it does offer clues in his childhood. A happy boy, he grew up in a loving extended family and made friends easily. They biked, hiked, built backyard forts. His mother, an English language tutor, would not give him colouring books in case they restricted his imagination. With his father, an agriculture research scientist, he inspected diseased and decaying trees they also hunted deer, skinning and eating them. Lynch recounts a memory of flies crawling on a porcupine they shot.There is another striking scene from childhood. One night, Lynch writes, he encountered a beautiful naked woman walking down the street, bruised and traumatised. “It was so incredible. It seemed to me that her skin was the colour of milk, and she had a bloodied mouth.” He was too young or too transfixed to find out who she was before she vanished.After art school, Lynch hustled for years to make Eraserhead, widely believed to be a response to the birth of his first child, Jennifer, who had club feet. Cineasts still debate what the onscreen infant was made of: skinned rabbit, lamb foetus? But when I ask Lynch he bats it away. “I don’t talk about the baby.”Eraserhead landed Lynch a job directing The Elephant Man. His attempt to personally mould and apply John Hurt’s makeup failed, forcing him to hire a specialist and triggering an extraordinary bout of self-reproach. “I thought it would be better to kill myself because I could hardly stand to be in my body,” he writes. He recovered only to clash with Hurt’s co-star, Anthony Hopkins, who deemed the young American out of his depth and tried to get him fired. Mel Brooks, who produced the film, recalls an angry phone call from Hopkins but not an explicit demand to fire Lynch. In any case, he defended his director and shepherded The Elephant Man to eight Oscar nominations in 1980. Brooks remains a fan, telling Lynch’s co-author: “He’s all screwed up, too, of course, and he projects his own emotional and sexual turmoil into his work and assaults us with the feelings he’s being assaulted by.”One of the great puzzles about Lynch is his relationship with women. He writes strong female leads, and has worked for years with many of the same actors (Naomi Watts, Laura Dern, Sheryl Lee) yet the frequent onscreen violence has led to accusations of misogyny. Offscreen, he can be brutal when it comes to the end of a relationship. In Room To Dream, Isabella Rossellini that Lynch laughed while shooting her rape scene with Dennis Hopper in Blue Velvet, and “I still don’t know why.” Rossellini went on to have an affair with the director, a relationship that ended his marriage to Mary Fisk. “My heart was truly broken, and I was walking around like a lost person with blood dripping from every pore,” Fisk tells McKenna. She has since forgiven him.Throughout the book, and in his own telling, it is clear that Lynch’s most enduring passion is work. When his current wife, Emily Stofle, an actor who appeared in Inland Empire and Twin Peaks: The Return, became pregnant, he warned her that film would still come first. Their daughter was born when Lynch was 66, and Stofle 35. “After I had Lula, he disappeared into his work, which is what he does… he works and that’s where he gets his joy,” she tells McKenna.I ask Lynch how he manages to inspire such loyalty, despite such strict rationing of human contact – from his collaborators, friends, even his exes. He drops his cigarette on the floor and stubs it out with a boot before answering. “I like to have some people around. If I was totally alone I think I’d get funny, and not in a humorous way.”As a father and husband he has often been absent, he concedes. “You gotta be selfish. And it’s a terrible thing. I never really wanted to get married, never really wanted to have children. One thing leads to another and there it is.”That sounds like regret, until he elaborates. “I did what I had to do. There could have been more work done. There are always so many interruptions.”• Room To Dream, by David Lynch and Kristine McKenna, is published by Canongate Books at £25.

Was he cross? Not in the slightest. Was he bemused by the way it had been whipped up? Absolutely. “It’s a bonkers environment, isn’t it?” he asked, nursing a dislocated shoulder, supposedly at war with the England press corps and fending off questions from a Chinese journalist about the “hilarious” and “ridiculous” mistakes of England’s footballers through the ages, Raheem Sterling in particular.A degree of sanity is needed because England remains a largely stress-free camp and Southgate – previously part of the England travelling media – is not, as purported, in a huff with anyone. He explained his views on the reporting of his possible team, starting with an acceptance that he wished he had worded Friday’s comments differently. There is no row. There never was – “I’m totally relaxed,” the manager said – and it was probably a relief for everyone once he had put it to bed and we could start talking about football again, the old-fashioned way.England will, after all, qualify for the knockout stages, with a game to spare, if they can cope with the punishing heat and a muscular Panama side in their second assignment of Group G. That cannot be sniffed at bearing in mind it would be only the third time that England have won their opening two fixtures in a major tournament, dating back to 1950. The last occasion was the 2006 World Cup when Sven-Göran Eriksson’s team beat Paraguay and Trinidad and Tobago. Before that, it was 1982 and back-to-back wins for Ron Greenwood against France and Czechoslovakia.Otherwise, England have not managed it in 21 other tournaments, which leaves the current manager wondering sometimes why the expectations are always so high. “It goes back to what I’ve always said to the lads,” Southgate said. “There’s a perception that England have always been hugely successful. When you dig deeper, our history is actually different.”England’s total of six knockout wins in major tournaments since 1966 emphasises the point again. The message from Southgate was that it was time for his players to create their own history, rather than being weighed down by what had happened in the past, and he can certainly be encouraged by the number of chances his team created against Tunisia in their opening game.Dele Alli will be missing because of his thigh injury but Southgate has everyone available, the most pressing issue being whether he perseveres with Raheem Sterling or opts for Marcus Rashford to play alongside Harry Kane.The downside is that England would have to win by six goals to overtake Belgium at the top of the group on goal difference. Far more likely, Roberto Martínez’s side will need a draw to win the group when England take them on in Kaliningrad on Thursday. In that scenario, England would play their first knockout tie in Moscow against the winner of Group H, where Japan and Senegal have won their opening fixtures. Yet Martínez’s declaration that he will make a number of changes against England, with Romelu Lukaku and Eden Hazard among the players likely to be rested, adds another element of intrigue.Not that England should be thinking too far ahead when Panama have the potential to be awkward opponents, with temperatures of 30C (86F) forecast and the locals here warning that the glass panels of the stadium will make it feel much hotter.On that front, Southgate said there was “no physiological benefit to train in the heat the couple of weeks before and think there will be an adaptation”. He sounded like he meant it but it is a concern behind the scenes. The advice given to Southgate was that England should acclimatise in a hot area and England had initially identified a hotel in the Black Sea resort of Gelendzhik. The decision to base themselves in Repino, where it has been 16C to 18C, surprised a number of officials at the Football Association. The heat in Nizhny Novgorod is fierce, to say the least.All of which increases the importance of England’s players to move the ball well and make sure their opponents expend energy trying to win it back. “We’ve done a lot of due diligence on Panama over the last few months, watching all their qualifiers and all their matches since,” Southgate said. “We don’t expect too many surprises in terms of how they play.”One danger will be Panama’s tactic of long throw-ins. England have been practising how to combat that in training but Southgate has also stressed the importance of not giving away free-kicks in dangerous areas, noting the number of set-piece goals so far.“I studied Germany a lot from the previous World Cup and one of the big things was they didn’t concede fouls in their third of the pitch. They were incredibly low numbers. We’ve been consistently doing that over a period of time because the quality of every team these days on set plays is high.”As for the hullabaloo about a photographer taking a picture of Holland’s notes during an open session for the media on Friday, Southgate made his position clear. “I totally understand the media have a role to report the news\u0026nbsp…\u0026nbspI don’t expect the media to be supporters of us in terms of the way they work. They’re here to work. I know they want us to do well. That’s been clear through the tournament.”The headlines, indeed, will be kind if England can achieve their aim in the oppressive heat."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f0567793272b0be6b14a39a7b65dd6e051633491/0_53_4579_2748/master/4579.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ffd2bb7db38c5540381f6c6546a942f1","title":"philippe coutinho brazil world cup neymar","story":"Amid the Seleção’s customary overblown operetta of fear, joy and lurking emotional collapse the Barcelona midfielder is an island of self-assurance, balance and skillAs Pelé famously pointed out, all you really need is a ball and the green, green grass. Plus of course, in his long-form World Cup version, a vast media presence that could pack out the St Petersburg Stadium on its own a bubble of crushing continental-scale expectation and above all tears, tears and more tears.Nobody does World Cup angst quite like Brazil. As Tite’s talented team wrestled their way to a fraught but ultimately useful 2-0 defeat of Costa Rica by the Gulf of Finland there were howls, cries of frustration, and constant reminders that for Brazil simply being present at the World Cup is to become immersed in a vast overblown operetta of fear, joy and lurking emotional collapse.And that was just in the press room after the game. By which point two things had become clear. First, Philippe Coutinho has been both Brazil’s player of the tournament to date and, along with Luka Modric, the outstanding midfielder of Russia 2018’s early stages.This should not be a surprise. But it is a part of the Coutinho shtick that despite having recently moved to Barcelona for £130m it is still possible to suggest he is very slightly underrated, his talents a tiny bit overlooked in a climate where star footballers are so often celebrated beyond all proportion.In this regard it helps that Coutinho plays for Brazil in the shadow of Neymar, whose emotional paroxysms dominated their first win at this World Cup, even as the beautifully balanced No 8 just behind him was putting on a quiet masterclass of passing, moving, dribbling and shooting.Brazil are already headed off towards a Group E denouement against Serbia in Moscow on Wednesday. For now Coutinho’s performance feels like a significant note in the early currents of this World Cup. Brazil will improve. Neymar will find his fitness and his edge. But Coutinho’s assertiveness is a rare thing, an inidual display of assured winning quality from one of the contenders and a note of cold certainty in the middle of all that quavering emotion.At which point the second thing that became clear post-match was that no one does press conferences quite like Brazil, either. Tite spoke so long and so passionately that after a while you began to worry about the closure of the metro system and the gathering threat of dehydration.Even the questions from Brazil’s travelling media were full of sub‑clauses and caveats (“And my second part of this question is, do you, Professor, believe that ...”). Tite listened to them all and answered in detail.The most striking part was his line on his overwrought star player, a moment to make those of us exasperated by Neymar’s antics stop and think a little. Neymar, Tite proclaimed, is just a human. He was incredibly stressed. He reacted that way because this means everything to him.No doubt this World Cup also means a lot to the Costa Rica players Neymar repeatedly swore at and, so it seemed, tried to cheat. But nobody operates in quite such a steam‑cooked environment at modern tournaments.Four years ago it was clear Brazil were almost done before the Colombia game when Thiago Silva burst into tears at the pre-match press conference. The most remarkable thing about Neymar then was his ability to let this pressure slide off him, to remain opaque, cheerful, fully revved. St Petersburg was Neymar feeling it.In this context Brazil will be thankful for Tite, a calm, wryly amused figure at the heart of all this melodrama. His changes made the difference against Costa Rica. Douglas Costa came on at half-time and began to torture the left side of the defence with his speed and precision. Roberto Firmino – a more aggressive presence than Gabriel Jesus – was introduced at the right moment.Plus Coutinho was a constant through every shift and change of shape. Watching him at the St Petersburg Stadium, able to run and pass and take possession with such preternatural balance, as though the ball is simply an extension of his big toe, the thought occurred that only Modric among current midfielders looks this natural and this easy, players who basically are football, who express its angles and energy in every movement.Even a Martian visitor could have watched to half-time and decided, yes, the relentless little No 8 is the most natural midfielder you are likely to see, and come to think of it why on earth isn’t he on free kicks.Again there is a matter of star weighting. Granit Xhaka made some interesting mind-games-style comments in the lead-up to Brazil’s opening match. Xhaka, who clearly does not like Neymar much, recalled a junior World Cup match against Brazil. Neymar was the star in that team, too, a player who already looked like he could sprint the length of the pitch and barely disturb the morning dew. But it was Coutinho who blew the mind of the young Swiss players with his command of every part of his game.It is this all-rounder status, shooting, passing, running, creating, covering space with dreamy levels of craft, that is Coutinho’s unique quality. By the end of Friday’s game he had run more any other Brazil player without the ball, made more sprints than any of his teammates, and run further overall than anyone bar 12 of 484 players to take the field at Russia 2018.With this industry there are of course moments of thrilling quality: the flicked lofted pass to put Neymar in on goal in the first half against Costa Rica. The signature curled dipping right-foot goal against the Swiss, the parabola of the ball taking it two feet outside the post, before violent late in-swing brought it howling into the furthest corner of the net.Coutinho’s craft is key in a Brazil midfield where he sits alongside two more muscular players in Paulinho and Casemiro. Ahead of him it is also worth acknowledging Neymar’s theatricals, and his dribbling skills took Costa Rica players out of the game, helping Coutinho to thrive.This is the secondary benefit of having a real gun attacking player, a hidden pocket of space that Argentina, most obviously, have been unable to exploit at this World Cup. There is plenty of tightening up required for Tite’s Selecao from here. But with two of Big Phil Scolari’s seven steps to heaven just about negotiated, the main man in the middle is already thrumming up through the gears."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/593b45fc60a0b061723f9ead565e34d8a97bb90d/0_153_3099_1859/master/3099.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a782fab639e8298bbdafcfe966e9bd5c","title":"south korea mexico world cup match report","story":"Mexico must secure a point in their final group stage match against Sweden to ensure they reach the last 16 for a seventh straight World Cup after they eased to victory over South Korea in Rostov. Having shocked the world champions, Germany, in their opening Group\u0026nbspF game, Mexico secured a 2-1 win as Carlos Vela tucked home a first-half penalty before Javier Hernández clinched the points with his 50th international goal.South Korea, who pulled a goal back in stoppage time through Son Heung‑min, are all but out after enduring a second narrow defeat. But after Germany’s late victory over Sweden, Mexico face a nervous showdown in Ekaterinburg on Wednesday as they bid to get past the last 16 for the first time since hosting the finals in 1986.“We came to Russia with a lot of criticism but we’re working hard and have a lot of talent. We have humility but we beat Germany and South Korea and now we have to play against Sweden and stay cool and calm,” Hernández said.“We cannot afford to get caught up in all this, we have to continue our job and stay humble. Of course we should enjoy this but tomorrow we start working again,” he added after he equalled Luis Hernández’s record of four goals at World Cup finals for Mexico.South Korea were guilty of committing a number of fouls throughout the match, leading the Mexico coach, Juan Carlos Osorio, to complain his players had not been given enough protection.“Usually, I don’t like to talk about referees but there was something I didn’t like and that was that there were 24 fouls against us,” said Osorio. “It’s very easy to analyse who committed them. For the good of football, I hope they take the necessary precautions and measures.”Osorio, who is hoping to break Mexico’s run of six successive last-16 World Cup eliminations, said he spent a lot of time making sure complacency did not creep in after their win over Germany.“What often happens against teams with less history is that the human being tends to relax but we dedicated all week to making sure we did not let that happen and fortunately the message didn’t get lost among all the praise the team has received,” he said.“Football is about opinions, it’s very subjective and it changes all the time. The analysis is more about the result so the most appropriate thing for us is to keep preparing and not get carried out. We must prepare for the next game as if it is the last and get as far in the World Cup as we can.”.Mexico needed only 26 minutes to take the lead after Hirving Lozano initially failed to turn home a low cross. They were awarded a penalty as Jang Hyun-soo was penalised for handball – referee Milorad Mazic not needing to use VAR to point to the\u0026nbspspot. Vela stepped up and coolly sent Cho Hyun-woo the wrong way to mark his 70th cap with the opening goal.The second half began more equally but it was Cho who was once again called into action just before the hour, neatly tipping a deflected Andrés Guardado effort behind for a corner. Vela angled a curling strike just over the bar before Hernández made sure of the win with a landmark goal.With time running out, Son scored South Korea’s first goal of the finals and it was one worth waiting for as the Tottenham forward bent a 20-yard strike out of the reach of Ochoa and into the corner – but it proved too little, too late.Juan Carlos Osorio’s side now face a final group game against Sweden in Ekaterinburg on Wednesday, while South Korea take on Germany in\u0026nbspKazan."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8eec94e40c38eadcf5d6f58a263cac7f4ca4740c/0_202_3000_1799/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=287a03854f566c37d5f65d4ab694509f","title":"toni kroos germany sweden world cup match report","story":"Joachim Löw had been asked about the curse of world champions past. Three of the previous four World Cup winners had exited at the group phase – France (2002), Italy (2010), Spain (2014) – and the Germany manager knew his team stood to be the next. After the debacle that had been the defeat against Mexico in the opening Group F tie, the pressure was on. It pulsed against German temples because everybody knew that Sweden were likely to be a tough nut to crack. Their goalkeeper, Robin Olsen, had entered the game having not conceded since October last year.It was pretty much win or bust for Germany because even a draw would have left them without control of their destiny in the final round of group matches. On a wild night, they once again showed their defensive frailties and it was a glaring example of their indiscipline when Jérôme Boateng, who had been booked, leapt into a reckless 85th-minute tackle on Marcus Berg to leave his team with 10 men.But at the other end, they attacked with abandon during a thrilling second half and, with 18 seconds of the five minutes of stoppage time remaining, they got their reward, their reprieve. The angle to the left of the penalty area looked to be too tight for Toni Kroos as he stood over a free-kick. But he made it slightly better by touching the ball to Marco Reus, who gave it back and what happened next was a contender for goal of the tournament.Kroos’s technique was flawless, the bend on the shot wicked and it fizzed beyond Olsen into the far, top corner. Germany roared Sweden were broken, even though a win over Mexico in their final game would see them qualify, and there were angry scenes upon the full-time whistle, as the rival benches clashed.“Some of the German bench celebrated by running in our direction and rubbing it into our faces by making gestures and that really got me annoyed,” Janne Andersson, the Sweden manager, said. “We fight it out for 95 minutes and then you shake it out and leave so I was very angry. People behaved in ways that you do not do. This is probably the most crushing end to a game I’ve\u0026nbspexperienced.”It was a result that got away from Sweden because, make no mistake, they could have been home and hosed at the interval, after a first half in which they scored through Ola Toivonen and might have had more. There was the highly contentious decision on 12 minutes not to award them a penalty after Boateng had pushed Berg when he was the last man, which looked to be the wrong call and the impression would only be strengthened with each TV replay. Don’t mention the VAR. The video assistants did not come into play.Löw was brave and fortune favoured him. He had made four changes from the Mexico game – the most eye-catching of which were the omissions of Sami Khedira and Mesut Özil – and he lost the former’s replacement, Sebastian Rudy, to a broken nose after half an hour. Rudy was bloodied after being caught, inadvertently, by Toivonen.Löw introduced Mario Gomez for the second half, with Timo Werner moving to the left wing and Thomas Müller pushing up as a second striker, and he and his players threw everything into the salvage operation. The sense of adventure was pronounced.Jonas Hector, the left-back, wandered into an inside-forward position at times and Löw’s final move in the 87th minute was dramatic. He withdrew Hector, despite being a man down, and sent on the attacking midfielder Julian Brandt, who promptly rattled a post with a ferocious drive. Joshua Kimmich and Antonio Rüdiger were the only recognised defenders on the pitch at the end. Thanks to Kroos, the gamble paid off.Kroos had been the villain for Germany in the first half. He gave the ball away, uncharacteristically, to Berg and, when it was worked wide, Viktor Claesson crossed for Toivonen. The striker took an excellent first touch on his chest and the second was even better – a glorious lob that gave Manuel Neuer no chance.Germany played on the front foot but the worry for Löw was how threatening Sweden looked in the first half on the counterattack how easily they carved apart his team. It was extraordinary to see a German defence in such open and obliging mood.The penalty controversy followed a simple pass that set Berg clean through – the chasing Boateng not only shoved him, he also appeared to trip him – and when Emil Forsberg drove an opening on 44 minutes, he had two yellow shirts in glorious positions. Where were the defenders? He picked out Claesson but he decided against the first time shot, which was a bad move. Hector got across to tackle. Berg also worked Neuer with a glancing header.Germany had gone close early on through Julian Draxler and Hector while the substitute Ilkay Gündogan extended Olsen with a deflected long-ranger but they were a different team after half-time.Reus, who more than justified his selection ahead of Özil, got the equaliser from Werner’s cross and it was all Germany. Reus could not flick home with a trailing leg from Kimmich’s lovely cross Werner lifted high and, after Andreas Granqvist had extended Neuer at the other end, the 10 men almost snatched it only for Olsen to tip over from Gomez’s header. The sting in the tale was still to come."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dfb5b674c267a7ed098018df204166e12cff4a51/177_0_4641_2785/master/4641.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9f851d9f7e0e3eb674a4a72dee2d644a","title":"xhaka and shaqiri goal celebrations bring balkan politics to world cup","story":"Fifa has opened disciplinary proceedings against Switzerland’s Granit Xhaka and Xherdan Shaqiri after they celebrated their goals during a 2-1 World Cup win over Serbia in Kaliningrad by performing an Albanian nationalist symbol.Xhaka and Shaqiri, who are of Albanian-Kosovan heritage but were raised in Switzerland, put their hands together to form what looked like a double-headed eagle similar to the one on the Albanian flag. The gestures risked inflaming political tensions in the Balkans among Serbian nationalists and ethnic Albanians. Kosovo is a former Serbian province that declared independence in 2008. Serbia does not recognise Kosovo’s independence and relations between the two countries remain tense.The Serbian FA lodged a formal complaint on Saturday, with football’s governing body later confirming that Arsenal’s Xhaka and Shaqiri of Stoke are both under investigation. A preliminary investigation has also begun into alleged comments made by the Serbia coach, Mladen Krstajic, after the match, while disciplinary proceedings have also been opened against the Serbian FA “for crowd disturbance and the display of political and offensive messages.”Shaqiri, who was born in Kosovo, played with the Kosovan flag stitched to one boot and the Swiss flag stitched on the other. Xhaka’s parents are from Kosovo and are of Albanian heritage. The Arsenal midfielder’s father was imprisoned and beaten in the former Yugoslavia for campaigning in favour of Kosovan independence and his brother Taulant plays for Albania’s national team.Jovan Surbatovic, the secretary general of the Serbian FA, had earlier said he would write to world football’s governing body regarding “the case of the boots, a question of several controversial flags and the celebration of both goals for Switzerland”. Fifa rules do not directly contemplate punishment for showing a national flag but, according to its disciplinary code, sanctions can be handed out for “provoking the general public”. If found guilty, players can be banned for up to two games. Fifa was approached for comment but has not responded. Xhaka and Shaqiri have suggested their actions were not provocative.“Frankly, my opponents did not interest me at all,” Xhaka said. “It was for my people, who always supported me. For those who did not neglect me, in my homeland, where my parents’ roots are. These were purely emotions.”Shaqiri, who plays for Stoke City, admitted that he was not allowed to talk about “politics” and insisted the celebration was “just emotion”. As he went through the stadium’s mixed zone he grew irritated at the questioning, replying “let’s not talk about this” and walking out when again asked what the significance of the celebration was.“It was a fantastic goal, an important goal for my team and I am very proud I was able to score it for them,” Shaqiri said. “I can’t discuss the gesture I’m afraid. We are footballers, not politicians… Emotions sometimes take over footballers and there was a lot of emotion out there.” He acknowledged it was “a very special game for some players”. Among the Switzerland team that started against Serbia, Valon Behrami is also of Kosovan heritage.Those players had been whistled by a crowd in which it appeared most Russians in the stadium supported Serbia. There were chants of “Serbia-Russia! Serbia-Russia” and a banner declared the two countries “brothers”.After the match, Switzerland’s coach, Vladimir Petkovic, said: “It’s clear that emotions show up and that’s how things happen. I think we all together need to steer away from politics in football and we should focus on this sport as a beautiful game and something that brings people together.” Krstajic was less magnanimous when asked about the decision not to award a penalty to Aleksandar Mitrovic in the second half. “We were robbed,” he said. “I wouldn’t give him either a yellow or red card, I would send him to the Hague. Then they could put him on trial, like they did to us.”Krstajic also posted photographs from the match on his Instagram account, accompanied by the comment: “Unfortunately, it seems that only the Serbs are condemned to a selective justice, once (it was) the damned Hague and today in football the VAR...”The Serbian press officer angrily intervened to prevent what he called “political” questions when Serbia’s Nemanja Matic was asked what he made of the celebration. He threatened to report journalists for doing so.The buildup to the match had seen exchanges between Serbia players and Shaqiri. Mitrovic, who scored Serbia’s goal, asked: “If he loves Kosovo so much and decides to flaunt the flag, why did he refuse a chance to play for their team?” There were a couple of clashes between the pair on the pitch too. At one point, Mitrovic leant forward to say something to Shaqiri when he was on the floor, covering his mouth with his hand as he did so. “I didn’t understand, maybe he spoke Serbian to me,” Shaqiri said. “I had told him already to keep calm and do his job… Of course the Serbian fans were whistling, that’s normal, no? We knew it was going to come but we kept calm. Both teams played with respect and that’s important.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a0de03d9d3198c9e1083416a36d3f2e37dfc1d1/0_346_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0c3bdb4a7f3dda60bcb28a81f5775e2e 700w","title":"world cup 2018 reaction to germanys win and england buildup live","story":"The pod point out that with just 75 seconds of injury time remaining John Guidetti shoots tamely at Manuel Neuer from a low percentage angle when he could easily have bled more time from the clock by running the ball into the corner.

It isn’t the process of getting pregnant, with its cycles of raised and dashed hopes, or the term “sperm donor”, with its unsettling connotations. It’s not even the queasy feeling that what you are doing sets you apart from other people and that the reason you are doing it is not that you are a powerful, rational, resourceful woman, but, as a friend of mine put it after considering and rejecting the idea of having a baby alone, that “I couldn’t get anyone to shag me”.No. The hardest thing about having a baby alone is making the decision to do it.“So are you going to do it then?” says Rosemary. It is late summer 2013 and we are drinking whisky in a hotel bar in Edinburgh. “Yeah, probably,” I say. “I mean, I might. Are you?”I haven’t seen Rosemary for months and it is only after a lot of whisky, and with a casualness that belies the cold terror underneath, that we reach the main order of business: our ongoing discussion, part lament, part spur to action, over what to do about having children. That is: if, when, how and with whom, or, since we are both, for the purposes of this conversation, single, “with” “whom”.I have always known I wanted children. From the time I was old enough to conceptualise my future, motherhood made sense to me. It was always one child in my imaginings and never part of a fantasy about marriage, and while everything else in my life changed over the years – the country I lived in, the kind of work I did, the gender of the people I dated – the distant outline of a child remained steadfast. On the rare occasions I allowed myself to inspect it directly, the idea that it might never happen made me feel giddy with loss.I met L two years after moving to New York. On the surface of things, we looked very different – me, English, lefty, fundamentally unkempt she, New Yorker, centre-right, well put together. On any given day we could disagree about everything – fact or fiction, subway or car, Republican or Democrat – so that, in the months after we met, it felt like being on safari in each other’s alien worlds. If falling in love is, partly, a question of finding a docking station for one’s neuroses, I knew I was home when L told me that, after her building was evacuated during 911, she went straight to an off-licence and bought hundreds of dollars’ worth of booze in case civilisation collapsed and the world reverted to a barter economy. Come the zombie apocalypse, this is a woman you want on your side. But there was this, too: the house she grew up in would one day have to be sold, she said, and what she would miss most were the things you can’t take with you, like the sound the stairs made when they expanded at night. Somewhere in my system, a pilot light flared.She was three years older than me and told me from the outset that, in the near future, she was planning on trying to get pregnant. Logistically, this made sense it would be madness to forestall while we flapped about for another two years trying to decide what we were doing. Emotionally, however, it stumped me. According to every relationship model I knew, you could either be with someone who’d had kids before you met, have kids together and separate down the line, or split up and have a baby alone. There was no such thing as being with someone who had a baby on her own. It sounded like a terrible deal: all the stress and anxiety without the substance of motherhood.At that stage, the strongest terms in which I could have put my own long-held but dormant desire for a baby were that I didn’t want not to have one. If there was, behind this impulse, a larger, less tangible longing, I didn’t want to look into it too deeply lest it unleash a full-blown baby hunger I couldn’t get back in the box. But I started to notice small, unsettling changes in myself. When somebody asked me, “Do you have children?” – a question that, until recently, I had responded to in my head with versions of, “Are you mental? I’m about 11” – it started to sound less neutral, more unfriendly. I had always believed that, medical issues aside, most women without children had acted through choice, but my faith in this weakened. I watched as a number of friends missed out on having children because their boyfriends broke up with them when they were in the vicinity of 40, before having children with younger women. I watched as women six, seven years my senior finally met someone new and went through round after punishing round of IVF. I didn’t want to be alone at 45, or 50, and on Tinder, dating people with children when I had none of my own. I didn’t want to be 70, the age my mother was when she died, lying on my deathbed without the image of my child’s face in my head. Above all, I didn’t want to look back on this period and wish I’d had the courage to act.I also didn’t want to “help” another woman raise her baby. Unless I was Mother Teresa (I’m not), the only way it would make sense for me to stick around in the event of L having a child was if our relationship became a more conventional union, or if I had my own baby independently, too.It’s not that L’s pregnancy made me more broody (I defy any woman to see another woman’s early pregnancy up close and think, “Hey, that looks fun!”) and I wasn’t bound by her decisions. We didn’t live together. In fact, an infantile strand of my personality deliberately wanted to make different decisions. If we were going to suffer the deprivations of single parenthood, we might as well realise all the advantages, too – in my case, starting from scratch and doing precisely what suited me and my notional baby.All I had to do was figure out what that was. Would I use a friend as a sperm donor, or a stranger? If the former, who? If the latter, how would I make that choice? Would I move back to London for free treatment on the NHS (which, to the horror of the rightwing press, now offers fertility services to single women and lesbians) or stay in America and spend thousands on something that might not even work? In the event, I choose the path of least resistance: America will never really feel like home, but it is where I live, where L has her baby and where, eight months later, I am sufficiently panicked to finally get moving with my own.One of the things you have to get used to when you are a British person embarking on fertility treatment in the US is the pace. In Britain, the law of supply and demand is such that there are more women wanting sperm than there are donors, so even private clinics have waiting lists. In America, where no one with adequate resources waits for anything, you have a chat with your doctor, schedule a date, call the donor bank, which bikes the sperm round to the clinic, and off you go. You might have spent six months or six years deciding to do this but you could, potentially, be pregnant within a month of first seeing your doctor.That is, if you have made what feels at the time like the hardest decision: how to pick a donor. This question probably cost me six months of concentrated flapping, during which time I asked a male friend if he’d do it, because it seemed more “normal” than the alternatives, and was achingly relieved when he said no, before eventually deciding to find an anonymous donor.This is a tricky part of the story for me. There may come a day when it is as regular as milk to share details of one’s sperm donor – when there is a language less alienating to describe it than this, and that feels less compromising of one’s child’s privacy. But we are not there yet, and I’ve no idea how to calibrate this choice. Is it the biggest of my life, or essentially meaningless? Underplay the donor and you risk turning the guy into the elephant in the room go on about him too much and you risk pathologising your child’s background. Scrolling through profiles, I look for characteristics that align with my own. I want someone clever, which here means educated. I want someone with dark hair. I want someone whose favourite film isn’t Once Upon A Time In America or Titanic. In the absence of a metric for gauging a man’s humour or internal beauty or moral worth, I want someone tall and basically symmetrical. A choice is superficial only if it is made at the expense of deeper considerations and so, although I reject sperm donors on criteria that would outrage me if applied in real life by men to women, I tell myself I’m not doing anything wrong.Everything is extra: $35 for the guy’s baby photos $50 for an audio file. Guidelines vary, but in New York you can see photos of him only as a child. Some donor banks offer a “silhouette” of him as an adult, which would be hilarious if it weren’t so creepy. What next – his breath in a jar to rule out halitosis? I don’t listen to the audio files. I don’t try to find the guy, even though there is so much information, it would probably take me less than a day. This is not gene selection it is the selection of the story of how my child came to be, and, through a combination of vital statistics, familiarity of background, a subtle implication that he is a Democrat and his use of the word “tremendous”, which signals to me a certain wryness and enthusiasm, I make my choice. In other words, on nothing substantive. What matters is it’s my choice and I make it.I pay extra for ID disclosure, enabling any child to trace the donor when they turn 18. I decide how much to buy – enough for three cycles – then fill in a form and return it, along with payment for almost $2,000. When I call to confirm my request, I half expect the receptionist to laugh and ask what on earth am I doing, trying to buy genetic material over the phone as if it were lunch? Instead, after I mumble, “Need to order some sperm”, she puts me through to the lab, where a technician will check to see if what I want is available.I give him the donor number. There is a clacking of keys, followed by a short pause. Then, with the smoothness of a sommelier fielding a wine order at dinner, he says, “An excellent choice.”After weeks of monitoring, at the end of 2013, my eggs are ready. This is it, says Dr B. I can come in tomorrow and, after waiting an hour for the sperm to defrost, finally get this show on the road. He asks if I’d like L to be present when the insemination takes place. “Some people find it nice to involve their partners.”Fertility treatment can be hard and excluding, he says, and involving the patient’s partner, even to the extent of inviting him or her to operate the syringe full of sperm, can give them a feeling of inclusion. I blush. Clearly he’s in favour of L being present, either because it gives him a warm feeling or to neutralise some latent ambivalence he has about helping to create single mothers.I try to imagine the scene: me, stressed out and half-naked on a gurney L, holding the catheter and rolling her eyes the medical staff, trying not to intrude on our beautiful moment. I don’t think I want L there – I don’t want anyone there, it’s embarrassing – and when I imagine asking her, I realise I don’t want to give her an opportunity to say no, either.There is a cold, mean streak in me that makes me think trying to involve the partner is ludicrous under any circumstances. Surely there’s a dignity in allowing things to be what they are? This is a medical procedure pretending otherwise risks making the treatment seem sadder, just as choosing a sperm donor will continue to feel sad, or bad, or weird, as long as it’s tied to conventions associated with choosing a spouse.The next day, a week before Christmas, Dr B breezes in full of good cheer. We chit-chat as he loads the syringe with a substance that is, gram for gram, more expensive than the world’s finest heroin (though less expensive than marrying someone you’re not into in order to have a baby).The cycle fails, as do the subsequent three cycles, one of which results in a short-lived pregnancy and all of which mean that, by the spring of 2014, I am taking, for the second month in a row and despite producing too many eggs the first time, large amounts of fertility hormones.It is different this time.“How do you feel?” says Dr B.For five days I have been injecting myself with a preloaded pen, which has bruised me terribly. The skin of my abdomen looks like 1970s wallpaper, all bright purple flowers with a greeny blue border. I feel altered, hideously bad-tempered. I tell myself it’s chemical and will pass. But it doesn’t. A week after finishing the injections, Dr B looks at my charts and tells me to stop taking the drugs. Ten days later I go in for insemination number five.“Whoa,” says the nurse doing the ultrasound. “You’ve a lot going on in there.”I look at the screen: a lot of shapeless dark patches connected by strings.“They look like spider’s eggs,” I say, and shudder.I have, once again, overreacted to the hormones. But Dr B says not to worry: not all of them are mature. I could call off the cycle but I say, “Go ahead.” The sun comes out that weekend, and L and I take a walk with the baby in the buggy. I feel Zen in the face of all possible outcomes. On Monday night I go into my kitchen and crack an egg against the side of a pan for dinner. Two bright yellow yolks slide down. I have never seen such a thing before and stare down at the eggs, feeling bad for the hen. I am so surprised I say it out loud: “Twins.”It’s twins. Of course it is. How could it not be? I am a walking exemplar of the phrase, “Be careful what you wish for.” Over the next few weeks I wait for the idea of carrying twins to normalise, but it doesn’t. For minutes at a time I forget I’m pregnant, then I remember with the force of the original shock. I have lunch with an old friend I haven’t seen for a while. I know he’ll be shocked, too, and he is.“How’s that going to work?” he says.And there it is, the question we’ve been avoiding since L’s pregnancy. If I have these babies, what will the babies be to L and what will she be to them? The answer is only partly to be found in the relationship I have with her baby. There is no honorific to describe what I am to him and there is no word for what he is to me. He is at the centre of us, the miracle over whom we both marvel, but I have no moral, financial or legal responsibility for him. Neither do I perform many of the most basic parental duties. I have always known this lopsided arrangement would be tolerable only until I had a baby of my own. What I hadn’t anticipated is the ways in which its limitations would also prove to be strengths. In the year since his birth, my relationship with the baby has evolved to be oddly free-floating from that with L. He is my buddy, a child in whom I have no stake other than love. That it’s a love I’m not bound – by law or biology – to feel makes it all the more precious.On the other hand, what am I doing potentially bringing two further children into a situation it takes so long to explain? I can just about rationalise to myself why a woman without a child might want to maintain a degree of separation from a partner with a child, given the vast difference in lifestyle. But two women in separate households with babies of a similar age who hang out on evenings and weekends? If we’re not a blended family, then what on earth are we? Clearly, at this point, the proper course of action would be to either give up this nonsense of separate households and separate children, and move in together, or else call it a day. There is no middle way. Perhaps it is selfish. It’s selfish to carry on along parallel tracks, denying the children a second parent and creating two single-parent families. It’s selfish, practically, morally, financially and environmentally, to maintain our independence while being together, like driving two cars to a single destination. And while my relationship with L’s baby is full of joy, how can it survive once I have my own children and am unable to travel back and forth to see him?For the first time I seriously question why I want to do this alone. It isn’t just that L and I have conflicting ideas about parenting – very broadly, I am too mean in her eyes, and she isn’t mean enough in mine – it’s the historical weight each of us puts on those differences and our assumptions about where they might lead us. We both have a highly developed sense of self-preservation, which expresses itself in different ways, except, perhaps, in this one shared belief: that the way one protects children from harm is by controlling who has access to them. The only thing more frightening to me than not having a baby is having a baby in a hostile environment. One afternoon L sends me an email with a link to an apartment listing that is almost double the rent I pay in Brooklyn. The floor plan looks familiar, as does the view from the window. It’s in her building, the mirror image of her home, but one floor down.“?!” I reply.“But do we want to live that close to each other? Isn’t it weird?”I go to see it. The landlord is putting in new flooring and a new bathroom and most of the apartment is under polythene, but because it’s an exact copy of L’s, bar the fixtures and fittings, I don’t have much trouble imagining it. It occurs to me, as I walk around, that he may not even want to rent to a single woman expecting two babies. But in any case, it’s too expensive. Eeven if it’s the kind of building I need, with a mail room and an elevator and a maintenance team on site even if it would be amazing to have L upstairs when I bring the babies home even if the very fact that the listing came up in the first place, in a co-op that discourages rentals, is the kind of coincidence that feels like a gift from above – none of that matters, because I can’t afford it.It is, surely, nuts: to sort of live together but not. It feels like cheating, to have L’s support and proximity without the hard work of cohabitation. How would we explain it to the children? Or to ourselves? That we like each other sufficiently to be in daily contact, except on days when we don’t? What would the kids even be to each other? Cousins? Best friends? The victims of a half-arsed piece of emotional evasion, or beneficiaries of a radical new vision?In those first weeks after moving, we enter a honeymoon period in which the loveliness of living almost together is nothing to the luxury of living sort of apart. The act of leaving my flat and walking up one flight imbues daily visits with the tiny frisson of occasion. When one of us snaps, the other goes home without it being construed as a histrionic gesture. There’s no marriage or joint mortgage, but a commitment has been made. I have the long-overdue realisation that relationships rely on a balance between independence and the right level of curtailment of freedom to liberate one from the burden of choice.One evening, L sits on the sofa with her son, reading a book about different kinds of families. “‘Some people have two mommies,’” she reads, pointing to an illustration of two badgers wearing earrings with a baby badger in their midst. “‘Some people have two daddies. Some people have one mummy, hasome people have one daddy.’” Her baby, who isn’t a baby any more but a toddler and the most delightful child in the world, isn’t quite old enough to formulate questions and we are off the hook for a little while yet. L and I exchange glances. “Some people have a neighbour,” she says, sotto voce.My final ultrasound of the year falls just after Christmas. I am six weeks from the due date. The technician looks at the screen. He frowns, says something I don’t catch and leaves the room. Someone else comes in. Everyone gathers by the monitor while I look at the ceiling and try to figure out what to have for lunch. A fourth doctor comes in and tells me to get dressed and follow him. I feel a spike of alarm. In his office, my high-risk obstetrician, Dr Y, is waiting.“They have to come out,” Dr Y says.“Oh my God.”The placenta for the smallest baby is working only intermittently if it stops altogether, she’ll die.“This is not an emergency,” Dr Y says calmly, “but it is… fairly urgent.” He tells me he has time the following day, New Year’s Eve, or the day after that.“Let’s do it tomorrow,” I say, trembling.My dad is in London and offers to come straight to New York, but I don’t want him in the air while I’m having surgery I can’t add fear of his plane going down to everything else. At L’s that night, I tell her to ask her mother to come across town the following day to watch her son.“I’m so happy you’ll be there,” I say.“It’s only because everyone else is in England.”“No, it isn’t. I would want you to be there, whatever.”As I say this, I realise it’s true. Fear pushes me inward, joy pushes me out, and while I am as frightened of having these babies as of anything, it’s a different kind of fear: not a shrinking but an opening out. I have been so stringent in ensuring I can do this alone, perhaps the reward is that I don’t always have to.Right up until the last moment, a small part of me thinks, what if all this is a mistake? What if Dr Y turns to me and says there’s nothing in there – of course you’re not pregnant! Did you think that, by signing a few forms and handing over your credit card, you could dodge millennia of evolution, not to mention convention and common decency? Go home, buy yourself a cat and never speak of this again.But at 4.17 pm the next day, a tiny, fierce cry fills the room. Baby A is removed from the basement of my body. I burst into tears. L grips my hand. A moment later, Baby B comes out and L leaps from her seat in the direction of the babies while Dr Y, turning to his students, holds a quick pop quiz over my guts. Then the nurses bring over the babies.L gets all of this illegally on camera. It’s not footage I can watch too often. The babies, two flat-faced Glo Worms covered in gel, are blotchy and impossibly alive. I am insane on the gurney, grinning drunkenly at my two girls. Over and over I say it, in the manner of a woman shortly to be given more drugs: “Oh my God, I can’t believe they’re both blond.”• This is an edited extract from An Excellent Choice by Emma Brockes, published by Faber \u0026amp Faber at £16.99.

Luckily, there are as many ways to cook courgettes as there are courgettes in Greece, and each has a different effect: maximise courgettes’ freshness by serving them raw, marinated, pickled or grilled or roast or slow-cook for a creamier result. This akopita-like filo pie, in which I swap the usual spinach for courgette, is a nod to happy summers in the Mediterranean sun.I’ve added cheddar to what is otherwise a straightforward Greek pie, because I find it ties everything together nicely, but feel free to use another cheese, if you prefer.1kg courgettes (about 6), trimmed and gratedSalt and black pepper20g dill, roughly chopped20g tarragon leaves, roughly chopped20g parsley leaves, roughly chopped4-6 spring onions, thinly sliced (60g)2 eggs, beaten150g feta, roughly crumbled80g mature cheddar, coarsely grated½ tsp chilli flakes2 tsp lemon zest, finely grated40ml olive oil175g filo pastry (ie, 7 39cm x 30cm sheets)½ tsp nigella seedsHeat the oven to 170C335Fgas 3. Mix the grated courgettes and two teaspoons of salt in a large bowl, then tip into a sieve and leave to drain for 30 minutes.Wrap the courgettes in batches in a clean tea towel and wring tightly, to extract as much liquid as possible – you should end up with about 520g courgette flesh. Transfer to a large bowl and add the herbs, onions, eggs, both cheeses, chilli, lemon zest, half a teaspoon of salt and a generous grind of black pepper.Line the base of a 23cm spring-form cake tin with greaseproof paper and lightly grease the sides with oil. Lay a sheet of filo over the base, allowing the excess to hang over the sides of the tin, and brush with oil. Top with another piece of filo, rotating it slightly so the excess hangs at a different angle, brush with oil, then repeat three more times, until you have used up five sheets in all. Put the courgette filling in the centre of the pie and even it out with a spoon. Brush another piece of filo with oil, fold it in half horizontally and lay it over the filling, tucking in any excess around the filling. Brush with oil, then repeat with the last sheet of filo, angling it to cover any exposed filling. Fold over the overhanging filo, crinkling it up to leave a crumpled top, brush with more oil and sprinkle with the nigella seeds.Transfer the tin to an oven tray and bake for 50 minutes. Take out of the oven, remove the outer ring of the tin, and bake for 15 minutes more, until golden and cooked through. Leave to cool for about 20 minutes before serving.This is a standalone vegetarian main course that I return to time and again. The semolina porridge is like runny polenta, only a little creamier. You can substitute it with rice or mashed potato, if you like.50g unsalted butter5 garlic cloves, peeled and thinly sliced1.2kg large courgettes (ie, about 6-7), trimmed, cut in half lengthways, then thinly sliced widthways Salt and black pepper200g frozen peas, defrosted25g basil leaves, roughly shredded15g tarragon leavesFinely grated zest of 1 lemon50g pine nuts, lightly toasted1 tbsp olive oil, to serveFor the semolina porridge600g whole milk180g semolina100g pecorino, finely shavedPut the butter in a large saute pan for which you have a lid, and put it on a medium-high heat. Once the butter has melted, add the garlic and fry for a minute or two, until it starts to brown.Add the courgettes, three-quarters of a teaspoon of salt and a good grind of pepper, and cook for five minutes, stirring often, until the courgettes start to soften. Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover and leave to cook for five minutes. Stir in the peas and warm through for a minute, until the peas are cooked, then take off the heat, stir in the herbs and lemon zest, and set aside while you make the porridge.Put the milk and 600ml water in a medium saucepan, and add three-quarters of a teaspoon of salt and a generous grind of pepper. Bring to a boil on a medium-high heat, then add the semolina and whisk continuously for three to four minutes, until smooth and thick, like porridge. Turn off the heat and stir in 80g of the pecorino.Divide the porridge between shallow bowls and top with the courgettes and peas. Finish with the pine nuts, a sprinkling of the remaining pecorino and a drizzle of oil.This needs to be dished up the moment its made, before the courgettes start ‘weeping’ and losing their freshness, so don’t let it sit around for too long. It goes well with meat from the grill or alongside a bunch of meze.3 tbsp olive oil10g thyme sprigs1 lemon – peel finely shaved into 6 strips (avoid the bitter white pith), then juiced, to get 2 tbsp1 garlic clove, smashed with the flat side of a knife600g courgettes (a mix of green and yellow looks great, if you can find both), trimmed and shaved into long, thin ribbons with a potato peeler or mandoline60g walnut halves, roughly choppedSalt and black pepper15g basil, roughly shreddedPut the oil, thyme, lemon peel and garlic in a small saucepan on a low heat and leave to infuse for eight minutes, until the oil becomes aromatic and the garlic, lemon and thyme start to colour.

Pick the leaves off the sprigs and add to the oil discard the sprigs, lemon and garlic.Put the courgettes, walnuts, lemon juice, a third of a teaspoon of salt and plenty of pepper into the oil, then massage the courgettes for a minute or so – they will break up a little – then stir in the basil and serve at once."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15ef6fe4450a7e99b3a72f4e7ea3552214cf10b3/0_153_2799_1679/master/2799.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c5c23e9345f63d34c0f2c02fb7b9c098","title":"from medical discharge to the london marathon one military couples story of resilience","story":"When Mike Kiff was discharged from the army, chronic pain and depression threatened to end his marriage, but with support from The Royal British Legion he and his wife have rebuilt their life togetherIn 2005, Cpl Mike Kiff fell from a roof and dislocated his shoulder badly while on active duty. The injury required surgery but seemed unlikely to curtail a career in the armed forces.Although it was never quite right after the incident, he continued in his role. Then, one day in 2014, while serving in Kabul, Afghanistan, he reached for his rifle and felt a blinding pain in the same shoulder. The pins that were holding it together had been ripped out, tearing tendons and fracturing the bone.“In my mind I knew it was all over then, the pain was so severe I couldn’t breathe,” he recalls of the incident. “Things went downhill from there.”He attempted to continue his job, but after a few weeks Kiff’s senior officer made it clear he was in no position to function effectively in what was a war zone. He was flown back to his base in Germany where he found his problems shelved as the rest of the regiment began a move back to the UK. The injury also meant that a pending promotion was off the table because he was now considered unfit for duty. Serious injury often signals the end of a career in the armed forces but making the transition back to civilian life can be a very difficult process for both the service person affected and their family.With little external support and constant chronic pain he began to sink into severe depression, which soon had an impact on his relationship.“I knew Mike was struggling badly from the calls we had when he was in Afghanistan, but when he returned to base it began to fall apart almost from the moment he walked through the door. He was no longer the same man who had gone away,” says wife Linda. The couple had met while Mike was on leave in Bournemouth, married in 2006 and have two children.As the barracks emptied out around them, their problems were low priority. However, Mike had some good fortune when a medical officer recommended a break at Brydon House, a recently opened personnel recovery centre that had received major funding from The Royal British Legion.“I had physiotherapy, received specialist counselling and found people who were prepared to listen to my problems. It was a completely different level of support, a hundred times better,” he says.After a lengthy recovery process, Mike was medically discharged and the family returned to Bournemouth from Germany. Unfortunately, their problems worsened. They found themselves homeless and were forced to move in with Linda’s parents. Meanwhile, Mike was jobless, in severe pain and on antidepressants. Linda took a job working nights. Their relationship deteriorated rapidly.“I had no one to turn to,” says Linda. “I’m Mike’s support system, of course, so I took the brunt of it. He was jobless for a year and I was working full time. Our roles changed completely, which only added to the stress. It wasn’t a healthy situation but I discovered I could also get support from the Legion. Until then I thought they were just fundraisers.“They advised me to adapt my thought process towards him. I talked to them on a number of occasions and they were always a huge help. We had hit a wall in our marriage and their support was crucial to us getting through it.”“My issues had begun to affect our relationship and we were struggling,” agrees Mike. “The Legion were there to support us. We were both able to talk to people about what was going on. I was able to get anything from a sympathetic ear to practical financial guidance and help finding a job. Linda got advice about how to manage me because I was depressed and angry.”Slowly, with support from the Legion, the couple have rebuilt their lives. Mike now works as a civilian instructor teaching fibre optics to military personnel and Linda has a job in retail. Mike is still on medication and has good days and bad, but knows he can always pick up the phone and talk to someone.In 2017 the couple ran the London Marathon to raise funds for the organisation. “It was a way of saying thank you and having a common goal also helped reconnect us,” says Mike. “I think it’s safe to say we’d probably be orced without them and if that had happened I don’t know what would have happened to me. It would have been the final straw.”To find out more about The Royal British Legion click here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cabcc8d37a79b853e89f5857d27a29c9a678333c/0_200_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=07d1af13bfd4fd36439111876db5a0cc","title":"netflix chief of communications leaving after reports of using n word","story":"Reed Hastings vows to ‘set a better example’ in memo regretting PR chief’s racial slurThe head of Netflix has told his staff he needs to “set a better example” after sacking the company’s head of communications for twice using the N-word during work meetings.Reed Hastings, the video streaming company’s founder, told staff in a memo he had decided to “let go” of Jonathan Friedland for using the racial slur in a “descriptive” sense. Friedland, a former journalist who joined Netflix in 2011, first used the word several months ago during a discussion about offensive words in comedy, and again a few days later during a conversation with two black colleagues. Hastings, who became a billionaire after starting Netflix as a mail-order DVD rental company in 1997, said in the lengthy memo, published by the Hollywood Reporter, that he heard about the second incident last week.Friedland tweeted an apology: “Leaders have to be beyond reproach in the example we set and unfortunately I fell short of that standard when I was insensitive in speaking to my team about words that offend in comedy. I feel awful about the distress this lapse caused to people at a company I love and where I want everyone to feel included and appreciated.”Friedland spent 20 years as a foreign correspondent before joining the Walt Disney Company. During his seven years at Netflix, it has become a dominant force online, valued at £106bn, with 125 million subscribers worldwide.The memo from Hastings said Friedland had “contributed greatly in many areas”, but showed “unacceptably low racial awareness and sensitivity”.“Several people afterwards told him how inappropriate and hurtful his use of the N-word was, and Jonathan apologised to those that had been in the meeting. We hoped this was an awful anomaly never to be repeated.”Of the second incident, Hastings wrote: “Jonathan said the N-word again to two of our black employees in HR who were trying to help him deal with the original offence. The second incident confirmed a deep lack of understanding, and convinced me to let Jonathan go now.”Hastings said global debate and the word’s use in film and music had created some confusion about whether using it could ever be acceptable. “For non-black people, the word should not be spoken as there is almost no context in which it is appropriate or constructive (even when singing a song or reading a script),” Hastings wrote.“There is not a way to neutralise the emotion and history behind the word in any context. The use of the phrase ‘N-word’ was created as a euphemism, and the norm, with the intention of providing an acceptable replacement and moving people away from using the specific word. When a person violates this norm, it creates resentment, intense frustration, and great offence for many.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b31ed89e9466c053ae312839e1d04acf3cab91a/0_73_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2212f62687ac9cfc72591fd945514410","title":"david byrne american utopia tour hammersmith apollo review","story":"One strand of western thought still assumes that the mind and the body are distinct. To generalise, dance music is for bodies while art rock, say, titillates the mind.David Byrne begins each night on the highly unorthodox tour for his most recent album, American Utopia, seated at a table stroking a brain – like a memento mori, only pinker. It is the only splash of colour on a grey, bare stage, encircled by shimmering beaded curtains. So far, so cerebral: the song is Here, from the new album, and its lyrics describe sections of the cerebellum.Byrne was, of course, once the frontman of a band called Talking Heads (and not, say, Grinding Hips), whose anxious, querying post-punk appealed to lateral thinkers. In the magnificent 2017 film, 20th Century Women, set in 1979, the band are referred to as “art fags”. Another film – the 1984 documentary, Stop Making Sense, about Talking Heads’ concept-heavy Speaking in Tongues tour – set an artistic benchmark so high few other films about music have ever come close.This tour is an artistic endeavour not far off Stop Making Sense’s high-water mark. Byrne’s youthful air of surprise has given way in recent years to a more professorial demeanour, to which he has recently added a foppish Andy Warhol haircut.But one of the secrets of Byrne’s early success, mid-period extemporisations and absolute continued relevance is his devotion to rhythm. Byrne explained his choice of Stop Making Sense’s outsized suit to an interviewer at the time as a device to make his head appear smaller. “Because music is very physical, and often the body understands it before the head.”This unprecedented, exquisite live show finds a 12-strong band in near-constant motion, with percussion to the fore: at several points, half a dozen musicians are playing bits of drum kits hanging off harnesses they are wearing, a cross between an American high school marching band and a Brazilian carnival procession. (The harnesses are so discreet, the keyboard player’s instrument appears to hover in mid-air.) Everyone is in (normal-sized) grey Kenzo suits and barefoot by the end, backing vocalist Chris Giarmo’s jacket is entirely black at the back, and Byrne’s own back is piebald with sweat. There are moments where Byrne gnomically ruches up his trouser leg to reveal an ankle, or rolls up his jacket sleeve to reveal an inner elbow. At the end of a lot of songs, he hoicks up his trousers – since the tour began, you can imagine Byrne has shed the odd pound.Pop is no stranger to troupe dancing, but working musicians don’t normally move this perfectly, rearranging themselves like psychic starlings into clumps or lines, posing, vogue-ing, proceeding backwards in circles choreographer Annie-B Parson is the architect of these manoeuvres. You can see the link to a previous Byrne outing – 2015’s US-only Contemporary Colour shows, since released as a film – which found Byrne reinterpreting the US sports pastime known as “colour guard”, where flag-spinners join marching bands for half-time performances.This set, by contrast, is all grey and minimal and yet somehow just as kaleidoscopic. A huge swath of songs – Talking Heads songs, Byrne solo outings drawn from various periods, covers, collaborations – have all been subtly rescored to fit a show heavy on funk, fun, drama, shadowplay and a sprinkling of overt politics. Between two recent songs – Dog’s Mind and Everybody’s Coming to My House – Byrne encourages everyone to vote “in every election they possibly can”. The second encore finds the band covering Janelle Monáe’s 2015 anthem Hell You Talmbout, which lists the names of young African Americans killed by law enforcement or other violent confrontations.The old Talking Heads favourites are pure pleasure, ning moods as erse as I Zimbra, This Must Be the Place (Naive Melody) and a frankly magnificent version of Once in a Lifetime, which Byrne announces by staggering around, spotlit, quoting his own former movements.Although released through Todo Mundo and Nonesuch, Byrne’s US labels, American Utopia was an album shaped in association with creatives at London XL Recordings subsidiary Young Turks, in which a phalanx of obscure electronic producers were drafted in to create novel soundscapes. I Dance Like This was probably the most jarring of these, with a chorus veering towards the industrial.Live, it becomes one of the night’s unexpected highlights, more heavy metal than machine music. “I dance like this,” it goes, “because it feels so damn goodIf I could dance better, well you know that I would.” Byrne and his troupe of musicians dance magnificently. You could say the also pretty much resolve the whole Cartesian mindbody split in the process."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/22cbdbbdba5966d307d89265a4f499bd1b6a7947/0_25_3589_2154/master/3589.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7a99dbb23462eb685b3f653a2c766dc3","title":"brexit demonstrators london we were lied to","story":"Veteran demonstrators, children and even Thatcherites on march that crossed the political idesThirty-five years ago, David Anderson marched with his father in protest against Britain joining the common market. Yesterday, he travelled down from Rugby to stand beside his daughter and call for Britain to stay inside the European Union.“I’ve gone full circle,” he said. “I think it’s so important for this generation, and the one after them. The referendum was a massive decision and people were ill-informed. They were lied to.”Anderson, 53, and his daughter were far from alone. An estimated 100,000 people from all corners of the country thronged the streets of central London – from parents with babies a few weeks old to protesters in their 80s, from demo veterans to people on their first protest – to give a powerful show of European solidarity.Officially they marched to demand a people’s vote, a second referendum on whatever terms the government agrees for leaving the EU. But for many, the march was simply a chance to show their anger and frustration, not just at the Brexit vote two years ago, but the political confusion that has followed.“The north-east is one of the areas that stands to lose the most. But it’s not just us who will be harmed, it’s the whole country,” said Bob Heyman, who had travelled down from Newcastle with his wife, Ruth, to join the protest. “Neither of us are politically active, but this has just got us going. We really feel it’s the country’s future at stake.”The crowd bridged deep political ides, with Conservatives marching beside Labour and Liberal Democrat supporters. Their chants – “Where’s Jeremy Corbyn?” bellowed repeatedly around Parliament Square – would not have made comfortable hearing for any of the main political parties.Nicolas Maclean, a former adviser to Margaret Thatcher, marched with a group of about a dozen men and women brandishing “Tories against Brexit” placards. “She would be turning in her grave,” he said. “She said one of her greatest achievements in Europe was Britain taking the lead in setting up the single market and now some people in government want us to leave. It is an absolute disaster.”Richard Stanely, a foster carer from Gloucester, said he worried about more cuts to services for young people, already pared to the bone after years of austerity policies. “Brexit is only going to make things worse.”The march threaded through central London, and culminated in a rally at Parliament Square, with speeches from politicians including Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrats’ leader, who said: “We go on this march with a simple message: Brexit is not inevitable.”The Green party co-leader Caroline Lucas said the march was a defence of the rights of Europeans in Britain, and Britons in Europe. “We are here to defend your rights and to defend free movement. Friends, what a wonderful gift it is, what a precious gift it is to be able to travel and to work and to study and to live and to love in 27 other countries. We should be celebrating freedom of movement not apologising for it,” she said.Many of those who turned out said that freedom of movement defined their lives. Hazel Bergiel, who is British, had come from her home in Chevreuse in the Île-de-France region near Paris to take part.“I’ve lived in France for the last 35 years and I wouldn’t have voted to leave but I was denied a vote,” she said. “I’m very much anti-Brexit, but I’m still very much British. I only have one passport even though I live there and this is why I’m here, really – to support the movement.”The march was a sea of flags – the EU’s circle of stars waved beside or superimposed on the Scottish saltire, and other countries of the union, or held up proudly beside a union jack.“I hope the Brexit decision could be overturned, although I’m not really sure it’s possible,” said Maxine Roessler, a German at the march with her husband Chiufan Lee, five-year-old son and newborn daughter. Their faces were painted with the flags of the EU, her native Germany and their adopted home in Britain, where the family has lived for over a decade and plans to stay despite Brexit.“I’ve applied for British citizenship,” said Roessler. “It was not a decision I took lightly, because to some extent, after the vote, I felt not wanted.”Police on foot, in riot vans in the back streets and in helicopters were on standby in case of a clash between the People’s Vote march and a march starting less than two miles away at Victoria station, which had a heavy presence of far-right activists. A much smaller crowd, a few thousand strong at its peak, turned out for that protest, with Ukip flags flying next to posters for far-right groups including the White Pendragons.Many of those marching seemed inspired by the movement behind Donald Trump in America, wearing “Make Britain Great Again” hats that echo his slogan, and one woman even wearing a rhinestone badge spelling out Trump. Pro-Brexit slogans mixed with chants of “Free Tommy Robinson”, the far-right activist whose support group had galvanised many of the day’s marchers.“The government is trying to swindle us out of our Brexit,” said Ashley Jarrett, a hydraulic engineer who said he had come with a group of other Robinson supporters.“It’s not going to be OK. I tell you what is the worst thing, it’s the legacy we are going to leave the young people.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/376d65401e3004dd8b9252abbcf426ca6678ab66/19_220_4202_2520/master/4202.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e99047c3e4866519a000adae40f7908d","title":"scottish independence supporters march bannockburn","story":"About 8,000 people head to site where Robert the Bruce triumphed over English armyThousands of Scottish independence supporters have marched from Stirling to Bannockburn.

People didn’t understand what the referendum would mean. And now, two years down the line, it’s still not clear what we were voting for.“They were sold this lie about the NHS,” said Ankle, referring to the widely discredited leavers’ claim that it would make £350m a week available for the health service. At the march with a friend who had travelled from Scotland, she also said she was concerned that the Brexit campaign had played to prejudices. “When I was listening to the campaign, it just seemed a very racially motivated campaign, and I didn’t like it.”“I’m 86 and I remember why we went into Europe: people wanted to prevent another war. During the campaign, no one pointed out the advantages of the European Union. Wherever I go, I travel all over the world, people ask me, ‘why did you vote for Brexit? What are you doing?’ I call it the biggest self-inflicted harm in British history.”“I feel absolutely devastated by Brexit, and I wanted to stand up and be counted. The signs didn’t take very long – they took about a week,” said Isabel, who didn’t want to give her full name.“I remember, before we were in the Common Market, you were lucky if you had one peach a week, because that was all you could afford, because they were imported from Italy and you had to pay the Common Market tariffs. It was the same with all vegetables.“It’s also the idea of Europe: I studied languages, I have friends in Germany and other places in Europe.”The 44-year-old software engineer dragged his two children away from their school’s summer fair to attend, the first time any of them had been to a protest.“Dad said you shouldn’t go to the fair, there are more important things,” said Magnus. His sister, Isla, said her dad’s arguments had convinced her, even though she regretted missing the fair. “I was worried that not enough people would come,” she said. Ben Moseley said: “We have big problems in this country, and we can’t ignore the fact that many people are very unhappy. But Brexit will only make things worse. Separating from the EU is a huge distraction from what’s really important in this country.”“This march is about having a people’s vote. It’s not about whether you voted leave or remain, it started with a referendum and it can only fairly finish with a people’s vote when we know what the options are. A yes or no vote didn’t go into the minutiae, and now that we are into that, what was promised is not appearing. We were sold a lie.Several of my friends voted for Brexit, and I don’t know two of them who voted for the same reason. So saying ‘the people have spoken’ is a slightly misleading statement.“Its not easy explaining to him what the European Union is, but I think he’s got some of the idea now.” Felix’s mother is German and Lee is Canadian, they met in the UK and made it their home. “As a Commonwealth citizen, I could vote in the referendum, but my wife as a European couldn’t.”“The funding for support for young people has been horrific since the Tories came to power, and Brexit is only going to make things worse.”“Really we’d like Brexit to stop, because I think it’s a disastrous, suicidal idea ... I profited from the EU by living and working in Germany, and didn’t think at the time that I needed German citizenship I now very much regret that I didn’t apply for it.“We were lied to when we voted in the Scottish independence referendum. We were told that if we voted for independence, we’d be straight out of the EU, and the only way to guarantee staying in the EU was to stay in the union. And a number of people foolishly believed that, and I think a lot of those people are very cross now.”“Its a pile of bollocks, really. I thought of a whole load of things to say (on my banner), but that sums it up.“I’m not really political,” she said. “I feel deeply ashamed and horrified about what’s happening, and I don’t feel Brexit is representative of what we are as a country.”“I think, really, we are a genuinely good-hearted, multicultural, generous people, and I think we are showing ourselves up.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ccf2550dfb7029d7eb1cf0f351697433de9f85b7/422_60_1381_829/master/1381.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4610d163adaa12701f6ff69e54cb4f1e","title":"england australia fifth odi preview","story":"Never before have England inflicted a 5-0 whitewash on Australia in any format. But with the weather in Manchester set fair, the pitch looking flat and the opposition flatter, they could well be reaching for the paintbrushes on Sunday.Indeed, such has been the one‑way nature of this series that Ashton Agar, among Tim Paine’s beleaguered tourists, was positively drooling with envy when asked for his take on the cricket being played right now by Eoin Morgan’s No 1-ranked side.“It’s just their confidence, their self-belief ... they ooze it out there,” he said. “They are playing like a team where everyone knows their role. They back themselves and each other to go out and do it. They have set the benchmark, no doubt.”Agar’s analysis is hard to take issue with – and refreshing to hear from an Australian spinner given Nathan Lyon’s public pronouncements before last winter’s Ashes – with it difficult to escape the notion that unless the home side’s performance at Old Trafford dips like the sell-out crowd is expected to when England versus Panama is broadcast, 5-0 looks on.England’s batting is firing in such a way that 263 runs are needed to break their own world record of 1,617 in a five-match series. It is allowing some experimentation in the bowling too, with Sam Curran potentially making his debut – Mark Wood missed voluntary training – and Liam Plunkett a chance to return for Craig Overton.It is worth remembering, however, that this side were in the same situation against Pakistan two years ago, one game away from the clean sweep. The visitors pinched a win in Cardiff (one they would repeat in the next summer’s Champions Trophy), leaving the Test side that beat India in 1959 and the 50-over one that toured Zimbabwe in 2001 as the only England men’s teams to win a series 5-0.Sure enough, Adil Rashid, the leading wicket-taker with 11 scalps and fresh from having passed Graeme Swann’s 104 career wickets to become England’s all-time leading 50-over spinner, offered a professional opinion on the prospects of such a feat, albeit after initially allowing himself to dream a touch.“It would mean quite a lot, whitewashing anybody, South Africa or India or whoever,” he said. “It would be credit to the team and coaches, all that hard work of the past couple of years. But we’re taking it a game at a time, it’s just another game.“We’re not talking about that right now, we’re just concentrating on the game. Once it’s done and if you have the whitewash, then you have things to talk about. But we’re not.”While the chat around the England team has more surrounded which players make way when Ben Stokes and Chris Woakes return – they are hoping to face India next month in what should be a serious increase in intensity – Australia’s plight has been couched by the suspensions of Steve Smith and David Warner and injuries to Mitchell Starc, Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood.Rashid does not think this quintet would have made a difference. “Them players were still playing in Australia Smith, Warner, Cummins, Hazelwood and whoever else. We won 4-1 there and here’s 4-0. So it’s very similar.”The two sides last met at Old Trafford in 2015 when England were still coming to terms with their collective 50-over epiphany and lost a series decider by eight wickets. Starc and Cummins steamed in that day, the latter forcing Morgan to retire with concussion, and Mitchell Marsh, whose absence is also felt now, claimed four victims.Five days earlier, on the same ground, Rashid and Moeen Ali spun England to a win by sharing five scalps after a fine James Taylor hundred. A similar hold is in place now – they have 19 Australian wickets between them at 20 runs apiece – such that as far as the tourists are concerned, they are not so much the Chuckle Brothers (as per Jos Buttler in the match-day programme) but more the Brothers Grimm.England remain in similar shape personnel-wise – the cruel retirement of Taylor notwithstanding – but, as Agar noted, their confidence has sky-rocketed.Australia’s survivors are Agar, Aaron Finch and Glenn Maxwell, although the latter looks set to miss out again with the shoulder injury suffered in Nottingham still restricting him.It is hard not to feel sorry for their captain. Paine’s task has been an unenviable combination of peace envoy and leader of a callow squad (the team that lost at Chester-le-Street was their least capped since 1986). Little wonder basic errors have slipped into his usually velvet wicketkeeping – see the drop off Alex Hales on Thursday – while the right-hander badly needs a score with the bat.Is Paine, 35 runs from four innings, to be rewarded for dutifully picking up the pieces after the ball-tampering scandal by earning the dubious title of the first Australian captain to be whitewashed 5-0 by England? He seems a champion bloke, as they say Down Under, but this game is a sod sometimes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b27c84e8de035843ed4c74a60af0ecbb9678ab0c/160_0_1856_1113/master/1856.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf0a2867c82ee41b47d09318236c7dbc","title":"england sophie ecclestone new zealand south africa t20 international women cricket","story":"England’s women bounced back with style to split the difference in their T20 double-header, clinically accounting for New Zealand by 54 runs after losing an error-riddled thriller to South Africa earlier in the day to all but secure their progress to the tournament final.Key to the victory was the left-arm finger-spinner Sophie Ecclestone, who ripped the heart out of the White Ferns’ chase of 173, claiming four for 18 in her best display yet as an international cricketer. She was given the nod as player of the match ahead of Nat Sciver, who top-scored with 59 from 37 balls – her best outing of the summer.The England captain, Heather Knight, said that it had been a test of her side’s character how they responded to the chaotic loss against the Proteas. Then, the hosts were unable to defend 160, dropping four catches along the way. Opener Tammy Beaumont propelled them to that middling score after batting first against the side they built a world record score against three days earlier, out in the penultimate over for 71 on the back of three centuries.That they still had nine runs to play with when the final over began flattered the home side but Sune Luus (63 not out) left no doubt about the final result for the resilient visitors by hitting three boundaries to confirm the win with three balls to space, sealed with a six. She finished the work of powerhitter Lizelle Lee, who launched the ball over the leg-side rope six times on the way to a 37-ball 68 that silenced the healthy Taunton crowd.Second time around, England were able to get rid of New Zealand’s equivalent, their powerful opener Sophie Devine holing out in the second over having already belted two sixes. More crucial again was Katherine Brunt’s beautiful bit of seam bowling to trap the talismanic Kiwi captain, Suzie Bates, lbw for 23. She was yet to get in the book herself but Ecclestone was crucial to that wicket having sent down a maiden the over before to build the pressure.The tall teenage twirler’s main weapon on the day was her quicker delivery from round the wicket that went through the gate and past the inside edge of right-handers on three occasions. She was also twice helped out by Sarah Taylor stumpings when she beat the outside half of the blade when players tried to take the attack to her. After play, the Lancastrian said she was still “bricking it” every time she walks out for England. That never showed on Saturday.After their record onslaught on Wednesday, England hit only one six in their 40 overs at the crease. It made Sciver’s 59 all the more impressive that she did not need to shift into overdrive to reach the required results. She entered at an almost identical time in the first rubber and threw it away after getting a start. Against New Zealand she took responsibility as the senior pro to insist a healthy total would come. Her placement through point, in particular, was a standout.Knight had a smile on her face after striking within two balls of bringing herself into the attack in a match against New Zealand that had plenty riding on it – as the first of a raft of fixtures the sides play against each other in the coming weeks. That it was from a sharp return catch to see the back of the dangerous Amy Satterthwaite, her teammate in the Women’s Big Bash League, must have added to her glee.England play New Zealand once more at Bristol on Wednesday in their final group game before the final next Sunday. With a vastly superior net run-rate to South Africa, it would take something outlandish for Knight’s side not to reach the decider.This trophy does not mean a lot in isolation, but in a World T20 year everything matters. And if Ecclestone can keep proving her match-winning credentials she will be one of the first on that plane to the Caribbean."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dcaf66cc970be08509670e02c237f2a6b0961b9b/90_271_3419_2051/master/3419.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7ce3c95edc7d85993ea4fdfe6e0bc715","title":"merchant navy wins dramatic diamon jubilee royal ascot horse racing","story":"• O’Brien runner holds off French challenger • Harry Angel left at start after stalls disasterA lot of drama can be packed into 72 seconds, as racegoers learned on Saturday while trying to absorb everything that happened in a wild Diamond Jubilee Stakes, won in a head‑bobbing finish by Merchant Navy.He would have been an unlucky loser having been shunted sideways by the third horse in the closing stages. But the runner-up, City Light, surely beat himself by rearing as the stalls opened while Harry Angel detonated any chance he had with his pre-race antics which reached a climax when he stuck a hind foot on a ledge along the side of the stalls shortly before they clanged open in front of him.Paddock watchers knew Harry Angel, the 5-2 favourite, was making things hard for himself from the trouble he gave as Adam Kirby was trying to mount him. He continued to play up in the stalls, kicking out with his hind legs, which was how he got his foot wedged awkwardly and sustained an injury, the extent of which will only become clear on Sunday.“Adam couldn’t see, because the horse had his stalls rug on,” Harry Angel’s trainer, Clive Cox, said. “The starter can’t see that, either.“It’s a dreadful shame. He got quite a bad puncture wound on his hind leg. It was very sore when he came off the track. So I just hope we can get him back as quickly as possible. With his leg being up on the side when the stalls opened, I’m worried that he might have pulled something high up, but we won’t know for an hour or two.”Harry Angel lost many lengths at the start, with Kirby looking round in the first few strides as if sensing something had gone wrong, but City Light made an even worse beginning to this race.As soon as the stalls opened he was up on his hind legs, giving everything else a start, though he reached top gear remarkably quickly after returning to earth and was within two lengths of the eventual winner after perhaps a furlong.“It didn’t look a race to begin with as there were horses everywhere,” said City Light’s trainer, Stephane Wattel. City Light gave the Deauville‑based Wattel his first British success after 27 years as a trainer when he won on all-weather finals day in March. Here, he came within inches of giving Wattel his first Group One race success anywhere.Instead, Merchant Navy did just enough to hold on after shrugging off the wayward US runner Bound For Nowhere, who leaned on him in the final furlong. The winner has only been trained for a matter of months by Aidan O’Brien, having been Australian-based until the spring. His former owners still have a stake in him and their celebrations were among the most raucous of the week here.His first trainer in Australia, Ciaron Maher, was present to see the colt make good on the promise he showed when based with him at Caulfield. While he is bound to reflect on what might have been if the horse stayed with him, Maher seemed genuinely elated.“They sold him for a fairly healthy sum. You can’t have your cake and eat it, but it’s just great to see the horse win. He’s come through our system. Now, to do it up here, he’s going to have a good time at stud. He’s going to be very busy in both hemispheres.“He’s got an unbelievable set of lungs and I think he’s still developing. He was a later foal. Look at the horse, he’d be better again next year.”Maher had hoped to have a runner at the Royal meeting last year until his Jameka fell ill. He promised to come back one day with a contender of his own. “It’s an unbelievable atmosphere and racecourse. It doesn’t get any bigger than this.”O’Brien’s aim now is to persuade Merchant Navy’s owners to let the horse stay with him at his Ballydoyle yard for long enough to run in next month’s July Cup at Newmarket. “The plan was that he’d run here and then go back to Australia, as I think there’s a lot of mares waiting on him there,” the Irishman said.He had thought the colt faced an “impossible” task at the weights with Redkirk Warrior, who beat him in Australia in March, but that rival was very disappointing and ran as though he had not coped well with his journey round the world.A jockey who did a sponsorship deal with a pub was stood down from competing at Royal Ascot. Charles Bishop, who started this week on such a high by winning the Queen Anne on the 33-1 shot Accidental Agent, was reported by the stewards to be above the threshold level for breath samples and had to give up his four booked mounts.“He’s ashamed and disappointed,” said Eve Johnson Houghton, the trainer of Accidental Agent, who had booked him to ride her Ice Age in the Wokingham Handicap. “Let’s hope he only does it once. It’s disappointing for him. They tell me he was only just over the limit. If his first ride had been in the second race rather than the first, he might well have passed.”Bishop declined to comment when contacted by the Racing Post.The news is tinged with irony, in view of a sponsorship deal Bishop struck two years ago with the George \u0026amp Dragon pub at Upton, close to the West Ilsley stables of his main employer, Mick Channon. Bishop posed for pictures at the time with the pub name written down the side of his breeches, but the deal has presumably lapsed as he was wearing plain breeches for Accidental Agent’s success.Meanwhile, a spokesman for Ascot said he had been pleased by how few incidents of bad behaviour there had been when the total attendance was expected to exceed 300,000. “There’s been evictions for the use of drugs,” Nick Smith said. “We’re perfectly up front about that. It’s minimal in the context of the crowd but it’s an important message that, yes, people have been evicted.”Smith said advance warning of the use of sniffer dogs had got a point across to racegoers about bringing drugs to the races. “Racing has acted very responsibly, hasn’t hidden from the issue. It’s not racing’s issue in isolation but we have to address it. Like Epsom for Derby day, we’ve got right on the front foot and, as we speak at the present moment, with good results.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8baa0fdaee0a5ba03810f0531973d3150ea4e00f/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=50e32583f68186b8ae5cfdd7978ceca6","title":"the gps app that can find anyone anywhere","story":"In common with perhaps 15 million South Africans, Eunice Sewaphe does not have a street address. Her two-room house is in a village called Relela, in a verdant, hilly region of the Limpopo province, five hours’ drive north-east of Johannesburg. If you visited Relela, you might be struck by several things the village lacks – modern sanitation, decent roads, reliable electricity – before you were struck by a lack of street names or house numbers. But living essentially off-map has considerable consequence for people like Eunice. It makes it tough to get a bank account, hard to register to vote, difficult to apply for a job or even receive a letter. For the moment, though, those ongoing concerns are eclipsed by another, larger anxiety. Eunice Sewaphe is nine months pregnant – her first child is due in two days’ time – and she is not quite sure, without an address, how she will get to hospital.Sitting in the sun with Eunice and her neighbours outside her house, in a yard in which chickens peck in the red dirt, she explained to me, somewhat hesitantly, her current plan for the imminent arrival. The nearest hospital, Van Velden, in the town of Tzaneen, is 40 minutes away by car. When Eunice goes into labour, she will have to somehow get to the main road a couple of miles away in order to find a taxi, for which she and her husband have been saving up a few rand a week. If there are complications, or if the baby arrives at night, she may need an ambulance. But since no ambulance could find her house without an address, this will again necessitate her getting out to the main road. In the past, women from Relela, in prolonged labour, have had to be taken in wheelbarrows to wait for emergency transport that may or may not come.The maternal mortality rates in South Africa remain stubbornly high. Of 1.1 million births a year, 34,000 babies die. More than 1,500 women lose their lives each year in childbirth. Those statistics are a fact of life in Relela. Josephina Mohatli is one of Eunice’s neighbours. She explains quietly how she went into labour with her first child prematurely. When she finally managed to get a taxi, she was taken to two local clinics and then a private doctor, none of which were able to help her. When she finally reached the hospital after several desperate hours, her baby had died.I have come up to Relela with Dr Coenie Louw, who is the regional head of the charity Gateway Health, which is concerned with improving those mortality statistics. Dr Louw, 51, speaks with a gruff Afrikaans accent that belies his evangelist’s optimism to make a change for these women. “Though frankly,” he says, “if I don’t know where you are, I can’t help you.”Google Maps will only bring help to the edge of the village. “We tried to do something by triangulating between three cell phone towers,” he says, which proved predictably unreliable. Searching for other solutions, Louw came across what3words, the innovative British technology that, among many other things, neatly solves the question of how an ambulance might find Eunice Sewaphe.Five years ago, the founders of what3words ided the entire surface of the planet into a grid of squares, each one measuring 3 metres by 3 metres. There are 57tn of these squares, and each one of them has been assigned a unique three-word address. My own front door in London has the three-word address “.brave.tree”.The front door of Eunice’s house in Relela might be “irrigates.joyful.zipper” (or, in Zulu, “phephani.khuluma.bubhaka”). To test the system, I have driven up here with one of Gateway Health’s drivers, Mandla Maluleke. Maluleke has keyed the three-word code into his phone app, which has dropped a pin on a conventional mapping system. Once we leave the main highway, the GPS immediately signals “unknown road”, but even so, after many twists and turns it takes us precisely to “irrigates.joyful.zipper”, and Eunice’s front door.The what3words technology was the idea of Chris Sheldrick, a native of rural Hertfordshire (who knows what it is like to stand out in a country lane flagging down delivery drivers armed only with a postcode). Like all the best ideas he developed this one to cope with a specific problem that had maddened him. Sheldrick, 35, had started life as a musician, and then after a sleepwalking accident, which damaged his wrist, he set up a business organising musicians and production for festivals and parties around the world. Despite the advent of Google Maps, the problem that dogged his business was bands turning up at the wrong site entrance. Sheldrick employed a person whose sole duty was to man a phone line trying to get a band to the right field. Having given up on conventional satnav they tried using GPS co-ordinates, but get one figure wrong, and the party never got started.Sheldrick thought that there had to be a better way. Looking back now, he says that “the key thing we were trying to solve with what3words was how do we get 15 digits of latitude and longitude into a more communicable human form”. Advances in satellite mapping and navigation meant that if you were a Deliveroo rider or an Amazon courier or a last-minute saxophonist you were never really lost, but also often not exactly in the right place. Companies like Google and TomTom recognised this problem, but the solution they developed was an alphanumeric code of nine characters. For Sheldrick that was clearly a nonstarter: “When someone asked where you lived, it would be like trying to remember your wifi router password.” That’s when this idea of three words came up. A bit of maths proved it was possible. “With 40,000 recognisable dictionary words, you have 64tn combinations, and there are 57tn squares.”The algorithm behind what3words took six months to write. Sheldrick worked on it with two friends he had grown up with. Mohan Ganesalingham, a maths fellow at Trinity College, Cambridge, and Jack Waley-Cohen, a full-time quiz obsessive and question-setter for Only Connect. After the initial mapping was complete, they incorporated an error-correction algorithm, which places similar-sounding combinations a very long way apart. And then there was the question of language: using a team of linguists, what3words is now available in a couple of dozen tongues, from Arabic to Zulu.It has also grown from a company of three to now around 70 full-time employees after two multimillion-dollar rounds of venture capital.The challenge now is educating the world in their system. “We obviously aim to be a global standard,” Sheldrick says. To that end they have recently signed licensing agreements with companies including Mercedes, which will utilise the system in its A-class cars, including using voice activation, and TomTom, which will incorporate three-word commands in its navigation platforms. The technology also offers an off-the-shelf solution to the many countries that lack any kind of universal address system. Ten governments and their postal services – including Mongolia, Nigeria, Ivory Coast and Tuvalu – have signed up to the idea.“If you think about addresses,” Sheldrick says, “some are from centuries ago, some are from last week, but there is also so much of the world that has not engaged with that. And that can include where I live in rural Hertfordshire, to our office in London where the postcode does not point to the right place, to entire countries, like Mongolia or Saudi Arabia, which have just never known anything other than using directions.” Given that smartphones now have such wide penetration, he believes there is the opportunity to leapfrog conventional address systems.Sheldrick is watching the slow advance of his idea in travel guides and email signatures and Airbnb booking forms. The technology has already proved invaluable in disaster zones and refugee camps as well as at rock festivals. It could easily enable drone delivery. Earlier this month the lead GP on the Isle of Mull, Dr Brian Prendergast, sick of being unable to find his patients, requested they all sign up to it.Lyndsey Duff, the head of what3words’ two-woman South African office got quite emotional, she says, when she first heard about the possibilities of the technology two years ago. She was working at the time for the South African High Commission in London. There are many ways in which South Africa was historically ided but one of them, she suggests, “was always by maps”. While the whites-only areas of apartheid cities had street names, the black townships and rural villages like Relela were just inked in as grey spaces. “For me, what3words is the perfect balance of good business and doing good,” Duff says. She points to the fact that iStore – the South African equivalent of Apple Store – is now using what3words for its deliveries, as well as to the potential of projects like Gateway Health (which use the service for a nominal fee). Not only ecommerce, but also social progress is being held up by the absence of “last mile” technology that will take you where you need to get, Duff suggests.On the ground, that last mile can still be quite a hard sell. In Limpopo, as elsewhere, Gateway Health is faced with the question of how to make the technology go viral. Dr Louw believes it takes a village. His strategy is to use Relela as a pilot scheme for what3words, to show its positive impact on maternal health, and to use that case study to try to persuade regional and national government to adopt the address system as standard.In Relela, I joined him as he tried to sell the benefits to perhaps the toughest crowd of all, the village’s hereditary chief and councilmen, who have had plenty of white men from Johannesburg come here and tell them how they can improve the way they have always done things. The chief’s big brick house is at the top of a hill looking down the valley toward the Cloud Mountains. In late afternoon, we are invited to sit in his front yard, where benches have been set up for a council meeting under a large, spreading jacaranda tree. When Louw makes his pitch for every home in Relela to utilise a what3words address, he is met with silence. This, it is eventually explained, is because the council meeting does not yet have a quorum. We sit on the benches for a long, chill hour while the sun goes down, waiting for the other two councillors to come up the hill. Eventually when it is getting dark and six men are present, Louw repeats his pitch. Again, silence.I have a go. “If someone was to come to the village from outside,” I say, “how might they currently find the person they wanted to meet?”“But,” I say, “what if a child was sick, and needed an ambulance. Or a woman was in distress, in labour? What if the zone leader was out?”The councilmen discuss these questions gravely. “Then that would be a problem,” Mowane concludes.Louw shows a video on his phone about how what3words might solve that problem. At this point, slowly, almost imperceptibly, a smile spreads across one or two of the councilmen’s faces. Another meeting is arranged, this one involving a big screen for the villagers, and lunch.On the way back down from the chief’s house, Louw suggests this is progress. He believes in a year or two the argument will be won, and there will be a team of community drivers on hand to get women like Eunice Sewaphe to hospital. “It is exciting times,” he insists. There are 139 villages like Relela in this region. But once Relela has addressed itself, then – neighbours being neighbours – he hopes the other 138 will follow. Beyond this valley, there are 4 billion people without an address. Perhaps technology can now put them on a map, three words at a time.Tim Adams travelled to South Africa as a guest of what3words and Gateway Health"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9ad6b3ccb22aa2808b641e1f1eefc34c40fec47/0_162_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4621b63bbb7b6ba6e988ef35b898bc0d","title":"rufus wainwright opera transfigured second classical release change direction","story":"At 44, the singer and songwriter Rufus Wainwright is shortly to loose his second opera on the world. Hadrian, which opens in Canada later this year, will tell of the Roman emperor’s long relationship with his lover, Antinous. And creating it has been a reverent, careful step for Wainwright, who says that opera now serves as his “religion in many ways”.“I’ve often gone into the opera house in quite a state yet come out completely transfigured, so when I gear up to work in that world, it is like I am going into the clergy,” he tells the Observer.On 22 June, Wainwright, who has built up an international following with his swirling, emotionally candid melodies, performed in the grounds of Kenwood House in London and then at Coventry cathedral to adoring fans. This week he will be doing gigs in Whitley Bay, Leeds and Bath. Yet he is full of disappointment about the pop world. “I always loved opera, and now the mainstream pop business has imploded and is not something I can relate to any more, it opens up the territory for a bunch of other things.” Far from waving farewell to his past, however, Wainwright is announcing the dates of a new tour that will bring him to Britain next spring to celebrate his first two albums, released two decades ago. “I’m excited to examine that material again,” he says. “At first I thought I’d even perform the albums back to back. I haven’t discarded that idea, but it would be a long evening.”His lack of faith in the pop scene is partly due, he says, to all the “incredibly talented and rich and successful young people out there who are still obsessed with making more money and with being the centre of attention”. He cannot see why these stars, once they make it, would not want simply to make the music they like, instead of serving an industry. He was lucky, he now suspects, not to have had great fame and cash thrust upon him at an early age: “I know when that happens you create this machine around you that has to be fed, so I guess I dodged a bullet in not having that occur.”Wainwright, a Canadian-American who grew up in Montreal and lives in Los Angeles, says he is “definitely at one of those vantage-point periods” of his life where he is enjoying looking both forward and back. He was 24 when his first, self-titled album marked him out from the crowd in 1998. Today, eight studio albums later, he is a healthier, gym-going performer, happy with his achievements.And the tour is not the only challenge ahead: Wainwright has been back into the studio in LA to record a new album with the leading US producer Mitchell Froom. “They are songs that bubbled up during my years doing operas, and getting frustrated with directors and conductors and opera houses. So I’ve been going into a room and singing them all to fuck off.”Unsurprising, then, that people have a hard time categorising Wainwright. He has been hailed as a balladeer, a troubadour, a torch song singer and even as “the king of baroque pop”. But for him the point is that he does not produce commercially safe work. The trouble with the music industry, he argues, is that the value of the song lyric has been undermined. And it is a trend he regrets all the more since the death of Leonard Cohen in 2016. The fellow Canadian was grandfather to Viva, the daughter that Wainwright shares and raises with his old friend, Lorca Cohen. “Lyrics are the wood the ship is made from, as opposed to the sail, the music. Writing them is an art form in itself and having known Leonard very well, I know losing him was a great passing of that concept.”Melodies, Wainwright says, come to him naturally, as “a function of my body” lyrics though, he has to “fashion and test out”. “It’s not that I am such a great lyric writer, but I do know what makes a great lyric. That’s maybe because I am actually a really great singer, I can feel it in my gut,” he playfully suggests.Wainwright and his younger sister Martha, the folk rock singer, sprang together from a deep well of music. Their father is the singer and actor Loudon Wainwright III and their mother, the late Kate McGarrigle.“No matter whether we were at a dinner party, or at a restaurant, if there was a piano around, my mother, after a couple of drinks, would usually end up drawn to it,” he remembers. “She was almost stricken with this musical mania. I need music in order to survive, but she was particularly afflicted. And what at times was even annoying, now seems wonderful to have experienced.”Wainwright turned his back on a potential career in classical music when Loudon handed a tape of his son’s music to the producer Van Dyke Parks. But he does not blame his father for the subsequent change of direction. The two have had their conflicts, notably chronicled in the son’s song Dinner at Eight, but family peace now reigns. “I was fortunate. I wouldn’t have had it any other way. I would have made it come hell or high water, but I do owe a lot to Loudon – and he owes a lot to me. We owe a lot to each other, Loudon and I. It is nice now to be able to receive and to give.”While Wainwright admits this is not opera’s most popular age, he does detect a tipping point on the horizon. “With what is going on politically, art and music will have to start to express the sense of horror and sadness and angst. And opera still holds a kind of gravitas that even children see. They know it is profound and it impresses them.”Hadrian, which was composed for the Canadian Opera Company, follows Wainwright’s first opera Prima Donna, which premiered at the Manchester International Festival in 2009. Sung in English and Latin, Hadrian was inspired by the French author Marguerite Yourcenar’s 1951 account of the emperor’s affair with Antinous and is to star the leading American baritone Thomas Hampson. By shining a light on Hadrian now, 1,880 years after his death, its composer hopes to tackle “some pretty contemporary issues”.“Hadrian created Palestine and was responsible for the first big Jewish massacre that occurred in documented history,” says Wainwright, referring to the Great Revolt of AD 66-73, the first recorded war between the Romans and the Jews in Judea. “So the borders he initiated are still being fought over. And a lot of the issues of homosexuality are identical today. Exceptions were made then, but the love between Hadrian and Antinous was a bona fide relationship and seen as very wrong.”His new work qualifies as an opera by anybody’s reckoning, Wainwright says. Importantly, it is through-composed – meaning the music doesn’t repeat itself – and will be performed unamplified. He is aiming, he says, for the kind of timelessness the best operas achieve.“My goal would be to recreate that freshness of effect with my work. And maybe it is my annoyingly positive attitude, but I feel I am laying this massive trap that all of these young people will stumble into suddenly as they get older. After all, a certain percentage of those young wild people at Glastonbury will end up sitting through the Ring Cycle one day.”When Wainwright performed at the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden over five nights in 2010, box office receipts showed that three-quarters of the audience had never been there before. “So the opera world needs me!” Wainwright laughs, revealing his plan for a third and final opera. “That would be my last, because it is so labour intensive. And it is financially insane when you have a daughter to put through school and mortgages to pay.”All Of These Poses Anniversary Tour 2019 will bring Wainwright to the Royal Albert Hall in London, and to Birmingham, Manchester and Glasgow in April next year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b73425f07fbb8c8b226f21ea4b464306723a1679/0_124_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e13d62755f2bd1c413928184d84c61c","title":"kit harington rose leslie game of thrones stars marry","story":"Couple who met on set of TV series exchanged vows at Rayne church in AberdeenshireGame of Thrones stars Rose Leslie and Kit Harington have married at a church in Aberdeenshire.Guests lined the path outside Rayne church in Kirkton of Rayne, and the newlyweds were cheered and showered with flower petal confetti as they left.The couple got into an old Land Rover Defender decorated with paper hearts and tin cans tied to the back, which rattled as the couple drove off to the reception at Leslie’s family’s 12th-century castle. Guests at the wedding included Game of Thrones stars Peter Dinklage, Maisie Williams, Sophie Turner and Emilia Clarke, as well as Jack Donnelly and his partner, fellow actor Malin Akerman. Leslie wore a flowing ivory gown and veil for the ceremony, while Harington was dressed in a morning suit. The couple, both aged 31, met in 2012 while playing on-screen lovers – Ygritte and Jon Snow – in the TV drama. Speaking outside the castle on Saturday, Leslie’s father, Sebastian, said: “We are absolutely thrilled for Kit and Rose to be marrying today. It’s an absolutely lovely day for us.“It’s a great day for Aberdeenshire. We are using local caterers, local lighting, local flowers.” Two years after they met, Leslie left Game of Thrones, while Harington has become one of the show’s most popular stars, having appeared in every episode. Fans of the show gathered outside the castle hoping to catch a glimpse of the couple. Two students from China, currently studying in Glasgow, were among the fans who gathered at the venue. Yunyao Li and Qiong dan Xu, both 23, said they are fans of Harington’s alter-ego in Game Of Thrones. Clutching floral bouquets for the stars, they said: “We would like to see him if possible.” A wedding date of 23 June had previously been posted at Aberdeenshire’s Huntly register office. The stars announced their engagement in the Times newspaper last year.

So if you’re looking for counterculture sounds, it’s here you’ll find songs that spoke for a generationImmersion in Seattle’s music scene begins minutes after disembarking at Sea-Tac, the city’s international airport, which houses a store devoted to the record company Sub Pop. In 1988, the then shoestring Sub Pop Records released Nirvana’s debut single it subsequently became as synonymous with Seattle as Motown is with Detroit. Opening our hipster playlist is Nirvana’s fourth single, Smells Like Teen Spirit, released three years later. It became a massive hit across the world, igniting the rock phenomenon that would transform Seattle, a hitherto obscure enclave in America’s far north-west, into an epicentre of cool.Previous generations of Seattle musicians took for granted that they would have to leave their hometown if they wanted a successful career. Arguably the greatest electric guitarist of all-time, Jimi Hendrix is up next – he was born and raised in Seattle, although only found fame after moving to London.Right now, Seattle’s music has never been so rich or erse. Witness the contrast of Fleet Foxes’ Sun it Rises, a yearning choral-Americana hymn to frontier spirits, with avant-hip-hop duo Shabazz Palaces. Shine a Light hails from their futuristic twin Quazarz album – released in 2017 by a certain indie record label with its own airport shop.Portland has become renowned in recent years for its ultra-progressive attitudes – as satirised by the comedy series Portlandia – but the city’s hippy roots have long attracted free-thinkers from all over America. Emerging from the city’s early 90s underground rock scene with his disarmingly catchy dark-folk confessionals was Elliott Smith. Here, we trace the Texan native’s troubled quest around Portland in Needle in the Hay.Other musicians who rocked up in Portland included feminist trio Sleater-Kinney, formed in the Washington state capital Olympia during the mid-90s, by guitarists Corin Tucker and Carrie Brownstein, alongside drummer Janet Weiss. From their 2015 comeback album, No Cities to Love confounds the adage that radical voices mellow with age – or, in the case of Portlandia co-creator Brownstein, fame.Next up, we have the Shins, who formed in New Mexico but became Portland residents following their 2002 breakthrough hit New Slang (as featured in the film Garden State). Then, Laura Veirs – who was called to the city via Colorado and the midwest to craft her contemplative modern-folk tapestries – offers a revelatory version of the Grateful Dead song Mountains of the Moon, from her latest album the Lookout.The Grateful Dead were, of course, a flagship band for 60s counterculture. From San Fran, tremors from the Summer of Love rippled up the west coast of the US – and then around the world. While the Dead were busy soundtracking Ken Kesey’s Acid Tests, the 1967 Haight-Ashbury scene’s commercial powerhouse was Jefferson Airplane, a relatively straightforward folk-rock band until the recruitment of siren vocalist Grace Slick. Her vocals on White Rabbit – with its exhortation to “feed your head” – alongside other songs, such as Somebody to Love, helped the tracks become anthems for the ages.A decade later, the punk revolution was under way, and San Francisco’s North Beach district harboured the latest manifestation of the city’s nonconformist heritage: the Dead Kennedys. They deployed caustic satire in songs like California Über Alles to debunk mainstream American culture and politics.Our penultimate track is Why Won’t You Stay, by one of San Francisco’s greatest songwriters, Mark Eitzel, chronicler of the city’s luckless and heartbroken for the past 30 years – both with legendary band American Music Club, notably on Everclear (Rolling Stone’s Best Album of 1991), and in his more recent solo work. Eitzel’s lachrymose voice is the perfect accompaniment to a Mission bar crawl.Carrying the city’s freak flag proudly into the present day to round off our playlist are Thee Oh Sees, a twin-drummer psychedelic juggernaut led by wild-eyed John Dwyer – proof that San Fran isn’t merely a place, it’s also a state of mind.For more inspiration and to book your trip to the US, visit bausa"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d64639bd23ef4445039890f6608fc52c957f9844/0_23_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a721b08f52ad9b5898a8bee0a8c5af28","title":"explosion rally new ethiopian prime minister abiy ahmed","story":"Abiy Ahmed commented on Addis Ababa blast that killed one and injured more than 100, saying ‘killing others is a defeat’Abiy Ahmed, Ethiopia’s new prime minister, has vowed to continue his radical programme of reforms after more than 100 people were injured by an explosion at a rally in his support in Addis Ababa on Saturday.The 41-year-old ex-soldier, who took office in April, had just finished speaking when what is thought to be a grenade was thrown at the stage in the capital’s Meskel Square.Footage showed the prime minister being rushed from the scene by security guards.Abiy later described the explosion as a “well-orchestrated attack”, but one that failed.“A few Ethiopians were injured. There are a few people who lost their lives,” he said in a televised address. “Love always wins. Killing others is a defeat. To those who tried to ide us, I want to tell you that you have not succeeded.”At least one person was killed and 153 people were injured, 10 critically, the health minister, Amir Aman said.Seyoum Teshome, a member of the organising committee, said the attack had involved a grenade. “Someone tried to hurl it to the stage where the prime minister was,” Teshome told Reuters.Tens of thousands had filled the square in the centre of the Ethiopian capital to hear Abiy, who was wearing a cowboy hat and T-shirt, speak.Observers said the size of the crowd underlined the broad-based popular support for Africa’s youngest national leader and the deep desire for change in the country of 100 million after decades of authoritarian rule.Many supporters wore clothes displaying Abiy’s image and carried signs saying “One Love, One Ethiopia”.Abiy, who was appointed prime minister following the unexpected resignation of his predecessor, Hailemariam Desalegn, in February, told the crowd change was coming and there was no turning back.“For the past 100 years hate has done a great deal of damage to us,” he said, stressing the need for more reforms.Since taking power, Abiy has ordered the release of thousands of prisoners, opened state-owned companies to private investment and dramatically loosened restrictions on media.Most recently, he stunned Ethiopians by saying he was prepared to fully implement an 18-year-old peace deal with Eritrea aimed at ending a two-year war between the country and its neighbour that reached a stalemate and had resulted into an expensive military buildup by both countries.The move is one of a series that observers say could transform the region. Abiy has also said he will scrap trade barriers with Somalia and spoken of his desire for closer integration with Ethiopia’s unstable and violent neighbour as part of a wider effort to create a single market in the Horn of Africa.However, the reform programme has prompted resistance from certain groups and some Ethiopians near the border with Eritrea have protested against the peace deal.Most significantly, the Tigrayan People’s Liberation Front, a party in Ethiopia’s ruling coalition that has been the dominant force in government for most of the past 27 years, said the announcement on the peace deal had been made before the ruling coalition’s congress met to discuss it.Ethiopia’s government, which came to power 27 years ago after more than a decade of civil war, is split by factional battles between four ethnically-based parties as well as fierce competition between institutions and iniduals.Abiy is the first leader from Ethiopia’s largest ethnic community, the Oromo, which has complained for decades of economic, cultural and political marginalisation.Some have hailed him as Ethiopia’s Mikhail Gorbachev, a reference to the leader who attempted to bring rapid change to the ailing Soviet Union in the late 1980s.“The grenade attack in Addis may be well linked to hardliners who do not want to see dialogue and conciliation with Eritrea. However, it may also be in response to perceived Tigrayan marginalisation andor dissent within the military. Either way, it shows that the reforms are not window dressing,” said Ryan Cummings, a South Africa based security analyst.The US embassy said violence has no place as Ethiopia pursues meaningful political and economic reforms.Despite an International Monetary Fund forecast predicting that Ethiopia will be the fastest-growing economy in sub-Saharan Africa in 2018, few doubt the scale of the problems Abiy faces. But there is growing inequality, insufficient employment opportunities for a huge number of graduates and environmental damage.Efforts to expand Addis Ababa, which resulted in the displacement of farmers from its surrounding area, sparked anti-government protests in 2014 that led to the imposition of a nine-month state of emergency last year. About a million Ethiopians have been driven from their homes by a land and ethnicity-fuelled crisis that has gripped the nation for years and escalated in recent months. Since taking office, Abiy has visited most regions of Ethiopia and has repeatedly called for unity between its ethnic groups.He described the grenade attack as “an unsuccessful attempt by forces who do not want to see Ethiopia united”.

Damian Collins will join forces with the former Wales rugby union captain Gareth Thomas on Monday to launch a draft amendment to the Football Offences Act 1991 that would outlaw indecent and homophobic chanting.Chanting of an “indecent or racialist” nature is banned at football games, but due to confusion over its interpretation the draft bill aims to explicitly ban chants and gestures that make indecent references to “sexual orientation and gender identity”.The MP for Folkestone and Hythe said: “The time has come to move from acknowledgement to action. That is why Gareth and I are seeking to amend the Football Offences Act 1991 to make chanting or gesturing of an indecent nature with reference to sexual orientation or gender identity against the law. “When the Football Offences Act came into force, it made racialist abuse within football stadia illegal. The proposed amendment, which I will present to the House of Commons on Monday, seeks to extend that legal protection to LGBT+ players and fans.” Collins cited the 10,000 Swiss francs (£7,615) fine handed to the Mexico football federation over chants by some fans last weekend and called for sport governing bodies to take stern action against similar instances. He said: “Whilst, if enacted, the bill would protect LGBT+ fans and players in the UK, recent events, including at the World Cup, have once again demonstrated that homophobic abuse takes place at football matches the world over. “Fifa and other sports governing bodies should take the necessary steps to ensure that homophobic abuse will never be tolerated and that action will be taken against people that engage in activities like these, no matter where the game is played. “We hope that the bill will soon become law and will contribute to making football a sport that is truly open to everyone.” Thomas, who made 100 appearances for Wales, scoring 41 tries, came out as gay in 2009, shortly after he and his wife orced. He moved to rugby league in March 2010, making four appearances for Wales, and retired from all forms of rugby in October 2011.

Iran-backed Houthi rebels fighting the Saudi-led coalition have also been accused of committing war crimes against civilians in the key port city of Hodeidah, now the scene of heavy fighting and where there are fears of an unprecedented humanitarian crisis.Britain has consistently said that it keeps all arms exports under close scrutiny and that licensing is made on a case-by-case basis. But now a freedom of information request reveals that for the last five years, Britain has been selling Storm Shadow and Brimstone air-to-surface missiles and Paveway IV bombs to the Saudis under what are known as Open Inidual Export Licences (OIELs), which the government says are for the export of “less sensitive goods”.Unlike specific licences, OIELs allow an unlimited number of consignments over a fixed period, typically between three and five years. There is no obligation to publish the total value of the licence after it expires. “Open licences remove the need for the seller to obtain prior approval for each export,” said Andrew Smith of Campaign Against Arms Trade, which submitted the FOI. “It’s an opaque system which has been used to shift extremely sensitive weaponry to the Saudi regime.”The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, which uses open sources to measure the quantities of arms exported each year, estimates that, since 2013, around 100 British-made Storm Shadow missiles worth £80m, 2,400 Paveway IV bombs worth £150m, and 1,000 Brimstone missiles worth £100m have been sold to Saudi Arabia.“Open licences issued in the years before Saudi Arabia intervened in Yemen’s civil war are still being used for the export of hundreds of millions of pounds of bombs today. If it were not for this Observer report neither parliament nor the committee tasked with scrutinising arms exports, on which I sit, would have any idea that these weapons are being sent,” said Labour MP Lloyd Russell-Moyle, who sits on the Commons committee on arms export controls.In 2015, the process for issuing OIELs was updated, with a view to encouraging their greater use. The committee strongly criticised the move, claiming it would “inescapably reduce the transparency” of Britain’s arms exports. But the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, which at the time was responsible for the Export Control Organisation, the agency that oversees the sale of military exports,insisted that the policy applied to the export of “less sensitive goods to less sensitive destinations.” The government has confirmed that all three weapon systems have been used in Yemen, where Human Rights Watch has linked British-licensed Paveway IV bombs to attacks on civilian targets. In December 2016, Sky News examined an attack site where part of a Storm Shadow missile with UK markings was found.The government insists that it operates one of the most robust arms export control regimes in the world with all export licence applications assessed on a case-by-case basis against the Consolidated EU and National Arms Export Licensing Criteria.But this claim was challenged by the arms trade campaigner, Smith. “By the government’s own admission it is trying to encourage more companies to use this type of licence,” he said. “If permission is not needed before a specific export of missiles or bombs takes place, then how can it claim to operate a case-by-case system?”A Department for International Trade spokesperson said claims that OIELs allowed Britain to export arms without close scrutiny were “completely untrue”. “The export of Paveway IV bombs, Storm Shadow missiles and Brimstone air to surface missiles are made under a longstanding government-to-government defence cooperation programme between the UK and Saudi Arabia,” the spokesman explained. “OIELs are not a simple or quick option for exporters and the application process can take several months. Terms and conditions for use will vary depending on the goods and export destinations. Holders of OIELs are subject to audit by DIT compliance inspectors.”"},{"url":null,"title":"summer solstice 2018 longest day pictures","story":"The spectacular moment the sun begins to rise over Stonehenge, Wiltshire this morning as Britain welcomes the longest day of the year. The monument is built along the solstice alignment of the summer sunrise and the winter sunset. Read more about the summer solstice here.15-year-old boy stabbed to death after birthday party in RomfordNew Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern introduces baby Neve te Aroha to the worldPlague of green iguanas wreaks havoc in FloridaStars of Westeros out in force as Game of Thrones\u0026#39 Kit Harington and Rose Leslie tie the knot in AberdeenshireCritics mock Emmanuel Macron as unpresidential for posing with risqué dance troupe at Elysée palaceSaudi women take to the roads after ban lifts, without the feminist pioneers who drove reformsRestaurant owner who asked Sarah Sanders to leave says she was taking moral stand against Donald TrumpRestaurants told to reveal calorie counts under Government plans to halve childhood obesity within 12 yearsGosport inquiry panel accused of \u0026#34NHS cover up\u0026#34 over faulty syringe driversChaos at US border as illegal immigrant parents plead to be reunited with their childrenPresident of Zimbabwe survives \u0026#39assassination attempt\u0026#39 in BulawayoMurder investigation launched after middle-aged woman found dead in gardenRecord number of British female wildcards at Wimbledon as coach says their friendship helped their rise to success  Gosport nurses first raised alarm over use of painkillers 30 years agoComment: Why England should be a nation of proud flag-waversComment: The lessons I learnt as an NHS whistle-blowerEnglish football hooligans tracked down by police after being filmed singing anti-Semitic songs in RussiaExclusive: Moped gang members reveal how they were \u0026#39addicted\u0026#39 to crime - and claim they made £2,000 a dayBaby-boomers face £10k burden to care for elderly parentsEU migration row to relegate Brexit to footnote at Brussels summitWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/men/2018/06/14/TELEMMGLPICT000146063662_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450\"","title":"co2 brexit yawning divide told truth","story":"digitalservices@telegraphHow amusing that there is now suddenly a shortage of CO2 to inject into beerOne of the more disturbing features of our time is the yawning gulf between the way some of the most serious issues of the day are generally discussed and reported, and the real story behind them, which too often just gets buried from view.

So, it is with a mixture of curiosity and bemusement that I view the embarrassed reticence of the establishment over English patriotism and its symbols, most notably the flag of St George.Whenever Bangladesh is in an important tournament – usually with more success in cricket than in any other sport – the whole country is covered...To continue reading this articleStart your free trial of PremiumAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekAccess one Premium article per weekRegister for freeStart an annual subscription and receive a Fitbit Versa, worth £199View all subscription options\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp|LoginPlease review our commenting policy15-year-old boy stabbed to death after birthday party in RomfordNew Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern introduces baby Neve te Aroha to the worldPlague of green iguanas wreaks havoc in FloridaStars of Westeros out in force as Game of Thrones\u0026#39 Kit Harington and Rose Leslie tie the knot in AberdeenshireCritics mock Emmanuel Macron as unpresidential for posing with risqué dance troupe at Elysée palaceSaudi women take to the roads after ban lifts, without the feminist pioneers who drove reformsRestaurant owner who asked Sarah Sanders to leave says she was taking moral stand against Donald TrumpRestaurants told to reveal calorie counts under Government plans to halve childhood obesity within 12 yearsGosport inquiry panel accused of \u0026#34NHS cover up\u0026#34 over faulty syringe driversChaos at US border as illegal immigrant parents plead to be reunited with their childrenPresident of Zimbabwe survives \u0026#39assassination attempt\u0026#39 in BulawayoMurder investigation launched after middle-aged woman found dead in gardenRecord number of British female wildcards at Wimbledon as coach says their friendship helped their rise to success  Gosport nurses first raised alarm over use of painkillers 30 years agoComment: The lessons I learnt as an NHS whistle-blowerEnglish football hooligans tracked down by police after being filmed singing anti-Semitic songs in RussiaExclusive: Moped gang members reveal how they were \u0026#39addicted\u0026#39 to crime - and claim they made £2,000 a dayBaby-boomers face £10k burden to care for elderly parentsEU migration row to relegate Brexit to footnote at Brussels summitFurious French fishmongers fined for breaching EU rules by not displaying Latin fish namesWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/06/23/TELEMMGLPICT000167374413_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqLeUJvOJqnV613e1NxllMSd6BnMf0kzF1WPsn9AqaDz8.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"explosion zimbabwean presidents rally","story":"digitalservices@telegraphEmergency workers treat people injured in the blast as President Emmerson Mnangagwa addressed a rally in Bulawayo, ZimbabweEmmerson Mnangagwa, the Zimbabwean president, said he narrowly survived an attempt on his life on Saturday after a explosion at a party rally that injured two of his vice-presidents and several party officials.He described to state media how an object exploded a few inches away from me - but it is not my time.Video footage showed plumes of smoke surrounding the president as he was hustled away from the scene, down stairs from the podium at White City stadium in Bulawayo, the country\u0027s second city and an opposition stronghold.Fifteen people were hurt, three of them seriously, according to David Parirenyatwa, the health minister.Mr Mnangagwa later said he had visited some of the injured in hospital and pleaded for unity ahead of elections next month.President Emmerson Mnangagwa minutes before the explosionThe campaign so far has been conducted in a free and peaceful environment, and we will not allow this cowardly act to get in our way as we move towards elections, Mr Mnangagwa said in a Facebook post.George Charamba, a government spokesman, said investigations were under way and that there have been “multiple attempts” on Mr Mnangagwa’s life over the years.He took power in November when Robert Mugabe stepped down after 37 years in office under intense pressure from the army.There have been no claims of responsibility. Analysts suggested the culprits could come from among the armed forces - as they seek to create the condition for a security clampdown - or from elements within the ruling Zanu-PF that were sidelined with the ousting of Mr Mugabe.Chipo Dendere, a Zimbabwean professor of political science at Amherst College in the US, said the incident would change the tone of the election campaign.This is going to make everyone a little bit tense... this is the first time we have seen such a blatant attack, she said blaming isions inside the ruling Zanu-PF for the attack.Whatever internal fissures existed within Zanu-PF before (the coup in) November, those fissures didn\u0027t go away.The United States condemned the attack.The US Embassy said on Twitter that political violence in any form is unacceptable and contrary to the progress needed to move the country forward and take its place on the global stage.Although Mr Mnangagwa was not hurt, state media reported that Vice-President Kembo Mohadi suffered a leg injury.15-year-old boy stabbed to death after birthday party in RomfordNew Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern introduces baby Neve te Aroha to the worldPlague of green iguanas wreaks havoc in FloridaStars of Westeros out in force as Game of Thrones\u0026#39 Kit Harington and Rose Leslie tie the knot in AberdeenshireCritics mock Emmanuel Macron as unpresidential for posing with risqué dance troupe at Elysée palaceSaudi women take to the roads after ban lifts, without the feminist pioneers who drove reformsRestaurant owner who asked Sarah Sanders to leave says she was taking moral stand against Donald TrumpRestaurants told to reveal calorie counts under Government plans to halve childhood obesity within 12 yearsGosport inquiry panel accused of \u0026#34NHS cover up\u0026#34 over faulty syringe driversChaos at US border as illegal immigrant parents plead to be reunited with their childrenMurder investigation launched after middle-aged woman found dead in gardenRecord number of British female wildcards at Wimbledon as coach says their friendship helped their rise to success  Gosport nurses first raised alarm over use of painkillers 30 years agoComment: Why England should be a nation of proud flag-waversComment: The lessons I learnt as an NHS whistle-blowerEnglish football hooligans tracked down by police after being filmed singing anti-Semitic songs in RussiaExclusive: Moped gang members reveal how they were \u0026#39addicted\u0026#39 to crime -

Mr Macron made a late appearance with his wife and even did a few dance steps himself.DJ Chloe performs during the music day celebration in the courtyard of the Elysée PalaceThe “Son of immigrants, black, and queer” T-shirt was worn by Kiddy Smile, who earlier said it was to show his opposition to the asylum and migration bill being pushed through by Mr Macron’s government.15-year-old boy stabbed to death after birthday party in RomfordNew Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern introduces baby Neve te Aroha to the worldPlague of green iguanas wreaks havoc in FloridaStars of Westeros out in force as Game of Thrones\u0026#39 Kit Harington and Rose Leslie tie the knot in AberdeenshireSaudi women take to the roads after ban lifts, without the feminist pioneers who drove reformsRestaurant owner who asked Sarah Sanders to leave says she was taking moral stand against Donald TrumpRestaurants told to reveal calorie counts under Government plans to halve childhood obesity within 12 yearsGosport inquiry panel accused of \u0026#34NHS cover up\u0026#34 over faulty syringe driversChaos at US border as illegal immigrant parents plead to be reunited with their childrenPresident of Zimbabwe survives \u0026#39assassination attempt\u0026#39 in BulawayoMurder investigation launched after middle-aged woman found dead in gardenRecord number of British female wildcards at Wimbledon as coach says their friendship helped their rise to success  Gosport nurses first raised alarm over use of painkillers 30 years agoComment: Why England should be a nation of proud flag-waversComment: The lessons I learnt as an NHS whistle-blowerEnglish football hooligans tracked down by police after being filmed singing anti-Semitic songs in RussiaExclusive: Moped gang members reveal how they were \u0026#39addicted\u0026#39 to crime - and claim they made £2,000 a dayBaby-boomers face £10k burden to care for elderly parentsEU migration row to relegate Brexit to footnote at Brussels summitFurious French fishmongers fined for breaching EU rules by not displaying Latin fish namesWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/06/24/TELEMMGLPICT000167380041_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqwa5Jnl6ZbmW0SCmJ33EhWJ6sbWUxKJa4c3yj6Zo3vyg.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"new zealand prime minister jacindaardern introduces baby neve","story":"digitalservices@telegraphNew Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern and partner Clarke Gayford pose with their baby daugther Neve Te ArohaJacinda Ardern, prime minister of New Zealand, announced on Sunday she had named her new-born daughter Neve Te Aroha as she prepared to leave hospital amidst an outpouring of public excitement.Ms Ardern appeared before dozens of reporters and a flurry of camera flashes at Auckland City Hospital in her first appearance since giving birth, thanking the public for their support as her three-day-old daughter slept in her arms.We really just wanted to say thank you and that we\u0027re all doing really well. Sleep deprived, but really well, she said.Ms Ardern, 37, became New Zealand\u0027s youngest prime minister when she took office through a coalition deal last year after an inconclusive election. She has now become the first woman in the country\u0027s history to give birth while in office.She delivered her 3.31 kg (7.3 lb) daughter in the country\u0027s largest public hospital on Thursday afternoon with her partner, television presenter Clarke Gayford, at her side.Baby Neve sleeps through all the fussThe couple had settled on the baby\u0027s first name, Neve, after she was born, he mother said, explaining that it means bright and radiant and snow, which reflected that she was born in the middle of winter during the nation\u0027s indigenous Maori new year and the shortest day of the year.Her second name, Te Aroha, which means love in Te Reo Maori, one of the country\u0027s national languages, was a nod to the many Maori iwi, or tribes, that had offered names as a gift to Ms Ardern while she was pregnant.\u0027Te Aroha\u0027 was our way of reflecting the amount of love this baby has been shown even before she arrived, Ms Ardern said.The island nation, with a population of 4.5 million, was in the grips of a baby-induced glow of optimism in recent days with many social media users dubbing the baby the Prime Miniature while they waited for her name to be announced.It\u0027s just something really lovely in a world where so much is unfair that we\u0027re all very excited about it, said Frances Gerbic, a music teacher living in Auckland.Proud mum and dad speak to the mediaThe New Zealand Symphony Orchestra recorded a version of Brahm\u0027s lullaby Cradle Song translated into Te Reo Maori, and Auckland\u0027s tallest building, the Sky Tower, was lit up pink for three nights in honour of the occasion.Support also flooded in from around the world, with Britain\u0027s Queen Elizabeth, whom Ms Ardern met in London in April, sending an emailed message of congratulations and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau tweeting at Ms Ardern: Pro tip, Jacinda: Briefing notes make excellent bed time stories.Ms Ardern will take the next six weeks off, leaving her deputy Winston Peters in charge, and return to work in early August when Mr Gayford will care for the baby full-time.Meet New Zealand\u0026#039s \u0026#039First Bloke\u0026#039: Clarke Gayford, the man who\u0026#039ll become a stay-at-home dadMany in New Zealand and around the world had held up her pregnancy - just the second time an elected leader had given birth in office since Pakistan\u0027s Benazir Bhutto in 1990 - as a symbol of progress for women.Hopefully these things that in these moments now are...a novelty...one day they aren\u0027t new any more, Ms Ardern said.I hope for little girls and boys that actually there\u0027s a future where they can make choices about how they raise their family and what kind of career they have that are based on what they want and what makes them happy.15-year-old boy stabbed to death after birthday party in RomfordPlague of green iguanas wreaks havoc in FloridaStars of Westeros out in force as Game of Thrones\u0026#39 Kit Harington and Rose Leslie tie the knot in AberdeenshireCritics mock Emmanuel Macron as unpresidential for posing with risqué dance troupe at Elysée palaceSaudi women take to the roads after ban lifts, without the feminist pioneers who drove reformsRestaurant owner who asked Sarah Sanders to leave says she was taking moral stand against Donald TrumpRestaurants told to reveal calorie counts under Government plans to halve childhood obesity within 12 yearsGosport inquiry panel accused of \u0026#34NHS cover up\u0026#34 over faulty syringe driversChaos at US border as illegal immigrant parents plead to be reunited with their childrenPresident of Zimbabwe survives \u0026#39assassination attempt\u0026#39 in BulawayoMurder investigation launched after middle-aged woman found dead in gardenRecord number of British female wildcards at Wimbledon as coach says their friendship helped their rise to success  Gosport nurses first raised alarm over use of painkillers 30 years agoComment: Why England should be a nation of proud flag-waversComment: The lessons I learnt as an NHS whistle-blowerEnglish football hooligans tracked down by police after being filmed singing anti-Semitic songs in RussiaExclusive: Moped gang members reveal how they were \u0026#39addicted\u0026#39 to crime -

Resignations seem inevitable as Theresa May\u0026nbspis forced to do what she has so far refused to do -\u0026nbspmake a binding choiceClick to followThe Independent OnlineTwo years on from the referendum and we still have no earthly clue how Brexit will play outA week, as they say, is a long time in politics. Little wonder that the last couple of years felt like an eternity.So, two years after the referendum what, if anything, have we learned about Brexit, and indeed about ourselves? \u0026nbspWell, first and foremost, we’ve discovered that leaving the EU is unbelievably difficult.Untangling 40-plus years of membership was never going to be easy. Doing so under the ridiculous time constraints imposed by Article 50 doubly so. A senior civil servant recalled one of his EU colleagues remarking that Article 50 was written in such a way that only the British civil service would have a chance of getting it done in time.Which points to another lesson. Whoever was in charge of this process, whatever the size of their majority, doing Brexit would have been difficult, all-consuming and messy.And this is so not least because of the choice the EU has presented us with. Michel Barnier’s infamous steps of doom\u0026nbspmean there simply isn’t the room to arrive at the kind of ambitious free trade agreement of which the Prime Minister long dreamed. Rather, the Government must choose between three unpalatable options, or rather two unpalatable ones and an inconceivable one.Whether the Dominic Grieve amendment had passed last week or not, the Prime Minister now realises that no deal is not an option at all.Leaving us with two: a Brexit that is economically ruinous and one that, essentially, equates to membership without the perks.We must, in other words, choose between something that looks like the EU’s deal with Canada (though in all probability a Canada minus rather than a Canada plus) or something resembling continued membership of the single market and customs union.There isn’t much of a half-way house. All the clever talk of a partial single market for goods\u0026nbspis unrealistic. It would be complicated to manage, and does not really help even manufacturers. Rolls Royce, to use the most cited example, make a fair amount of their money from service\u0026nbspcontracts on their goods. Moreover, and not incidentally, the EU has not indicated it would accept anything along these lines.So back to the binary choice. Neither is perfect. Far from it. “Canada”\u0026nbsppresents economic problems. It would mean hardly any agreement over services – the bulk of our economy and the area where we enjoy a healthy surplus with the EU. And it will imply the need for customs checks at Dover. The Prime Minister herself implicitly recognised that such an outcome would be nowhere near good enough in her Mansion House speech.Equally, however, a straightforward “Norway”\u0026nbspsolution, with the UK unambiguously within the European Economic Area, is not one that would work politically here. So the question is whether something substantively similar can be dressed up as something sufficiently different – perhaps with registrations for EU nationals, a hyping up of the emergency brake on migration that the EEA treaty allows and stricter application of EU rules on free movement.This is where the debate now is. Find a clever way of selling the status quo, or adopt a model that impacts severely on trade and hence our economy, and deal with the political consequences.I, for one, have no earthly clue how this will play out. But as this stark choice becomes clearer, and as we approach squeaky bum time, the choice has to be made. Cabinet unity will be stretched to breaking point. Resignations seem inevitable as the PM is forced to do what she has so far refused to do: make a binding choice.And remember this is only a part of the story that has played out since 23 June 2016. The other is not about the EU, but about ourselves.Brexit is happening against the backdrop of a politics changing radically before our eyes. The traditional class bases of support for both major parties seem to be shifting. Hardly surprising then that neither the Tories nor Labour seem sure what post-Brexit offer to make to voters: neither is wholly certain which voters it is trying to attract.This political churn, combined with the all-consuming impact of Brexit on Whitehall, means that little if anything has been done to address the substantive domestic implications of the referendum. And this matters because it is here, rather than in Brussels, that the domestic political battle over Brexit will be won or lost.Whatever her subsequent errors as Prime Minister, Mrs May adeptly captured the mood of the country when she made that striking address from the doorstep of her new residence in Downing Street in July 2016.Brexit represented many things, not least a profound dissatisfaction with the political and economic status quo. Hence the real measure of its impact will not directly be what happens in negotiations with the EU, but how our Government decides to tackle this dissatisfaction. And of course the EU will no longer be there to provide cover for domestic policy failures.Certainly, something more substantive and less dishonest than the “Brexit idend”\u0026nbspfor the NHS is required. What that will be offered, as both major parties flounder, is anyone’s guess.And so, to the final lesson. There is a long, long way to go. We have reached the Brexit foothills. But the real mountains – sorting trade, then, more importantly, sorting ourselves – still await us.

When I did, one asked:\u0026nbsp“Can we pray for you?”I asked why they wanted to pray for me, and the same person answered that they felt called by God to walk the streets of DC\u0026nbspand let God’s voice tell them who might be “broken” or otherwise need prayer.As a Christian, I’m opposed to neither prayer nor people praying specifically for me, at least not when it’s done in good faith.But I’m also a transgender woman, and I was dressed in gorgeous makeup and clothing and earrings. I sure caught the gist of why these folks happened upon me to offer prayer.My introduction to Christianity was in evangelical churches. For years, I navigated conservative religious spaces, where I encountered bigotry and attempts to shame LGBT+\u0026nbsppeople and women as often as I found warmhearted people eager to serve others.There was more than a little racism, too. I’ve heard the statement “I’ll pray for you” said with love, and with judgment and scorn. I know the difference, and the folks who confronted me outside the cafe were making their judgement clear.Instead of a theological debate that usually goes nowhere for lack of good faith in discussion, I wanted them to feel what it’s like to have someone supposedly approach in love but inflict pain and discomfort. Perhaps that’s what it takes. A forced perspective in empathy. Why not try that approach?I could have ignored them but I’ve had it with some evangelicals giving a bad name to their community by insisting on defining people’s humanity for them. These three assumed I was broken because of my gender identity. They saw the constellation of my personhood through a backward telescope.It angered me that the whole of my being could be reduced to their flawed understanding of LGBT+\u0026nbsppeople, a view that could easily be revised if only they would take the time to get to know me instead of assuming they already did.So I would be damned if I would let them interrupt my Sunday afternoon coffee when I certainly wasn’t bothering them.I asked their spokeswoman if she understood how it might look to be searching for “broken” people to pray for, and specifically pick out a random transgender person. And they looked more than taken aback.I stood up, smiling but internally annoyed, and asked them what the Book of Matthew says about prayer. Their eyes went wide. One guy stammered nervously, clearly having trouble answering the question.The other two were just as flummoxed, ambushed by the idea that the “broken” transgender person was asking a simple question about a common verse on prayer in Matthew.For those who don’t know, Matthew is the first book in the New Testament and one of the three Synoptic Gospels, each of which are narratives of the life of Christ, frequently using the same stories, often with identical wording.While all three contain instruction on prayer, I reached for Matthew 18:20 because of its strong presence in the evangelical community and its common misapplication by members. In short, it reads: “For where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I with them.”Those up on their biblical knowledge might wonder why I didn’t turn to Matthew 6:5-7, scathing verses that call out hypocrites who are performative in their Christianity, telling them to pray in private rather than out on the streets so that they might be seen by others.It’s a good one that, unsurprisingly, is ignored in evangelical circles. They know it’s there, but it’s inconvenient.The verse I selected hits hard instead because it’s so commonly heard before a group prayer in evangelical churches. There, it tends to be inaccurately interpreted as a numbers game, one that’s about bringing to fruition what is requested of God in prayer.Evangelicals think of it as a call to bring more people into the church or, more cynically, personal prosperity through the Gospel.In reality, it’s a verse on accountability before God and about how God may work that accountability through humans. As Leisa Baysinger notes on the blog Our Ancient Paths, it references earlier Jewish tradition that at least three witnesses must agree to bring judgement on someone.In the moment I was unaware of its exact roots, which were surprisingly apt given the attempt of this small band to sit in judgement of me, but I still understood what was at stake in the line, and I loved the idea of using a verse on accountability that they had probably misunderstood numerous times.I was the judged who understands the law better than those attempting to judge, and on that day I sought to bring accountability.These aren’t issues I take lightly, and the passive-aggressive condescension of these three was anything but harmless. This wasn’t the time to be polite.Not when the Trump-Pence White House is trying to ban transgender people from the military. Not when transgender students with stories of discrimination are turned away by the US\u0026nbspDepartment of Education.Not when President Donald Trump and vice president\u0026nbspMike Pence\u0026nbspare seeking to implement a Health and Human Services Department regulation allowing healthcare workers to deny potentially lifesaving treatment to LGBT+\u0026nbsppeople.Not when the Human Rights Campaign reports that in the US, eight transgender people have been killed in 2018 and 28 in 2017 –\u0026nbspthe most ever annually. I wasn’t going to be silent.Instead, I spoke.“You know how Matthew says that where two or three are gathered in Jesus’ name, there he is with us?”They stared at me blankly. I had no intention of going easy on them.“That is what Matthew says, is it not?”At last, one spoke up: “Yes, that’s right.”And they nervously stepped forward into a circle.I said to one:\u0026nbsp“You start us off.” And she did, going through the motions quickly and antiseptically because they clearly wanted to get as far as they could from this awkward situation. And then I picked it up when it was clear she was done.“Lord Jesus, thank you for the benefit of these friends,” I began, wholly honest with God about how I hoped she would bless my new friends, encouraging them to affirm and be inclusive of others. I was hopeful that their community would honour all as God made them and value the strength of ersity.I mentioned the natural beauty of the LGBT+\u0026nbspcommunity and thanked God again for making us as we are, throwing in a genuine wish that their trip back home would be a safe one.Then, knowing my audience, I wrapped up with the usual evangelical banal phraseology –\u0026nbsp“no weapons shall be formed against them”,\u0026nbsp“put God on their hearts” –\u0026nbspto let them know I was just as familiar with their community’s vernacular as they were, maybe more so.As I finished, having returned their “let us pray for you” to them tenfold, they murmured their thank you’s and scuttled away.I don’t know whether my words made it through, but I hope they have a sense of what it feels like to have a stranger impose self-righteous venom on them. I also hope that they’ll realise how much actions such as these diminish the power of prayer and enable so much harm to LGBT+\u0026nbsppeople.A prayer that one might change their sexuality or gender identity is egregious encouragement to those who would seek to discriminate against LGBT+\u0026nbsppeople in our laws and to do violence against them in our communities. My own prayer’s acidity served to make them aware of their own by way of spiritual inoculation.The Genderquake debate did more harm than good for transgender peopleWhy has Caitlyn Jenner been chosen to speak about ‘ersity’?These people did not want to know more about me. They wanted to talk at me and pray at me. And I’m confident that’s not how Jesus would go about it.There are many in the evangelical community who love and affirm their LGBT+\u0026nbspfamily, friends and fellow human beings.It’s unfortunate, then, that others in the community still must be told a simple truth: They are not doing the Lord’s work by politicising prayer at the expense of others or by dumping their misplaced condescension on strangers they believe to be broken.Prayer should be a loving act, not a weapon of marginalisation.Clymer ia a transgender woman,\u0026nbspUS\u0026nbspArmy veteran and\u0026nbsppress secretary at the Human Rights Campaign\u0026nbspEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Opponents said it would also unfairly penalise people in social housing, as only they would be liable to be evicted.UK news in picturesDemonstrators at the People\u0027s March demanding a People\u0027s Vote on the final Brexit deal, in London, on the second anniversary of the 2016 referendum.Andria Marsh, 63, holds up photographs of her parents and her original British passport, following a Windrush service at Westminster Abbey in London.

Several earthquakes have been recorded in the area where the volcanic eruptions continue, including a 6.9 magnitue earthquake which struck the area on 4 May.“There has to be a peace process, and there has to be a right of the Palestinian people to live in peace, as well as the right of Israel,” he added.\u0026nbspMr Corbyn described Donald Trump’s decision to recognise contested Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and move the US\u0026nbspEmbassy to the disputed city as a “catastrophic mistake”.With the trip to Jordan, Mr Corbyn appeared to be attempting to boost his foreign policy credentials.\u0026nbspOn Friday, he toured Zaatari, Jordan’s largest camp for Syrian refugees.\u0026nbspTaking questions from reporters, he said a Labour government would “work very, very hard to regenerate the peace process” in Syria.Without a solution, “the conflict will continue, more people will die in Syria and many many more will go to refugee camps, either here in Jordan or come to Europe or elsewhere,” he added.More than six\u0026nbspmillion Syrians have fled war in their homeland, with a majority finding refuge in neighbouring host countries such as Jordan. Hundreds of thousands more have migrated onward to Europe, with Germany taking in the bulk.\u0026nbspMr Corbyn said Britain could do much more to shelter Syrian refugees, particularly unaccompanied children, arguing that the government’s quota of 20,000 refugees was “very, very small compared to any other European country”.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Killing others is a defeat. To those who tried to ide us, I want to tell you that you have not succeeded\u0027Mattha Busby and agenciesClick to followThe Independent OnlineEthiopians at a rally in Addis Ababa in support of the new prime minister, Abiy AhmedAt least two people have been killed\u0026nbspand others injured following an explosion at a political rally in support of Ethiopia’s new reformist leader.In a televised address after the blast on Saturday, which eyewitnesses said was caused by a grenade, Abiy Ahmed described the incident as “an unsuccessful attempt by forces who do not want to see Ethiopia united”.He said “a few people have lost their lives” and others were injured in the attack, that came shortly after he spoke to a crowd of tens of thousands of supporters on Meskel Square in the capital, Addis Ababa. Mr Ahmed has not yet blamed anyone for the blast, nor has anyone claimed responsibility, and police are investigating.“Love always wins,” he said. “Killing others is a defeat. To those who tried to ide us, I want to tell you that you have not succeeded.” An Associated Press reporter said they saw more than a dozen injured people. Ethiopians have been heartened by a slew of reforms under Mr\u0026nbspAhmed and had come together in a show of support in numbers unseen in recent years in the east African nation. The rally has now broken up with people singing, chanting and going back to their homes. In a cowboy hat and T-shirt, Mr\u0026nbspAhmed had addressed the crowd in Meskel Square as supporters wore clothes displaying his image and carried signs saying “One Love, One Ethiopia”.Mr\u0026nbspAhmed told the tens of thousands of supporters that change was coming after years of anti-government tensions and there was no turning back. “For the past 100 years hate has done a great deal of damage to us,” he said, stressing the need for even more reforms. The 42-year-old entered office in April and went about introducing a swift package of liberalising reforms which surprised Africa’s second most populous country.He announced the release of tens of thousands of prisoners, the opening of state-owned companies to private investment and the unconditional embrace of a peace deal with rival Eritrea. “I’ve never thought this day will come in Ethiopia. I’m very emotional right now,” said Mulugeta Sema, a supporter of Mr\u0026nbspAhmed who wore a T-shirt with the new leader’s image. “We should never get back to dictatorship. This is time for change.” British man held on death row in Ethiopia for four years releasedEthiopia demands Britain return all country’s artefacts held by V\u0026ampAHowever, not everyone has supported the reforms. Some Ethiopians near the border with Eritrea have protested the embrace of the peace deal. Meanwhile, the Tigrayan People’s Liberation Front, the dominant force in Ethiopian government for much of the past 27 years, said the peace deal had been made before the ruling coalition’s congress met to discuss it.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

He urged Indians to be proud of their culture and history.“The gems of India’s unique heritage, such as yoga, will be respected by the world at large only when we ourselves respect our culture and traditions,” he said.Around the world, public yoga events were held in Afghanistan, Japan and Peru, while Australia and South Africa celebrated on Monday.“From Tokyo to Toronto, from Stockholm to Sao Paulo, yoga has become a positive influence in the lives of millions,” Mr Modi told participants on the lush green lawns.“In a world where non-communicable diseases, stress and lifestyle related ailments are rising, yoga can play a central role in mitigating these diseases to create a healthy mind and body.”In the buildup to Thursday’s event, Mr Modi took part in a social media campaign, begun by his BJP party ministers, to get people to share videos of their fitness workouts on Twitter.Celebrities\u0026nbspfrom Bollywood actors to sports superstars\u0026nbspgot involved, and Mr Modi’s own video showed him performing yoga on a boulder in his prime ministerial gardens.Social media was again awash with videos emulating Mr Modi’s on Thursday, including from staff at Delhi airport, pupils at thousands of schools and members of India’s armed forces.Amid questions over his appeal, PM Modi’s party sweeps to key victoryPlea to Indian PM in London for ‘tortured’ captive elephants Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi accused of spying on citizens India PM makes point of visiting Palestinians after meeting NetanyahuThe Indian navy released pictures of sailors doing yoga on board the world’s oldest aircraft carrier, the INS Viraat, decommissioned last year, and soldiers guarding the world’s highest battleground, the Siachen glacier in northern Jammu and Kashmir state, did yoga routines at an altitude of around 18,000 feet.The events clearly mustered a huge amount of public support. For some, however, there was a sinister edge to having public institutions take part in a scheme closely associated with the prime minister’s messaging. Even prisons were involved, with 15,000 inmates due to take part in yoga events on Thursday in the capital alone.Sagarika Ghose, a prominent journalist and political commentator, wrote on Twitter: “Believer in yoga, try every morning, immense benefits. But concerned: why does a GOVERNMENT need to promote yoga? Yoga’s an inidual choice, a personal option.”Mr Modi’s rule, she said, was “fast becoming an escapist Bollywood film where song and dance attempt to distract from hard realities”. One of the most liked responses to Ms Ghose’s tweet told her to “go to Pakistan” if she couldn’t show loyalty to India.For Ajay Mehra, a political scientist at Delhi University, the International Day of Yoga “has become an imposition”, forced on the people by government.“Something like yoga should not be part of a political project,” he told The Independent, adding that there were certain yogic practices – chanting mantras for instance – that could be offensive to some groups in a plural society, “Muslims in particular”.Mr Mehra noted that Jawaharlal Nehru, the first prime minister of India, stressed the importance of secular, pluralist leadership while also being a devoted practitioner of yoga – “but he didn’t publicise it”.International Day of YogaEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

When the downpour finally came, it was worse than anyone feared.In just four days, Cox’s Bazar received two-thirds of the average rainfall expected in the month of June. More than 100 landslides have been reported, several people have died and hundreds of families have been made homeless, forced to sleep in mosques or crowd into shelters with their relatives.Ahead of World Refugee Day\u0026nbspon Wednesday, the UN released a report showing that the number of displaced people in the world has risen to a new record high of 68.5 million, and highlighting the plight of the Rohingya fleeing persecution in Myanmar as one of the biggest drivers pushing up that number.But speaking from Cox’s Bazar in a break in the weather that has coincided with the end of the Ramadan fast, Caroline Gluck, a senior official with the UN’s refugee agency, said their message this year was to “celebrate” World Refugee Day as a tribute to those struggling through such hardship, and the charities fighting to help them.As is the case with the wider refugee crisis across the globe, the population of those displaced in Bangladesh is made up mostly of women and children. Aid workers have found that creating women-only centres for healthcare, counselling and childcare is having a dramatic impact on the Rohingya’s quality of life.Rohingya women and girls are taught sewing, play games, receive medical care and are offered counselling at women-only centres run by charities like IRC in Cox\u0027s Bazar (Jessica Wanless)“In any crisis, women and children are the most vulnerable,” Ms Gluck told The Independent - a problem only exacerbated as flooding and landslides cripple camp infrastructure. “Night-time can be a worrying time, particularly if you have to travel to use toilets. The camp is quite sprawled, and instead of living alongside people you know, you are living with strangers.”One of the charities providing women-only centres is the International Rescue Committee (IRC). Dalia Al-Awqati, IRC’s emergency director in Bangladesh, said up to 80 per cent of the refugees are women and children and in need of “specialised support”.“Many Rohingya women and girls have been raped, seen their husbands and children killed before their eyes and lots of them are facing raising their children alone,” she told The Independent. “They live in a situation that is exacerbated by the presence of stigma and discrimination.”IRC\u0027s women-only centres (Jessica Wanless)For 12-year-old Azara, the centre is an oasis of normalcy in a situation that is anything but, and a welcome break from the boredom that comes with living in a refugee camp.She said she came to the centre every day, finding a safe space where she can make friends, play games and engage in her favourite pastime - henna.“It feels like home,” she said. “We come straight after we have been to school. Every week there is at least one day for sewing. Every week we learn something new. We love to learn.”Ex-UN ambassador says \u0027destroying Rohingya exceeds costs\u0027 for MyanmarRohingya facing \u0027crisis on top of crisis\u0027 as world looks other wayRohingya say Myanmar singled out the educated in genocideArmed Rohingya group massacred Hindus in Myanmar, report alleges\u0027Bittersweet\u0027 Ramadan for Rohingya Muslims forced to flee their homesMs Gluck said centres like those run by the IRC were vital to encourage women “carrying the burden” of what happened to them in Myanmar to come forward and seek counselling and support, in what is traditionally a very culturally conservative society.Media reports have previously highlighted a spike in births nine months after the alleged brutal crackdown by Myanmar’s army in Rakhine state that forced the Rohingya to flee. The danger, Ms Gluck said, is that all pregnancies in the camp become stigmatised as potentially being the result of rape.And one of the biggest positives to come out of the creation of the centres has been the number of female volunteers working to foster new communities in their makeshift home.A lot of women are taking on jobs as safety volunteers or in counselling their fellow refugees directly, having received training from NGOs. “It has helped women to develop roles that they didn’t have back home,” Ms Gluck said.Senwara stands in the Kutupalong refugee camp in Cox\u0027s Bazar (Timothy NesmithIRC)Senwara, a 35-year-old mother of four, is a volunteer who helps spread word about the centre to other refugees. She became the only female “Majhi” or community leader in her area of the camp after helping distribute food aid, and sees promoting the centre as part of her responsibility.“Women come here to this centre because there are no men,” she said. “If there were men, families would not let teenagers or women giving birth come here because they would feel shy. They are serious about this matter.”Ms Gluck said the few days of good weather, plus celebrations around Eid, had brought “joy to many faces” in the camps. There is an upbeat mood also to coincide with World Refugee Day, with singing, volleyball and other competitions put on to showcase the best of life in the camps.Rohingya Crisis in Photos Rohingya

He added that the dossier would involve a “census of Roma in Italy” which would “see who, how, how many”. He added: “Unfortunately, you need to keep Italian Roma in Italy.”The country\u0026nbspis estimated to be home to between 100,000 and 180,000 Roma.The minister’s actions drew criticism from human rights groups and opposition politicians.“The way is short from a census to a concentration camp.

They thought nothing of \u0026lsquobuying\u0026rsquo women and abusing them... to fund their love of luxury cars and property.DC Eddy said the Met had decided to charge Nastase for reasons of continuity.He explained: \u0026ldquoBecause we led the prosecution, it was decided we should also prosecute him, rather than a new one start in Romania, even though his alleged offence was committed over there.Asked about Constantin Mihai\u0026rsquos conviction for attempted murder, a Home Office spokesman said: \u0026ldquoWe will always seek to deport any foreign national with a history of serious or persistent convictions overseas."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/1/590x/978734_1.jpg","title":"meghan markle thomas markle suit royal ascot royal wedding","story":"ITVThomas Markle did not attend his daughter Meghan\u0027s Wedding Mr Markle was unable to travel to Windsor to walk his daughter, now the Duchess of Sussex, down the aisle.Mr Spence, who is well-known in the horse racing world, was seen wearing the suit at Royal Ascot on Tuesday.The Duke and Duchess of Sussex were also in attendance on the same day.The Duchess did see the suit in person, but sadly it was not worn by her father as she originally expected.

If you\u0027re able, ask if your friends, family or neighbours need any support.And if you\u0027re going outside for a prolonged period, remember UV is high at this time of year so think how the sun affects you and what you\u0027d do to make sure you don\u0027t get burned.Heatwave alerts will be sent out by Public Health England once daytime temperatures reach 30C (86F) and nighttime temperatures reach 15C (59F)."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/78/590x/978719_1.jpg","title":"Turkey elections 2018 Recep Tayyip Erdogan opposition rally state TV blackout","story":"Erdogan and his opposition Muharrem Ince A presidential vote is taking place later today, in an election that has rocked Recep Tayyip Erdogan following opinion polls being far tighter than he had hoped.If Mr Erdogan was re-elected, it would confirm the transformation of the Turkish political system from a parliamentary to a presidential one after a slim victory in favour of the move in a referendum in 2017.Muharrem Ince, a passionate politician from the secular Republican People\u0026rsquos Party (CHP), was at a huge rally in Ankara where he directly addressed his opponent.He said: \u0026ldquoTomorrow is the last evening.

The PM described the assessments as “very preliminary”.Our revelation last night reignited the bitter Whitehall wars as Brexiteers said it was proof of Boris Johnson’s claim that the Treasury is the “heart of Remain”.And it came less than 48 hours after Chancellor Philip Hammond was forced to deny his department was the “enemy of Brexit”.Ex-Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith told The Sun: “This will only fuel the widespread belief that far too many of the Treasury simply don’t want Brexit and are doing their level best to ensure it is damaged or stopped.”Jacob Rees-Mogg said: “This is proof the Treasury is obstructing Brexit.”At the time of the Brexit papers leak the leading Eurosceptic accused Treasury officials of “fiddling the figures” to make every EU exit scenario look bad.It reopens the damaging rift between Brexiteers and the Treasury.Just 24 hours earlier Philip Hammond angrily denied that the Treasury was the “enemy of Brexit”.In a public slap down of Mr Johnson, the Chancellor used a high profile speech at Mansion House on Thursday night to insist the Treasury was instead the “champion of prosperity for the British people outside the EU.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They’ve far too much to discuss among themselves.”Migration is plunging European politics into crisis again. German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s coalition is threatening to break apart over the issue.While in Italy, the new government is threatening to close its southern border — blocking migrant rescue ships from landing — and open its northern border, encouraging illegal migrants and asylum seekers to head north to Germany and Sweden.So worried is European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker that he is hosting a mini-summit tomorrow to try to find a solution to the migrant crisis which can help save Merkel’s political career.It is tempting to look at the EU in crisis and say that is why the UK is leaving. But this crisis is making it more difficult for Britain to get a reasonable Brexit deal.The European Commission is running the Brexit negotiations.Its priority is in defending the theology of the European Union, rather than finding practical solutions. As one leading figure in the Government laments to me, Brussels’ chief negotiator Michel Barnier “won’t budge off CETA (Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement) with Northern Ireland stuck in the customs union”.This kind of Canada-style free trade deal is regarded by the Government as inadequate.Mrs May and co have long hoped that the member states, nearly all of whose economies would be hurt by such a limited agreement, would intervene at some point and tell the Commission to engage more constructively with the UK. But this is happening all too rarely.One of the reasons is, in the words of one member of the Brexit inner Cabinet: “Only four national capitals are fully across Brexit.”Many of the countries that are most sympathetic to the UK don’t have the capacity to follow all of the issues concerned.Over the past few years, the key to any deal in Europe has been Merkel. She is not now going to ride to Britain’s rescue— as David Cameron found to his cost in the renegotiation.But the German Chancellor could push the Commission towards a slightly more pragmatic approach.However, she is now trying to keep her own governing coalition together, as well as come up with a deal with the French for eurozone reform, leaving next to no time for Brexit.I am told that when Brexit is discussed in meetings she is “visibly distracted”, turning to aides for advice far more frequently than she does on other issues.This situation is one of the many reasons why the Government should have prepared vigorously for no deal: A credible threat to walk away from the table if the Commission didn’t behave in a reasonable fashion would have got the member states’ attention.But Mrs May now must hope the EU can patch together some deal on migration and that the member states begin thinking seriously about what kind of post-Brexit relationship they want with this country.WHEN the Cabinet gathers at Chequers next month to thrash out the UK’s offer to the EU, one of the most contentious issues will be customs.The Brexit inner Cabinet is split between those who favour a so-called “new customs partnership” (NCP) with the EU – which would see the UK continue to apply EU tariffs after Brexit, with companies receiving a rebate if their goods stayed in Britain rather than heading to the continent – and those who advocate Max Fac, which would use technology to minimise border checks.Two Cabinet working groups are trying to find a way to make these ideas work. Neither group has had a decisive breakthrough yet. But I am told the Max Fac one is “not a million miles away” from a solution.The challenge for the PM is to make these plans acceptable to her own side, including David Davis and Liam Fox. One Brexit inner Cabinet member tells me: “She’s got to have David and Liam. If she doesn’t have them, then she has no solution.”Both Davis and Fox support the Max Fac option. But there are influential figures in No10 who remain convinced that NCP is the option to go for. They argue only NCP can help deal with the Irish border issue and get the Government through next month’s crucial Commons votes on the customs union. They warn: “No NCP, no Brexit.”The fear among Brexiteers is Mrs May will use this Chequers meeting to try to push through a modified version of NCP. They fear the reason the whole Cabinet will be present on the second day is to give Mrs May the numbers to do this if the Brexit inner Cabinet remains split on the issue.Doing this, though, would be extremely risky. It would leave Mrs May with a policy that neither her Brexit Secretary nor her International Trade Secretary support.THE Chancellor and the Defence Secretary aren’t just split over how much money the military should get, but what it should be spent on, too.One Cabinet ally of Philip Hammond’s complains that Gavin Williamson wants to “spend the money on uniformed officers when he should be spending it on robotics and the like”.Their view is that this would be a better response to the 21st-century security challenges Britain faces.But in truth, Britain needs both conventional and new, hi-tech forces if it is to respond to the variety of threats now out of there. That is why we MUST spend more on defence.Those close to Williamson point out that if the Government doesn’t increase the defence budget, our status as the leading military spender in Europe – upon which so much of our influence in the world depends – will be under threat as the French and the Germans increase their military budgets.NEXT week, Theresa May will give a speech setting out the Government’s post-Brexit industrial strategy.Key to this must be artificial intelligence, an area where we are one of the leading nations in the world.I understand that the importance of maintaining the UK’s edge in AI is what led to Mrs May accepting Home Secretary Sajid Javid and Digital Secretary Matt Hancock’s argument that visa rules for tech entrepreneurs must be relaxed.The countries that succeed at AI will end up defining this century.So any deal with the EU must preserve the UK’s ability to regulate these industries of the future in a way decided by us, not Brussels.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is staggering that the ­Government is still undecided on ­fundamental principles.But the Tories’ woes were hugely exacerbated by their election calamity, caused in part by Remainers hoping Labour would betray Brexit.That emboldened diehards in the Lords and Commons — operating alongside the lavishly-funded, slickly orchestrated campaign colluding with Brussels to annul the biggest vote in our history.Meanwhile the national conversation has degenerated into a tsunami of hate, chiefly from sanctimonious Remainers branding Leavers uneducated racists.How much better off we would all now be if on June 24, 2016 they had grudgingly accepted defeat and pledged instead to make the best of Brexit.In fairness, some Remainers did. TV’s Richard Madeley spoke for them recently when he said we now had a duty to see it through in full by leaving the single market and customs union.He was right. To pretend that Brexit can be “softened” to honour the substantial Remain vote — a nightmarish fudge which Boris Johnson warns of today — is simply dishonest. There is leaving and there is remaining. That’s it.Brussels has revelled in Britain tearing itself apart. Now it is sidetracked by its own problems. A deal looks miles off.Theresa May has only one path forward. At next month’s pivotal vote, she must defeat the backbench rebellion hoping to shackle us to a customs union restricting our trading future. That is not Brexit, as voters would quickly realise. It would reignite the Leave ­campaign with unprecedented ferocity.And the PM and her Cabinet must not be derailed by Remain-fanatic businesses muttering about pulling out. Previous such threats have proved bogus, like all those dire economic forecasts.Leaving may not be smooth in the short-term. That must not deter us.When the EU finally realises Brexit in full is inevitable maybe they will stop playing games and agree a deal.But if the Remain resistance succeeds in crippling Brexit, it will bring on chaos.Our current divisions will seem like happy hour. And it will be their fault.HEARTBREAKING, isn’t it, to see Argentina in disarray and the Germans wobbling at the World Cup?

I’m out of here.”Former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith has told Mrs May to turn the tables on “bullying” Eurocrats when she returns to Brussels this week.He believes she is in her strongest ­position yet to get them to discuss their relationship with Britain when we leave on March 29 next year.In the 15 months since Article 50 was triggered, they have refused to discuss trade while our own MPs argued among themselves.But Mrs May’s hand was strengthened last week after she saw off the rebels to get the EU Withdrawal Bill through ­Parliament.Tory MP Mr Duncan Smith warned she must show her mettle as she faces the biggest test of any PM in peacetime at next week’s Brussels showdown.He told The Sun on Sunday: “Theresa May now has the upper hand in these talks.They have been watching us fight among ourselves over Brexit for months and didn’t have to do anything because her position was so weak.“They knew there was an outside chance it wouldn’t happen, so they’ve dug in on all the practical stuff such as trade and bogged us down with other details.“But now it has been voted through. We are leaving. They cannot stop it.“I’ve advised Theresa to tell them bluntly to agree to talk about trade or she is leaving.“If they refuse to engage, she must have the resolve to get up and leave the table — making clear she will take our ­£40billion contribution with her.“Theresa must put her cards on the table and tell them she wants to talk about trade now.“If they tell her they don’t want to, she should put her business card on the table and say ‘Tell you what.There’s my ­number. Give me a buzz if you change your minds.Meanwhile, we’ve got nothing more to say to you’.“Then she should turn to her aides and say, ‘We can catch the ten past six if we hurry now.Can you get some cars because we’re on our way.We’ve got work to do. Nice to see you all. OK, guys. Take care. Goodbye!’“That will bring them to their senses rather quickly.“The 27 other EU countries are desperate for a deal so they can sell us their cars, cheeses and potato products.“They’ve tried to push us around for the past couple of years but Theresa has the upper hand now and she must show them who’s boss.”Slamming the way EU officials have treated Britain as “disgusting”, Mr Duncan Smith said: “Undiplomatic doesn’t begin to cover it.“They’ve done their level best to ­humiliate and be rude to us. They are meant to be our friends and allies.”Singling out chief negotiator Michel Barnier, European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker and ­European Parliament co-ordinator Guy Verhofstadt, he added: “Come this week, we can tell them their days of behaving like ­playground bullies are over.”He said Wednesday’s flagship vote was THE most significant bill passed in the Commons since the treaty to join the fledgling ­European Economic Community in 1973.Crucially, it removes any chance of Brexit being derailed and the clock really has begun ticking towards our departure in 278 days.Brexiteers now warn that the PM must finalise a deal by November, to leave time to clear it all by February.Mr Duncan Smith said: “She is in a stronger position than she’s been in for some months.Getting the most critical bit of legislation through last week means she goes to the European Council knowing our departure is now settled.“That means she is back in charge of the negotiation and there is no way they can stop Brexit.“Now it’s down to raw negotiation, and the question facing the EU is how much they want to have a good relationship.“We do, and the Prime Minister has been open about that.

BoJo declared: “We don’t want some bog roll Brexit – soft, yielding and seemingly infinitely long.”But Dr Fox said he’d be happy to let the process roll on a little longer, if it means making a clean break.He said: “What I wanted was that we were outside of the single market, the customs union and the European Court of Justice. That’s where I think we’re going to end up.“If we do it slightly more slowly in order to minimise any disruption, that’s fine by me. Having waited 40-odd years to leave the European Union, a few extra months doesn’t bother me if we‘re getting it right.”Dr Fox insists an extension to Article 50 to keep Britain in the EU beyond March 29 would be “politically unacceptable”. But on the second anniversary of the historic referendum, he said prolonging the implementation period beyond 2020 would not be a problem.The minister told Sky’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday: “If the transition period had to be extended for technical reasons with the backstop…and we already had the withdrawal agreement and future economic partnership agreed, I wouldn’t have a major problem with that.”He stressed that any extension must be “very time limited” and there must be a mechanism for Britain to pull out if we thought we were being kept in the EU against our will.The clash comes ahead of Theresa May’s trip to Brussels this week for her first showdown with EU chiefs since she saw off Brexit rebels to get the Withdrawal Bill through Parliament.Senior ministers have urged her to show she is prepared to play hardball and insist that talks no turn to our future trade relationship. Dr Fox warned EU negotiators would be unwise to think the PM is “bluffing” about the possibility of walking out without a deal.He told the BBC: “The Prime Minister has always said that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed and that no deal would be better than a bad deal.I think it’s essential, as we enter the next phase of the negotiations, that the European Union understands and believes it.Our negotiating partners would not be wise if they believed that the Prime Minister was bluffing.”The minister warned that the economic impact on EU countries would be severe if they failed to strike a deal.But he said staying in the single market would be unacceptable because it would imply continuation of free movement of people and staying under the jurisdiction of the European Court.Former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith today urges Mrs May to leave her business card on the table and walk away if EU chief rebuff he demands to talk trade.He told The Sun on Sunday: “She should say ‘Here’s my number.

Im so excited its actually happening.She had a US drivers license before obtaining a Saudi one and appeared comfortable at the wheel as she pulled up and parked.As for the male drivers on the road, she said: They were really supportive and cheering and smiling.In a few hours, she says shell drive herself to work for the first time in Saudi Arabia.Samira al-Ghamdi, 47, one of the first Saudi women to be issued with a driving licence, said: We are ready, and it will totally change our life.Saudi women with foreign licences only began converting them earlier this month, so the number of new drivers is expected to remain low at first.It will be some time before others learning to drive at new state-run schools are road ready, while some women still face resistance from conservative relatives.Many accustomed to using a private driver say they are reluctant to take on the Muslim kingdoms busy highways.Fayza al-Shammary, a 22-year-old saleswoman, said: I definitely wont like to drive.I like to be a princess with someone opening the car door for me and driving me anywhere.The change is part of sweeping reforms by the kings son Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who aims to transform the economy of the worlds top oil exporter.The lifting of the ban, which for years drew international condemnation, has been welcomed by Western allies as proof of a new progressive trend in Saudi Arabia.For nearly three decades, outspoken Saudi women and the men who supported them had called for women to have the right to drive.They faced arrest for defying the ban as women in other Muslim countries drove freely.In 1990, during the first driving campaign by activists, women who got behind the wheels of their cars in the capital, Riyadh, lost their jobs, faced severe stigmatisation and were barred from travel abroad for a year.Ultraconservatives in Saudi Arabia had long warned that allowing women to drive would lead to sin and expose women to harassment.Ahead of allowing women to drive, the kingdom passed a law against sexual harassment with up to five years prison for the most severe cases.Criticism against women driving has largely been muted since since King Salman announced last year that they would be allowed to drive.Simultaneously, however, at least 10 of the most outspoken supporters of womens rights were arrested just weeks before the ban was lifted."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT000414555491.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"royal wedding thomas markle morning suit pr meghan","story":"Thomas Markle, 73, had been set to walk his daughter down the aisle at Windsor Castle for her big day but was unable to attend after suffering a heart attack.Instead the suit was left on the peg at upmarket Chelsea outfitters Oliver Brown.That is until Johnno Spence visited the shop and picked up the semi-bespoke morning suit at a knock-down price of £2,000.Meghan, now the Duchess of Sussex, is said to have personally commissioned the company’s owner Kristian Robson to make several outfits for her father, not just the suit for the wedding.The list included three shirts with size 18 collars and double cuffs, in blue, yellow and white a navy blue weekend suit a single-breasted waistcoat and a set of tails.A source told The Daily : When Johnno walked in, the tailor said: We’ve got the perfect morning suit for you as well as a summer suit and three shirts for you if you want them.Spence is said to have paid £2,000 for the items, around half the normal price and proudly wore the morning suit to Ascot.Oliver Brown, established 35 years ago, is the official tailor of Royal Ascot, where a top hat and tails are compulsory for Royal Enclosure guests.Spences PR firm, JSC Communications counts jockey Ryan Moore, National Hunt rider Nico de Boinville and Champion Apprentice jockey Josephine Gordon as clients."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT000415655113.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"tory mp nusrat ghani inspirational muslims","story":"But we live in a fantastic country where you are not limited by the expectations set upon you at birth and where tolerance runs deep.We should be proud our society has remained open.My own example shows what we have achieved.In one generation of setting foot in this great country, I am helping lay foundations for future generations.The Sun on Sunday’s super coverage of Inspirational Muslims will no doubt challenge misconceptions but most of all will inspire readers to live to their full potential.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We know that over three-quarters of them find offers for sugary sweets and snacks at checkouts annoying.“It’s our job to give power to parents to make healthier choices and to make their life easier in doing so.”Last night the obesity plan received broad support.Alison Tedstone, chief nutritionist at Public Health England, said: “Having a takeaway or eating out is no longer a treat, it’s a regular part of everyday life, yet too often menus are information free zones.“Clear and consistent information on menus at the point of choice is the bold commitment needed to help families make healthier choices and avoid obesity-related health problems.”Some supermarkets already restrict sales to under-16s after calls from teachers and experts.Ministers must decide on a 16 or 18 age limit. Research shows the drinks can trigger unruly and dangerous behaviour.Caroline Cerny, of the Obesity Health Alliance, added: “The plan crucially addresses the issue of children being continually exposed to junk food adverts when they watch their favourite TV shows and when they go online.”Chris Askew, of Diabetes UK, said: “With one in three children either overweight or obese before they leave primary school, it’s clear that bold, decisive action needs to be taken. Being overweight as a child can significantly increase your risk of developing serious conditions like Type 2 diabetes in the future.”But Advertising Association chief Stephen Woodford said: “UK advertising rules are already among the strictest in the world.“International experience and independent research has shown advertising bans have little impact on the wider societal issues that drive obesity, which is caused by the interaction of many complex factors and requires a multi-faceted solution.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Today they do their socialising online – and like junk food, it’s highly addictive.“We’ve got to do something about this. That’s why we want schools to play a part in getting pupils in the habit of exercising regularly.”Mr Hunt who runs up to six miles, three times a week, said he wants to help parents to help their kids.“We’re not going to halve childhood obesity through government action alone. We can do a few things to help raise awareness but in the end parents have to take responsibility for the health of their children.“So part of this is helping parents to understand how critical their role is.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The National Crime Agency believes more than 1,000 gangs are operating hotlines. The NCA has at least 200 live operations in place to smash the rings. Each line can make \u0026pound5,000 a day – \u0026pound1.8million a year. The grim trade sees:  Children having drugs forced inside their bodies – known as “plugging” – and trafficked nationwide. Horrific videos of attacks and revenge beatings shared on social media to intimidate rivals and warn gang members wanting to break free. Recruits subjected to sexual abuse or forced into prostitution. Social media sites like Periscope used by gangsters “like CCTV” to keep tabs on youngsters out on the streets.   Junior Smart, who leads the SOS Project with the St Giles Trust, said: “People are saying this is happening in deprived areas with specific demographics. People expect it to be \u0026shytypically a black youth, hoodie up and wearing a manbag. “That’s not how it works. It can start with simply being offered drugs and within days they have debt bondage and are stuck in the criminal world. “Even middle class children are getting involved because their families have the means to pay off debts and gang leaders can earn cash. “People have been recruited from primary school age. Others have mental health problems, learning difficulties. Gangs hang around school gates and see those who are being bullied, alone and are easy targets. “They target youth hostels, referral units. It’s an immediate workforce for them. One of the biggest problems is children – thousands of them – not being reported when they go missing.” The revelations come just days after police seized a 10in hunting knife as they smashed a gang supplying heroin and crack cocaine from London’s East End to Ipswich, Suffolk. And in April gang leaders Mahad Yusuf, 21, and Fesal Mahamud, 20, were jailed for a total of 19 years for trafficking a teen from Enfield, North London, to Wales.  Kids are promised cash, a flashy lifestyle, friendship and respect. But once sucked in they are invited to share drugs – only to be landed with massive debts that they must work off. It is understood 5,000 children were picked up by authorities last year over fears they were forced into slavery. That was 35 per cent up in a year. The NCA has revealed grim details of sexual abuse, while politicians have told of their fears for trapped kids. Labour’s Ann Coffey, who chairs the All Party Parliamentary Group for Runaway and Missing Children and Adults, said: “The extent of the violence is new – and it’s reaching into almost every small town in the UK.” "},{"url":null,"title":"11 best spots uk watch","story":"Advertorial11 best spots in the UK to watch an amazing sunset this summerThis week marks the summer solstice – and is also the official start of summer. So what better time to explore the UK and take in some of the country’s most breathtaking bike rides?\u0026nbspShareByHolly Thatcher14:24, 22 JUN 2018Updated21:07, 23 JUN 2018Advertorial (Image: Getty)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailWe\u0027ve been blessed with some decent weather already in 2018 - but this week is when summer *officially* begins. June 21, the summer solstice in the Northern Hemisphere, is the longest day in the year - affording us approximately 17 hours of daylight. Technically, this also means that the nights will start drawing in again now - so there\u0027s really no time like the present to get out and explore the great outdoors on some of the country’s most breathtaking bike rides. We\u0027ve taken a look around the UK to find the best places to watch the sun setting. 1. Museum of Scottish Lighthouses, Fraserburgh, Scotland  A small village called Maud in Aberdeenshire offers a starting place for a traffic-free cycle to the coast. If you\u0027re in the mood to learn then head to the Museum of Scottish Lighthouses in Fraserburgh. The sun will set at around 10.12pm this week in this part of Scotland, so you\u0027ve got loads of time to enjoy the start of the summer. Bike need replacing?   If your existing bike needs replacing, you\u0027ll want something efficient and speedy for the roads - like the Carrera Parva Hybrid bike , which comes in versions for both men and women and is now just \u0026pound210 (a saving of \u0026pound90). And if you don\u0027t need a new bike, why not have yours checked over before setting off. Like any mode of transport your bike needs to be looked after and regularly checked for wear and tear. Halfords offers a 32-point Free Bike Check which includes:  Frame, saddle and handlebar Wheels including tyres, rims, spokes and hubs Brake system including levers, calipers, pads and cables / hoses Drivetrain including gears, levers, chain, bottom bracket, cranks and cables  2. The Eden Project, Cornwall   Why not spend the day enjoying the amazing sights at the Eden Project? Best of all, if you arrive by bike you\u0027ll get a discount on entry. The sun sets on Eden at around 9:30pm on the solstice. Bear in mind though that the Eden Project shuts at 6pm, so you\u0027ll need to watch the sun go down somewhere nearby.  Get there in style on the Carrera Subway 1 Hybrid Bike , \u0026pound300. With easy to use 24 speed Shimano gearing, your effort for building speed will be minimised on all terrains, while its lightweight aluminium frame means you can quickly and efficiently ride to your destination. Camping out?   Planning to camp? Be sure you book in advance as you won\u0027t want to be without a pitch. Croft Farm Holiday Park is just a mile from the Eden Project and three miles from the beach. Pentewan Sands is also nearby and boasts amazing family facilities - as well as the nearby Pentewan Cycle Trail. Consider taking a Halfords Vis A Vis 4 Person Tent with you, which is currently reduced to just \u0026pound60, (was \u0026pound150, save \u0026pound90). The simple tunnel design is easy to pitch in approximately 20 minutes. With two separate bedrooms and a living area, it\u0027s perfect for families or groups of friends. For additional comfort pack an Urban Escape Folding Table And Bench Set , \u0026pound40 (was \u0026pound50, save \u0026pound10) which folds down into a single carry case to make it easy to transport and store.  3. Pembrokeshire Coast National Park, Wales  The Pembrokeshire Coast Path is an absolutely beautiful part of Wales and a stunning place to watch the sun go down. There are loads of campsites in the area, including some unique places to stay. There are plenty of bike routes too, with some offering traffic-free options if you want a more peaceful ride. In Pembrokeshire you can expect the sun to set around 9:39pm. Why not try..   The Boardman ADV 8.8 Adventure Bike , \u0026pound750, is a bike truly made to help you explore new possibilities. This bike is adept at riding in comfort on roads but really excels when you want to get off the beaten track.   4. White Nancy, Cheshire   Located on Kerridge Hill, White Nancy is a local landmark from which you can see all around the area, from Wales to the west and the Pennines to the north. From time to time White Nancy is painted to look like other things, like a Christmas pudding or with Olympic rings when London hosted in 2012. The sun will set over White Nancy at around 9:36 this week. Need to drive?  Heading further afield to enjoy the sunny days? If you\u0027re packing up the whole family into the car for a camping trip, make sure it\u0027s in good running order first. A Free Car Check performed by Halfords experts will put your mind at rest. Book online or just pop in to your local Halfords store and trained colleagues will carry out a free car bulb check and check your battery, wiper blades, engine oil level and air conditioning, and check for any windscreen chips. They\u0027ll even give you a free screenwash top-up too.  If you\u0027re making an unfamiliar journey, don\u0027t forget to get the Garmin Drive Sat Nav , \u0026pound79.99 (was \u0026pound99.99, save \u0026pound20.99). With lifetime map updates you\u0027re never going to find yourself driving down a newly-closed street or down a disused road. 5. Edinburgh Castle, Scotland  There are few places that are as stunning as Edinburgh Castle, located atop Castle Rock. The views of Edinburgh from the castle are amazing, and a great place to watch the end of the day roll around. Sunset here will take place at 9:58pm. 6. Hampstead Heath, London  The scenery on Hampstead Heath always pleases the eye. This amazing part of London has views of every landmark you could hope for and it\u0027s a wonderful place to watch the sun go down. This will happen at around 9:18pm in the capital.   7. Osborne House, Isle of Wight   The home of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert is quite a sight to see. Accessible by bike (and ferry, if you\u0027re not an island resident), it\u0027s the ideal place to see during the day before you settle down somewhere to watch the sunset. If you\u0027re up for the cycle, Shanklin Chine on the west of the island is well worth an evening visit.  Do it with ease - and classic style - on the Pendleton Somerby Electric Hybrid Bike , \u0026pound750. With added electrically powered pedal assistance, it delivers 40 - 50 miles of range through a rear hub motor with speed sensor. This extra power is enough to guarantee effortless rides, taking the strain out of hills and making moving off from a standstill much easier. If you prefer, this bike is also available in a non electric version and in a range of colours - we love the mint green ! The sunset starts at 9:18pm near Osborne House and 9:17pm in Shanklin Chine.  8. Ness Point, Lowestoft    Ness Point is the UK\u0027s most easterly point. This makes it a great place to ride to on National Cycle Route 1. Make yourself comfortable on the Halfords XL Waterproof Picnic Blanket , \u0026pound10 (half price) and watch the waves crash in as the sun goes down. Sunset is 9:16 at the UK\u0027s most easterly point.  9. Blackpool Pleasure Beach, Lancashire   With plenty of places to cycle in the area you could have an amazing day out in Blackpool. Start with a ride to the Pleasure Beach, and have some fun with the kids (or without them!) on the roller coasters. When all that\u0027s done you can have fish and chips while the sun sets on another day. The sun will go set at around 9:43 in Blackpool.  10. Cotswolds, England  Spread over six counties there\u0027s a lot to see in the Cotswolds. Consider taking a ride through the picturesque Castle Combe to take in the amazing houses and the stunning market square. The sun sets on this beautiful village at 9:26pm  Find your way by car - and beat the traffic   If you\u0027re driving to somewhere new then why not add a sat nav to your car? The TomTom GO 6200 , \u0026pound270, (was \u0026pound339.99, save \u0026pound69.99) adds real-time traffic information to the navigational benefits of a sat nav (smartphone required for this feature).   11.

We surveyed every local authority to compile the list of shame – the streets that drew the most complaints. Our research was carried out after a study showed roads in Britain are worse than in Chile, Oman and Peru. And they are deadly. Between 2007 and 2016, 22 cyclists were killed and 368 were \u0026shyseriously injured due to crumbling roads, with the victim toll rising. Last year an inquest heard Roger Hamer, 83, died from severe brain \u0026shyinjuries after being flung off his bike when it hit a pothole in Ramsbottom, Greater Manchester.  We found the country’s worst road is Mellor Brook Bypass near Balderstone, Lancs. Motorists and cyclists reported it to the council 545 times in one year. Freedom of Information requests show Seven Hills Road in Elmbridge, Surrey, caused the second highest number of complaints, with 216 reported. Hundreds of drivers signed a petition demanding that the county council resurfaced it. One resident said they had seen FIVE different cars changing tyres at the \u0026shyroadside, adding: “I will be avoiding this road until it is repaired.”  Another motorist said: “Incredibly dangerous trying to avoid huge, deep potholes, having to veer into oncoming traffic. Fed up with damage to my car. “Are they waiting for another needless death? Stop treating us with contempt.” Shocked drivers are hitting potholes and ruining tyres and their cars’ \u0026shysuspensions, steering and underbodies, or losing control and having crashes. Edmund King, the president of the AA, said our investigation shows that right across the country, “our potholed roads are a national disgrace”, and are “fast becoming a national emergency”.  He said: “We are rescuing record numbers of drivers whose vehicles are damaged by potholes. Insurance claims for damage caused by potholes is soaring. “The lack of \u0026shyinvestment on local roads means highway authorities are doing little more than papering over cracks, with drivers picking up the pieces.” He said February’s Beast from the East had made it worse – but was simply exposing years of \u0026shyunderinvestment by cash-strapped councils.  In the first four months of 2018, AA Insurance received more pothole claims than in the  whole of 2017.   Our probe comes after the Asphalt Industry Alliance revealed 24,500 miles of local roads will need to be shut for repairs in the next year – and it would take at least 14years to clear the backlog, costing \u0026pound9.3billion. A separate report by Cycling UK found local authorities have forked out \u0026pound43.4million in compensation and legal costs due to potholes over the past five years. Sam Jones, of Cycling UK, said: “Before spending \u0026pound15billion on new motorways and trunk roads, let’s fix the roads we use every day and are essential for us to get to work and drop the kids off at school.” National roads are to get 52 times more government funding by 2020 compared to local roads. Councillor Martin Tett, of the LocalGovernment \u0026shyAssociation, said: “Only long-term, consistent and fairer investment in local roads can let councils embark on the improvements so desperately needed.” "},{"url":null,"title":"campaigning mum reveals how talked","story":"NewsCampaigning mum reveals how she talked cops round after being arrested for medical cannabisCallie Blackwell says she told police she\u0027ll keep breaking the law as lives depend on it\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByKaren Rockett21:30, 23 JUN 2018NewsCallie gave cannabis oil to son Deryn\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA campaigning mum talked her way out of a cell after convincing police cannabis should be legal for medical use. Callie Blackwell, 38, was arrested after being seen holding a cannabis plant at a Westminster protest. She has been lobbying for the Class B drug to be allowed as a medicine since her son made a miracle recovery after she gave him liquid cannabis.  Today she continues to break the law by helping parents of sick children get access to medical cannabis through Bud Buddies UK.   Callie revealed she was arrested in February by three officers on suspicion of cultivating cannabis and held at London’s Charing Cross police station for six hours. She said: “I was like: ‘If you’re going to keep me here, I’ll tell you everything I know about cannabis’. “By the end of it they were like: ‘Just go, this is ridiculous’. They didn\u0027t even caution me. “I said to them: ‘Well what happens when I do this again?’ and they said I’d probably get a caution. “I told them I’m going to keep breaking the law because lives depend on it.”   Callie’s son Deryn was 14 when he was given days to live after four bone marrow transplants failed to halt his leukaemia . Two months after the final op, Callie risked jail by secretly giving Deryn liquid cannabis.  After five days his new bone marrow finally started to make blood cells. His immune system recovered and Deryn is now a healthy 18-year-old trainee chef. His mum was speaking in the wake of the row over Billy Caldwell, 12, of Co Tyrone, Ulster – who has cannabis oil to control seizures.

Former school pal and footie team-mate Luke Robinson has \u0026shyrevealed the England skipper – at the time sporting a David Beckham mohican – told him he was going to win the World Cup one day.  Speaking of Harry’s dream ahead of tomorrow’s Panama clash, Luke said: “He loved England and even then one of his biggest dreams was to play for England and win the World Cup. We’d watch the World Cup together and he was always a very proud England fan. “During the 2002 World Cup, Harry had his England shirt with Beckham on the back and the Beckham mohican. “He was so passionate, he was devastated when we went out.”  Luke, 24, was with Harry when he lifted the Essex \u0026amp Waltham Forest District Cup as a 12-year-old in 2006. Now he, like the rest of the \u0026shynation, hopes Harry will lift the coveted FIFA World Cup Trophy on July 15. And teacher Luke said if Harry does win the \u0026shyultimate prize, it will be his proudest \u0026shymoment. He said: “I remember once when Brazil were playing and they had the likes of Ronaldinho, Ronaldo and Roberto Carlos – some of my \u0026shyfavourite players. “I was saying, ‘I’d love to play for Brazil!’. But Harry was like, ‘No, it’s got to be England! I’d love to play for England. That’s the country! That’s the thing!’. He’s that type of guy, England and proud.”  On Harry’s dedication, he said: “Everything was football. If he wasn’t watching football, he was speaking about football, playing football in the park or playing it on the computer. He did well at school and was good at other sports, like cricket, but it was football all day, every day. “In catering class, we had to bring a recipe and make a meal. He’d get a recipe from his chef at Tottenham and cook that so it was healthy. “He’s massive now but at school he was five foot eight or nine, and podgy. He shot up at 16 or 17. He did running and trained three or four times a week. By 16 or 17 he was fit as a fiddle. He put in years of dedication.”  Harry got England off to a flying start last Monday, scoring both goals in a dramatic 2-1 win against Tunisia – and Luke said the display was classic Kane. He said: “Back in school we knew if we needed a goal Harry could always get it. He’s still that sort of player now and the way he popped up with the winner against Tunisia was like back in his schooldays. I don’t see why he can’t win the golden boot.” Harry, 24, leads the line again today against minnows Panama. England’s second Group G game kicks off in Nizhny Novgorod, western Russia, at 1pm our time.  And someone else tipping him to go all the way is Ian Marshall, the chairman of Harry’s first team, Ridgeway Rovers – where Beckham also started out. And he said: “I bet if Harry won the World Cup he’d come back and see us with it. He’s a class act and we’re so proud. For a club like us to have two England captains in Harry and David, it’s something to shout about.” Meanwhile, England is set for a \u0026pound382million party as it cheers on Harry and his boys today.  Retail experts reckon \u0026pound65million will be spent in pubs, cafes and restaurants and \u0026pound151million will go on food and drink at home. Some \u0026pound20million will go on flags and souvenirs, \u0026pound68million on shirts and \u0026pound67million on TVs, website VoucherCodes and the Centre for Retail Research said.  Tesco expects to sell 140 million bottles and cans of beer. The chain’s booze boss Rob Cooke said: “There’s a real party atmosphere.”  Big brother\u0027s watching you Harry Kane has his biggest fan cheering him on in Russia – his lookalike older brother Charlie.

Police investigating the clip served three men with notices under the 1989 Football Spectators Act. Michael Herbert, 57, appeared at Leicester Magistrates\u0027 Court on Saturday, where he was handed a five-year football banning order, the National Police Chiefs\u0027 Council (NPCC) said. Two other men, aged 52 and 58, appeared at Leeds Magistrates\u0027 Court, where the case was adjourned until Tuesday.

The southern Russian city, which was the venue of England\u0027s 2-1 win over Tunisia, was formerly known as Stalingrad - the site of one of the bloodiest battles in history when Soviet soldiers repelled Hitler\u0027s army during the Second World War. Last Wednesday, a spokesman for the FA said: We strongly condemn the actions of the people in this video. We are working with the relevant authorities, including the UK police investigations team, who are making inquiries to identify the individuals involved and take appropriate action. The disgraceful conduct of the individuals in this video does not represent the values of the majority of English football fans supporting the team in Russia.

But a getaway to Australia for a family wedding turned into a bit of a nightmare for a mother from the UK.  A woman, going by the name Ashley W, shared her story on Netmums , revealing how she had spent \u0026pound4,000 on flights for her family to attend her cousin\u0027s wedding down under.   But when they arrived, her family told her she would have to find a babysitter for her five-month-old daughter as children weren\u0027t invited.  The mum says she had known about the nuptials for a year and during that time no one had mentioned that her baby wouldn\u0027t be welcome at the ceremony.  It wasn\u0027t until the official invitation turned up three weeks before the big day, that she discovered there was going to be a problem. By this point it was too late, as she\u0027d already booked flights for her family. She said: My cousin invited us to his wedding in Australia with 12 months notice. Sent us an email with the date no further info. My daughter is five months old. So my family said we would attend and we bought the flights.  She added: I chased for the actual invitation about 100 times and eventually it arrived three weeks before we flew. The invite said no children. I flagged that they really should have mentioned this before I bought the flight. When they arrived in Australia, her family weren\u0027t impressed that she had brought the child along and suggested she find a babysitter. She continued: Am I being unreasonable to think it\u0027s a joke they can\u0027t make an exception for a breastfeed baby flying from England?  Don\u0027t have kids at your wedding, no problem. Don\u0027t make me spend \u0026pound4k on flights and accommodation to be told that my baby can\u0027t come. Other mums commented on the post that they would be furious if put in a similar position. One user said: OMG that\u0027s ridiculous! You\u0027re flying to the other side of the world... I personally wouldn\u0027t let strangers look after my child. I\u0027d be fuming too! I totally get the no child thing, I really do, but this is definitely an exception.

It looked like a bowl cut. Once my mum stopped laughing at me I said to her \u0027you might as well have put a bowl round my head and saved me \u0026pound10\u0027. Cleaner Chris filmed a video raging about his barnet and posted it on social media. In the video he can be seen holding his phone to his face and lamenting his locks.  Chris can be heard saying: Right guys, went down [to] Cleckheaton yesterday for my hair cutting. I went down to Smart Cuts, [it] cost me a tenner, look at the state of this. Give me a little shave on the beard as well that\u0027s why it was a tenner. Short back and sides and a trim on the top, that\u0027s all I asked for. Now you can see it there, look at the state of that. So if you want to look like Lloyd off Dumb and Dumber and pay a tenner for it, get yourself down to Smart Cuts, absolutely garbage.  Two days later his trained hairdresser aunty Janene Crossley, 47, spent 20 minutes blending the style and Chris said he is now starting to see the funny side of it. Chris said: When I first shared the video there was no funny intention, it was just to show people. Next thing I know people are commenting and liking it and phone wouldn\u0027t stop pinging for two days, everybody was laughing at it. Chris said the hair cut fiasco started when he tried a different barbers for the first time. The dad of two said: I normally go to a different hairdressers but the one I usually go to was busy and there weren\u0027t a lot of people there. I tried this barbershop instead and went in for a short, back and sides. I don\u0027t tend to style my hair, I only do that when I go out. I just keep it kept cut short and neat so that it looks good at work and brush it to the side. I was in there for about 15 minutes and as he was cutting and shaving round the side of my head he kept brushing it into the style I have, it looked nice and neat. When I got home later that day I had a shower and the following day got up early and that\u0027s when I saw what it looked like. I just couldn\u0027t believe my hair, they\u0027d messed it up. My mum\u0027s not a professional but she could have done a better job with a bowl. I looked an absolute idiot.

The UK will be warmer than 28C in Tahiti, French Polynesia, as even the north braces itself for all-time record 31C highs. A weather map for Thursday shows the hot high-altitude air in orange and red.  After a marvellous Midsummer\u0027s Day tomorrow at 27C, the Met Office forecasts 30C by Tuesday and highs of around 33C on Wednesday and Thursday.  But up to 35C has been predicted for the south by The Weather Outlook as high pressure builds and hot air blows in from Spain, as seen in the weather map.  The Weather Outlook forecaster Brian Gaze said: It\u0027s a marvellous Midsummer\u0027s Day for most of Britain. Computer models show 35C isn\u0027t out of the question from midweek as temperatures continue to rise amid a Spanish plume of warm air. Temperatures could reach higher than Britain\u0027s hottest day since the 36.7C on July 1, 2015, at Heathrow, London, recorded by the Met Office.  The Met Office said Northern Ireland could break its 30.8C all-time temperature record, set on June 30, 1976, at Knockarevan in Co Fermanagh, and July 12, 1983, at Shaw\u0027s Bridge, Belfast. Met Office forecaster Alex Burkill said: It\u0027s already warm in the south and will be hot and sunny everywhere in the UK by Tuesday, with high pressure. Midweek could see the low 30s - so 30C to 33C - in the south. And it will be hot right up to the north of the UK, with a chance Northern Ireland could beat its all-time maximum temperature record of 30.8C.

Mark Tewdwr-Jones has sparked a furious debate about where the north-south divide really lies in the UK. The academic has drawn a new map which lumps the northern cities in with London and the Home Counties. Prof Tewdwr-Jones, a professor of town planning, says Manchester, Leeds and Sheffield can’t be classed as northern because they are influenced so much by the capital, the Manchester Evening News reports.   “There are several ways you could define a northern region - but perhaps the most pertinent question is where does London end?” he asks. “My map is a northern area defined as ‘not London,’ where London’s sphere of influence extends over most of the country - determined by two-hour commuting patterns which is becoming the norm.” Professor Tewdwr-Jones, who is chair of town planning at Newcastle University and has advised ministers on planning, land use and housing issues, argues that policymakers should adopt a more ‘nuanced’ view of what constitutes the North.

Monalisa Perez, then 19 and pregnant with her second child, was advised by Pedro Ruiz, 22, he would be shielded by a thick book as she took aim from close range. But the stunt went horribly wrong and the bullet went straight through the 1.5-inch book and into Ruiz\u0027s chest, fatally wounding him. Dramatic footage newly released shows him encouraging his terrified girlfriend to pull the trigger, with a bullet inside he says can travel the length of three football pitches. In a transcript of the moments leading up to the shooting, Perez says: “Babe, I’m not doing this, I can’t.” “I don’t want to be responsible,” she adds.   But according to local reports , Pedro tells her: “You won’t as long as you hit the book, as long as you hit the book you’ll be fine. Come on. The batteries gonna die on it. Come closer.”  Before she pulled the trigger, transcripts showed she said: I can\u0027t do it babe. I\u0027m so scared.  Babe, if I kill you what\u0027s gonna happen to my life. Like, no this isn\u0027t okay, she continued, the Daily Mail reports.  Eventually Perez pulled the trigger that ended Ruiz\u0027s life. Ruiz had introduced the video by saying his YouTube channel would have crazy stuff in it. Here I have my girlfriend Monalisa to help me out with my first video, a video shows him saying. So babe, let\u0027s go ahead and show them what we have in store, he said as she showed off a 50 caliber desert eagle gun placed on a red cushion.  He explains in the clip that he\u0027s going to ask Perez to \u0027clip the button\u0027 and she looks at him nervously asking is it hard to which he replies no, it\u0027s a button. It\u0027s basically a canon in your hand going off, he describes. Ruiz shows off how big both the gun and the bullet are in the footage. He says if he snaps his fingers the bullet could travel more than three football fields in length.  The point of this video is I really want to see if a 50 caliber bullet can go through a book, he says. I\u0027m going to stand behind it, and Monalisa is going to shoot it, hoping she hits the book. Hoping she hits the book and not me, but the most trustworthy person that I trust in this world is my girlfriend, Monalisa, so if I\u0027m going to die, I\u0027m pretty much ready to go to heaven right now. If I die I\u0027ll be ready for Jesus. He probably won\u0027t accept me into the gates because of how stupid this is but I have confidence my girlfriend will hit the book and not me.

It was, of course, ever thus when predicting what may be in store for a football club.On the pitch, however good the squad may look, successful results can never be taken for granted.The season just ended is an example of that. While it would not be realistic to expect Dundee to finish in the top four, there was reason to believe the players should have been good enough to have mounted a serious challenge to make the Premiership’s top six.That they didn’t was disappointing but, despite some complaint about that, the reality of a club the size of Dundee is that any campaign that ends with them still in the top division has to be acceptable.The hope has to be that, with the right additions, next term will see that top-six challenge materialise.If it does, it can become a regular occurrence.As for the new stadium, it goes back to that phrase – seeing will be believing.The plans are impressive and the feeling the best bet for the future is to move away from Dens, home for the last 119 years but now ageing and in many ways impractical, is a sensible one.But the aim was the first spade would be in the ground at what’s been dubbed “Nou Campy” just north of the Kingsway and adjacent to Camperdown Park at some point this summer.Yes, there’s another couple of months to go before that becomes a false promise but, with no final planning permission in place as yet, time is running out.Of course, even if that’s what comes to pass, it doesn’t mean the stadium won’t be built.As we’ve seen up the coast at Aberdeen, such projects can be delayed, delayed and delayed again.If Nou Campy never gets off the ground, it doesn’t have to follow the club will be plunged into the latest of what down the years have been many crises.For many fans, wherever the team is playing, so long as it continues to be backed by the Keyes cash and is riding high in the Premiership, that bright future will have arrived.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b2a29b42d531-435x564.jpg ","title":"125 years of dundee fc four of the very best to have pulled on dark blue","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFor what is a mid-sized club by Scottish standards, over their history it’s fair to say Dundee have punched well above their weight when it comes to producing and attracting top talent.In today\u0026#8217s look down memory lane, as we celebrate their 125th birthday, we highlight the very best of what has been a quality crop.Billy Steel: However long there is a Dundee FC, no list of the club’s greatest performers will ever be complete without the name Billy Steel.When director/manager George Anderson snapped the Scottish international inside-forward up from Derby County for a record £22,500 in September 1950, it went down as one of the transfer coups of the decade.Regarded as world class but known for being difficult to manage, Steel repaid the faith Anderson had shown in him and, in the next four years, would inspire Dundee to two League Cups.Steel left Dens in 1954 when he quit the senior game aged just 31. He moved to America where he died in 1982 but, 36 years later, remains regarded as one of Scotland’s greatest players.Claudio Caniggia: It was a case of 1950 and Billy Steel all over again when, in October 2000, Dundee sent tremors through the football world by announcing the signing of Argentine World Cup star Claudio Caniggia.In desperate need of a replacement for injured striker Fabian Caballero, the Dee’s Italian manager Ivano Bonetti used his Serie A connections and fixed up Caniggia, a former Roma team-mate of his brother and assistant Dario.In the end, the man who was Diego Maradona’s favourite strike partner for Argentina did not stay long at Dens Park, making just 21 league appearances and scoring seven goals, before heading for Rangers at the end of the 2000/01 campaign.Both for his performances and the gentlemanly way he conducted himself off the park, the impact he had on Dundee was considerably greater than the time he spent at Dens Park.Alan Gilzean: If there’s a debate over who the best-ever Dundee player is, when to comes to putting the ball in the net there can be no argument.Although down the years the club can boast some prolific scorers, there never has been, and is never likely to be, anyone who could match the ability of the legendary Alan Gilzean.Over 40 years after his playing career with the Dark Blues and then Spurs came to an end, those who saw him or played with or against him still regard him as being a world class centre-forward.Born in Coupar Angus, Dundee were his first senior club. He score an unequalled total of 169 goals for them and won the league in 1961/62 before being transferred to Spurs, where he enjoys similar legendary status, in 1964.Doug Cowie: The sands of time mean in some ways he is the forgotten man of Dundee greats but never to those who saw or played alongside Doug Cowie.Signed by George Anderson in 1945, over the next 16 years the Aberdonian would make a record 446 appearances, win two League Cups and also appear in two World Cups for Scotland.Cowie left Dens at the end of the season before the club won the championship but many of those who played in the side that clinched the title have often referred to the influence he had over their development on the pitch.As well as nurture it, Cowie would go on to show himself as an adept talent spotter. Once his playing days were over he worked for Dundee United and, along with fellow-scout Davie Small, was credited by Jim McLean as being instrumental in unearthing many of the local players who went on to bring the league flag to Tannadice in 1983.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/06/image.jpg1_.741936.jpg ","title":"125 years of dundee fc humble claudio caniggia was even better off pitch barry smith","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA Dundee legend in his own right, Barry Smith captained the club for nine years before returning as manager in 2010.During that time he saw some of the best and some of the worst times in the history of the club.Among the best, however, was playing alongside some top-quality team-mates.And one name that stands out is Claudio Caniggia.Barry said: “I grew up watching guys like him play in World Cups, so I feel really fortunate to have played with Caniggia.“What made him stand out is, no matter how much he had done in the game before, he was so humble and had great humility.“What stood out for me is how he took time to help out the younger lads in training. Guys like Steven Milne and Graham Bayne owe a lot to him.“That was just the type of guy he is, very humble, no airs and graces and he took a lot of time with younger players that a lot of other players wouldn’t.“The first time he came in, he immediately made sure he was part of the team.“He didn’t just stand around, he got involved straight away.“Claudio didn’t want to be a superstar or anything, just wanted to be part of a team. His attitude was superb.“A lot of players could take a lesson from him. Every day he knew he still had to work hard.“I remember him as much off the park as on it because he was so good on the training ground.”Barry had another name he’d stick into the mix from his time at Dundee.“Georgi Nemsadze was the most technically gifted player I played with,” he added.“I knew when I won the ball, I could give it to him no problem.“I was very lucky to play alongside him.“I have to say, those guys did what they did because there were other guys in the team doing their jobs.“Guys like Lee Wilkie, Gavin Rae and me were the workhorses for the team and we allowed the players with all the flair to go and do their stuff.”As manager, Barry had to deal with some of the darkest times at Dens as the club headed into a second administration – the people at the club, however, managed to turn that time into one of the best at Dundee with the ‘Deefiant’ season.He added: “I do believe if the team hadn’t stayed up someone would have shut the doors at Dens.“Collectively everyone responded, the coaching staff, office staff, players and definitely the fans rallied around the club.“Though it was a really negative time, we turned it into a positive one which then led to promotion the following year.“I don’t like to single anybody out but Robert Douglas played a massive part.“It’s difficult to say just how much he helped gelling the players together.“All the players and their wives and families were invited round to his all the time and that really generated the team spirit.“He really made sure the team was a real team and that’s not even talking about what he did on the park.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b2b7163e9578-397x564.jpg ","title":"125 years of dundee fc jocky scott recalls winning league cup against celtic","story":"\t\t\t\t\tIn their 125 years, Dundee have five major trophies in their cabinet and, with almost 45 years since they last lifted silverware, it shows just how difficult it is to be top dog.Just like today, back in 1973, when the Dark Blues lifted their last trophy, managing to battle past the Old Firm was one of the biggest hurdles.Dundee legend Jocky Scott was part of the 1973 League Cup-winning side and says meeting Celtic in the final, rather than the semi, gave the side a completely different mindset going into the game at Hampden.Between 1969 and 1977, Dundee lost five Scottish Cup semi-finals to the Hoops. However, the one time they met them in a final they ran out 1-0 winners in December 1973.Jocky said: “The team that won the League Cup was a very good side.“Unfortunately, we couldn’t do more in the Scottish Cup because we kept meeting Celtic in the semi-final – we just couldn’t beat them.“When Rangers and Celtic are dominant, it’s very difficult. You’ve got to catch them on a bad day or get them in a final where you are on a hiding to nothing and just go out and play.“A semi-final is the worst game of all.“You’re within touching distance of the final but you’re not there yet.“Some players don’t handle that too well but then can handle a final.“Around 1973, we’d played Celtic in a few semi-finals and they were all very close games.“We were never really hammered in any of them but they just had that wee bit more experience of playing in semi-finals and winning them.“We had experience of losing semi-finals.“Psychologically that’s a big thing, whereas when you get to a final it’s different.“We were, obviously, the underdogs – with that there’s nothing to lose, just go out and play, do your best and hope it’s good enough.“You need wee breaks, too, and we got them.”In the midst of the miner’s strike, the 1973 final was an eerie affair with just 27,974 spectators braving the snowy conditions.Striker Gordon Wallace got the all-important goal late on to secure the trophy for the Dark Blues.Scott added: “Rab Wilson played it up to Gordon Wallace.“He had Pat McCluskey at his back but he took it down on his chest and in one movement hit it low into the corner.“The goalie was taken by surprise with the quickness Gordon hit it.“It was a typical striker’s goal, instinctive, didn’t think – bang.“We scored and went ahead – I don’t think we did that in any of the semi-finals we played, we were always having to fight back. We scored first and had something to build on.“It wasn’t like we scored and sat back and defended for 60 minutes or we were fortunate or anything.“We’d had a go at them, played well in defence and attack. It wasn’t a smash-and-grab win, we deserved it.“We were good enough to go on and win more trophies but, unfortunately, we didn’t.

A one-sided 5-1 success over Motherwell at Ibrox in the last four set up a clash with Rangers at Hampden. The Gers were favourites but this was a Dundee side that feared no one. They showed that with a 3-2 victory.After failing to live up to being favourites when they faced Motherwell in the Scottish Cup Final later that season, the next campaign saw them again win the League Cup.This time they cruised a group made up of Clyde, Raith and Airdrie and, although they lost the first leg in the quarters against Stirling Albion 3-1, back at Dens a 5-0 success saw them through.Hibs were then taken care of in the semis and the final against Kilmarnock was a fairly routine affair, a Bobby Flavell double being enough retain the trophy.Nine years later came Dundee’s most glorious day when, under the guidance of Bob Shankly, a fantastic season was crowned by clinching the club’s only league title.It came at Muirton Park, where a 3-0 win over St Johnstone – who were relegated – saw them beat off the challenge of Rangers in what, until that final day, had been a nip-and-tuck race.The league was won with the use of just 15 players, though with the likes of Alan Gilzean, Alex Hamilton, Ian Ure, Andy Penman and skipper Bobby Cox in the line-up, it was a special team.It was back to the League Cup for the last major success and, if the 1973 triumph is not the most talked about of the five, it was a laudable achievement. It came during the time of the three-day week and power cuts, meaning the final had an early kick-off to save power, so attracted a crowd of just 27,974.The game was decided by a solitary late goal from the prolific Gordon Wallace and if many reports make it sound forgettable, it should be remembered victory was over a Hoops side that would go on to reach the European Cup semi-finals.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/976302492.jpg-279x180.jpg ","title":"argentina cant expect messi to carry them says dundee hero caniggia","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFormer Dundee star Claudio Caniggia has urged the current Argentina side not to be a one-man team in Russia this summer.The Argentines got their World Cup campaign under way on Saturday against Iceland but could only manage a draw.Today they face Croatia and will hope to kick-start their campaign.Caniggia went to three World Cups – almost returning for a fourth at the age of 42 in 2010 – and arrived to much fanfare at Dundee in 2000.He says his country’s best chance of winning it all for the first time since 1986 is if Lionel Messi’s supporting cast step up to the plate.The 51-year-old rose to international prominence during the 1990 World Cup in Italy alongside Argentina great Diego Maradona and insists the difference between that side and today’s is the expectation on the other players.Caniggia said: “Messi doesn’t get the same support from his team-mates Maradona did.“I knew Maradona was the complete footballing genius but I didn’t think about keeping up with him. Never.“Every player has a responsibility, even those who don’t play much.“You can’t give all the responsibility to Messi, because then what’s the point of you being there?“Imagine if I’d thought in 1990 the world champions had to carry me through. No! Carry us? We’re in it together.“I’m Argentina’s striker and I have to drag them through it, too.“That was my responsibility. You’ve got to have character, determination, ambition and impulse.”Argentina are fifth in the betting to lift the trophy and Caniggia believes they can do it, particularly with the talent they have up top.With Messi, Gonzalo Higuain – who has come under fire for his performances for his country – Sergio Aguero, Paulo Dybala and Angel Di Maria to choose from, goals shouldn’t be a problem. Defensively, however, they could come unstuck.“What’s in our favour is the best attacking players can put fear into anyone,” added Caniggia.“Their names alone unsettle the opposition. The other teams don’t think ‘Higuain is being criticised in Argentina’. They think: ‘he’s Juventus’ top goalscorer’.”“Our weak point is we’re still not solid at the back, and there are still a couple of places up for grabs.”Caniggia was in his early thirties by the time he arrived at Dens Park in 2000 and remarkably had the chance to play at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.“We’ll never know now but to play 30 minutes would have been perfect. I was in good shape and I hadn’t lost my pace. But I couldn’t decide, and later I regretted it. It would’ve been unbelievable to play.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"convincing players to come to dundee united has not been easy admits csaba","story":"\t\t\t\t\tCsaba Laszlo admits getting the players he wants to rebuild Dundee United this summer has not been easy.But he’s revealed the more quality signings that have been made, the less difficult the process has become.With other clubs, often from top divisions, also keen on players like Callum Booth, Craig Curran and Frederic Frans, the Tangerines had to pull out the stops to persuade them to sign up at Tannadice.That saw Csaba making a point of speaking to every potential target individually, rather than doing business through their agents.“If we are in the Premiership it is easier to attract staff and players, but we are not,” he said.“I have talked to every single player we have signed to convince them to come to Dundee United.“It was not an agent calling them to tell them Dundee United were interested, it was the manager calling to say you are important.“I think this was a reason why we’ve got players. It’s a lot of work and it’s not finished.“Frans and Booth both had offers from Premiership clubs here, Frans also from the top division in Belgium.“They have come here and, when other players see that, it made it better for us to get others to come as well.”Csaba has also revealed not one of the new faces had a problem with the new 25-miles rule he’s introduced.From now on, every player will have to stay no further away from Tannadice than that and, contrary to what some predicted, it’s not been a problem.“Before it could be Willo Flood, myself and some directors travelling on the team

Construction work will start early next month.\t\t\t"},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7486028.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"                          Swindon\u0027 own Maisie Sly has topped off her trip to Hollywood in style, after the film she starred in, The Silent Child, was announced as the winner Best Live Action Short Film at the 90th\u0026nbspAcademy Awards."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7590066.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"11 things you d only hear in Glasgow","story":"                          There are some things you will only ever hear in Glasgow or Glesga, as us locals call it,\u0026nbspand this is our definitive list of the best."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7608211.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Hollywood star Johnny Depp reveals who his Scots hero is during Glasgow visit","story":"                          Johnny Depp might have brought rock \u0026rsquon\u0026rsquo roll to Glasgow with old pals Alice Cooper and Joe Perry \u0026ndash but he told Scots fans his own hero was William Wallace.\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Revealed  Ibrox boss Steven Gerrard pops into secret plush cinema in Glasgow","story":"                          Steven Gerrard had\u0026nbsphis big week in Glasgow\u0026nbspfor the first day at Rangers -

launched on Thursday.Attended by charity representatives and local councillors, the call was made to make the Highland capital fit for the 21st century.The manifesto has been produced by the Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) in collaboration with groups including Autism Rights Group Highland, Guide Dogs Scotland and the Highland Cycle Campaign.It sets out a range of barriers it says prevents Inverness being truly accessible to all, including too many bollards of different types and heights, unfenced cafe tables and chairs spilling into pavement areas and refuse bins on narrow pavements forcing pedestrians onto the road.The coalition want the council to adopt a Street Charter which would dictate conditions to be applied to any future planning or licensing applications.RNIB Scotland campaigns manager Dr Catriona Burness said: \"For too many people our streets remain a daily obstacle course.\"We believe a Street Charter would help to enhance the quality of life for residents and, vitally, boost the reputation of Inverness as an open and welcoming tourist destination.\"As \u0026lsquoThe Gateway to the Highlands\u0026rsquo Inverness plays a pivotal

welcoming to everyone \u0026ndash and the key to inclusivity is physical accessibility.\"She added: \"A Street Charter would help to avoid entrenching flawed designs that could blemish Inverness for a generation or more.\"Brian MacKenzie of the Highland Cycle Campaign said\u0026nbsp the drive to get things right first time made good financial sense for cash-strapped local authorities.\"For example, a 2015 House of Lords report on \u0026lsquoshared spaces\u0026rsquo (where roads and pavements are levelled allowing vehicles and pedestrians to use the same area) warns that \u0026lsquocouncils are risking public safety with fashionable simplified street design\u0026rsquo and notes that \u0026lsquomore and more local authorities are forced into expensive remedial work, often restoring crossings they have themselves removed\u0026rsquo,\" he said.The manifesto states: \"A Street Charter would offer planners and consultants a template for inclusive design, potentially saving the council money by cutting down on objections to plans or completed developments.\"And it adds: \"A Street Charter would also make for a more pleasant environment for people who don\u0026rsquot have disabilities as clutter-free streets and logical street layouts would make getting around easier and more appealing.\"Highland Council introduced a new policy in April, requiring trade waste bins to be kept off city

The connection with the charity came about because Andrew is father-in-law to a friend of Emily Crossley, a former reporter and anchor for Channel 4 News and CNN International, who co-founded the charity in 2012 after her son Eli was diagnosed with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. (DMD)Emily has advocated for patients around the world and spoken many times in the Houses of Parliament.The trust raised \u0026pound3.5million in its first three years, and then six years ago started the annual Duchenne Dash, which with big sponsors such as Maserati, brings in millions for research and also raises awareness of the horrible disease. Last year\u0027 Dash raised \u0026pound1 million.DMD is an inherited genetic disorder passed on by the mother that leads to progressive muscle degeneration and weakness. Symptom onset is usually between ages three and five and the disease primarily affects boys, although in rare cases it can affect girls.Sonia, who completed this year\u0027 Loch Ness Etape as part of her training, said: \"Every week, two families in the UK are given the devastating news that their son has DMD, and we believe there are at least two cases in the north.\"The Paris dash is to raise money for research and raise awareness. The charity is half way through it\u0027 mission to End Duchenne in Ten.\"The Dash was pretty hard as there is little respite apart from on the ferry. I would say it was probably worse than childbirth, but we all did really well.\"The organisation was amazing and you have to ride in peletons of about 40.\"It was brilliant seeing the Eiffel Tower getting closer and closer and as we rode up the Avenue des Champs-\u0026Eacutelys\u0026eacutees to the tower it felt as though we were finishing the Tour de France.\"We had VIP treatment and the streets were all closed for us by the police.\"Sonia added that Duchenne UK is making huge progress in fighting this number one genetic killer of boys and the funded clinical trials are starting to produce treatments that can slow down the onset of the disease which could buy hundreds of thousands of boys enough time to wait for the more radical treatments and possibly even a cure.To donate online go to http://uk.virginmoneygiving/fund/DuchenneDash2018Sunday 24 Jun 2018 5:35 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116168.jpg","title":"Could this be Nessie lurking in the deep","story":"\u0026nbspAn Inverness man on a dreich day beside Loch Ness popped off a couple of shots on his camera before swiftly retreating to the shelter of his parents\u0026rsquo car.It was only later back home in Milton of Leys when he was reviewing his photographs that Toby Christian began to wonder \"Have I captured the Loch Ness Monster?\"Two frames seemed to show a dark shape in the water, perhaps indicating something lurking just below the surface.The second shot in particular which is reproduced on this page with Toby\u0027 permission shows a dark patch on the water in the foreground which looks particularly mysterious.Toby (47), a keen amateur photographer, said: \"I was out in the car for the day with my parents Robert and Mary and we stopped just off the A82.

It will recover the costs later.In March it also ordered building owners with glazed canopies to check they had adequate inspection and maintenance arrangements in place.This followed incidents at both the Inverness and Inshes retail parks in 2017 and earlier this year where panels fell from their fixings, in one case resulting in a shopper having stitches to his head after being hit with broken glass.Mr Stewart said: \"Although councils can act if buildings are deemed dangerous and go on to recoup money from owners if they carry out work, there\u0027 more that can be done to bring in more preventative measures.\"Businesses are under severe pressure at the moment with rising city centre costs.

We know parents, carers and staff may be concerned by the issues raised and we will be keeping them informed of the action being taken.”It is understood the head teacher at the time of the inspection is no longer in the post and an acting head is in place.An Aberdeenshire Council spokesman said: “During their visit, the inspection team identified a ‘caring environment and positive relationships between staff and children’ and ‘happy children who are eager to learn’, along with good teamworking and good quality teaching.“But the team also identified major weaknesses in the leadership and have called for improvements to self-evaluation and to the school’s approaches to equality and diversity.“A timeline for improvements has been identified, and we have developed an action plan to ensure these are all met by the end of August.”He added: “Work has been undertaken to ensure staff are fully informed about children’s medical history, that appropriate plans are in place in case of emergency and that staff are fully aware of how to implement these plans. A new management approach has also been established.“By August, the council will ensure the security of boundaries, improve the design and layout of the toilet cubicles, and make sure all staff have necessary training. A report on the inspection and the action being taken will be brought before councillors after the summer.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"legislation to stop cars parking on pavements receives backing from mp","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA campaign to stop cars parking on the pavement has been backed by a north-east MP.Ross Thomson took part in a recent Guide Dogs event at Parliament which showed the hazards for someone with visual impairment.It included street clutter and an area lacking safety features such as a kerbs, pedestrian crossings and cars parking on the pavement.The Transport (Scotland) Bill includes proposals on pavement parking, and Guide Dogs is campaigning for a UK-wide law to make it an offence, except on streets where local authorities agree it is safe for pedestrians.Mr Thomson backed the campaign following contact by several constituents about the difficulties they can face in Aberdeen.He said: “I was pleased to meet Hilda the Guide Dog and walk with her along Clutter Street – which could be any high street in Scotland.“The car parked on a pavement really brought home the challenges faced by blind and partially-sighted people.“It was also enlightening to speak to Guide Dog owners about their experiences and the impact these obstacles have on their lives.”Niall Foley of Guide Dogs Scotland said:“If you have a vision impairment, pavement-parked cars aren’t just a nuisance, they can force you to step into the road and put you in danger.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"man 38 denies driving while six times the limit","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA man has denied getting behind the wheel while more than six times the drink-drive limit.Edward Welsh, 38, pled not guilty to drink driving when he appeared at Elgin Sheriff Court yesterday.The alleged offence happened on the town’s West Road on Thursday.It is alleged he had 139mcg of alcohol in 100ml of breath when he was driving.

As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade. We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.On another subject, I have been unimpressed with our local roads department management\u0026#8217s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from local residents and myself about the plague of potholes scattered across Islay.There are many roads across Islay that have some potholes marked to be filled while others remain unmarked despite them in many cases being side by side. This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity. Their dedication enabled Cats Protection to help around 200,000 cats and kittens nationwide.Cats Protection is always on the lookout for new volunteers to join the UK’s biggest cat community. Though a large part of our work is helping cats, through fostering and rehoming, our volunteers have the opportunity to become involved with a range of interesting activities such as organising fundraising events, helping with publicity or managing funds and resources to benefit the greatest amount of cats.Volunteering can offer the chance to develop skills such as time management, interpersonal skills and teamwork, making CVs much more attractive and, of course, helping cats.Anyone who is interested in becoming a volunteer can go to our website www.cats.org.uk/get- involved/volunteering  to find out more.Julie Meredith, head of volunteering development, Cats Protection,Sir,I really love being active, especially the feeling after and that’s why I’m supporting Bowel Cancer UK and Beating Bowel Cancer’s latest fundraising campaign to get sponsored to do 30 minutes of physical activity for 30 days in June.Step up for 30 is a fantastic way for you to be more physically active to reduce your risk of bowel cancer – the UK’s second biggest cancer killer.

The pair were seeded car 30 in the two wheel drive section, run first on the day in a new schedule being piloted by the rally, the two wheel drive cars covering the stages before the four wheel drive cars followed in the afternoon.With the dry conditions in the weeks running up to the event dust would be the main problem for those running further down the field. Douglas attacked the first stage, Twiglees, and was catching the car in front when, unfortunately due to the dust being created by that car, came out of a 90 degree corner with zero visibility and connected heavily with a rock, damaging the suspension and forcing his early retirement.The car, and the driver, are noticeably quicker  each event they compete in and it\u0026#8217s only a matter of time before the results are there.The other Argyll car out on the stages was Ally Currie from Mull and Grant McNiven in the Ford Fiesta ST picking up 9th overall and 1st in Class 6.The next round of the Scottish Championship is Argyll Rally, based in Dunoon on June 23 \u0026#8211 the closest round for most Argyll rally enthusiasts and one not to be missed. The stages look absolutely breathtaking this year and well worth a watch.The Scottish Tarmac Rally Championship continues as well with round three being the Granite at Leuchars Stages hosted by Aberdeen and District Motor Club at the MOD base in Leuchars, Fife.Argyll was well represented both in the drivers seat and the co-drivers. All Argyll crew Willie and Steven Beattie were out in the newly finished and beautifully finished Escort MkII. They were absolutely flying and really getting to grips with the car when a sixth gear lock-up threw them into a spin and off the stage, clouting a fairly substantial fence post in the process.The navigators side now looks decidedly second hand, but nothing a few hours in the workshop won\u0026#8217t sort. A bent bottom suspension arm put paid to them re-joining but they will take the positives and the blistering pace into the next round for sure.Willie Beattie Snr in his equally exquisite Escort was also beginning to get the hang of the car, with some more seat time this year, not to mention experienced co-driver, Phil Sandham, pushing him on. He, after making sure his boys were okay when they didn\u0026#8217t show up at service after their spin, continued on to secure 12th overall and second in class: his first honours since building the car.The next round may see some family ties severely stretched, at least until the final results are announced.Ian Parker was also out in familiar machinery, co-driving for Fraser Smith in his Canal Garage-prepared Honda Civic. The pair were also making good progress up the class rankings until the diff decided to implode and finished their rally on Stage six.The drive of the day was not in question. Alan Kirkaldy led from start to finish despite some interesting issues in the first test. His door came loose after about a third of stage and he continued, holding the door shut by the open window whilst steering, changing gear and waving with the other.Astonishingly he still managed quickest stage time by five seconds. His co-driver for the day could forgive himself for being a little green about the gills after that.Eoghan Anderson from Cairnbaan was lucky enough to win the seat in a charity auction at the Annual STRC Dinner earlier in the year. An experience he is unlikely to forget in a hurry, although some of the memories may be a little bit blurry and perhaps just a little sideways. The top three were rounded out by Ian Forgan, ably guided round in his Subaru by his daughter in her first rally and the final position on the podium went to Ian and Allan Paterson, also in a Subaru.The next round is this weekend at Crail where the Beattie boys will be back out, Ian Parker swaps a Civic for an Escort MKII and Donald Bowness is set to get back out in the Nova.PICS:Photos: Gavin Brown, West Coast PhotosRed Escort (Car 1) Alan Kirkaldy/Eoghan Anderson (first overall) no_a24rally01\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"high tech preparation for mid argyll art show","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 14/06/18, 7:45 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThis year has seen a lot of preparatory work ahead of the 2018 Mid Argyll Art Society exhibition in August.The popular show will again be held in the Drill Hall, Lochgilphead and will run from August 6-11.As in the last few years, the Mid Argyll Camera Club will have photos on display.The society is harnessing modern technology in a campaign to raise the profile of this year\u0026#8217s event.There is now a Mid Argyll Art Society Facebook page that can be used to get updates on what is happening.There will shortly be a website giving details about the art society, its history, information on the exhibition and how to participate, and photos of past exhibits to give a flavour of what the event is like.A lot of work has been done on modernising the entry process.

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"a poignant prizegiving for tarbert afc","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 20/06/18, 6:08 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowTarbert AFC’s annual football dance was held on Saturday June 16 in the Islay Frigate Hotel.Players and their partners were joined by the wider circle of people who are involved with the club.This annual dinner dance is also the end of season awards presentation.Nikki MacDougall took home awards for Top Goal Scorer and Referees\u0026#8217 Player of the Year.

This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"accident bankfield roundabout causing rush","story":"NewsAccident at Bankfield Roundabout causing rush hour delaysTraffic is tailing back along the A77 and Dalmellington Road.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet08:59, 21 JUN 2018NewsBankfield Roundabout\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAn accident at the Bankfield Roundabout is causing rush hour delays.

It is the latest diversification at Corton Farm, just outside Ayr. Customers can buy a litre glass bottle for \u0026pound2 and use it again and again at the milk machine. And farmer Alison Kerr said: “You cannot get any fresher. “We’re really hoping it catches on so we can sell more and more directly to local people.” The Kerrs – five generations at Corton since 1925 – have constructed The Milk Hoose and the Milkbot vending machines providing “untampered, non-homogenised” milk from the Corton herd.  Customers on Friday gushed praise on the creamy taste, saying it is nothing like mass-produced products. The Kerrs are charging \u0026pound1.50 per litre and say it cuts out plastic waste from supermarket bottles. Although it is more expensive than supermarket pricing, they say their milk compares favourably to speciality gold top products. Willie and Alison, both 46, have been joined working the farm by son David,19, and are being helped by daughter Joanne,16, when she is not at Belmont Academy. Willie said: “It would be a dream to sell every litre we produce right here. “But we have had a great start and it has been so well received.” The farm produces between 5000 and 6000 litres of milk a day, depending on the time of year.  That is courtesy of the 220 Friesian-Holstein milkers. The Kerrs own 260 acres and rent another 250. Fourteen years ago they expanded into the Corton Plants nursery and 14 months ago the Coo Shed coffee shop. But Alison said: “The Milkbot really completes the story of selling your own product. “We siphon off what we need into churns to be pasteurised and it is put into the Milkbot. “I guarantee it tastes completely different as all the fats and proteins have not been stripped out. “It is non-homogenised and the cream settles on top like the the old-fashioned milk.” At the moment it is thought only three farms in Scotland are selling direct via a vending machine.  Alison added: “People now are so detached from where the food comes from and I think supermarkets are to blame for that. “Some kids think milk comes from a bottle in a supermarket. “Plastic has just become a huge issue and it has been good timing for us. “People are loving our branded glass bottles.” Peak time for the new vended milk is between 5pm and 7pm and there can be 20 cars in the car park at a time with people leaving work keen to top up their supply. Alison added: “Hopefully this continues to grow. Milk is sold too cheaply in supermarkets and farmers have been down-trodden for a long time. “We have just had to take what we can get and be paid sub-30p a litre. At the moment the Milkbot is doing a couple of hundred litres a day so we have a long way to go to reach 5000 a day.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"girl 4 stuck playpark equipment","story":"NewsGirl, 4, gets stuck in playpark equipment and needs fire brigade to rescue herPetrified Lily-Mags Rodman ended up wedging her wee leg in a metal car in Belleisle near Ayr.\u0026nbspShareBySarah Hilley16:44, 20 JUN 2018Updated19:45, 20 JUN 2018NewsLittle Lily-Mags had her leg stuck in the toy car for 40 minutes\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA four-year-old girl got stuck in playpark equipment for 40 minutes as firefighters struggled to get access to her. Petrified Lily-Mags Rodman ended up wedging her wee leg in a metal car in Belleisle. Her father David and other parents were unable to free her, sparking an emergency services rescue. But crews faced a major delay as access to the park through the main entrance was blocked off due to fencing at the Belleisle Hotel. The crew had to abandon their fire engine some distance away and run across the grass to reach Lily-Mags. After assessing the situation, they were forced to backtrack their appliance through the main exit and find another way in.  Mum Clare said: “Luckily my daughter wasn’t badly hurt, but if it was a life-or-death situation and a child had fallen from equipment it may have been too late.” Clare, who was working from home outside Ayr, rushed to the park after her husband phoned. Clare, 33, said: “I drove in a panic. “Her leg was wedged in the car at a funny angle. “I could hear her screaming over the phone. My husband and others tried to get her out but it hurt so they called the fire brigade.” Firefighters calmly cut off the side of the car to free the tot.  She emerged unscathed but with bad pins and needles during the incident a week past last Wednesday. Now Clare and Lily-Mag’s gran Anita O’Connor are calling for an emergency services route to the wooded park. Clare said: “The fire service were really fantastic but it took them 10 minutes to figure out how to get the fire engine in.” Anita said: “She was stuck for well over 40 minutes as the fire engine couldn’t find a route through to the park because of the fencing. “Fortunately she has not sustained any injuries, but she is extremely traumatised. “This issue regarding access needs to be addressed ASAP and not sat on for days until the council have their next meeting.”  Belleisle Hotel owner Campbell Inns erected more fencing on June 6, which has blocked off access to the playpark through the main driveway. The alternative entrance is now through Greenfield Avenue. Anita said emergency services should have been notified of the issue. A council spokesman said: Due to layout changes affecting the main access road at Belleisle, emergency services had to enter via an alternate route. “We are contacting the emergency services to advise them to use the alternative entrance for the time being.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"pair young lads saved squirrel","story":"NewsPair of young lads saved squirrel that was lying in agonyNow the caring boys - Max Bryson and Ben Edwards - have been praised for their caring capers.\u0026nbspShareByStephen Houston10:10, 21 JUN 2018NewsMax Bryson, left and Ben Edwards (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA squirrel lay in agony after plunging from a tree in a park ... only to be protected and saved by two young lads. Now the caring boys - Max Bryson and Ben Edwards - have been praised for their caring capers. And Ben’s dad James said: “I am immensely proud of them both. “Too often people these days would just walk past and, although concerned, would not intervene. “Ben and Max got stuck in and worked out a rescue plan.” The 12-year-olds, who have just started second year at Kyle Academy, had been out cycling in Rozelle Park last Tuesday.  They came across the bashed-up critter at the side of the duck pond and sprang into action. Onlooker Lorna Barclay said the boys deserve recognition. She said: “The squirrel was obviously hurt and fretting on the path. “We approached to see if we could help but were pleasantly surprised they had the situation under control.” They had already called the SSPCA and protected the frightened furry animal from dogs. When the charity said they’d be an hour the boys went home and got a strong bag filled with straw - leaving Lorna on guard.  And Max’s mum Liz and dad Douglas, who own the Inverlea Guest House in Ayr, said: “He loves animals so wanted to help. “I am so happy both boys decided to intervene. “They did it all on their own and I knew nothing about it. “What the lady said about the boys was amazing.” The lads returned to the squirrel within 15 minutes with their custom-made bed all ready for the SSPCA inspector. Lorna added: “It was lovely to see how concerned and compassionate the boys as well as using their problem- solving skills.  “Many other people would have walked on by without any interest in helping.” Ben already has a busy household with dad James, mum Sarah, sisters Lizzie and Emily, two cats, a tortoise and a fish. Scottish SPCA Chief Superintendent Mike Flynn said: “At this time of year we receive a lot of calls about people concerned about wildlife. “We all have a responsibility to look after and care for the wildlife in Scotland and these two boys went above and beyond on this occasion to help this poor squirrel. “They should be very proud.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12713526.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/emp_ayp_070618ecrepont_10JPG.jpg","title":"talented youngster finn ecrepont walking","story":"NewsTalented youngster Finn Ecrepont is walking on AyrDubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet12:00, 18 JUN 2018NewsAyr United\u0027s Finn Ecrepont (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMost success stories in football start with a rejection somewhere along the line. And 15-year-old Ayr United starlet Finn Ecrepont is no different. Dubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football. The Kilmarnock school has dedicated facilities for bright talents in the footballing world. And after leaving Alloway Primary, Ecrepont’s aim was to join the set-up at the Grange - but he was told he wasn’t good enough at his trial for the performance school. But the left-back, who also went to Glenburn Primary, refused to give up on his dream. Ecrepont, who has played with Ayr United since he was nine, said: “Getting that knock back is key to where I am today, because that has made me realise it’s not as easy as just walking into a team. “I didn’t get through the first trial so that made me focus and I knew I had to work hard. “I guess there was choices to make and sacrifices to make, but I was willing to make these changes for my football.  “I had training at Ayr the night after I got my knock back so I went to ask my coach Ross Armour for advice, so that’s when the work began. “I went away and worked on my game and a year later I got into the performance school at the Grange, which is one of the best things that has ever happened to me.” Ecrepont worked his way up through the ranks at Ayr and has now signed a three year deal with the first team. Just last season he was training with the under 17s, but his progress has been off the scale and he is now training with the senior side. He has been getting day release from school on a Thursday to train with the first team, but after signing his new deal he will train four mornings a week with Ian McCall’s side. And despite most schools refusing to take him in due to his football commitments, Ayr Academy were good enough to take him in. And dad Eddy, who runs Cafe Ginger in Ayr, claims teachers from Ayr Academy have offered to work overtime to help Ecrepont through his studies. Ecrepont is delighted to get his chance so early with Ayr.  He said: “The coaches thought I was playing well so I got more of a chance through my training and playing more with the under 20s last season. “I just love being in and around the first team, and the boys have been great with me so I am happy to be where I’m at at the moment. “Everyone at the club has been brilliant with me, through all the age groups. All the senior players and coaches have been really accepting of me and I couldn’t have asked for anything more. “Ian McCall and all of the other coaches are great because they always give me feedback. “Whether it’s positive or negative they are always keeping me right. That has been key to my progression. “If I was to ask anyone a question at Ayr they would answer it no problem, and that’s exactly what I look for and it’s why I’m here.” Despite the gruelling schedule of being a footballer, Ecrepont claims he is still fully focused on his school work.  He said: “Adapting to be a footballer hasn’t been much different as I enjoy it and it’s more like a hobby. I play football for fun and that’s what’s most important to me, so I guess it’s just normal. “It can take a lot out of me, but again because I enjoy football so much I don’t really realise how much I am doing. “I don’t think it’s had an effect on my school and I think it’s going good. Hopefully I have done well in my exams which I’ll find out in August. “I’ll get a Wednesday off from training so I can hopefully work towards getting my highers. “This year I’m studying higher English and PE, next year I’ll do something like Chemistry and Biology. And despite his age, Ecrepont has already been involved in a number of big games. He scored for Scotland under 16s against England, but for Ayr under 20s he was involved in a league decider last season against Morton. He said: “Unfortunately we lost the game 1-0 from a penalty, but I played the full game and it was a great experience and the boys played really well.  “There was quite a few Ayr United fans there so they gave us a great support.” But Ecrepont refuses to forget where he came from, he is sure to consistently help his dad Eddy in Cafe Ginger. Ecrepont said: “I signed for Ayr on the Tuesday, I was washing dishes for my dad on the Friday and on the Monday I was training with Scotland. “I work with my dad at the cafe which has been key to keeping me grounded. I know for a fact he wouldn’t let me get big-headed so I couldn’t thank him enough for that. “I’ve been asked before where I see myself in five years, but the honest answer is I don’t know. “For all I know I could get injured tomorrow and break my leg. “I have been told many times that I haven’t made it, and I know that. “My hard work starts now, so I just need to take everything as it comes and take each day on its own.” "},{"url":null,"title":"School library petition almost reaches target in first week","story":"A PETITION calling for librarians to be returned to three Borders high schools

Lowood Bridge has reopened ahead of schedule.\nThe B-listed 250 year old crossing, which links Galashiels and Melrose, was closed for 20 weeks between January 31 and June 15 for an essential and major repair and strengthening programme.\nDespite the early stages of the project taking place during the most extreme winter weather seen in recent years, the bridge reopened before the start of Melrose Festival Week.\nExtensive masonry repair works have taken place during this time which required significant scaffolding to be in place for a number of weeks, resurfacing of the road surface on and around the bridge has been carried out and the traffic light system upgraded.\nAll these works, which have been carried out by Borders contractors, also mean that Lowood Bridge\u0026rsquos 26 tonne

Royal Burgh Standard Bearer Peter Forrest.\nOn Friday morning the 26-year-old joiner led his town with both authority and calmness as Souters celebrated and honoured their historic traditions.\nYet the countdown couldn\u0027t have been more nerve-racking or distracting.\nDelays in Selkirk town centre renovations meant a reshuffle of vantage points for the iconic Casting of the Colours ceremony.\nAnd on the eve of the Common Riding itself, Storm Hector rampaged through the Royal Burgh tearing down bunting and leaving a trail of destruction and debris.\nIf the build-up wasn\u0027t distracting enough, a thoughtless thug spent the Nicht Afore the Morn spray-painting graffiti on landmarks including the War Memorial.\nBut just a few hours later the 2018 Standard Bearer remained the picture of calm as the sun gently rose on Friday morning.\nThe weather had relented, the debris had been cleared, the bunting had been restrung, and the vandalism was covered.\nAnd as Souters frae a\u0027 the airts linked arms and belted out the songs they\u0027d learned as children, all the woes were soon forgotten.\nSelkirk shone as it always does on Common Riding morning.\nAfter returning the Burgh Flag, Standard Bearer Forrest told us: \"I have been calm all week and even managed to get a good three hours\u0027 sleep last night.\n\"I\u0027m not sure how I manage it, but I don\u0027t get nervous at all, and despite everything that has happened, for me the Common Riding couldn\u0027t have gone any better.\n\"I\u0027ve loved the build up and I have loved every second of being Standard Bearer - I don\u0027t think the smile has left my face since the minute I got up this morning.\"\nWhether it was the four years he served as an Attendant - behind James Cheyne in 2009, Douglas Gunn in 2010, Gavin Henderson in 2012 and Kieran Riddle in 2017 - that equipped Peter for taking his duties in his stride, we\u0027ll never know.\nBut his composure and welcoming smile wasn\u0027t lost on any of the dignitaries around him.\nHonorary Provost Jake Wheelans said: \"After all the bad weather and everything else it was great to have Peter as our Standard Bearer.\n\"He was impeccable in every part of his duties today, and he upheld all of our traditions as a Standard Bearer should.\n\"Selkirk has enjoyed a tremendous Common Riding with a fantastic Standard Bearer.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Keep calm - it  39 s only the Common Riding","story":"THE calming influence of Standard Bearer Peter Forrest made sure Selkirk Common Riding ran like clockwork on Friday.\nJust hours after Storm Hector had ripped through the region, Souters awoke to a serene and surprisingly relaxed morning.\nAnd about to head their day-long celebrations was to be the most relaxed of them all - Standard Bearer Forrest.\nThe Flute Band\u0027s Rouse Parade set the tone for a day few will forget.\nHundreds gathered at the War Memorial to honour the brave sons of Selkirk who didn\u0027t come home.\nAnd as the First Drum was sounded at 6am in the Market Place, the hundreds who do come home year after year from far off lands burst into song.\nHer Bright Smile has rarely sounded so good.\nThe build-up had well and truly begun.\nAnd by the time Standard Bearer Forrest was officially installed by Lady Busser, Dylis Wheelans, on the balcony of the Victoria Hall the hundreds had grown to thousands.\nA total of 281 riders followed the 2018 Standard Bearer doon the Green, across the Ettrick and up the Linglie.\nEveryone one of them was safe oot and every one of them returned safe in, some two-and-a-half hours later.\nOfficial reports later confirmed only three minor falls occurred throughout the entire procession.\nAs Standard Bearer Forrest, duly assisted by his Attendants Craig Monks, Robbie Reilly, Thomas Willmott and Liam Cassidy, led the cavalcade beyond Tibbie\u0027s towards the Three Brethren, beneath in the ancient streets of Selkirk the Hammermen, the Weavers, the Fleshers, the Colonials, the Merchants and the Ex-Soldiers began to muster ahead of their march to the Toll.\nAll the pomp and ceremony, headed by the trusty Silver and Pipe bands, brings out the best in this small rural burgh.\nIt\u0027s a place where pride and passion go hand in hand with smiles and laughter.\nSongs are sung, friendships rekindled and customs observed as the crowds patiently await the Coming in of the Burley.\nAnd they didn\u0027t have to wait long at Selkirk\u0027s northern most entrance as Standard Bearer Forrest, aboard the grey-dappled Lizzie, arrived to a cacophony of cheers and shouts of encouragement.\nProud parents, Ann and Rob, as well as girlfriend, Emma Pearce, were the first to offer him their congratulations as a well-deserved breather is taken at The Toll.\nAnd, in time-honoured fashion, his mounted followers made their own spectacular galloping return to the auld toon.\nJoyce Wright, representing the Ladies section of the Rig Committee, presented the traditional riding crop to Standard Bearer Forrest before he remounted to conclude his duties.\nAnd what a conclusion it is.\nThe Casting of the Colours pays homage to the heroic Fletcher, who returned from Flodden with a captured English banner and defiantly cast it around his head before dying.\nTo Up wi\u0027 the Souters Standard Bearer Forrest brought his ceremonial duties to an end with an impeccable cast.\nReflecting on his day, Peter told us: \"Being Standard Bearer was everything I knew it would be and more.\n\"I enjoyed the Marches - really enjoyed it - and my horse Lizzie was great.\n\"You think it can\u0027t get any better then it does. Coming in at The Toll was unbelievable and the Casting was something that will live with me forever.\n\"It has been a truly amazing day and I\u0027d like to thank everyone who came out and supported me.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Casting their places in history","story":"SELKIRK Common Riding is undoubtedly a festival steeped in tradition and commemoration.\nBut it is also a day of contrasts for the followers as well as the ones lucky enough to take part.\nFrom the high-adrenaline riders returning at the Toll, the ecstasy and elation is quietly absorbed by reflection and respect as the colourful procession heads into town.\nBeneath silver skies the rearranged scarlet plinth within the Market Place awaited not only Royal Burgh Standard Bearer Peter Forrest, but the six accompanying Standard Bearers selected by the town\u0026rsquos ancient Societies and Associations.\nTo the growing thrum of expectation, as the hidden clock ticked past eleven, all seven gathered beneath the steps to await a brief minute or two that will live with them forever.\nSince the tragic cast of a blood-soaked English banner more than 500 years ago, this re-enactment both commemorates and celebrates, defiance and pride in equal measure.\nAnd as the Silver Band leads the way with Up wi\u0026rsquo the Souters, each Standard Bearer in turn re-enacts and relives this defiant and proud act.\nStandard Bearer Forrest, as he had been all morning, was assured and relaxed as he turned the Royal Burgh Standard above his head.\nIt was as deserved a cheer as any Standard Bearer has received as he smiled, waved and made his way from the gaze of five-thousand eyes.\nCollege lecturer Mark Easson \u0026ndash a painter by trade \u0026ndash resumed where Standard Bearer Forrest had left off. Armed with the Incorporation of Hammermen Banner, the 49-year-old showed a steady hand and perfect timing to provide an impeccable cast.\nHis smile was as deserved as the loud cheer that followed him down the steps.\nFletcher himself was a weaver before that bloody battle in 1513, and Michael Pepper made sure the fabric of the historic Corporation continued unblemished for another year.\nThe 27-year-old textiles worker may have looked a little nervous but as his cast continued his smile grew. Again, the appreciation was richly deserved.\nFormer farmer Jackie Johnston brought experience with him as he provided a perfect cast of the Incorporation of Fleshers Flag.\nIf there were nerves, they didn\u0026rsquot show as the self-employed excavator took it all in his stride, even managing a thumbs-up to the conductor of the Silver Band before dismounting.\nWhile the other Standard Bearers have enjoyed several weeks\u0026rsquo of practice under the guiding gaze of those who have gone before them, Colonial Standard Bearer Alisdair Piercy has been using two broom-handles taped together with an old Scotland flag in his garage in Toronto.\nBut casting the colours is in his blood - the 39-year-old was following in the footsteps of his father, Drew, and grandfather, Archie, by casting the colours.\nAnd the 2018 Colonial Standard Bearer was perfect in every way as he cast the striking yellow banner above his head.\nFollowing the ceremony Alisdair revealed: \u0026ldquoI watched the casting so many times when I was a boy growing up in Selkirk.\n\u0026ldquoBeing up there was amazing \u0026ndash I was ready to start but when that drum sounds it hits you right in the heart.\n\u0026ldquoI was trying not to listen to the band and keep counting in my head, like I\u0026rsquod been told, and I think it worked.\nThe wave and grin from Alisdair were deserved as he savoured every moment on the scarlet plinth.\nOne Standard Bearer who is more familiar with the new-look Market Place than most is architect Stuart Davidson.\nThe 37-year-old dad-of-three has been heavily involved in the ongoing redesign of the town centre.\nStuart was a picture of concentration throughout most of his faultless cast, only allowing himself a huge smile of relief during the final bars of Up wi\u0026rsquo the Souters.\nArguably the most poignant of all is saved for last.\nFormer KOSB Martin Young brought with him all the military discipline and reliability you would expect as he carried the Ex-Soldiers\u0026rsquo Association Flag onto the scarlet plinth.\nThe father of two, who is a now a traffic policeman, provided another faultless cast with the Union banner before leading this close-knit community in two minutes of silence and reflection.\nWith the centenary fast approaching of the end of the Great War, the sacrifice made by so many is being brought even clearer into focus.\nThat defiance of tyranny and pride in one\u0026rsquos own beliefs and customs, shown by Fletcher, has carried on in Souters down the centuries as decade after decade they have made the ultimate sacrifice.\nThose two minutes of impeccable silence and reflection were only broken by the haunting strains of The Liltin.\nAnd for yet another year, Souters can return home safe in the knowledge that the past won\u0026rsquot be forgotten and the future is one of hope.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"New route planned for tonight s Melrosian s rideout","story":"FOLLOWERS of Melrosian

InChorus subsequently performed with Dougie at the Amber Festival in Perth.\nThe trip to New York was hugely memorable with the choir singing on the Red Steps in Times Square, at the annual NYPD concert, at various September Concerts in the city, and, most poignantly, at the British Memorial Garden to the relatives of the British people who had died on 9/11.\nMoira Pearson, who is one of the founding members and choir manager from 2009 to 2012, told us: \" When the advert for a New Peebles Choir was placed in the Peeblesshire News in September 2008 no-one could have imagined just how important InChorus would become to so many people.\n\"It was a great privilege to be the choir manager for three years, during which time we travelled to New York to support and sing at commemorative events for the 10th Anniversary of 9/11.\n\"The fundraising effort to enable the journey was immense but made much easier by the unstinting support of the Peebles community.\"\nAlthough the 9/11 concert will remain a highlight of the InChorus story, the successes and landmark achievements continued after they came home.\nThe next year, 2012, saw the choir performing to another full house at the Festival Theatre, this time raising funds for other charities which is what InChorus likes to do.\nThe following year they embarked upon their \u0026lsquoChoirathon\u0026rsquo in aid of Comic Relief, when they sang from 9.30am to 9.30pm in the sleet, but raised \u0026pound3,500 in the process.\nIn 2013 they also had their first foray to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in what was to be come a biennial venture, winning the covered sell-out laurels in 2013, 2015 and 2017.\nIn 2014 the choir decided to try its hand at competition winning themselves a \u0026lsquoChoir of the Day\u0026rsquo award at the Scottish auditions of Choir of the Year, proving that even a very large choir can be sufficiently disciplined in all the nuances of choral singing to make a good impression.\nOver the years InChorus members discovered they rather liked performing at music festivals and have sung at T in the Park, Meadows Festival, Fringe by the Sea at North Berwick, Big Burns Supper in Dumfries, Eden Festival, Lindisfarne, and last year on the main stage between Texas and the Manic Street Preachers, at the BBC Children in Need\u0026rsquos Carfest in front of an audience of 20,000 people.

While there, they performed on the bandstand in St Stephen\u0026rsquos Green and at the famous Cobblestone pub, as well as appearing as a flash mob all over the city.\nAly Skidmore, herself a long serving choir member, took over as Musical Director in 2014. Aly was responsible for the huge flash mob \u0026lsquoDancing in the Street\u0026rsquo event last year, involving the whole community.\nShe told us: \"Whilst singing is at the heart of everything that InChorus has achieved over the last 10 years, it\u0026rsquos never been only that.\n\"Through this organisation we have seen people\u0026rsquos friendships, confidence, skills, self-esteem and both emotional and physical health all flourish and grow over the years.\n\"In return the members give their time freely and generously to learn, rehearse and perform music for the benefit of others.\n\"In its time InChorus has achieved and given so much more than any of us really ever anticipated at the outset and I think every member feels so proud about that.\nIt\u0026rsquos amazing what a community can achieve when they group together, take a collective breath and burst into song.\"\nThey say that into every life a little rain must fall, and InChorus has not escaped, losing three much loved ladies to cancer.\nIn 2016 it was founder members Kitty Lyle and Celia Hayton and, just a few weeks ago, Bernice Brown - all are missed greatly.\nThroughout its 10 years the choir has raised over \u0026pound60,000 for other charities, both through its own concerts and through specific charity events.\nThis is something that is at the core of InChorus, something of which they are proud, and something which will continue in the years to come.\nAt one charity dinner they even put up an InChorus performance as an auction prize and were \u0026lsquosold\u0026rsquo for over \u0026pound1100. This, in turn, led to a performance at a very prestigious charity dinner in aid of breast cancer.\nTo celebrate its 10th birthday, the choir will be travelling to Barcelona in October for a long weekend of performances.\nBut before that they have a bit of a party planned in Peebles.\nOn September 1, the actual birthday weekend, they have organised their \u0026lsquoTen out of Ten\u0026rsquo day - when they will sing throughout the day from a list of at least ten different favourite songs, at ten different locations in Peebles.\nAlthough the earlier locations have yet to be revealed the finale will take place at the Eastgate Theatre, where it all started ten years ago, for an evening concert.\nThis will also be the final event of the 2018 Creative Peebles Festival.\nThe choir hopes you will join them or, at least, come and say hello.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"United front to boost the Borderlands","story":"HUNDREDS of stakeholders had their say on proposals to transform the Borderlands economy at a special conference in Dumfries on Monday.\nLeader of Dumfries and Galloway Council, Elaine Murray, welcomed more than 370 business representatives, public sector organisations and individuals to the first Borderlands conference.\nShe said: \u0026ldquoI am delighted that so many people attended on the day, this shows what an important project the Borderlands Inclusive Growth Deal is.\n\"One attendee described the conference as an \u0026lsquoIlluminating and fantastic event\u0026rsquo, which reflected the enthusiasm I perceived on the day, that this is a once in a generation opportunity which must be seized.\nFive local authorities from north and south of the border are working in partnership to put together a proposal that should have huge implications for those who live, work and visit the area.\nIt was the first opportunity for interested parties to hear about the themes that are being developed to underpin the Borderlands Inclusive Growth Deal \u0026ndash and to give their views on the major projects they believe would kickstart transformation.\nThe conference was held at a key time for the partnership, made up of Carlisle City, Cumbria County, Dumfries and Galloway, Northumberland County and Scottish Borders Councils.\nResponses from the conference will help the partnership to build a case to present to both the UK and Scottish Governments later this year. Views were sought on the Borderlands\u0026rsquo key themes: Digital Energy Destination Borderlands Rural Productivity Business Growth Transport Innovation and Skills and Quality of Place.\nThe conference had backing from both governments who have pledged support for a deal.\nKeith Brown MSP, Cabinet Secretary for Economy, Jobs and Fair Work, said: \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government has made clear our support for a proposed Borderlands deal in our budget statements. And we look forward to negotiating the detail of that deal when the partners are ready with their proposals. This is a key part of our commitment to 100 percent coverage of deals across Scotland.\n\u0026ldquoWe want to see an ambitious deal that focuses on driving inclusive growth and the priorities that will make a difference and help the economy thrive. We want a deal that helps address the area\u0026rsquos connectivity challenges, supports growth in sectors particularly important in the Borderlands, and creates more opportunities for all to attract people to the area.\n\u0026ldquoWe are working to tackle the economic challenges in the South of Scotland, having already committed to establishing a South of Scotland enterprise agency, and we want to ensure that priorities align to maximise impact and success.\nSpeaking ahead of the conference the Secretary of State for Scotland, David Mundell said:\n\"The Borderlands Growth Deal represents a unique opportunity to provide a real shot in the arm to the economy of our region, a region that faces similar challenges wherever you live or work within it.\n\u0026ldquoWorking with the proposals that have been prepared by local authorities, businesses and individuals, we will spend the summer shaping these in to a coherent deal that will support the economy of the region by encouraging people to invest in new opportunities, by building on our strengths and improving the lives of those who live here.\n\u0026ldquoIn that way, we will bring to the Borderlands the benefits that are now being seen across the UK as investment in City and Growth Deals progresses.\nDumfries and Galloway Council Chief Executive Gavin Stevenson said: \u0026ldquoCrucially we now sit between the emerging powerhouses of the central belt of Scotland and the Northern Powerhouse in England. Unless we act they will continue to suck up our young talent and skills.\n\u0026ldquoWe need to re-position ourselves, we need to stabilise and to stop our productivity falling and then we also need to reinvent. This feels like a once in a generation opportunity.\n\u0026ldquoWe know our potential, our children will not forgive us if there are no jobs in the future. I think we are at that point where we either put up or shut up. We get out there, we shout, we demand and we create the business opportunities.\nThose attending quizzed a panel, chaired by the UK Government\u0026rsquos Borderlands champion John Stevenson MP, on how the deal could support inclusivity, tourism projects and benefit small rural communities.\nFor more information visit the partnership website www.Borderlandsgrowth or email info@borderlandsgrowth\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Youngsters make a splash at Braw Lads  39  Swimming Gala","story":"SPECTATORS crammed into Galashiels Swimming Pool on Tuesday night for the Braw Lads\u0027 Swimming Gala.\nBraw Lad Greg Kelly, Braw Lass Kimberley O\u0027May and their attendants were given a rousing welcome as they came to support the young competitors.\nAnd the swimmers from all age groups put on a fantastic display throughout the evening, which culminated with the mixed aged group Braw Lads\u0027 Relay Race.\nThis event didn\u0027t disappoint.

Would those closest to you think so?​Lots of questions this week.As we get to know each other better, our answer to the questions deepen.Jesus first asked his disciples who people said he was and they gave many answers.Then Jesus put them on the spot and said: \u0026#8216Who do you say that I am?\u0026#8217I can imagine the disciples looking puzzled and looking from one to the other for an answer.I imagine the silence would hang in the warm night air as Jesus waited for a response.And it was Peter who gave the answer that resonates through time when he said: \u0026#8216You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.\u0026#8217Peter had recognised the wonder of this man before him and knew that he was of God.Jesus praised Peter for his intuition and no doubt the others knew they were in the presence of a sacred moment.Peter was not perfect and often his coat was on a shuggly peg, but in the end he served his Lord and went on to die for his faith.Who are you?\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"victoria halls free big night out gig","story":"The non-licenced, free-of-charge gig, featuring Rhuvaal, Matt Mcalister, DJ Jamie G and Kintyre Schools Pipe band is from 7.30pm to midnight on June 29 in Victoria hall and doors open at 7pm.Youth worker Dawn Wallace said: \u0026#8216The Big Night Out  is part of ‘The Year of the Young People 2018’ celebrations.\u0026#8216The event received funding from Argyll and Bute Youth Forum, Argyll and Bute Health and Social Care Partnership- Health and Wellbeing Fund and MACC Airbase Community Company- MACC Charitable Giving Fund which has enabled us to run this event free of charge.\u0026#8217\t\t\t"},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7484923.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Festival guests left feeling cheesed off call for a refund","story":"              GUESTS at a cheese festival who were left disappointed by a lack of the smelly stuff on offer are calling for a refund.\u0026nbsp  The Big Cheese Festival, which was held at Hove Lawns yesterday, has been branded a \"shocking experience\" by\u0026nbspguests, with some saying they counted no more than two cheese stalls.

Six-year-old Maisie, who plays the main character, Libby, in the film, in what was her first ever acting role, was accompanied to the glitzy ceremony in Los Angeles by her mother Elizabeth, co-star and writer Rachel Shenton, and the short film\u0026rsquos director Chris Overton.  And while a little young to be enjoying a champagne celebration, Maisie will be returning to her Upper Stratton home as one of the youngest actors to have starred in an Oscar-winning film.      THE.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.  The film was given its first public screening in Swindon last month at the Swindon Arts Centre.

The court was presented with details of the alleged anti-social behaviour of Mr Conner, including shouting, swearing and fighting within a property at Links Avenue, and disposing of items and bags of rubbish outwith a domestic bin within the communal garden.  The terms of the ASBO prohibit Mr Conner from behaving in an anti-social manner including shouting and swearing at neighbours and other residents in and around Links Avenue.

Len Smith, 92, was conscripted at the age of 18 and was a supply lorry driver for the British Liberation Army.  He landed at Gold Beach, Normandy, where he said he was not shot at and saw little combat.  But he drove some of the first troops into Berlin in 1945 and moved supplies through a war-ravaged France, Belgium, Holland and Germany.  Despite his actions, modest Len, who went on to work in the civil service, said he had never thought of himself as veteran, never mind a hero.  He told the Courier: \u0026ldquoThere were thousands of young men like me. I never considered myself a veteran until the recent events marking the anniversary led to me looking back.  \u0026ldquoAt the time we just got on with it the real heroes are the soldiers who fought and died over there.  Mr Smith was one of eight children born in Pencaitland to local couple John and Euphemia Smith.  His sister Ellen, 97, still lives in Pencaitland and he visits the area regularly but after he was demobbed in 1947, Mr Smith moved to Longlevens, Gloucestershire, to find work.  Now a widower, Mr Smith\u0026rsquos sister sends him the Courier every week so he can keep up with local news.  His L\u0026eacutegion d\u0026rsquoHonneur medal was sent to his home in Cheltenham by post and contained a letter from Jean-Pierre Jouyet, French ambassador to the UK, which said: \u0026ldquoI offer you my warmest congratulations on this high honour, which recognises your military engagement and steadfast involvement in the liberation of France during the Second World War.  \u0026ldquoAs we contemplate this Europe of peace, we must never forget the heroes like you who came from Britain and the Commonwealth to begin the liberation of Europe by liberating France.  But Mr Smith insists he was just a young man doing a job.  He said: \u0026ldquoI didn\u0026rsquot know how the war was going, I didn\u0026rsquot read anything about the war. I was a young lad and I had no fear.  \u0026ldquoI just thought \u0026lsquoget on with it\u0026rsquo.  However, he remembers thinking about how worried his mother would be.  Len\u0026rsquos brothers James and Thomas were also in active service and James was in the D-Day landings. All three came home.  He said: \u0026ldquoWhen we came back my mum was overjoyed, she got three sons back uninjured.  Last year, Mr Smith returned to the Normandy beaches on a British Legion tour organised for veterans.

Plans to close Haddington Infant School and King\u0026rsquos Meadow Primary School were revealed last autumn.  East Lothian Council intends to create a new primary school, operating from the existing school buildings, which will cover nursery through to primary seven. The proposal was approved by East Lothian Council in April after a public consultation. It has now also been approved by the Scottish Government.  Combined, the two schools currently have a school roll of about 700 pupils. However, it remains unclear who the new headteacher for the primary school, which is yet to be named, will be.

Fiona Robertson, head of education at East Lothian Council, said: \u0026ldquoWe believe that the decision to establish one new primary school, operating under a single management structure, offers the best solution to not only developing a stronger and more cohesive curriculum, but that local children will benefit from improved progression planning and transition as they progress from infant to upper stage.  \u0026ldquoOur education service will work closely with our current headteacher Mrs McGillivray, and the chairs of both parent councils, to recruit a headteacher for the newly established school.

Five retail units are planned for a site at Gateside previously earmarked for a Sainsbury\u0026rsquos supermarket and petrol station.  The site, which totals about 60,000 sq ft, could be made up of units ranging from 7,500 sq ft to 20,000 sq ft in size.  Alastair Dickie, development director with Ediston Real Estates, which now owns the site, attended the town\u0026rsquos community council meeting on Tuesday, one week before plans are unveiled to the public.  He told members the proposal was for the site to include three food retailers, with the other two units including \u0026ldquoa household-type retail business and a coffee drive-through facility.  However, he was keeping tight-lipped on the identity of the businesses until legal agreements were in place.  Mr Dickie hoped planning permission for the site, off Oak Tree Roundabout west of Haddington, could be achieved by the end of the year.  He said: \u0026ldquoIf we submit an application in August, we would hope. . . we would hopefully have a consent in December or January next year.  \u0026ldquoWe could be on site quarter one of 2019.  It is then hoped that the retailers could be trading in the lead-up to Christmas that year or early in 2020.  The development, which has been described as \u0026ldquoEast Lothian\u0026rsquos first retail park, will involve in the region of \u0026pound14 million investment, with 150 jobs potentially created, as well as those during the construction process.  It has already been revealed that talks are ongoing with \u0026ldquoa number of major retailers who will be new to East Lothian.  Concerns have been expressed by a number of retailers in the town centre that the creation of a retail park on the outskirts would be detrimental to their business.  But Mr Dickie, who previously lived in the town and continues to stay in the county, was hopeful the additional retailers would encourage people to remain in the area rather than heading further afield to retail parks in Edinburgh.  The proposals are on display to the public from 2pm to 7pm on Tuesday at the John Gray Centre.  The developer is also continuing to make progress at a second Haddington site for retail development \u0026ndashat Harperdean, between the A1 and the A199, east of Aberlady Road.

The new scheme offers people an opportunity to support Our Community Energy \u0026ndash a partnership between not-for-profit Scottish firm Our Power and Mongoose Energy, which manages community energy assets \u0026ndash and hopes to find investors in the county.  They say that the site at Pogbie Windfarm \u0026ndash already home to the turbines \u0026ndash will create enough energy to power 7,200 homes and believe that, when they combine it with a second site in Berwickshire, the scheme will raise an estimated \u0026pound1.9 million in surplus profit over 25 years.  Our Power said that profit from the wind turbines it takes over would then be used to keep energy prices down, helping people who are struggling with the costs.  They need to raise just over \u0026pound3 million for the project, which covers both sites, and community groups and individuals are being invited to invest in bonds and shares to raise the money needed to get the project up and running, with investments ranging from \u0026pound500 to \u0026pound100,000.  Andrew Smith, Our Community Energy acting chairperson, said: \u0026ldquoFuel poverty is a huge issue for Scotland and we\u0026rsquore proud to be launching such an important fundraising opportunity to directly tackle it.  \u0026ldquoInvesting with a social purpose is something close to the hearts of many Scots, and these bond and equity offers provide the chance to have a huge impact locally.  \u0026ldquoThese offers aim to support those who struggle to afford sufficiently heated homes, as well as providing investors with an exciting new option which not only targets a significant social impact but a positive environmental one too.  \u0026ldquoHowever with these types of investments there are some risks and funds are not readily realisable.  \u0026ldquoInvestors should note that capital is at risk and returns are not guaranteed.  A fuel poor household is defined as one which needs to spend more than 10 per cent of its income on all fuel use and to heat its home to an adequate standard of warmth.  Last year, the East Lothian Poverty Commission found that almost half of local pensioners were forced to spend more than 10 per cent of their income on energy bills.  Mark Kenber, CEO of Mongoose Energy, added: \u0026ldquoWith the majority of Scots recognising the critical level that fuel poverty has reached, it is now more important than ever for investors to put their money into causes that work for the social good, not just their own.  \u0026ldquoOur Community Energy not only gives investors the potential to earn competitive interest rates on their money, but also the opportunity to support the wider Scottish community.

A pressure group called \u0026lsquoBowls for Gullane\u0026rsquo was established on Facebook in the wake of concerns that the village\u0026rsquos bowling club \u0026ndash with a membership of only about 30 \u0026ndash was to be sold to developers.  Councillor Jeremy Findlay, ward member and former chairman of Gullane Area Community Council, said: \u0026ldquoAll three ward councillors are behind the campaign to save the club and we hope that the members understand the feeling in the village.  \u0026ldquoI understand that the committee own the club and it would be the members who benefit from any potential sale.  About 50 residents gathered outside the bowling club on Monday evening to show their displeasure at the possible loss of the club.  The group told the Courier they had had hundreds of offers of support.  Catherine MacKenzie said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove had people phone up, email and text us \u0026ndash and face-to-face \u0026ndash to tell us that they\u0026rsquore willing to become a member.  \u0026ldquoSome of them don\u0026rsquot live locally, or won\u0026rsquot be able to bowl, but they are willing to pay the membership fees.

Gordon McLelland, a local resident and member of the community council, added: \u0026ldquoThe community council want to save the club for the community.  \u0026ldquoWe have tried hard to offer the club our support to work with them but so far they have turned that down.  Billy Mellors, the county\u0026rsquos bowls development officer, said: \u0026ldquoThe overwhelming support from the local community indicates to me the future of Gullane Bowling Club can be sustained if the current members accept it.  Many locals have tried to sign up as members but have been turned away by the club, it has been claimed.  Another member of the group said: \u0026ldquoWhat has shocked us as a group is how many people have been refused membership in recent years \u0026ndash young and old have come forward with their personal experience of being turned away.  Mr Mellors added: \u0026ldquoTime will tell on the way the club want to go but we all hope a common sense approach is taken to preserve this community facility.  East Lothian MSP Iain Gray met representatives of the Bowls for Gullane group last week and is keen to find a solution to ensure the club\u0026rsquos survival.  He said: \u0026ldquoThis is an unfortunate situation Gullane has lost too many local assets recently, so every effort should be made to avoid losing another. I did meet with representatives of the campaign and have said that I will support them in trying to find a way the land, and preferably bowling too, can remain part of the village community.  Ian McMillan, CEO of Bowls Scotland, said that he was \u0026ldquodelighted to see local residents lend their support to the campaign to save the 116-year-old club.  He added: \u0026ldquoI would encourage all in the village to support their historic club, get on the green, enjoy the great game of bowls and ensure future generations can benefit from the opportunity to play an accessible, inclusive sport. Bowls Scotland fully supports the work being undertaken to keep bowls an important part of Gullane\u0026rsquos community fabric.  Les Ritchie, secretary of East Lothian Bowling Association, told the group: \u0026ldquoWe are ready to support you and the community in whatever steps might secure a future for bowling in Gullane.  Attempts by the Courier to speak to Michael Baxter, vice-president and secretary at the bowling club, were unsuccessful this week. In April, Mr Baxter told us: \u0026ldquoThere are not enough members to support the running of the club.  He had said then that the club was \u0026ldquotrying to find a solution but that it was not viable to continue with a dwindling membership.

Doug Haig from the Bridge Centre said to do a world record attempt because it would be great for publicity and a lot of fun.  The group decided to make it an unofficial world record attempt because they were worried they would have to turn away people who were not dancing in time to the music. Instead, they can now welcome all-comers, with an instructional video already on the group\u0026rsquos Facebook page to get revellers in the mood."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7929938.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"North Berwick High School students taking play to the Highlands","story":"              MEMBERS of the Indelible Arts Youth Theatre are heading to the Highlands for the final of a national competition this weekend.  They are one of four one-act plays that will take part in the Scottish Community Drama\u0026rsquos National Youth Drama final in Plockton on Saturday.  The group, who meet in North Berwick\u0027s St Andrew Blackadder Church every Friday, will be performing Evan Placey\u0026rsquos powerful play Girls Like That, which explores the consequences of a naked photo being sent round a school and how this affects, not only the girl in the photo, but the way in which girls react and respond.  Indelible Arts director Linda Grant told the Courier: \"I am so delighted that our talented cast have made it to the SCDA one act festival.  \"It really is a joy to bring all these young people together who have a love of the performing arts and support each other in a very nurturing environment. In particular I am so glad that we have progressed with this play.  \"After a reading the script during one of our sessions the girls were behind it one hundred percent, here was a piece that they could relate to and completely identify with.\"  And some of the cast, pupils at North Berwick High School, are equally looking forward to taking part.  S6 pupil Ella Higgins said: \"When I first read the script, I immediately loved it and was desperate to perform it.  \"I\u0026rsquove never read or seen anything that fully demonstrates how much resilience is needed to survive in high school as a teenage girl to the extent that this play does and it covers so many issues and scenarios that many girls do experience in real life.  \"This play is such an important and well written piece. I feel so proud to be performing it at the final and I hope we do it justice and get it the recognition it deserves.\"  Holly Edwards, another S6 pupil, said: \"The play is extremely relevant and gives a taste of real life and what really goes on at schools that have such a large social media influence.  \"The competition means a lot to us as a group and the thought of getting to the final is so exciting, we want to show people what this play is all about. After all our hard work we are all so happy to be in the final!  Heather Fortune, also S6, added: \"Life today as a high school student is displayed perfectly through the contrast between the boys\u0026rsquo reaction to the photo and the girls\u0026rsquo reaction to it.\"  And S4 pupil Abbey Greenwood: \"I have really enjoyed working on this play, I think it really brings people together and opens up discussions on how we treat each other in society.\""},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7930043.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Calls to tackle Edinburgh Bypass gridlock as tram system to Musselburgh mooted","story":"              MUSSELBURGH\u0026rsquoS MSP has backed calls for improvements to the Edinburgh City Bypass \u0026ndash while suggesting extending a tram or light rail system to the Honest Toun.  Colin Beattie stressed that \u0026ldquoradical thinking needed to be done to create a solution, highlighting a possible extension of a tram or light rail system out to Musselburgh.  During a recent Holyrood debate, he said: \u0026ldquoPeople meet the queues of traffic heading on to the bypass on the main roads around my constituency before they are even near the bypass. This causes more congestion and more air pollution.  Mr Beattie later said: \u0026ldquoYou can go along the road at any time of the day and there are queues of traffic, mainly at Sheriffhall Roundabout.  \u0026ldquoIt is important that when the Government are looking at all the possible changes required to the bypass, all options are considered. The main priority should be that it is cost-efficient and done as soon as possible.  \u0026ldquoIt may be that it is more economic to extend a tram or light rail system out to the main population centres such as Musselburgh than to take on the eye-watering cost of enlarging the A720. This would also benefit the environment and be much faster than using road transport.  \u0026ldquoClearly more radical thinking needs to be done on creating a sustainable solution. I am not convinced that simply replicating a system which moves traffic speedily and efficiently into new choke points is the answer.  Miles Briggs, Lothian region MSP who led the Parliamentary debate, said: \u0026ldquoThe transport information company Inrix in late 2016 identified the bypass as the most congested trunk road outside London, with four of the UK\u0026rsquos worst bottlenecks.  \u0026ldquoI continue to be contacted by frustrated constituents and businesspeople who face frequent delays when using the bypass to commute or transport goods, especially but not exclusively at peak times or when there is an accident on the route. Many drivers tell me their experience is that these tailbacks and traffic jams are becoming more and more regular.  He said that while proposed work at Sheriffhall would be an important improvement, he added: \u0026ldquoIt is only one part of what needs to be a far broader, long-term and coordinated programme of improvements to the bypass which will ensure traffic can keep moving in the decades ahead.  \u0026ldquoThis means looking at innovative solutions, assessing whether extra lanes will be needed, looking at the possible use of hard shoulders in some situations and utilising technology so the bypass can become a smart motorway.  Mr Briggs called on the Scottish Government to take forward a feasibility study into widening the city bypass and new options to address the growing congestion.  A Transport Scotland spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe Edinburgh and South East Scotland City Region Deal includes investment of up to \u0026pound120m in the A720 city bypass for the grade separation of Sheriffhall Roundabout and \u0026pound20 million investment in public transport infrastructure in west Edinburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis investment will improve journey reliability and safety for all users and support significant planned investment in Edinburgh and South East Scotland.  \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government remains committed to undertaking the improvements at the Sheriffhall junction at the earliest opportunity. We are continuing to progress the detailed design development and assessment of the preferred option and expect to publish draft orders in 2019."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7930076.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Haddington pub seeking new owners","story":"              A TOWN centre pub which changed its name less than a year ago is on the lookout for new people to run it.

Inspectors found the following strengths in the school\u0027s work:  - Strong relationships exist between staff and children across the school and nursery which are based on shared values  - In the nursery, children are motivated and confident, and are able to make choices about their play, particularly outdoors. Across the primary stages, children are committed to and proud of being part of their school community  - The committed staff team, led by the headteacher, work well together in their goal to secure positive outcomes for children. Wellbeing is central to the whole school community and staff provide a nurturing learning environment where children receive effective support.

Brave Ruth Quilietti-Bird \u0026ndash who at one point was the most ill person \u0026ldquoin the whole of the UK, according to her husband \u0026ndash moved hospital several times to receive specialist treatment for multiple organ failure, spending her 40th birthday in intensive care rather than on a planned holiday.  She has had both her feet amputated after they suffered tissue damage due to sepsis \u0026ndash a serious complication of an infection.\u0026nbsp It was also feared that Ruth, who taught art at Knox Academy in Haddington and Preston Lodge High School, Prestonpans, might also lose her hands.  She is recovering at the Astley Ainslie Hospital in Edinburgh, where she is getting used to her newly-fitted prosthetic legs with the aid of physiotherapists.  The health of her hands improved and she is keeping them busy by resuming her love of creative activities such as drawing, weaving and needlework.  Ruth is now looking forward to getting out of hospital to rejoin her family: husband Mark, 47, and their daughters, seven-year-old Lucia and Isabella, five.    But she can\u0026rsquot return to her New Street home in Musselburgh as it has an outdoor staircase and is no longer suitable, so the search for a new home is under way.  Now her friend Jacqueline Campbell has launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise \u0026pound20,000 to help fund a mobility scooter and adapt a new property.  In March, Ruth suddenly started to have breathing problems along with vomiting and diarrhoea.  Mark, a nurse at the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh, said she was rushed to the accident and emergency unit at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh by paramedics who assessed that she was suffering from sepsis, which can be triggered by an infection and affected her immune system.  He said: \u0026ldquoHer health deteriorated more and more and she was taken to the high dependency unit. They said they needed to ventilate Ruth and that was the last time I spoke to her for two-and-a-half weeks. She went into a medicalised coma.  Mark said it was still unknown what was causing the infection, so Ruth received multiple antibiotics.  \u0026ldquoThe consultant told me to prepare myself because we were losing Ruth, he said.  The medical team decided to take Ruth into theatre to connect an ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) circuit to help her breathing.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoThey managed to stabilise her but her vital organs were failing. Her respiratory had already failed and her kidneys had failed.  \u0026ldquoThere was no one as ill as Ruth in the whole of the UK at that time, receiving that amount of support to keep her alive.  Ruth was then transferred to a specialist ECMO unit at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoHer liver was failing and her heart was beginning to fail.  \u0026ldquoThey said again that they were losing Ruth and she wouldn\u0026rsquot last the in-patient stay.  \u0026ldquoThey made the decision to fit a second ECMO circuit to support her heart and this stabilised her.  \u0026ldquoI was told several times I might be potentially losing Ruth. Then things started improving and they were able to withdraw some of the support and her blood tests were showing very small improvements.  \u0026ldquoRuth was infected with group \u0026lsquoA\u0026rsquo streptococcal, a very aggressive bacteria which is around us all the time.  \u0026ldquoRuth\u0026rsquos immune system was already affected, so it was able to take over very quickly, causing failure to the vital organs. She was diagnosed with sepsis and pneumonia.  Ruth began to make progress with her breathing, her heart started to stabilise and her kidneys started to improve. Doctors felt they could remove the ECMO circuit for the heart and rescind the \u0026lsquodo not resuscitate\u0026rsquo notice.  As doctors brought Ruth out of sedation, she faced the risk of haemorrhaging throughout the body because of blood thinning and medications.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoI remember her opening her eyes and looking at me.  \u0026ldquoWe put our foreheads together and looked into each others\u0026rsquo eyes. I knew that Ruth was back.  \u0026ldquoHow close she was to dying on several occasions is still difficult to comprehend.  A special moment for Ruth was a visit by her daughters for her birthday when they took her cuddly toys and held her hand. Her mum and dad were also at her bedside.  Ruth was moved back to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, where her ventilator was removed and she was able to start to speak.  But as she got better, she was to face a huge decision as a result of the tissue damage, caused by the lack of blood flow, which had turned her feet black.  She was told she would have to lose her right foot and possibly half of her left foot, with surgery carried out at St John\u0026rsquos Hospital in Livingston.  But Ruth, determined to get the best quality of life, made the decision to lose both feet below the knee, which would give her more choices in terms of prosthetics and improve her recovery.    Mark paid tribute to the \u0026ldquowonderful hospital staff who had \u0026ldquogiven everything for Ruth.  He highlighted the help he had received from friends and family over the past few months, including the network of \u0026lsquoSupermums\u0026rsquo who looked after Lucia and Isabella, friends, neighbours and colleagues at the Western General.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe kindness of people has been overwhelming. They want to help so much.  The family have also received support from the charity \u0026lsquoFinding Your Feet\u0026rsquo, which helps families affected by amputation or limb difference.

North Berwick\u0026rsquos Law Primary School P6 pupils were looking forward to the trip to Yellowcraig, by Dirleton, where one class was due to camp out tonight (Wednesday) and another tomorrow (Thursday).  Two of the school\u0026rsquos four P6 classes had already taken part in the one-night camp last month.  In total, 54 youngsters were expected to camp out this week.  However, Jill Wareham, the school\u0026rsquos headteacher, contacted parents on Monday to say that a decision had been taken to cancel the overnight stays after \u0026ldquoa group of people camped near the field they use.  The school is still going ahead with the daytime activities planned as part of the camp but asked parents to pick up their children from Yellowcraig at 7pm.  Mrs Wareham told parents in an email: \u0026ldquoYou may be aware that there is a group of people camped near the field at Yellowcraig where we usually hold our camp out. This has various implications for our risk assessments for the trip and, having taken advice from a number of sources, we have decided not to stay overnight at the site this week.  \u0026ldquoWe realise this will be disappointing news and apologise for any inconvenience, but we will look into the possibility of the pupils having a night in tents at another venue after the summer.

A study is being launched to examine how the six secondary schools could work together to ensure they all start and end at the same time and follow a common timetable.  A meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos cabinet heard that high schools had historically been given considerable autonomy in planning their school days and \u0026ldquocurricular arrangements. But this had resulted in \u0026ldquosix different structures, length of the school day and different levels of access in terms of experience and opportunity. And there was \u0026ldquosignificant variation throughout East Lothian in the range of Advanced Higher and Higher courses offered and the number of qualifications available in S4.  The report, backed by councillors, said the feasibility study would aim to lead to the creation of \u0026ldquoa common secondary school day and a common curricular structure.  The move would also see a change in hours for primary schools to match the new secondary day, with proposals to extend P1 and P2 pupils\u0026rsquo week from 22.5 hours to the same 25 hours that their older school-mates follow. A failure to synchronise primary school start and finish times to match the high school changes would cost the council an estimated \u0026pound190,000 in additional transport costs.  A public consultation will now be launched with the schools to establish the best standard timetable, with options for a 27, 32 or 33-period week. A 33-period week, for instance, could see secondary students\u0026rsquo first period of the day start at 8.30am, with a finish time of 3.40pm Monday to Thursday and 12.55pm on Fridays.  The council said a common school day would lead to joint delivery, mutual support, sharing of best practice and collaborative professional development opportunities, as well as meaning greater equity of resource and opportunity for young people across East Lothian and barriers to travel would be reduced.  Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet spokesperson for education, said: \u0026ldquoThese proposals are all about improving inclusion, wellbeing and equality. We\u0026rsquore always keen to look for new ways of raising attainment and improving positive destinations for our children and young people.  \u0026ldquoThere are a number of potential practical benefits associated with such changes.

The operation at the site off Edinburgh Road took place last Thursday.  Sculptor Michael Johnson\u0026rsquos work, called \u0026lsquoMemory and Reflection\u0026rsquo, is 12ft high and 6ft feet wide.  The stainless steel sculpture depicts aspects of Musselburgh\u0026rsquos history with images of agriculture, people, connections to the sea, the river and the Romans. The face of the sculpture is mirror polished and reflects whatever stands before it.  Mr Johnson, from Nottinghamshire, sees these two aspects of the shell, the memory and reflection, as metaphors for a work which interprets the history of the town and offers a reflection of how the town is viewed now.  A working group made up of community representatives selected the mussel shell for the commission. Mr Johnson undertook activities with local groups and schoolchildren to create designs for bronze inserts incorporated onto the main sculpture.  The fisherfolk stone sculpture at Murdoch Green will be moved to a seating area in front of the Shell petrol station, also off Edinburgh Road.  The mussel shell is one of two works of art funded by Tesco at a cost of \u0026pound76,000 as part of the council\u0026rsquos Percent for Art policy, which was a condition of planning consent for the company\u0026rsquos present store.  The other is an archer planned for the banks of the River Esk, with its installation expected to be next week. A trail of arrows around the town is also planned and will link in with a Global Treasure App, a treasure trail organised by Musselburgh Area Partnership."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7959630.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Future of the Hollies Day Centre safeguarded","story":"              THE future of the Hollies Day Centre at its present location in Musselburgh has been safeguarded.  It has been confirmed that the much-loved facility for older people will continue as it is in its High Street home.  Fears were raised back in 2016 that the day centre might be forced to relocate or even cease to exist in its present form because a new day centre facility could not be accommodated within the current building.  East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership needed to provide at least 18 places of registered day care for people with complex care needs in Musselburgh given that it was the largest town in East Lothian. This was in line with need identified as part of a wider review of older people\u0026rsquos day centres.  This led to the partnership and the Hollies exploring the options available, which ranged from potentially adapting the current building to accommodate 18 people through to looking at possible other buildings if the Hollies couldn\u0026rsquot be adapted.  After nearly two years of talks, and Care Inspectorate and architects\u0026rsquo input, it was found that, in order to adapt the Hollies premises, the lunch club and public cafe would be lost at the expense of more than 100 users.  A joint decision remains to be made about the eight day care places already in existence at the Hollies current premises but, at present, there is agreement that these places will continue.  The health and social care partnership is now looking for somewhere else in Musselburgh to accommodate the other 10 places.  Following a meeting this month, the Hollies trustees have confirmed that agreement has been reached with the health and social care partnership that the status quo will remain at the day centre.  In a joint statement, the trustees said: \u0026ldquoThe Hollies distributed a consultation paper to service users and had 271 responses completed in two weeks. The overwhelming consensus of the people consulted is for the Hollies to continue providing the service it does now for the people of Musselburgh and surrounding areas. We have also received positive feedback on our proposed expansion of activities in the hall in the afternoons.  \u0026ldquoWe have agreed with the health and social care partnership that the Hollies should remain as it is. We are looking forward to continuing to work as before and to embark on exciting new projects to meet the wishes of all those who attend the Hollies.  Liz Shannon, centre manager, said: \u0026ldquoFunding is a constant battle for us all at the Hollies and we have been in limbo whilst these talks were taking place and have been unable to approach funders as we were unclear what funding we were asking for.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership has assured us they will continue to give funding at the current level for this financial year which is \u0026pound82,000 to continue to fund the eight registered places which we are grateful for in this transition period. However, that is less than a third of what it costs to run all our services and maintain the building.  \u0026ldquoThings are going to be very tight for the near future while we submit funding applications to funders like the lottery however, we are very excited at the prospect of moving forward and very grateful for the support from the people of Musselburgh and beyond.  Councillor Fiona O\u0026rsquoDonnell, health and social care spokesperson, said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased that the Hollies will continue to provide a wide range of services in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis was a really positive meeting and the plans to provide more activities in the Hollies are good news for local people.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership will continue its work to increase the amount of day support in Musselburgh for older people with complex care needs."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7959839.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Phonebox removed from centre of Haddington","story":"              A TRADITIONAL red phonebox has been removed from the centre of Haddington after it was used just once in a year.

Colin Beattie\u0027s comments follows a \"positive meeting\" with health bosses in the wake of patients\u0027 concerns about the service at the enlarged practice in the Musselburgh Primary Care Centre.  The Musselburgh MSP met with doctors and staff at the surgery, along with representatives from East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership.  Mr Beattie said: \"There is no doubt that there are issues around patients\u0026rsquo communication with the surgery, particularly at peak times. I was pleased that the surgery has recognised this and was in a position to give me a briefing on the situation.\"  He said doctors were now up to their full staffing level of 14 and an additional four staff members to take phone calls were in the process of being recruited.  During the visit, Mr Beattie had the chance to discuss other new initiatives which were \"positively transforming the surgery\".  He said: \"While much work seems to have been done, more still has to be achieved to improve the service to patients.  \"I am confident that Riverside and East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership are seriously addressing their remaining issues and I will be keeping in close contact going forward to ensure that my constituents receive the service they should expect.\"  He added that the practice was looking at introducing an online appointment booking system, which it is anticipated would reduce phone calls to the practice.  Riverside was also looking at different options as to how to more effectively manage phone calls at the volume it was receiving, he said.  Mr Beattie said: \"I have encouraged the practice to expedite the introduction of the online appointment booking system, which I feel will have the greatest and quickest effect on the experience of patients contacting the surgery.\"  He also raised the concerns of patients who might have to speak to multiple staff over a period before they were dealt with.  \"Clearly a single point of contact who can immediately direct the patient to the correct destination would be cheaper for the surgery and more efficient and less frustrating for the patient,\" added Mr Beattie."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7963766.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Child obesity plan targets energy drinks and supermarket checkout    pester power   ","story":"              A ban on selling energy drinks to children could be introduced under Government proposals to halve childhood obesity by 2030.

There are a great selection of seaside cafes all around the country to choose from, ranging from gourmet to traditional greasy spoons. Here\u0027s 15 of our favourites.  1.

There are new flavours on offer at The Mission every week: with cherry bakewell, mango and nutella just some of those produced in the past. And if that wasn\u0026rsquot enough, the scenic surroundings make a trip to Mallaig well worth the effort. If you can\u0026rsquot bear to tear yourself away from the scenery, then The Mission also does food to take away.  5. Sands, Aberdour  Beach front, Hawkcraig Road, Aberdour, Fife  Open every day 10am-5pm  01383 861473, www.facebook/Sands-A-Place-By-The-Sea-188201457968564  You can\u0026rsquot really get more seaside cafe than this, with a lovely outside seating area sat right on top of the Silver Sands beach.

Buckley\u0026rsquos, Prestwick  59 Main St, Prestwick, Ayrshire  Open Monday-Saturday, 8.30pm-5.30pm and Sunday 10am-4pm  01292 737787, www.buckleysprestwick  One of the more gourmet cafes on this list, Buckley\u0026rsquos have modernised the traditional seaside cafe into something a bit more high-end.

The food is freshly-prepared and locally sourced, and there are plenty of vegetarian and gluten-free options.

Scottish Canals said a major cash shortage meant maintaining navigation across its routes was \u0026ldquounsustainable, with barges facing being banished from key sections such as around the world-famous Falkirk Wheel.  But critics have blasted the plans, insisting it would leave parts of the ancient network no more than \u0026ldquostagnant ditches.  They accused those in charge of squandering a \u0026pound79 million fund to modernise the waterways at the turn of the millennium.  Labour\u0026rsquos shadow Scotland minister Paul Sweeney branded the proposals \u0026ldquoan absolute scandal, and called on SNP transport minister Humza Yousaf to intervene and guarantee that navigation on the canals will be maintained.  A Transport Scotland spokesman said it was in regular contact with canal bosses \u0026ldquoto discuss the opportunities and the challenges around maintaining these historic assets.  He said: \u0026ldquoScottish Canals have been allocated \u0026pound11.6m in the budget for 2018/19 with an increase of \u0026pound0.5m \u0026ndash 16 per cent \u0026ndash in the capital allocation to \u0026pound3.5m.  \u0026ldquoWe recognise the challenges faced by Scottish Canals and will continue to work in partnership to support the organisation in their operations and to explore potential sources of funding.  In comes after Scottish Canals revealed the future for parts of its 137-mile network \u0026ldquomay not necessarily include navigation.  In a strategy document, it said the two main canals will be the Caledonian and Crinan, which between them see some 85,000 boat movements a year. In comparison, the Forth and Clyde Canal between Glasgow and Bowling sees just 200.  Campaigners have condemned Scottish Canals\u0026rsquo handling of the network, insisting the lack of investment threatens jobs and tourism. Former canals boss Steven Dunlop has just taken over as the \u0026pound168,000-a-year boss of Scottish Enterprise.  Scottish Tory MSP Alison Harris said plans to shut sections of the network were a \u0026ldquocompletely unacceptable state of affairs.  She said: \u0026ldquoScottish Canals has failed to invest in maintaining its core product \u0026ndash the canal itself \u0026ndash and now we\u0026rsquore seeing the cost of that.  \u0026ldquoThis means even more revenue will be lost from tourism, there\u0026rsquos a risk the water quality will worsen through lack of use, and that businesses who rely on the canal will either close or relocate.  Catherine Topley, Scottish Canals\u0026rsquo interim CEO, said it simply did not have enough resources, meaning \u0026ldquohard decisions were inevitable."},{"url":null,"title":"Kevin McKenna  Proper scrutiny vital if Glasgow School of Art is to be rebuilt","story":"              ONE of the tiresome consequences of Scotland\u0026rsquos recent constitutional turbulence has been the steady expansion of a class of political chatteratti. Many take turns at sitting on the boards of worthy public bodies in the hope that they might get to touch the hems of politicians and thus make them seem interesting at each other\u0026rsquos dinner parties. They fluff around these elected members and write blogs about \u0026ldquoThe Constitution or \u0026ldquoBrexit or \u0026ldquoThe Democratic Deficit that are equalled in their pomposity by their tediousness.  They\u0026rsquore a harmless enough assortment of chiels and many put the large quantum of spare time they have to some use by playing musical chairs on Scotland\u0026rsquos swollen quangocracy. Where it begins to get a little more sinister is when this self-regarding political class guards each other\u0026rsquos backs on matters requiring public accountability, usually involving large sums of our money or nepotism.  Many have had a ball this week indulging in a bacchanal of grief over the fire that consumed the Glasgow School of Art\u0026rsquos beautiful Mackintosh building. This is not to suggest that the fire that raged last Friday night and Saturday morning did not merit widespread dismay. The Mackintosh is one of only a handful of buildings which have come partly to define the cities they adorn. In time Dundee\u0026rsquos new V\u0026ampA will also surely come to find a place in that city\u0026rsquos heart.  The Mackintosh seeped into Glasgow\u0026rsquos soul because it possessed something of what we like to think we\u0026rsquore about: unconventional, idiosyncratic and blessed with a subtle wit. That Charles Rennie Mackintosh insisted on designing a living, breathing place of work for generations of our most creative talents \u0026ndash and not something inert and aloof \u0026ndash enchanted us further.  Our sadness was intensified by the knowledge that the fire occurred at the end of a \u0026pound35 million restoration process following the first fire in 2014. Then, as now, there was deep sorrow at the damage caused to the Mackintosh and this seemed to sweep aside niggling questions about the management of such a fragile and elegant building.  Thus, we were never adequately told why there was no working sprinkler system on site at the time. The response that \u0026ldquoa new one was in the midst of being fitted just doesn\u0026rsquot cut it. Nor was it explained why artistic installations requiring the use of highly flammable materials were being encouraged in such a building.  In a coruscating article for the Scottish Review last week Eileen Reid, the former Head of Widening Participation at Glasgow School of Art, cut through all the hand-wringing and lamentation. \u0026ldquoIn truth, the seeds of the Mack\u0026rsquos destruction were sown long before both fires, she wrote. \u0026ldquoMembers of staff and alumni who raised issues about the safety of the building for years prior to 2014 had to remain tight-lipped after the first fire, or condemned as churlish in the wave of sympathy and grief. Fire experts are shaking their heads in disbelief. Where, they ask, was the full modern preventative technology that exists for life safety and property protection?  Like many others, Ms Reid is seeking answers to some basic questions about the responsibilities of GSA\u0026rsquos Board of Trustees. The board, by deployment of its PR machine and the pledges of support from international luminaries, managed to escape close scrutiny following the first fire. It\u0026rsquos deeply concerning that some of the same questions arising from the first conflagration remain present in the second one. There is a case for the resignation of the board of directors while the investigation takes place.  Others may feel that it is only after such an investigation that roles should be examined. It was surely unwise to distance themselves from any degree of responsibility following the second fire, just as they had done after the first one.  It\u0026rsquos also crucial to our expectations of openness and accountability \u0026ndash especially where so much public money is involved \u0026ndash that there should be a public inquiry into the causes of both fires and the stewardship of the building. By its very nature Glasgow is an optimistic and cheery city and by the end of this week there is hope that the fa\u0026ccedilade at least might be saved for any rebuilding of the Mackintosh building.  Early cost estimates of the work involved in this seem to have gathered around a figure of \u0026pound200m. If that\u0026rsquos an early estimate the actual cost will probably be much greater. Those who have been weeping and gnashing their teeth over cocktails and glasses of Sauvignon Blanc have been remarkably breezy about the cost. They always are when it\u0026rsquos other people\u0026rsquos money. \u0026ldquoWell, of course we must re-build the Mack darlings, no matter the cost: it\u0026rsquos soooo iconic.  Less than a mile to the east of Glasgow city centre are to be found some of the most disadvantaged and deprived neighbourhoods in western Europe. Places where the struggle to survive is fought on a day-to-day basis have become iconic for different reasons. The inequality in this city is such that many can only press their faces up against the glass walls that separate them from the complacent elites and their high-minded pretences and caprices.  They are not so insular as to resist slices of capital expenditure by estimating how many hospitals and nurses they might otherwise fund. They might never have visited the Mackintosh in its former glory and may never set foot in any attempted facsimile of it. Credit them, though, with a knowledge of ageless beauty and of those things that genuinely enhance our city\u0026rsquos reputation. They don\u0026rsquot need to be lectured on how much Mackintosh\u0026rsquos great masterpiece means to Glasgow.  They also know the value of money much more than those of us who exist in our cosseted, indolent, political bubbles. If this city of extremes is to be granted leave to spend several hundred million reconstructing the Mack, they\u0026rsquoll want to know that the responsibility for such a massive outlay resides in people who can be trusted and who do not care about OBEs and swanning about the west end."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/7965431.jpg?type=article-full","title":"Game of Thrones couple marry in real life in Scotland","story":"              GAME of Thrones stars Kit Harington and Rose Leslie have tied the\u0026nbspknot in a Scottish church.

Their parents, Vikki and Paulo, open the second half in a specially made prop rocket, which soars round the top of the ring while the pair perform jaw dropping aerial stunts.  \"When we booked the rocket act people thought that of course we would finish with that,\" says Burton. \"[But] I wanted to end by making a serious point about the future of the circus and that is all about the next generation. Looking at the talent of these kids, the future is bright.\"  Running a circus is no mean feat. On its UK tour Zippos will travel up to 6,000 miles, with 24 loads required to take the circus from one location to another. It takes the 15-strong technical crew six hours to rebuild the big top each time. Then there\u0027s the job of pulling in the punters. Burton admits last year was not a particularly strong one, but this year advance ticket sales are already up 35 per cent across Scotland.  Burton started as an outsider \u0026ndash or josser, as people who aren\u0027t born into circus families are known. He took a childhood passion further as a student and joined a mime troupe (in which David Bowie was briefly a member) before becoming a clown. Despite promises to his mother he\u0027d get \u0026ldquoa real job after three years, he never looked back. After an escape trick went wrong he spent a year in a burns unit and then set up Zippos as an all-human circus. Domestic animals \u0026ndash horses and budgies \u0026ndash were introduced later, he claims due to public demand.  Animal rights campaigners disagree vehemently, and Burton claims he and his family have received death threats. This year, activists handed out leaflets outside Zippos before opening performances, warning of poor treatment of the horses. Animal rights organisation One Kind, which campaigned hard to secure Scotland\u0027s ban on wild animals introduced in May, claims the circus is no place for domestic animals, where it says they are exploited in the name of entertainment.  Yet Tamerlan Khadikov, from Kazakhstan \u0026ndash who owns all six of the horses travelling with this year\u0027s show \u0026ndash and Martin Burton are adamant that if there were any welfare concerns whatsoever they would be closed down. Restrictions are tighter in the UK than elsewhere, insists Khadilkov, who will take the horses back to their base on his farm in the Czech Republic after the tour is over.  He claims never to have slept in a house \u0026ldquoapart from a few nights in a hotel and last had a break from tour about three or four years ago. \u0026ldquoThe great thing about this life is when you want to see another country you just find a circus that tours there and get a contract, he says. \u0026ldquoIf I\u0027m more than a certain time in one place I get nervous.  Veteran ringmaster Norman Barrett, now 83, who refuses to sit down wearing his costume (it\u0027s one of many circus superstitions), explains. \u0026ldquoWhatever we do in this crazy life of ours, and it\u0027s a wonderful life, we are all doing it from our hearts. This is our life. It\u0027s not a job. Our whole day centres around what we are going to do in that ring at showtime. Cut circus people open, he says, and it\u0027s sawdust, not blood, you\u0027ll find. His father was a farmer who loved the circus so much he set up a ring in the barn, trained the horses and eventually went professional. Barrett was born in 1935 and remembers his father touring London in wartime.  So what is the future of the circus? \"It will always be there, says Barrett emphatically. Alexis hedges: \"It will change of course, it will adapt ... Barrett jumps in: \"Well, that\u0027s good, is it not? We want it to change.  \u0026ldquoCircus is evolving, agrees Pablo Garcia, who is helping his sons with their daily training. \u0026ldquoThere\u0027s different types and a lot of variety shows. But I think circus has got a bright future. We\u0027ve certainly never been short of work and hopefully they, he signals to the boys, \u0026ldquowill have the same experience.  None of this family can imagine any other life. Pablo\u0027s mother\u0027s connections go back generations while his father arrived in Scotland as a refugee from the Spanish civil war and was circus trained by an uncle. His wife, Vikki, comes from the famous Pinder family who owned both circuses and fairgrounds for more than seven generations, and are old hands at dealing with change.  John Haze, director of the Moscow State Circus and Circus of Horrors, says the galloping pace of development in recent decades has been thrilling. Yet it\u0027s not been easy in recent years, with many people constrained by austerity. \"Luckily the [film] Greatest Showman came knocking,\" he says. \"It has been a shot in the arm for the circus. And the circus just keeps on re-inventing itself. It\u0027s more diverse than ever.  Street performances, festivals, west end shows ... circus is now everywhere according to Professor Vanessa Toulmin, a researcher in circus and fairground history from Sheffield University. She tells stories of the original circus buildings \u0026ndash Hengler\u0027s Circus in Sauchiehall Street was one of the best in the UK \u0026ndash of groundbreaking women trapeze artists and of an incredible art form that soared from its illegitimate roots (it needed no planning or licence unlike stage shows) to become the darling of the establishment \u0026ndash Queen Victoria was a big fan. And 250 years later its appeal endures. \"I think it\u0027s the romance that still draws people in, says Toulmin. \"Performers travel the world, they see amazing things. But they are ordinary people. Ordinary people doing extraordinary things."},{"url":null,"title":"Former spokesman for the Defend Tommy Sheridan campaign hired by Scottish Labour","story":"              A POET who believes perjurer Tommy Sheridan was the victim of a conspiracy has been hired by Scottish Labour as one of the party\u0026rsquos new community organisers.  Jim Monaghan, who was the spokesman for the Defend Tommy Sheridan Campaign, will be paid around \u0026pound30,000 a year to help build a \u0026ldquosustainable coalition for \u0026ldquosocial change.  However, a senior party source blasted the move, saying: \u0026ldquoThis is an absolutely staggering decision that has stunned the party. Jim Monaghan is a wild conspiracy theorist who has defended convicted perjurer Tommy Sheridan. Organisers are among the most vital party staff members, in charge of local campaigning operations and responsible for speaking directly to voters. This is like the SNP putting the cybernats in charge of door knocking. It\u0026rsquos utterly bewildering.  Labour advertised for seven organiser posts in February, three of which were to be based north of the border.  The job advert stated that successful applicants should have the ability to work with a \u0026ldquovariety of stakeholders and Monaghan landed one of the jobs. However, he has had strong ties to Sheridan, who is considered to be a toxic figure on the left.  The former Glasgow MSP, who used to lead the Scottish Socialist Party, won a \u0026pound200,000 defamation case against the now-defunct News of the World in 2006 amid claims he was an adulterer and swinger.  Conflicting evidence led to a police investigation and Sheridan was charged with perjury, after which a lengthy criminal trial took place in 2010. Monaghan was a defence witness in the trial.  A jury found Sheridan guilty of perjury, part of which explicitly related to a trip Sheridan and others made to a sex club in Manchester.  BBC footage on the day of Sheridan\u0026rsquos sentencing showed Monaghan clapping the former MSP as he walked to court. He had also previously carried out paid work for Sheridan\u0026rsquos then solicitor.  Monaghan was also a volunteer on the campaign to \u0026ldquodefend the politician and planned a book - A Parcel o\u0027 Rogues: The Tommy Sheridan Conspiracy - which he later abandoned.  He also acted as \u0026ldquonational press and media spokesperson for Solidarity - the party Sheridan helped form after quitting the SSP - before joining Labour in 2010.  Monaghan wrote at the time: \u0026ldquoObviously, there is a long and hard battle within Labour and it isn\u0026rsquot one that will even take place, never mind be decided, in the context of the current leadership election. I am confident that, for at least the next few years, it is best for me and for my community that I work within the Labour party.  In December, the Sunday Herald revealed that Monaghan was one of the warm up acts at a Labour event attended by UK and Scottish leaders Jeremy Corbyn and Richard Leonard. He read poetry on the night.  Asked last year if he still believed Sheridan was the victim of a conspiracy, Monaghan said: \u0026ldquoYes, absolutely.  Monaghan\u0026rsquos Facebook page stated that he started a \u0026ldquonew job as a community organiser on June 18.  In 2016, the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission (SCCRC) - the official body that considers potential miscarriages of justice - declined to refer Sheridan\u0027s case to the High Court.  Sheridan pursued a judicial review of SCCRC decision, but it emerged last week that this latest legal bid had failed.  A Scottish Labour spokesperson said: \"We don\u0027t comment on staff.\""},{"url":null,"title":"Council workers blast degrading pay offer","story":"              COUNCIL bosses on six figure salaries are to pocket \u0026pound1,000 more than cleaners, carers and refuse workers, a new report says.  Chief executives are each to get an annual flat rate increase of \u0026pound1,600 in the pay deal for Scotland\u0027s councils.  However, lower paid workers offered a 3 per cent rise are in line for just \u0026pound600 extra, it was claimed.  The \"disparity\" was highlighted in new findings published by the GMB union.  GMB officials say finance secretary Derek Mackay told them in negotiations that the deal gave council workers equal value.  However, the Sunday Herald spoke to home helps, refuse workers and janitors, who said the offer was worth just a few pounds a week to them.  Last night, staff said the deal was an \"insult\" and \"degrading\" to them.  The GMB said the biggest cash lift goes to well paid executives rather than workers who have had a decade at the \"coal face of austerity\".  Nearly all Scotland\u0027s 32 local authority chief executives \u0026ndash all of whom are to get a \u0026pound1,600 flat rate increase - are on annual six figure salaries.  Under the pay deal, the \u0026pound1,600 flat rate is paid to all those on salaries over \u0026pound80,000.  There is a 2 per cent offer for all employees earning \u0026pound36,501 - \u0026pound80,000.  Workers earning less than \u0026pound36,500 get 3 per cent under the deal.  However, the GMB said it was worth just a few pounds a week to most of its staff in the 3 per cent bracket.  Last week, nearly 30,000 workers rejected the offer forward by local government body Cosla by a 92 per cent to 8 per cent margin.  The GMB has notified Cosla and the Scottish Government of the rejection of the deal,  Union officials say the dispute could spark a wave of summer strikes.  GMB Scotland senior organiser Drew Duffy said: \"They (workers) have been living and working at the coal face of austerity for the last decade, enduring freezes and real-terms cuts to their pay and conditions.  \"It is offensive to them when the finance secretary says this offer treats local government staff with \"equal value\".  Meanwhile, home helps, refuse workers and janitors said the 3 per cent pay offer was derisory.  Speaking on condition of anonymity, staff savaged the deal.  A female home help, who has worked in Glasgow for 20 years, said she was paid between \u0026pound17,000 and \u0026pound18,000 a year.  Under the 3 per cent offer, she said any increase would be less than \u0026pound10 a week.  She said: \"What we\u0027ve been offered is an insult and it\u0027s degrading.  \"Being a home help is such a wide ranging job and it\u0027s not simply caring for someone at home.  \"You are not just making someone a cup of tea, you are making sure that they are clean and that they are not lonely.  \"Yet what we\u0027re getting offered is just a few pounds a week.  \"It makes life difficult and a lot of the girls have to take on second jobs.\"  A rubbish collection worker in Midlothian said he had lost \u0026pound11,000 due to a decade of austerity and pay restraint.  The worker, who has been in post for 19 years and is on a salary of \u0026pound22,500, said the deal was \"blatantly unfair\".  He said a fairer deal would be for the lowest paid to get the \u0026pound1,600 flat rate, while chief executives get a capped sum of about \u0026pound250.  \"The 3 per cent increase is making no impact at all,\" he said.  He added: \"We\u0027ve lost \u0026pound11,000 in the last 10 years of austerity, so 3 per cent is nothing.  \"It\u0027s been happening year in year out. It\u0027s penny pinching by the government.\"  Another council worker said pay restraint meant she had been forced to go without holidays.  The woman, a security assistant in Aberdeen on annual pay of \u0026pound20,000, said she would be just a few pounds better off under the deal.  She said: \"For the past 10 years we\u0027ve had to accept low pay while the cost of living goes up higher than that.  \"Council rent also goes up and it\u0027s a real struggle to survive on the cash you are on.  \"With holidays if I scrimped and saved, I might get a week\u0027s holiday and I did last year, but not this year.\"  The security worker said the pay hikes for chief executives should be clawed back and redistributed among lower paid workers.  She said: \"They are not having any hardship and there is question of do they really need that.\"  A janitor who has worked in North Lanarkshire for 19 years said she would get just a few extra pounds on added to her \u0026pound21,000 salary under the deal.  She said: \"The pay gap has got ridiculously big.  \"There are a lot of people working who still can\u0027t feed their kids.\"  In response, a Scottish Government spokesman said: \u0026ldquoPay for local government employees, other than teachers, is negotiated between the unions and Cosla and the Scottish Government is not part of that process.  Cosla\u0027s resources spokeswoman Gail Macgregor added: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos the role of any trade union to seek to improve the terms and conditions of their members and I entirely get that, however, councils have to operate within the budget available to them."},{"url":null,"title":"Call to allow MSPs annual access visits to Dungavel detention centre","story":"              THE UK Government is facing a call to allow MSPs to make annual visits to the controversial Dungavel immigration centre.  Campaigners say the ban on MSPs visiting the holding centre in South Lanarkshire should be lifted, but the Home Office says that visits are generally only for MPs due to immigration being a policy area that is reserved to Westminster.  However, Glasgow MSP Pauline McNeill has said that the rule should be scrapped and MSPs should be allowed to check on the welfare of detainees.  She said that all MSPs should be able to make an annual visit in light of concerns that have been raised over the conditions and treatment of inmates.  \u0026ldquoMSP\u0026rsquos must be allowed access to witness the conditions in which people being detained in this country are being held,\" she said.  \"I\u0026rsquom calling for Members of the Scottish Parliament to be granted access to the site on an annual basis.  \"Members of the Scottish Parliament must be able to satisfy themselves that the welfare and health needs of the people being detained are being attended to.  \"By visiting the centre members would be fulfilling the normal duties and rights of elected members in any democracy.\"  Critics of UK immigration policy have expressed concerns about the length of time asylum seekers are held at Dungavel.  Reports on Dungavel have shown that dozens of detainees have been held at the facility for months at a time, and in some instances, for over a year.  The Sunday Herald previously spoke to former detainees, who claimed vulnerable people were held in prison like conditions at the site.  McNeill said Scottish Secretary David Mundell should use his influence to get the Home Office to lift the ban.  She added: \u0026ldquoI have serious concerns not only about the way the site is being run, but also by the attitude the UK Government is taking in regards to this issue.  \"I myself had to write to David Mundell on a number of occasions before receiving a response.  \"I am calling on David Mundell to support me in seeking annual visits for Members of the Scottish Parliament.  \"It is not acceptable that the concerns of Members of the Scottish Parliament about the treatment of people from the communities we represent are being ignored.  Meanwhile, SNP MPs Stuart McDonald and Joanna Cherry are to be allowed to visit Dungavel after demanding access.  McDonald, the SNP\u0026rsquos spokesman on immigration, asylum and border control, and Cherry, the party\u0027s justice and home affairs spokeswoman, wrote to the Home Office asking for permission.  McDonald said a date had yet to be set for a visit.  However, he said MSPs should also be allowed to check on the welfare of detainees, as he backed McNeill\u0027s call.  He said: \"The Home Office has a pretty bad record on this. It (Dungavel) should be open to all.\"  In response, a Home Office spokesman said: \"Individuals or organisations who do not have a statutory right of access and who wish to view an immigration removal centre are required under the provisions of the detention centre rules 2001 to obtain the permission of the Secretary of State.  \u0026ldquoRequests to visit are carefully considered to preserve the privacy and dignity of the individuals detained and to avoid a disproportionate number of visits."},{"url":null,"title":"Scotland well placed for PIP powers says minister","story":"              THIS week the MS Society launched their report \u0026lsquoPIP: A step too far\u0026rsquo which outlined the impact of the \u0026lsquo20 metre rule\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash the rule that bars anyone who can walk that distance unaided from receiving the enhanced rate of PIP \u0026ndash has had on those living with multiple sclerosis.  They found large numbers of those reassessed from DLA to PIP had lost that higher rate of support, with three quarters of those affected saying that the change had had a negative impact on their life.  This is the latest in a series of examples where people living with a debilitating health condition have been let down by the UK Government.  In February this year, the House of Commons Work and Pensions Select Committee published a damning report, along with a series of recommendations, about the assessment processes of the UK Government\u0026rsquos Personal Independent Payment (PIP) and Employment and Support Allowance (ESA).  These are recommendations for the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) to respond to by halting the roll-out of PIP to allow them to make serious changes \u0026ndash something we have called for consistently.  And, whilst ESA remains a reserved benefit the Scottish Government cannot change, I have taken a particular interest in the Committee\u0026rsquos recommendations on PIP as, by the end of this Parliamentary term in 2021, we will have taken over responsibility from the DWP for 11 benefits, including PIP. I am reassured that so many of the recommendations reflect what we are already doing in Scotland.  This government is clear that social security is a human right and one that people should be able to access in a way that treats them with dignity and respect. This principle is so important it is enshrined on the very first page of our new Social Security (Scotland) Act.  There is a noticeable common thread that runs through the House of Commons Committee\u0026rsquos recommendations, which is that the current system places significant and undue stress on people, through unclear communications, appearing to require the repeated provision of evidence and \u0026lsquohealth\u0026rsquo assessments that seem ill suited to understanding fluctuating conditions amongst others.  This is exactly what we have heard through our own engagement with our Experience Panels - 2,400 people with personal and direct experience of the current system. Our new social security agency \u0026ndash Social Security Scotland \u0026ndash is being co-designed using that experience and knowledge, and that of our stakeholder reference groups and user research. We are determined to design and build systems and processes that work for people, not against them.  For example, we have held a forum with people to understand the issues with the current DWP application process and in particular the self-assessment form so that we can make the improvements people need.  We will ensure that all information is accessible and we are also developing an online route for applications, as well as Easy-Read and other accessible formats.  We are committed to ensuring that people are offered a choice of ways to apply for disability benefits, including in person, online, paper and telephone.  We are continuing to test these with people who receive benefits to explore what other communication channels we should provide.  I understand the stress and anxiety that can accompany current DWP face-to-face assessments. And an important commitment that I am making to people in Scotland is that we will reduce these as much as possible. Our Act specifically states that face to face assessments will only be held if necessary and crucially will never be with a private contractor.  Key to this is ensuring that we gather appropriate evidence at the initial stage.  The person applying clearly knows best what they need but we are also exploring the range of health, social care and other evidence that could be used to support quality decision making, significantly reduce the need for face-to-face assessments and increase the number of lifetime and genuinely long-term awards.  We will take into account the needs of the individual to determine whether a home visit is needed, and people will be entitled to have someone with them to give support every step of the way.  And anyone who, because of a disability, finds it difficult to engage fully with us, will have the right to independent advocacy support.  Through our work we will meet all of the Work and Pension Select Committee\u0026rsquos recommendations on what should be done, where we have the powers to do so.  The chance to create something different in Scotland is there. The chance to introduce a greater level of compassion and respect into our country\u0026rsquos social security service is one we fully intend to take."},{"url":null,"title":"Citizens Advice Scotland comment  Decision-makers should experience the reality of debt before making financial policy","story":"              Earlier this month Andy Haldane, chief economist of the Bank of England, gave a talk at TedX in Glasgow entitled \"Putting the public back in public institutions\". Echoing an opinion piece he\u0026rsquod written in The Herald a few days earlier, his theme was that members of the public should have more input into the thought processes of the bank\u0026rsquos monetary committee, as he wanted to ensure that the decisions they make reflect the real experience of people across the UK.  It\u0026rsquos a fine objective, and Mr Haldane is an entertaining speaker. His address was amusing and thoughtful, and he clearly has a passion for the subject.  We were a little surprised, therefore, when he voted last week to increase interest rates \u0026ndash something that will have a harmful impact on millions of people across the country. Not least those who are in debt.  The Scottish Citizens Advice network sees people every day who are drowning in debt, and struggling to get by. Last year nearly 36,000 sought our advice, and many of these were people with multiple debts.  Nor is this just a crisis for people who come to us. A recent survey we commissioned of the general public in Scotland found that one in five Scots finds it difficult to cope financially. The same proportion say they always or almost always run out of money before payday. A further 21% say this sometimes happens.  In the last year, 15% of Scots had been turned down for credit, and for more than two-thirds of these people the reason was a poor credit rating. Nearly a third (31%) had been told they weren\u0026rsquot earning enough and 25% that they had too much debt already.  So much for the statistics. What\u0026rsquos it actually like being in debt with no realistic hope of getting out of it?  Any CAB adviser hears the same litany from their clients every day: the sleepless nights, the shame of sending your kids to school in old clothes, or standing in the supermarket waiting for the discount shelves to be filled. The stigma of the walk to the foodbank, the ever-growing piles of unpaid bills, pretending not to be in when the doorbell rings, wondering how you can ever square your debts when you\u0026rsquore already having to choose between eating and heating. These are the people who will be hit hardest by interest rate rises, and whose voices are least often heard.  Of course monetary policy should not become entirely directed by opinion polls or even focus groups. There is a reason why the Bank of England is independent of political control. These decisions must be made in the interests of the whole economy, and that means tough decisions at times made by experts with an eye towards the future and not just the present.  But we welcome Mr Haldane\u0026rsquos commitment to learning more about the lived experience of everyday people. In that spirit, I suggest he undertake a series of visits to the CAB service, starting here in Scotland where he could sit in on some debt advice sessions (with the client\u0026rsquos permission of course). His invitation is in the post.  Derek Mitchell is chief executive of Citizens Advice Scotland."},{"url":null,"title":"Former UK minister says Tory Brexit plans are a    land grab of epic proportions   ","story":"              FORMER UK Labour cabinet minister Andrew Adonis says that the Tory government\u0026rsquos Brexit bill is a \u0026ldquoland grab of epic proportions from Scotland.

After the transfer of powers from Brussels to Whitehall and Westminster, London will take charge of policy areas traditionally devolved to Holyrood.  The SNP has said that means demolishing the principle at the heart of the devolution settlement by giving Westminster the final say on many devolved policy areas, and Adonis warned that the UK Government\u0027s plans showed how \"centralised\" Britain would become after leaving the EU.

The plot developed as follows: the Italian interior and infrastructure ministers, Matteo Salvini and Danilo Toninelli - both in their first month in office - refused to allow passengers on the humanitarian vessel Aquarius to disembark on Italian land earlier this month.  The ship, run by NGO SOS M\u0026eacutediterran\u0026eacutee and charity Doctors Without Borders, had been sailing in international waters off Libya for hours after having taken in hundreds of migrants from collapsing rafts, and others previously rescued by the Italian Coast Guard and Navy. Their request to dock was eventually refused by the coast guard head office in Rome, as well as by authorities in nearby Malta.  The Italian government steadily settled on its position it called for more action from other European countries, and claimed they failed in their duties to help manage the situation, leaving southern countries alone to deal with the emergency.  After hours of uncertainty and with passengers becoming increasingly exhausted - among them were 123 minors and seven pregnant women, some with serious fuel burns according to the volunteers \u0026ndash the tug-of-war ended up when Spain\u0026rsquos new prime minister, Pedro S\u0026aacutenchez, offered a safe harbour to Aquarius in Valencia.  Despite the length of the journey, partly caused by the vessel having to combat poor weather conditions, it arrived safely in the port of Valencia last Sunday morning, after spending a week at sea. The passengers will be allowed to stay on Spanish soil for 45 days before starting legal procedures to obtain refugee status.  The docking of Aquarius was welcomed by many who gathered in the port of Valencia. Nevertheless, the event was not not immune to protests, with groups of locals rallying against the new Spanish government\u0026rsquos decision.  The episode caused international havoc, including a steep deterioration in relations between Italy and its neighbouring countries after French President Emmanuel Macron described Italy\u0026rsquos actions as \u0026ldquorevolting. However, France has also been strongly criticised for its harsh border policies, with reported violent clashes between the French patrolling forces in the focal points of Ventimiglia and Bardonecchia.  On the other hand, countries such as Austria and Hungary - both led by far-right, anti-European parties - praised the Italian stance, while German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Italy should not be left alone in handling the migratory flow.  All of this represents a turning point in Italian politics that reflects how a country known for its welcoming spirit has deeply changed in recent decades, culminating with the rise to power of the far-right.  Italy and the politics of rhetoric  The surge of widespread anti-European feeling in a country that was among the founders of what we now call the European Union, is no last-minute occurrence and was not ignited uniquely by the migratory boom.  Public sentiment has been building up in the last three decades and is strictly intertwined with the complex socio-economic and political framework the Italians have been experiencing throughout the period.  Even before the financial crisis began in 2008, there was a progressive deterioration of Italian life conditions due to strict budgetary policies which had been followed by both left wing and right wing governments.  The impact of this somewhat austere attitude has, however, to be seen in the context of the structural malfunction of the state within the country: together with an intrinsic corruption concentrated both on local and national level, this has clogged the economic system in Italy, which has had profound consequences on the welfare state. This was reflective of a worsening of life conditions, especially among the poorest tiers of the population: 29 per cent of people who lost their jobs in the aftermath of the crisis where already among the poorest fifth of the population, hitting hard working-class families particularly hard.  Employment rates, although now recovering after the crisis, weigh like a sword of Damocles on the economic revival, especially because of how badly affected young people are. Youth unemployment rates reached a peak of more than 44 per cent in August 2014 and have now settled at around 21 per cent. In this period, people between the ages of 15 and 34 have often been forced to leave the country to pursue better opportunities, creating a vicious loop that keeps preventing the expansion of the economy in Italy. Over-65s now account for over 22 per cent of the total population, the highest rate in the EU (in the UK it is 18 per cent).  Many Italians attribute much of this grim situation to the switch from local currency - the Italian Lira - to the Euro. What appeared in front of our eyes was that prices everywhere doubled, without any change to salaries. Many people in their mid-twenties or thirties who, like me, experienced the introduction of the Euro as kids in 2002, would recall that the price of the much beloved Goleador candies went from 100 Lire, which was the equivalent of \u0026euro0.05, to \u0026euro0.10, which was a hard hit to our weekly pocket money.  The switch deeply affected the Italian mindset towards Europe, even if figures later suggested that its actual impact was somewhat different to the perception: inflation annual rates kept on average at around two per cent in the period between 2002 and 2015 (with peaks of 3.5 per cent in 2008), and at the same time prices went up by about 31 per cent between 2001 and 2016. Decline was a gradual process which other global factors had contributed to, rather than a sudden twist as a result of the Euro alone.  Then came the financial crisis, which was a global earthquake but from which, given the preexisting structural problems, Italy struggled particularly hard to emerge from. A new wave of restrictive policies, emanated by the European Union, did not play in favour of the already difficult economic context in the country.  After that came the migrant crisis. Positioned right in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea, Italy had offered a pier for migrants way before the 2000s. Immigration coming from African former colonies - such as Libya and Eritrea - was already common in the 1970s, and there was a boom of migrants from Albania in 1991 after the fall of the communist bloc.  However, with the outbreak of the Arab springs in 2010 and the following conflict in Syria, more and more people started fleeing their homes, often leaving from the shores of Northern Africa. The arrivals then weighed mainly on the Mediterranean frontiers of Italy, Spain, Greece and Malta - all of which were already on their knees after the financial crisis.  The increasing numbers of people seemed to jeopardize the social fabric all over the country. In some areas, the lack of a solid integration system was exploited by organised criminality, which could suck in a huge amount of cheap, unregulated workforce into its web, as revealed by many investigations carried out in the last few years.  In any case, the problem of people entering the country without the tools to access the work market \u0026ndash which was already saturated after the crisis - created a further layer of poverty, as well as the feeling that migrants either were criminals or were there to steal jobs.  All of this was an explosive mix for a country in which, unlike Germany, part of the population still had not come to terms with its own historical past. Italy has never fully exorcised the ghosts of the fascist era: although very rarely engaging in explicit expressions, it was not rare to hear older generations praising some of Mussolini\u0026rsquos deeds \u0026ldquoback then. The lack of strong leadership in recent times has left people hungry for a strong character, which we now see in Salvini, who has reinvented himself as \u0026ldquoThe Captain, as his followers call him.  Added to this is a strong campaign against the so-called \u0026ldquoIslamic invasion, reinforced by the climate created by the many terrorist attacks in Europe in recent years, and the emergence of a battle based on the contrast of cultural values and traditions. In this picture the Italian people are good, and they are up against the bad migrants. The latter, according to far-right rhetoric, don\u0026rsquot embrace local culture and instead expect locals to adapt to their values, while creating large pools of criminality.  The left parties which led the country in the last decade appeared unable to overcome these social difficulties and to become an effective mediator between the different peoples living on Italian soil.  Now, the Northern League is reaping the rewards after years of campaigning against what they call \u0026ldquoinvasion and channelling the frustration created by the economic crisis through a communication strategy based on loudly shouted slogans - from \u0026ldquoItalians first to \u0026ldquoclose the ports.  Such hostility used to be reserved to the southern regions of the country. In fact, one of the League\u0026rsquos founding motives was the separation of northern Italy from the south: an area where the economy struggled due to a lack of attention from the state. This enabled the surge of the mafia historically, and it presented a very different landscape to the north. The latter was industrialized and attracted people from the south who would migrate in search of work and better lifestyles. Times have changed, but this division is still present and, therefore, the first battles of the League were against its own migrants.  However, in recent times it has left behind this ancestral antagonism and made national identity and a focus on Italian people\u0026rsquos needs in opposition to the needs of immigrants its new leading force.  Many voters subscribed to this new message, although it failed in the last election to prevent the Five Star Movement becoming the first party in the south.  By focusing their campaigns on easily accessible channels like social media and riding the increasing popularity of such tools as the only information sources people rely on, the parties have hit the right spot in the locals\u0026rsquo minds and gathered consent from new layers of society.  It is a largely shared opinion that Europe, too, has its own share of responsibility for the fragmentation emerging: the lack of political and legal uniformity, not only concerning migrants, has resulted in a political alienation in which Italy perceived itself to be left abandoned.  Sergio Belardinelli, professor of cultural processes sociology at University of Bologna, says the crisis in attitudes has been a long time in the making: \u0026ldquoThe immigration phenomenon was taken very lightheartedly ages ago, and this is probably due to the Italian left as well as a certain part of the Catholic world.  \u0026ldquoThis allowed the right-wing parties to fan the flames, resulting in what happens today and what we see in the roughness of the solutions proposed by the far-right parties.  \u0026ldquoThis is strongly related to the cultural crisis that has been affecting Europe for a long time and to the voiding of concepts such as identity: The European identity was characterised by an inclusive approach which embraced diversity.  This is losing importance, according to Belardinelli, whereas national identities are being politically weaponised. Furthering the European ideal of national identity being defined by openness and inclusivity is now very difficult.  CONCLUSION  On June 28 a summit will be held in Brussels to discuss the new terms under which the European Union will deal with incoming migrant arrivals, and with the possible reformulation of the Dublin agreement.  However, although Italy has tried to force other members to open up and share responsibilities, the leading forces seem even more eager to keep their frontiers shut. What European leaders are doing now is extremely dangerous as this will only further exacerbate the resentment of people living in the arrival countries and, with Poland expressing its desire for a \u0026ldquoPolexit, could be a gift for those who want to see the Union disrupted.  Nevertheless, Italy is at a crossroads at the moment. Many voices have risen on social media to oppose the government\u0026rsquos new approach on migration, and a wave of fact-checking websites have joined the choir attempting to halt widespread myths on immigration and other related topics. Public personalities from the left, such as Gomorrah writer Roberto Saviano, recently participated in a public campaign against Salvini.  However, it has had little effect on moving public opinion one way or the other. There is a general mistrust towards the left. Besides being extremely divided in its opposition, it seems to have failed to connect with people, and it underestimated the magnitude of public dissatisfaction. It follows a similar storyline to Brexit and Trump: it looked like they were miles away from happening, but eventually they arrived.  Euroscepticism does not look like it will exhaust its arguments soon, and it finds itself now in a popularity peak phase. Before this widespread rage passes, Italy will have to overcome its internal issues and get out of its economic impasse - which is, at the moment, an enormous task.  On the other hand, this wave of hatred and anger could one day be looked back on as a phase, a swansong after a mountain of issues had been building. However, it has not to be underestimated nor ridiculed, as it represents the present we are living at the moment.  Main parties after general elections on March 4  Right  ? The Northern League (Lega Nord) - Leader: Matteo Salvini (17%)  The League is a far-right party with strong nationalist, anti-immigration views and independence aspirations (first from the rest of Italy and, now, from Europe). With Salvini and his strong, aggressive attitude, the party went from a minority to being the leading voice in the new government.  ? Forza Italia \u0026ndash Leader: Silvio Berlusconi (14%)  The party led by former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi went from being the leader within the Italian right to a strong, yet subordinate, voice to Salvini\u0026rsquos. Far more moderate in tone, it represents the conservatives in the country.  ? Five Star Movement (M5S) \u0026ndash Leader: Luigi di Maio (32%)  The movement founded by comedian Beppe Grillo was conceived as a protest against the main arty system in Italy and aimed to be an independent voice in direct connection with Italian citizens (the main decisions are taken through a web portal by popular vote).  Left  ? Partito Democratico (Democratic Party) \u0026ndash Leader: Matteo Renzi (18%)  The majority party in the last few years, it progressively lost consensus in favour of the right wing coalition led by Salvini and Berlusconi. It represents the moderate left wing.  After the Election  As none of the parties or coalitions went over the threshold of 40 per cent, the majority required to form the government, and weeks passed with the winning parties unable to conclude a deal, Italian President Sergio Mattarella assigned the role of prime minister to Giuseppe Conte, an independent, with a government formed by Northern League and Five Star Movement representatives. Salvini was appointed Home Secretary whereas Di Maio has become the new Minister for Economic Development."},{"url":null,"title":"SNP says UK economy lagging behind other EU nations","story":"              THE UK\u0027s economy is lagging behind smaller independent nations such as Austria, Ireland, Norway and Denmark, the SNP says.  Scotland\u0027s GDP would surge if Holyrood had the same powers as parliaments in other small independent countries, the party said.  The SNP highlighted analysis published by the independent Scottish Parliament Information Centre (SPICE).  Figures from SPICE researchers showed Scottish GDP could match countries such as Austria, Ireland, Norway and Denmark, the SNP said.  Matching Irish growth over the same period would result in a \u0026pound30 billion economic boom, while keeping pace with Norway would boost Scotland\u0026rsquos economy by up to \u0026pound12 billion \u0026ndash with a \u0026pound10.4 billion increase by matching Denmark, and \u0026pound9.7 billion by matching Austria, the party claimed.  The findings were published after the SNP\u0027s Growth Commission stated that small independent countries have consistently outperformed larger economies by 0.7 per cent on average.  SNP MSP Ivan McKee said the SPICE research backed up the commission\u0027s findings.  He said: \u0026ldquoThis new independent analysis is incredibly revealing \u0026ndash it is clearer than ever that Westminster is holding back Scotland\u0026rsquos economic potential.  \u0026ldquoJust by matching the modest growth forecasts of small independent countries such as Norway, Denmark and Austria, Scotland could receive a significantly greater economic boost compared to continuing to follow the UK\u0026rsquos failed London centric economic model.  \u0026ldquoScotland must show the ambition and innovation that other independent countries have if we are to catch up with them and grow our own economy \u0026ndash and the Sustainable Growth Commission\u0026rsquos report makes a clear case for how we can achieve this over the coming decades.  \u0026ldquoIt is increasingly clear that only with the powers of independence can Scotland do what is needed to boost our economy, improve living standards and create the kind of nation we all want to live in.  However, Scottish Labour\u0027s economy spokeswoman Jackie Baillie blasted the SNP\u0027s blueprint for the economy as a recipe for continued austerity.  Baillie said: \u0026ldquoUnder the SNP, growth is struggling behind the rest of the UK and other small European countries, wages are stagnant and productivity is flat lining.  \u0026ldquoThis month\u0026rsquos Institute for Fiscal Studies report delivered a damming critique of the Nationalists\u0026rsquo blueprint for separation and confirmed that the SNP\u0026rsquos cuts commission would mean a \u0026lsquocontinuation of austerity\u0026rsquo.  \"It is increasingly clear that the SNP government remains in denial about its mismanagement of our economy and is also content simply to try and blame Westminster for all of Scotland\u0026rsquos economic woes.  \u0026ldquoThat is simply not good enough.  \u0026ldquoIn contrast, Labour\u0026rsquos plans would mean a decade of investment for Scotland.  \"We are the only party with an industrial strategy that sets out a plan to create decent jobs and grow the economy so it works for the many, not the few.  Scottish Conservative finance spokesman Murdo Fraser added: \u0026ldquoThis is the utter nonsense we\u0026rsquove come to expect from the SNP.  \u0026ldquoAs we know from their own blueprint for independence, a separate Scotland would be forced to instigate austerity max just to get the economy on an even keel.  \u0026ldquoAnd under their stewardship the Scottish economy has continued to lag behind the rest of the UK.  \u0026ldquoHolyrood already has a number of levers at their disposal to grow the economy \u0026ndash the fact is that this SNP Government is not using them."},{"url":null,"title":"Nicola Sturgeon poised to unveil dramatic cabinet reshuffle this Tuesday","story":"              SPECULATION is mounting that Nicola Sturgeon will carry out a reshuffle this week amid reports that a number of senior ministers are leaving the government.  Last night, three SNP insiders told the Sunday Herald that Sturgeon is poised to unveil drastic changes to her cabinet on Tuesday.  Sources close to the First Minister\u0027s office suggested that Sturgeon has no plans to change her ministerial team, but stopped short of a denial.  The Scottish Government refused to issue a formal statement, when asked about the reports.  However, there was growing speculation at Holyrood that a number of long serving ministers will be sacked, quit or moved sideways this Tuesday.  Sturgeon is said to want to inject new blood into her frontbench team, with promotions for rising stars from the intake of SNP MSPs elected for the first time in 2016.  The First Minister is expected to promote more women MSPs in a bid to improve gender balance in her government.  There were reports that Sturgeon will create new ministerial posts in a shake-up that a source said would \"extend her empire\".  However, a number of senior cabinet secretaries are understood to be vulnerable.  Fiona Hyslop, the Cabinet Secretary for Culture, Tourism and External Affairs, was mentioned by an SNP source as a figure who \"could be at risk\" after over 11 years in government.  Health Secretary Shona Robison is also facing the prospect of a \"sideways move\" another senior party insider predicted.  Sturgeon has faced repeated calls to sack Robison over her performance in a key brief.  NHS Tayside, which serves Robison\u0027s local patch in Dundee, is in crisis, and she is also dealing with criticism over GP recruitment and waiting times for ambulances.  Social Security Minister Jeane Freeman, who is well regarded by SNP backbenchers and is thought to have fared well as a junior minister, has been touted as a possible replacement for Robison in health.  A source said Freeman was \"within reach of a significant promotion\".  However, another senior SNP source said that Justice Secretary Michael Matheson may be moved to health after \"doing a shift\" in his current role.  There was also speculation that Transport Minister Humza Yousaf could be elevated to the cabinet.  A source said that Rural Economy Secretary Fergus Ewing, is ready to \"go to the backbenches\" after over 11 years in the government.  Another long serving minister, who may voluntarily leave the government, is Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham.  However, Sturgeon is understood to be ready to use her first reshuffle in over two years to promote \"high flyers\" from Holyrood\u0027s backbenches.  SNP MSPs Kate Forbes, Mairi Gougeon, Clare Haughey, Jenny Gilruth and Ivan McKee - all of whom were first elected to parliament 2016 - are reportedly in line for promotion to the ministerial ranks.  Sturgeon would need to secure parliamentary approval for any ministerial changes before Holyrood\u0027s summer recess, which begins after Thursday\u0027s business.  Senior SNP sources told the Sunday Herald that Sturgeon will use Tuesday, the day her cabinet meets, to make the changes public.  The SNP still has nearly three years before the next Holyrood election.  However, Sturgeon may seek to use the reshuffle as a chance to refresh the SNP government, which has been in power since May 2007."},{"url":null,"title":"Marchers demand vote on final Brexit deal","story":"              TENS of thousands of people marched through central London to demand a final vote on any UK exit deal, on the second anniversary of the Brexit vote.

The protests were held as senior Cabinet ministers, including Liam Fox and David Davis, insist the UK is prepared to walk away from talks without an agreement.  World War Two veteran Stephen Goodall, 96, led the pro-EU protesters as they headed from Pall Mall to Parliament Square.  Among those addressing the demonstrators was Gina Miller, who successfully campaigned to ensure the UK could not trigger talks on leaving without the approval of Parliament.

Hanging baskets, banners and bunting are also covered by the new rules, as well as attachments to street lighting columns, such as signs.Councillors heard the use of festive lighting, bunting, banners and hanging baskets can help encourage commercial activity in towns, add seasonal colour and help promote community events.ISC previously considered proposals which would have seen community groups covering electricity costs for festive lights, hearing there was strong opposition to this from local councillors and groups.Members asked officers to revisit the plans, setting up a working group to further investigate the potential impacts of the proposals.

It will provide on-board workshops, spare parts storage, crane and office facilities but will get supplies from another large vessel. By contrast the BOWL project will use smaller crew transfer vessels on a daily basis to provide crew and supplies.\u0026ldquoIt is just a different strategy being used at MORL and we could not accommodate that size of vessel at Wick as we do not have the shelter and water depth required, he said. \u0026ldquoIf we had our new quay at Shaltigoe we would have been able to accommodate it.But Mr Watt is confident the harbour will still play a part in servicing the MORL project and in other renewable projects in the Moray Firth basin. He pointed out that Wick is 33 kilometres from the wind farm while Fraserburgh is 70km away.\u0026ldquoWe wish Fraserburgh and Moray East well and will continue to develop Wick harbour, Mr Watt said. \u0026ldquoWe will move forward on a strong footing in the renewables market as well as in the fishing and cargo sectors.He added that work on the BOWL base is progressing well and will create upwards of 150 jobs.Caithness civic leader Willie Mackay said: \u0026ldquoIt is very disappointing news. Hopes were high this project could come to Wick. There have been a lot of improvements going on at the harbour which has the potential for a positive future.\u0026ldquoI hope other projects can come to Wick and I look forward to seeing improvements on the platform the BOWL project creates for the town and the community in general. I hope we can bring lots of jobs and apprenticeships to the area.Trudy Morris, chief executive of Caithness Chamber of Commerce, was \u0026ldquovery disappointed by the decision as the Wick harbour team has worked \u0026ldquoextremely hard to make the port an attractive base.\u0026ldquoAs the larger of the two offshore wind projects proposed for this area, it would have been a significant boost to the harbour and the region to have MORL based here, she said.But she added: \u0026ldquoIt has been fantastic to see the progress made at Wick harbour this year in preparing for the Beatrice Offshore Windfarm Ltd operations and maintenance contract, and we look forward to the benefits this will bring to the area.Eann Sinclair, programme manager for the Caithness and North Sutherland Regeneration Partnership, was also disappointed by the decision. However, he is confident there will still be opportunities for Wick harbour to get work in the Moray Firth area.MORL spokesman Craig Milroy said Wick was in the running for the O\u0026ampM base along with Buckie and Fraserburgh. A memorandum of understanding had been signed with Wick.\u0026ldquoAll three were strongly engaged with us but we chose Fraserburgh, he said. \u0026ldquoThere was not a single reason for choosing Fraserburgh but a combination of circumstances.

That simply makes it a must-attend event for Orkney’s premium food and drink firms, giving them the chance to showcase their products to a very wide audience of potential customers. It’s a very busy few days for our producers, but always worth the effort and it also gives us an opportunity to tell the wider story about Orkney and all its other attractions.”Amongst the Orkney businesses travelling to the show will be newcomers, J. Gow Rum, makers of the county’s first locally produced rum.Collin van Schayk of rum producers, VS Distillers, said: “We’re very much looking forward to introducing J. Gow Rum to the visitors at this year’s Royal Highland Show. The reception it’s had since its launch late last year has been fantastic, so we’re really excited about bringing it to a much wider audience, and sharing our story.“One of the strengths of Orkney’s approach to marketing food and drink is the fact local businesses present a united front at these major events.

The plans represent an investment of £125 million for investors and would create 385 new jobs.According to the hotel chain, the letter it has sent to OIC sets out how it has supported 12 local authorities in England and Wales, supporting local regeneration, creating jobs and boosting local economies.With similar letters being sent to 19 other councils in Scotland, including Shetland Islands Council, the hotel chain is attempting to show how it could similarly support local communities around the country.These agreements offer a funding structure which the hotel chain says enables local authorities to utilise their existing assets, create jobs, generate income, and help to regenerate land in strategically important locations.Hotels in the programme are built on surplus local authority land, with the funding provided either through the local authority’s internal resource or via low-cost funding from the Public Works Loan Board or third party resources.Upon completion of the hotel development, local authorities would either have the choice of either retaining ownership of the hotel and receive an annual rent into the council’s revenue budget or selling the hotel with Travelodge as its operator.Brian Wallace, Travelodge chairman said: “Many local authorities are in possession of large amounts of property and assets that are not being utilised. Investing in a low-cost hotel like Travelodge is an increasingly attractive choice, as it draws visitors, creates jobs and helps boost the local economy.”“We operate 44 hotels across Scotland. However, the country is growing at pace and attracting visitors from all corners of the globe but there still remains a huge shortage of good quality and great value hotels. To fill this gap, we want to extend our Scottish network with a further 20 hotels and this includes our first hotel in Kirkwall.
