[{"url":null,"title":"Maths English GCSEs levels ahead summer","story":"Share this article Students have been left in tears amid more confusion over how Year 11 and Year 13 children will be assessed this year - including whether exams will definitely be stopped - with Ofsted chief inspector Amanda Spielman telling ministers they must make up their minds immediately.One option on the table reportedly involved keeping GCSE and A-Level exams for only \u0027core subjects\u0027 such as maths and English with all other exams marked based on coursework, according to the Daily Telegraph.  Under-fire Education Secretary Gavin Williamson is working with Ofqual, who  considered having multiple exam papers for students, with a third on one day, a third the next and the final third after that. Under the plan they would all sit different exams to prevent cheating, but all marked in same way to the same standards.But Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, claims schools minister Nick Gibb called her last night and admitted there would be no GCSE or A-level exams at all for the second year running.  Boris Johnson said in his TV address to the nation: \u0027Primary schools, secondary schools and colleges must move to remote provision from tomorrow, except for vulnerable children and the children of key workers.\u0027He hoped schools could begin to reopen after February half-term. Keeping schools open for children of key workers and those in vulnerable situations mirrors previous lockdowns.Nurseries will also remain open and free meals will continue to be distributed.As exams are not considered viable, the Department for Education will consult on how children can receive fair grades without the introduction of another disastrous algorithm.Headteachers voiced despair at the wasted effort of preparing for just a single day of classroom learning. Katharine Birbalsingh, of Michaela Community School in Wembley, north London, said the sudden chopping and changing was \u0027madness\u0027.She stressed: \u0027I had my staff training today on administration of the Covid tests.\u0027We changed our training plans last week to follow new Government guidance. Now suddenly we are delivering online learning tomorrow? This is madness.\u0027David Shakeshaft, of Firs Primary School in Birmingham, said he needed to undo \u0027all the work I had to yesterday and today\u0027 ahead of reopening. He wrote online: \u0027Absolutely beyond comprehension I have been put in this position.\u0027 The Government\u0027s bid to get primary children back to school has been in tatters since Sunday night when it became clear that hundreds of headteachers were unable or unwilling to reopen.Pressure had been growing since the publication last week of documents that showed Government scientific advisers warned before Christmas that schools would need to shut to reduce the R rate of Covid infection.Last night Mr Johnson admitted that schools could be acting as \u0027vectors for transmission\u0027 – hours after First Minister Nicola Sturgeon had announced similar closures for Scotland.He said: \u0027We have been doing everything in our power to keep schools open because we know how important each day in education is to children\u0027s life chances.\u0027University students are also facing another extended spell of learning in their bedrooms rather than in lecture halls, with demands for tuition fee and accommodation refunds likely to soar as a result. With certain exceptions for courses such as medicine, undergraduates had already been told to stay away until January 25 \u0027at the earliest\u0027, but the campus ban will now also extend into next month.The cancellation of the summer\u0027s school exams will bring England into line with Wales and Scotland, which both decided to give up on the idea well before the current crisis.Mr Johnson said it was \u0027not possible or fair for all exams to go ahead this summer as normal\u0027.The Mail understands Education Secretary Gavin Williamson will now focus his attentions on ensuring schools provide quality online lessons as well as the rollout of the free laptop scheme.Robert Halfon, chairman of the Commons education committee, said the Government had been left with \u0027no other option\u0027 but to axe exams.However, Labour\u0027s schools spokesman, Wes Streeting, said the cancellation will \u0027cause additional anxiety for pupils and teachers\u0027 as the Government has no \u0027Plan B\u0027 in place.Former Tory education secretary Lord Baker told the Mail it was \u0027essential\u0027 that all school staff were vaccinated during the closure, and that in-school testing plans were strengthened.In a rare positive, around 130,000 students expecting to take vocational exams this month will still be able to sit the papers.Just last week, Mr Williamson told the Commons that the \u0027overwhelming majority\u0027 of primaries would be opening their doors on Monday. He said to MPs: \u0027Children need to be in school, which is why we will always do everything we can to resist knee-jerk reactions to close schools or colleges.\u0027But the National Education Union had predicted a \u0027snowball effect\u0027 of teacher rebellion and said yesterday that staff at 6,000 primaries – around 35 per cent – had refused to work. Former Conservative health secretary Jeremy Hunt was one of the first MPs to break with the pro-schools consensus yesterday, declaring they needed to shut \u0027right away\u0027.Miss Sturgeon ordered Scottish schools to stay shut until at least the start of February.The Welsh government also said it would move to online learning until at least January 18.Mary Bousted, of the National Education Union, said: \u0027This is a crisis point for the nation and a great deal of what got us here should not simply be blamed on new strains of the virus.\u0027She insisted: \u0027The Government has had eight months to prepare for a renewed period of remote learning and for alternatives to exam assessment at GCSE and A-level. But it has not used that time wisely or well.\u0027    What you can and cannot do during the national lockdown: The government guidelines in fullYou must stay at home.

This will be put in law. The police can take action against you if you leave home without a \u0027reasonable excuse\u0027, and issue you with a fine (Fixed Penalty Notice).You can be given a Fixed Penalty Notice of £200 for the first offence, doubling for further offences up to a maximum of £6,400.A \u0027reasonable excuse\u0027 includes:Work - you can only leave home for work purposes where it is unreasonable for you to do your job from home, including but not limited to people who work within critical national infrastructure, construction or manufacturing that require in-person attendanceVolunteering - you can also leave home to provide voluntary or charitable services.Essential activities - you can leave home to buy things at shops or obtain services. You may also leave your home to do these things on behalf of a disabled or vulnerable person or someone self-isolating.Education and childcare - You can only leave home for education, registered childcare, and supervised activities for children where they are eligible to attend. Access to education and children\u0027s activities for school-aged pupils is restricted. See further information on education and childcare. People can continue existing arrangements for contact between parents and children where they live apart. This includes childcare bubbles.Meeting others and care - You can leave home to visit people in your support bubble ( if you are legally permitted to form one), to provide informal childcare for children under 14 as part of a childcare bubble (for example, to enable parents to work, and not to enable social contact between adults), to provide care for disabled or vulnerable people, to provide emergency assistance, to attend a support group (of up to 15 people), or for respite care where that care is being provided to a vulnerable person or a person with a disability, or is a short break in respect of a looked-after child.Exercise - You can continue to exercise alone, with one other person or with your household or support bubble. This should be limited to once per day, and you should not travel outside your local area.You should maintain social distancing. See exercising and meeting other people.Medical reasons - You can leave home for a medical reason, including to get a COVID-19 test, for medical appointments and emergencies.Harm and compassionate visits - you can leave home to be with someone who is giving birth, to avoid injury or illness or to escape risk of harm (such as domestic abuse).

You should follow the guidance on the safe use of places of worship and must not mingle with anyone outside of your household or support bubble when attending a place of worship.Weddings, funerals and religious, belief-based or commemorative events linked to someone\u0027s death are all subject to limits on the numbers that can attend, and weddings and civil ceremonies may only take place in exceptional circumstances.There are further reasonable excuses. For example, you may leave home to fulfil legal obligations or to carry out activities related to buying, selling, letting or renting a residential property, or where it is reasonably necessary for voting in an election or referendum.Exercising and meeting other peopleYou should minimise time spent outside your home.It is against the law to meet socially with family or friends unless they are part of your household or support bubble. You can only leave your home to exercise, and not for the purpose of recreation or leisure (e.g. a picnic or a social meeting). This should be limited to once per day, and you should not travel outside your local area.You can exercise in a public outdoor place:by yourselfwith the people you live withwith your support bubble (if you are legally permitted to form one)in a childcare bubble where providing childcareor, when on your own, with 1 person from another householdPublic outdoor places include:parks, beaches, countryside accessible to the public, forestspublic gardens (whether or not you pay to enter them)the grounds of a heritage siteplaygroundsOutdoor sports venues, including tennis courts, golf courses and swimming pools, must close.When around other people, stay 2 metres apart from anyone not in your household - meaning the people you live with - or your support bubble. Where this is not possible, stay 1 metre apart with extra precautions (e.g. wearing a face covering).You must wear a face covering in many indoor settings, such as shops or places of worship where these remain open, and on public transport, unless you are exempt. This is the law. Read guidance on face coverings.Support and childcare bubblesYou have to meet certain eligibility rules to form a support or childcare bubble. This means not everyone will be able to form a bubble.A support bubble is a support network which links two households. You can form a support bubble with another household of any size only if you meet the eligibility rules.It is against the law to form a support bubble if you do not follow these rules.You are permitted to leave your home to visit your support bubble (and to stay overnight with them). However, if you form a support bubble, it is best if this is with a household who live locally. This will help prevent the virus spreading from an area where more people are infected.If you live in a household with anyone aged under 14, you can form a childcare bubble. This allows friends or family from one other household to provide informal childcare.You must not meet socially with your childcare bubble, and must avoid seeing members of your childcare and support bubbles at the same time.There is separate guidance for support bubbles and childcare bubbles.Where and when you can meet in larger groupsThere are still circumstances in which you are allowed to meet others from outside your household, childcare or support bubble in larger groups, but this should not be for socialising and only for permitted purposes. A full list of these circumstances will be included in the regulations, and includes:for work, or providing voluntary or charitable services, where it is unreasonable to do so from home. This can include work in other people\u0027s homes where necessary - for example, for nannies, cleaners, social care workers providing support to children and families, or tradespeople. See guidance on working safely in other people\u0027s homes). Where a work meeting does not need to take place in a private home or garden, it should not - for example, although you can meet a personal trainer, you should do so in a public outdoor place.in a childcare bubble (for the purposes of childcare only)Where eligible to use these services, for education, registered childcare, and supervised activities for children. Access to education and childcare facilities is restricted. See further information on education and childcare.for arrangements where children do not live in the same household as both their parents or guardiansto allow contact between birth parents and children in care, as well as between siblings in carefor prospective adopting parents to meet a child or children who may be placed with themto place or facilitate the placing of a child or children in the care of another by social servicesfor birth partnersto provide emergency assistance, and to avoid injury or illness, or to escape a risk of harm (including domestic abuse)to see someone who is dyingto fulfil a legal obligation, such as attending court or jury servicefor gatherings within criminal justice accommodation or immigration detention centresto provide care or assistance to someone vulnerable, or to provide respite for a carerfor a wedding or equivalent ceremony in exceptional circumstances and only for up to 6 peoplefor funerals - up to a maximum of 30 people. Wakes and other linked ceremonial events can continue in a group of up to 6 people.to visit someone at home who is dying, or to visit someone receiving treatment in a hospital, hospice or care home, or to accompany a family member or friend to a medical appointmentfor elite sportspeople (and their coaches if necessary, or parentsguardians if they are under 18) - or those on an official elite sports pathway - to compete and trainto facilitate a house moveSupport groups that have to be delivered in person can continue with up to 15 participants where formally organised to provide mutual aid, therapy or any other form of support - but they must take place at a premises other than a private home.Where a group includes someone covered by an exception (for example, someone who is working or volunteering), they are not generally counted as part of the gatherings limit. This means, for example, a tradesperson can go into a household without breaching the limit, if they are there for work, and the officiant at a wedding would not count towards the limit.If you break the rulesThe police can take action against you if you meet in larger groups. This includes breaking up illegal gatherings and issuing fines (fixed penalty notices).You can be given a Fixed Penalty Notice of £200 for the first offence, doubling for further offences up to a maximum of £6,400. If you hold, or are involved in holding, an illegal gathering of over 30 people, the police can issue fines of £10,000.Protecting people more at risk from coronavirusIf you are clinically vulnerable, you could be at higher risk of severe illness from coronavirus. There is additional advice for people who are clinically extremely vulnerable to coronavirus. Those who are clinically extremely vulnerable should not attend work, school, college or university, and limit the time you spend outside the home. You should only go out for medical appointments, exercise or if it is essential.TravelYou must not leave your home unless you have a reasonable excuse (for example, for work or education purposes). If you need to travel you should stay local – meaning avoiding travelling outside of your village, town or the part of a city where you live – and look to reduce the number of journeys you make overall. The list of reasons you can leave your home and area include, but are not limited to:work, where you cannot reasonably work from homeaccessing education and for caring responsibilitiesvisiting those in your support bubble – or your childcare bubble for childcarevisiting hospital, GP and other medical appointments or visits where you have had an accident or are concerned about your healthbuying goods or services that you need, but this should be within your local area wherever possibleoutdoor exercise. This should be done locally wherever possible, but you can travel a short distance within your area to do so if necessary (for example, to access an open space)attending the care and exercise of an animal, or veterinary servicesIf you need to travel, walk or cycle where possible, and plan ahead and avoid busy times and routes on public transport. This will allow you to practice social distancing while you travel.Avoid car sharing with anyone from outside your household or your support bubble. See the guidance on car sharing.If you need to use public transport, you should follow the safer travel guidance.International travelYou can only travel internationally – or within the UK – where you first have a legally permitted reason to leave home. In addition, you should consider the public health advice in the country you are visiting.If you do need to travel overseas (and are legally permitted to do so, for example, because it is for work), even if you are returning to a place you\u0027ve visited before, you should look at the rules in place at your destination and the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) travel advice.UK residents currently abroad do not need to return home immediately. However, you should check with your airline or travel operator on arrangements for returning.Foreign nationals are subject to the \u0027Stay at Home\u0027 regulations. You should not travel abroad unless it is permitted. This means you must not go on holiday.If you are visiting the UK, you may return home. You should check whether there are any restrictions in place at your destination.Staying away from home overnightYou cannot leave your home or the place where you are living for holidays or overnight stays unless you have a reasonable excuse for doing so. This means that holidays in the UK and abroad are not allowed.This includes staying in a second home or caravan, if that is not your primary residence. This also includes staying with anyone who you don\u0027t live with unless they\u0027re in your support bubble.You are allowed to stay overnight away from your home if you:are visiting your support bubbleare unable to return to your main residenceneed accommodation while moving houseneed accommodation to attend a funeral or related commemorative eventrequire accommodation for work purposes or to provide voluntary servicesare a child requiring accommodation for school or careare homeless, seeking asylum, a vulnerable person seeking refuge, or if escaping harm (including domestic abuse)are an elite athlete or their support staff or parent, if the athlete is under 18 and it is necessary to be outside of the home for training or competitionIf you are already on holiday, you should return to your home as soon as practical.Guest accommodation providers such as hotels, B\u0026ampBs and caravan parks may remain open for the specific reasons set out in law, including where guests are unable to return to their main residence, use that guest accommodation as their main residence, need accommodation while moving house, are self-isolating as required by law, or would otherwise be made homeless as a result of the accommodation closing. A full list of reasons can be found in the guidance on closing certain businesses and venues in England.Accommodation providers are also encouraged to work cooperatively with local authorities to provide accommodation to vulnerable groups, including the homeless.Going to workYou may only leave your home for work if you cannot reasonably work from home.Where people cannot work from home - including, but not limited to, people who work in critical national infrastructure, construction, or manufacturing - they should continue to travel to their workplace. This is essential to keeping the country operating and supporting sectors and employers.Public sector employees working in essential services, including childcare or education, should continue to go into work.Where it is necessary for you to work in other people\u0027s homes - for example, for nannies, cleaners or tradespeople - you can do so. Otherwise, you should avoid meeting for work in a private home or garden, where COVID-19 Secure measures may not be in place.Employers and employees should discuss their working arrangements, and employers should take every possible step to facilitate their employees working from home, including providing suitable IT and equipment to enable remote working.The risk of transmission can be substantially reduced if COVID-19 secure guidelines are followed closely. Extra consideration should be given to those people at higher risk.Going to school, college and universityColleges, primary (reception onwards) and secondary schools will remain open for vulnerable children and the children of critical workers. All other children will learn remotely until February half term.In the circumstances, we do not think it is possible for all exams in the summer to go ahead as planned. We will accordingly be working with Ofqual to consult rapidly to put in place alternative arrangements that will allow students to progress fairly.Public exams and vocational assessments scheduled to take place in January will go ahead as planned.UniversitiesThose students who are undertaking training and study for the following courses should return to face to face learning as planned and be tested twice, upon arrival or self-isolate for ten days:Medicine \u0026amp dentistrySubjects allied to medicinehealthVeterinary scienceEducation (initial teacher training)Social workCourses which require Professional, Statutory and Regulatory Body (PSRB) assessments and or mandatory activity which is scheduled for January and which cannot be rescheduled (your university will notify you if this applies to you).Students who do not study these courses should remain where they are wherever possible, and start their term online, as facilitated by their university until at least Mid-February. This includes students on other practical courses not on the list above.We have previously published guidance to universities and students on how students can return safely to higher education in the spring term. This guidance sets out how we will support higher education providers to enable students that need to return to do so as safely as possible following the winter break.If you live at university, you should not move back and forward between your permanent home and student home during term time.For those students who are eligible for face to face teaching, you can meet in groups of more than your household as part of your formal education or training, where necessary. Students should expect to follow the guidance and restrictions. You should socially distance from anyone you do not live with wherever possible.ChildcareThere are several ways that parents and carers can continue to access childcare:Early Years settings (including nurseries and childminders) remain openVulnerable children and children of critical workers can continue to use registered childcare, childminders and other childcare activities (including wraparound care)parents are able to form a childcare bubble with one other household for the purposes of informal childcare, where the child is under 14. This is mainly to enable parents to work, and must not be used to enable social contact between adultssome households will also be able to benefit from being in a support bubblenannies will be able to continue to provide services, including in the homeCare home visitsVisits to care homes can take place with arrangements such as substantial screens, visiting pods, or behind windows. Close-contact indoor visits are not allowed. No visits will be permitted in the event of an outbreak.You should check the guidance on visiting care homes during COVID-19 to find out how visits should be conducted. Residents cannot meet people indoors on a visit out (for example, to visit their relatives in the family home). There is separate guidance for those in supported living.Weddings, civil partnerships, religious services and funeralsWeddings, civil partnership ceremonies and funerals are allowed with strict limits on attendance, and must only take place in COVID-19 secure venues or in public outdoor spaces unless in exceptional circumstances.Funerals can be attended by a maximum of 30 people. Linked religious, belief-based or commemorative events, such as stone settings and ash scatterings can also continue with up to 6 people in attendance. Anyone working is not counted in these limits. Social distancing should be maintained between people who do not live together or share a support bubble.Weddings and civil partnership ceremonies must only take place with up to 6 people. Anyone working is not included. These should only take place in exceptional circumstances, for example, an urgent marriage where one of those getting married is seriously ill and not expected to recover, or is to undergo debilitating treatment or life-changing surgery.Places of worshipYou can attend places of worship for a service. However, you must not mingle with anyone outside of your household or support bubble.

The combination of high demand and low wind speeds has emerged as supplies from many traditional power plants remain out of action, causing electricity prices on the wholesale market to soar.The electricity system operator, a branch of National Grid, said that although a warning notice can “sound quite serious”, it is “a routine way” to encourage generators to produce more electricity, and does not mean electricity supply is “at risk”.The National Grid control centre has issued a flurry of informal and official warnings this winter, which it expected to be one of the tightest winters for electricity supplies in the last four years. There were two official warnings on consecutive days in November, and another in December.Hartree Solutions, a merchant commodities trading business, said that the UK is “at much greater risk of blackouts this winter than the National Grid has forecast”, which is reflected in market prices.The wholesale price of electricity to meet Wednesday’s peak demand, which will be in the hour from 4pm, climbed to £1,000 per megawatt on one of the UK’s most important electricity auction platforms, the highest price since the auction began in 2014 and 10 times the price for the same hour on Tuesday.Hartree said the shrinking electricity supply margins mean the National Grid control room “will need to be issuing alerts, warnings and utilising many – if not all – of their balancing tools on Wednesday to keep the lights on”.The official warning from the electricity system operator said: “In the short-term, we would like a greater safety cushion (margin) between power demand and available supply. It does not signal that blackouts are imminent or that there is not enough generation to meet current demand.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/932891b0a9917328107391b907943d37e8b7973d/551_754_6165_3699/master/6165.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9b3199bead3747df0dbfe4464a9c9ba0","title":"uk lockdowns push paperchase to verge of administration","story":"Closure of card and stationery chain’s high street stores in run-up to Christmas puts 1,500 jobs at riskThe cards and stationery retailer Paperchase is on the brink of administration after pre-Christmas store closures put an “unbearable strain” on the high street, putting 1,500 jobs at risk.The company, which has 173 stores and concessions, has filed a notice to appoint administrators as it tries to put together a rescue. The legal document provides protection from creditors for 10 days.A spokesman for Paperchase said the cumulative effect of multiple lockdowns, including the loss of crucial Christmas trade in November, had put “unbearable strain on retail businesses across the country”.Paperchase, he said, was not immune to the tough backdrop, despite strong online sales. “Out of lockdown we’ve traded well, but as the country faces further restrictions for some months to come, we have to find a sustainable future for Paperchase.”The spokesman added that the company was “working hard to find that solution” with the administration notice a “necessary part of this work”. The accountancy firm PwC has been lined up to handle the process.“This is not the situation we wanted to be in,” the Paperchase spokesman added. “Our team has been fantastic throughout this year and we cannot thank them enough for their support.”The company was founded in 1968 by art students Judith Cash and Eddie Pond, who opened a store in London’s Kensington. The company has changed hands numerous times, with high street rival WH Smith and now defunct US books giant Borders among the chain’s previous owners.In 2010 the private equity firm Primary Capital backed a £20m management buyout from Borders. Primary Capital, which had also owned Yo Sushi and Coffee Nation, tried to sell Paperchase in 2014 and considered a stock market flotation two years later.In 2019 Paperchase used an insolvency process known as a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) to cull unprofitable stores and cut rents. It blamed its financial problems on a decline in customer numbers coupled with rising costs. The CVA switched some of its stores to turnover-based rents, meaning the firm is not as burdened with property costs as some retail chains.

Here are the measures that must be takenIt’s easy to feel frustrated by the government’s response to this pandemic, and wonder why it hasn’t acted sooner. Ministers wasted an opportunity to suppress the virus in the summer when cases were low, and instead chose to open up quickly and recklessly after the first national lockdown. The government subsidised people to eat out in restaurants and bars, and encouraged holidays abroad via “travel corridors” without any kind of testing or quarantine restrictions for when travellers returned. It was always likely that, if uncontrolled, the virus that causes Covid-19 would mutate. High prevalence created more opportunities for a variant to emerge that now appears to be spreading at a worrying pace.Where does this leave the UK? Among scientists, optimism about several approved vaccines is tempered by serious concerns about the new variant, and what the next weeks have in store. Sage experts note that even with restrictions in place, it will be a challenge to stop the spread of this new variant over the next few weeks. The substantial rate of serious illness associated with Covid-19 also underlines the risks of exposing a large percentage of the population to a virus that is still not fully understood. Even a plan to allow the virus to run through the population would require restrictions, because the high rate of hospitalisation that results from Covid infections is dangerous to everyone. If hospitals are full, patients of all stripes – whether they’re suffering from a heart attack or a road traffic injury – can’t get the necessary treatment. And without spare beds, Covid-19 patients can’t get access to the ICU care they need to stay alive.The opposite response to this is what has been called a maximum suppression or “zero Covid” model. But at this stage, with the Office for National Statistics estimating that England is around 100,000 infections a day, and the new variant putting pressure on the NHS and the test-and-trace system, pursuing this strategy no longer seems feasible. The immediate priority should be surviving the next few months without the NHS collapsing, and planning for a robust response to eliminate Covid in the spring and summer.Vaccinating as many people as quickly as possible will be key to this. The UK has decided to vaccinate more people with one dose rather than fewer people with two. This is an ethical and political judgment rather than a scientific one waiting for follow-up doses to be delivered carries huge costs.But vaccinating everyone will take time, which is why a national lockdown was necessary. Schools will be closed until mid-February, except for the most vulnerable children and those of essential workers. This will reduce community transmission and allow scientists to gather new evidence about the variant.As always, mass testing and supported isolation are central to controlling the virus. Both during the lockdown and after these new restrictions are lifted, we should be testing people rapidly to identify those who are carriers, and ensuring those who must isolate have the resources – both financial and practical – to spend 10 days alone. That isolation is an act of goodwill is something the government has repeatedly overlooked during this pandemic, and those who are isolating need to be compensated for doing so.The government has spent many months and billions of pounds on its testing-and-tracing strategy. So it’s surprising that, despite these efforts, its approach to visitors arriving from overseas is still so lax. Preventing the import of Covid-19 cases and variants requires robust testing and quarantine procedures at our borders. Yet people are allowed in to the UK without a negative Covid test result, and pictures of crowding at airports – in contrast to the carefully planned approach of countries such as South Korea – do little to instil confidence in the safety of this approach.Finally, and most importantly, we need to follow these new restrictions, continue to distance from each and avoid crowded spaces and public transport, wear face coverings, and do our best to avoid getting infected and passing the virus on. We must deprive it of any opportunities to survive and infect others. In the spring, longer days and mass vaccinations will give us another chance to eliminate Covid and prepare for the coming winter. The UK’s health and economy depends upon it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4df3c8cee9288cdbe3395c23578d37fa3bc9eb7b/0_7_3864_2318/master/3864.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8a67d136b3e82403b9f45b8b494186d3","title":"call for pupils without laptops in england to be allowed into schools covid","story":"Children’s commissioner’s plea comes as third national Covid lockdown beginsA million children who are still without access to laptops should be allowed into schools, the children’s commissioner for England has said, amid growing pressure on government and telecoms companies to cut the cost of mobile data.The call by Anne Longfield – who wants pupils to be designated as “vulnerable” if remote learning equipment cannot be provided to them – comes as schools were closed for at least six weeks as England began a third national lockdown.“Those children who haven’t got the tech should be offered a priority place in school from Monday,” said Longfield, who called on companies to provide free data capacity for children and families at a time of “emergency”.The digital ide in England hits poorer pupils hardest, with research suggesting four of five schools with the poorest pupils do not have enough devices and internet access to ensure all those self-isolating can keep learning.More than 560,000 devices were delivered to schools and councils last year, according to the Department for Education (DfE). It announced before Christmas that it had bought 440,000 more.In Oldham, a headteacher said pupils with no broadband at home during the first lockdown last year rode trams all day to make use of free wifi. Glyn Potts, head of Newman Roman Catholic college in Oldham, added that his school had this week received 138 laptops from the central government scheme to add to the 34 they received last year – nine months after making the original request for 237.There were reports elsewhere of 13-year-old pupils submitting schoolwork at midnight because that was the only time they could use the sole computer or smartphone in their home, according to Claire Garside, of the Leeds-based volunteer group Digital Access West Yorkshire.“Every headteacher has told us they’re short of devices. Due to the DfE criteria, headteachers applied for these devices knowing that it wasn’t going to be enough for the children that they know need access,” said Garside.Aside from the shortage of hardware, ministers and telecoms companies faced calls to remove punitive mobile data costs.BCS, the Chartered Institute for IT professionals, said the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) should negotiate with mobile data providers to apply a “zero-rating” for educational websites in the same way they apply to online NHS resources.“Many low-income families rely on mobile data for internet access, and the average data allowance is much lower. Schools would need to confirm details of the sites they need, but these can be agreed and refined over time,” said Adam Leon Smith, chair of BCS.The DfE drew criticism by posting a photo on Instagram of a warehouse containing some of the 50,000 laptops and tablets due to have been delivered to schools this week.Siobhain McDonagh, the Labour MP who coordinated a letter in which MPs, unions and charities called on Boris Johnson to take action to help “children on the wrong side of the digital ide,” said of the photo: “It beggars belief that the government would celebrate distributing devices almost a year after schools first closed and to just a fraction of the pupils who need them.”The DfE has been approached for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43f47e95d285b4318ac525118892b7e0183eedc4/0_273_6087_3652/master/6087.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=eb29b238d7b8d88bb48a52d92e9aa2ab","title":"veganuary record number people pledge eat vegan food january","story":"Veganuary taken up by rising number of people trying plant-based alternatives to meatA record 500,000 people have signed up to the Veganuary challenge to eat only plant-based foods for a month. The milestone is double the number who pledged to go vegan for January in 2019.A quarter of those taking up the challenge – 125,000 – are in the UK, and this year British supermarkets including Tesco have run television and radio adverts promoting Veganuary for the first time. Other supermarkets such as Aldi, Asda and Iceland have produced dedicated pages including information and recipes in 2021, again for the first time.Veganuary is a global campaign that has recently focused on Latin America, where 150,000 people have signed up this year, along with 80,000 in the US and 50,000 in Germany.People give a number of reasons for choosing to cut the amount of animal foods in their diets, from reducing animal suffering, improving health or to lessen the environmental damage caused by food production. Many people in rich countries already eat more meat than is healthy, and scientists say cutting out meat is the single best way iniduals can tackle the climate and wildlife crises.“It really feels to me that plant-based eating is no longer controversial,” said Toni Vernelli from Veganuary. “Pretty much everyone has accepted we need to be reducing animal products in our diets for environmental reasons.”“The way British supermarkets have embraced Veganuary this year is truly game-changing,” she said. “They are not simply using it as a marketing opportunity, but are promoting the many benefits of plant-based eating. As bastions of our food supply, they know that the only sustainable way forward is plant-focused.”Vernelli highlighted a message about animal welfare on Aldi’s website: “Eating less meat or avoiding animal products altogether is often a really transparent way to show you want to make a difference.” Vernelli also noted that Marks \u0026amp Spencer had produced a 31-day Veganuary meal plan.However, half of the people in the UBS survey said they believed the plant-based meat alternatives were healthier and more environmentally friendly than meat.Dozens of companies around the world are also working on growing real meat cells in vats without the need to slaughter any animals. The first sale of cultured meat took place recently in Singapore, where Eat Just’s “chicken bites” were served to restaurant diners. But it is expected to be at least several years before cultured meat reaches a wide market."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c7ddcf02a60021a5ff4cc1c29a83e5de5182349/0_56_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6e171f15ca6ff6b4149540551e9227e3","title":"why the worlds biggest mammal migration is crucial for africa photo essay aoe","story":"Up to 10 million straw-coloured fruit bats descend on Zambia’s Kasanka national park every year, dispersing millions of seeds as they goDavid Mubiana will always remember the day he was shot. It happened in 2002, when his unit was ambushed by poachers with AK-47 rifles and a shotgun. He was wounded in the arm and stomach one bullet rupturing his spleen. As a wildlife police officer in Zambia’s Department of National Parks and Wildlife, his job is inherently risky.Like other wildlife protectors, he puts his life on the line every day. But not every animal needing protection is a big beast. Following the incident in 2002 in a park bordering Angola, Mubiana was transferred to Kasanka national park in central Zambia, where he now protects one of nature’s mysteries – and the biggest mammal migration in the world – from poachers and land encroachment. These poachers may be after antelope and elephants, but their actions also pose a threat to the straw-coloured fruit bat, Eidolon helvum.Every year, between October and December, 8–10 million straw-coloured fruit bats descend on the park to feast on an abundance of fruit. From west Africa, over the forests of the Congo basin and on to Zambia, the bats migrate thousands of kilometres over savanna and open land, dispersing seeds into deforested areas, and reforesting and regenerating landscapes on their journey. Scientists are still trying to fathom why these fruit bats, or “flying foxes”, gather at Kasanka in numbers not seen anywhere else. Each night they leave their evergreen swamp fig roosts to fly up to 55 miles (90km) in search of wild berries and fruit.Listed as near threatened on the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s red list, the straw-coloured fruit bat is one of the largest fruit bats in Africa. There are fears that if their numbers drop below a certain amount, the colony may not be able to keep going. “If that turns out to be true, we might be in trouble,” says Dr Dina Dechmann of the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior, whose team has studied the bats for 12 years.With the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, the bats have faced a new threat from humans seeking to attack them. “These bats are being persecuted because of ongoing publicity about their role as virus hosts. Their importance completely outweighs the potential threat,” says Dechmann, adding that their role in transmitting viruses such as Covid-19 directly to humans has not been scientifically proved.But habitat loss is fast becoming the park’s chief threat. As forests where bats roost and feed are lost, they are increasingly being forced out. “Bats will either need to forage farther, or they will remain in the same location and overuse resources. So it’s a habitat and wildlife management issue just as much as an urban-human bat conflict issue,” says Taylor-Boyd.Areas surrounding the park are also critical for people who rely on the forest for food and income. The trust has helped communities gain legal ownership of 60,000 hectares of surrounding forest, supporting income-generating activities such as beekeeping. Churchill Musungwa, a voluntary forest guard, says his community decided to work with the trust after seeing land nearby destroyed.Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow bioersity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/41e4a869cfb9ac2da06bff3ecab4d7e8014f7dc3/13_0_5383_3232/master/5383.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026s=84cfc60202873f7db92f1e1e9ad2e1bc","title":"my pickled veg is fizzing is it ok kitchen aide","story":"Upping the (sea) salt and adding vinegar can add longevity to fermented veg – but the fizzing means the bacteria are doing their job• Do you have a culinary dilemma?

While it’s worth persevering with those homegrown cucumbers, also consider heading to your nearest east European deli come next summer. “A lot of Polish-style pickles use varieties of cucumbers that are drier and have thicker skins,” De Thample says, “and this guarantees success.” Alternatively, make friends with quick pickles: “My grandmother used to cut cucumbers from the garden, add apple cider vinegar and a pinch of salt, and leave them on the table for a couple hours before dinner.” (You might want to sweeten the deal with a little honey, mind)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b10587ae187a97e58e40e1ba87d14ab8c46c7ce/0_2183_5119_3069/master/5119.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=585416737f87f2ec3850938cd93911ae","title":"life in the football cocoon photo essay premier league coronavirus lockdown","story":"’s sport photographer  Tom Jenkins gives his perspective of covering the national sport behind closed doors in football’s strangest yearIt’s day two of lockdown 2 and a perfect night for watching football: cold and crisp with a slight mist descending. Ninety minutes before the kick-off, I’m outside St Mary’s Stadium in Southampton. Around me is the occasional patrolling steward and a few TV technicians carrying kit into the ground. The silence is interrupted only by the cracks of fireworks from across the city.Suddenly a loud bellow from just beyond the waist-high perimeter fencing shocks me. “Come on you Reds,” a cyclist shouts as he pedals by. He looks at me and shrugs: “Well someone has to say it, haven’t they?” On he goes, repeating his chant as he disappears into the darkness. By the end of the evening, Southampton will be top of the Premier League for the first time in their history.In June, when Project Restart was in its infancy, football behind closed doors seemed like a quirky interruption. We were all just so glad to have it back in any form. How we smiled to see crossbars being sprayed with disinfectant and away teams emerging from unusual corners of the stadium, perhaps having changed in a version of the groundsman’s hut.Those motivational tarpaulins masking empty seats, resplendent with club mottos, were colourful and cheery. It was summertime, there were five substitutes allowed and drinks breaks. Now that all seems a long time ago and it feels very different.With winter here, darkness has enveloped the grounds the floodlights are on, bathing not only the pitches but also the surrounding communities in a milky glow. From outside it is now even more obvious that a game is going on, a clear beacon to fans that a party is happening and they don’t have an invitation. It is seven months since football returned. Through all this I have been a lucky one: a photographer – one of the few to be let in.I’m in Liverpool on the opening day of the season and I have time to spare before a tantalising match between the champions and promoted Leeds. On the gable end of a house in a typical Anfield street is a newly painted mural of Jordan Henderson lifting the Premier League trophy.As I photograph it, a woman takes out her phone and does the same. I cannot help but feel guilty, I’m off to see this fascinating match and she almost certainly is not. I think of her again after the match and feel even worse. A breathtaking game has ended 4-3, the sort of game that lifts your heart and confirms why you love football, why you go through the turnstiles to watch it.A couple of days later I am on the other side of the Pennines for Sheffield United v Wolves. The talk on the radio is of a possible return of fans. There is a sense of positivity that we will be out of this before long now. Wolves score two early goals and I imagine the vitriol that would have poured down from the vast Kop stand behind me.Filling out health clearance forms and temperature checks are now part of my routine, like packing my camera bags. At Chelsea in early October, having lugged my gear to the front entrance, I am hot and sweating. The temperature steward aims the little white gun at my forehead. “That’s 32.2,” he says. “Surely I’d be having organ failure if that was true,” I reply. The steward duly waves me through.I have done quite a few games at Chelsea in recent months and have talked with a friendly steward who hands out our sanitised photographer bibs. She tells me how fearful she is for some of the regulars in the West stand, especially for their mental health. She recalls how coming to the ground, seeing everyone there, being part of that community, has been like having a second family, helping her through some difficult personal times.Just before a match starts, I have often found myself walking the empty concourses behind the stands. Before, these places would be vibrant and buzzing with anticipation places where friends would meet up, drink and laugh, around them walls painted in club colours. Now they are like haunted houses.Evidence of what used to be keeps popping up – the bookies odds for first goalscorer still scrawled up on whiteboards, adverts promoting events in March. I can’t stop staring at the ones imploring people to go to the now notorious Cheltenham Festival in 2020.At Selhurst Park, I have been able to go to the back of the Arthur Wait stand and retrace the steps I used to take as a kid. Back then it was always down the same set of steep stairs from the same turnstiles on Park Road to the concourse at the back of the stand then out to the terraces or seats. The memories flood back.Come Halloween, I’m in a rain-lashed Sheffield to see United take on Manchester City. My allotted parking place is by a wall where names of fans are chiselled into each brick. On the other side of this wall, a dozen sodden fans are peering over, trying to get a tiny glimpse of the players getting off their buses.Before the game I chat to a steward in the massive Kop stand. “It’s bonkers,” he says. “They’ll be ramming into pubs right now and as long as they have a pie with their pint, they can watch this match on a big screenWhy can’t some sit and watch it in here?”On the drive home, I hear on the radio the prime minister announce another national lockdown. The prospect of fans being back in grounds such as Bramall Lane seems a distant hope.It’s definitely the sound that I find most surreal when no fans are in the grounds. The further you go up the football food chain, the larger the stadiums and the worse it gets. An empty Wembley is the ultimate echo chamber.The thwack of boot on ball reverberates up and around the bowl before slowly fading awayWhen the players from Manchester City and Everton line up before the Women’s FA Cup final to hear an immaculately dressed singer belt out Abide with Me, the anthem performed at just about every Cup final since 1927, it is eerie. I’m so used to this moment being associated with mass participation of a huge crowd. The hymn’s meaning seems even more moving right now, given the pandemic. The emptiness of the stands feels almost crushing.During the past few months, the fans I have felt most sorry for are probably those of Brentford and AFC Wimbledon. Both clubs have moved into new stadiums, usually a time for celebration, but this has not happened. Only at the beginning of December did a few Brentford fans get the chance to sample their new home.It was in early September that I attended the first competitive match there. The perfect grass, cutting-edge architecture, multicoloured empty seats – it felt like I was watching a video game. I was also at the new Plough Lane for the “grand” opening of the ground, 29 years after they played their last game nearby as Wimbledon FC.The only presence of the Wimbledon fans who resurrected the club in 2002 is themselves as cardboard cutouts. It was a bittersweet night. My friend and colleague Daffydd, a lifelong Dons fan, has been suffering awfully with motor neurone disease. The next day I email Daff to tell him how great the stadium is and that the managing director has promised to get him there as soon as possible. He doesn’t reply. Five days later Daff passes away.In late November, I’m at Fulham v Everton. A new stand is being built on the river side of the ground . At the end of the match, a workman emerges from the building site, speaking Portuguese. He persuades Richarlison, Everton’s Brazilian forward, to give him his shirt. Richarlison, seeming only too happy to be speaking to a real fan, climbs up and throws him the memento.In Canvey Island, Essex, Steve Marks is up a ladder erected on the flat garage roof next to his bungalow. A huge Union Jack is stiff to the breeze on a flagpole behind him as a freezing cold squall blows through. Fully decked out in waterproofs, he looks like the captain of a ship steering through a storm. About 50 yards away his team are playing their biggest match ever, a second-round FA Cup tie against Boreham Wood, which is live on BT Sport. “I couldn’t miss this,” he says, twirling his old-fashioned rattle, the sort that only seems to come out for cup ties. Other fans are on ladders, banging on a blue corrugated iron fence that rings the ground. “Two days later and we’d be in there,” one says, referring to the end of lockdown . “Typical, the biggest day in our club history and look at us.”With about five minutes to go, Boreham Wood’s burly centre-forward, Matt Rhead, nods in the third goal. Throughout the match he bore the brunt of the chants from the Canvey Ultras. He laps it up, playing the pantomime villain to perfection, joined by his teammates. Boy, how I’ve missed this – the moment when a goal is scored, when scorers and fans unite. It’s the whole reason and point of the game.When fans are not present, you can hear the net ripple and the scorers don’t know what to do with themselves. It usually ends up in a tame high-five or a polite handshake as if we are back in the 1950s. At least with a few spectators to see them, the players have got a reason to unfurl their best routines and a goal is celebrated properly.The lockdown is lifted on 2 December and clubs in tier 2 areas are allowed to host 2,000 spectators at matches. This means a whole new world for the fan, one of arrows, one-way systems and advice everywhere. At West Ham, the huge screen on the side of the London Stadium scrolls through slides saying ‘welcome home’ and then urges ‘hands, face, space’.At Brighton, Southampton are the first visitors to play in front of fans. James Ward-Prowse is about to take a corner in front of the baying Seagulls supporters in the North stand. The hulking figure of Jannik Vestergaard, the Southampton centre-back, slowly walked into the penalty box. “Oi, Vestergaard, you mutant,” one wag shouts. The rest of the fans laugh. Everyone, including all of the players, hears it. The ball is crossed in and flies off the centre-back’s forehead into the net. Cue exuberant celebration.As Old Trafford is in tier 3, fans still cannot attend. The 80th Manchester derby to be played there is the first behind closed doors. It is a dreadfully dull game and the lack of passion on and off the pitch cripples the spectacle. These sporting cathedrals were built to enable many people to watch football together. The sermon is still being preached but there is no congregation, no hymns to reverberate round the cobwebbed pews.Football grounds are also places for socialising, for seeing friends and for escaping reality for a few precious hours. It is not for nothing that fans refer to their ground as “home”. Think about why West Ham greeted their fans back with a welcome home message, why there is a banner inside Old Trafford saying “we can’t wait to welcome you home”. For millions of fans, their club’s ground is a place where they feel safe and secure, where they can share emotions both good and bad.So here we are now, seven months on from the restart of football. This pandemic has reinforced how important fans are to the game: they are the foundation on which these clubs are built. Players come and go, but the fan is there, supporting their teams with pride and passion.I look on with envy as grounds are packed out in Australia and New Zealand while our national game limps on through the hardest of winters. I can’t wait for it to break free of this cocoon-like state and a return to the football we all know and love.For Daff, a great man who loved his family, his football and his photography."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab5bbf1a8698c3f0db5701ebb1fe29a17ef35820/0_20_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=28eddb7712a3216649ca027db5479c99","title":"covid 19 testing premier league efl pfa coronavirus","story":"Forty positive coronavirus cases were discovered over two rounds of Premier League testing in late December and early January, it has been announced.The latest figures, published by the league on Tuesday afternoon, show that of 1,311 players and club staff tested between 28 and 31 December, a total of 28 came back positive for Covid-19. All those who tested positive must self-isolate for 10 days.In the next round of testing, 12 further positives were discovered after tests on 984 players and staff. The second round of testing featured a smaller group of players and staff than usual because it took place over a weekend, when some teams were involved in matches.It is understood the bulk of the positives across both rounds of testing relate to the three postponed fixtures over the period involving Manchester City and Fulham. City’s match against Everton on 28 December was called off because of an outbreak at the Manchester club, while Fulham’s games against Tottenham and Burnley on 30 December and 3 Januaryrespectively have also had to be rescheduled.“With low numbers of positive tests across the overwhelming majority of clubs, the league continues to have confidence in its Covid-19 protocols, fully backed by the Government, to enable fixtures to be played as scheduled,” a Premier League statement said.The league is also understood to have held conversations with the culture secretary Oliver Dowden following the announcement of a new national lockdown. The government minister is thought to have given his backing for elite sport to continue.In addition, there are ongoing discussions between the 20 top-flight clubs and the league about ways the protocols can be further tightened in communal areas, such as training grounds and pre-match accommodation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8929786545ccac2c54c5f6b0ba848a7ab6472c67/0_145_3792_2276/master/3792.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d38fb3368d27689e43a2dba866e0025f","title":"mauricio pochettino leaves open chance of lionel messi joining psg","story":"Mauricio Pochettino has left open the possibility of Lionel Messi joining him at Paris Saint-Germain by saying “any big player in the world is welcome”.At his first press conference as PSG manager, Pochettino was asked whether he would speak to his fellow Argentinian this month about moving to France when the player’s contract at Barcelona is due to expire after the current season.At an unveiling in which he revealed little, Pochettino, who spent two years at PSG as a player, spoke in Spanish and English but avoided answering questions about transfer bids for Dele Alli or Christian Eriksen, with whom he enjoyed working at Tottenham. But he made no effort to mask his excitement at taking charge of PSG, his first job since leaving Spurs in November 2019. “Father Christmas was very good to me this year,” he said with a broad smile.After the Ligue 1 matches against Saint-Étienne and Brest on Saturday, Pochettino will have an opportunity to win the first trophy of his managerial career next Wednesday when PSG duel with Marseille in the Trophée des Champions, France’s equivalent of the Community Shield. But the 48-year-old is in no doubt his primary mission is to turn PSG into European champions. They will meet Barcelona and Messi in the last 16, with the first leg on 16 February.“For PSG, as with any big club, the Champions League is the most important competition, though the others are also important. Of course it’s a massive challenge. Next month looks far away but the most important thing is for us to arrive for the match at our best. We are really confident. We have an unbelievable squad. This is the moment to try to build, get to know each other and adapt quickly. For sure we are going to arrive at our best and with the aim of winning and going farther.” Pochettino must cope with a raft of injuries in his first week. Neymar is one of several players unavailable for the trip to Saint-Étienne.Pochettino’s success at PSG will depend to a large extent on his ability to get the best out of Neymar and Kylian Mbappé, ideally while helping to persuade each of them to sign new contracts, with their current deals expiring next year. He refused to specify how he intended to deploy each player, saying only he hoped to use every player “in a way that allows them to best express their potential”, adding that “in modern football every team has to be flexible”.He did, however, confirm that Marquinhos would remain the club’s captain, though he did not say whether he viewed the Brazilian primarily as a defender or a midfielder. Pochettino’s predecessor, Thomas Tuchel, was often criticised for deploying Marquinhos in midfield.PSG’s previous two managers – Tuchel and Unai Emery – each arrived at PSG preaching high-intensity, attacking styles in which the collective force would be stronger than inidual talents. Both ultimately failed and wound up frustrated, with inconsistent, ambiguous teams. Asked whether he thought he could work successfully with demanding superstars, Pochettino replied: “We have worked with great players before.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cdb501ec19c70f8d9e8c2dfa2edca81914bfc1b0/268_445_4460_2676/master/4460.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=48c08a792d52d38c8d646ae2f1ee6846","title":"tottenham hotspur v brentford carabao cup semi final live","story":"“With White and Hart on the bench for Spurs, couldn’t Jose have had a laugh and asked Kane to put his feet up too?” writes Risha Mohyeddin with a chortle. Firstly, he reveals that Pontus Jansson would have been picked but is suffering from a minor injury. He also says the fact that this tie is being contested over one leg rather than the usual two increases the chances of Brentford pulling of an upset in their first ever semi-final. “We all know it’s not an everyday game but we are looking forward to it. Let’s try to attack, do our best and see what happens. Everybody knows Tottenham are big favourites and name-for-name are a better team than us but the fact it’s only one game helps us.”Moussa Sissoko has ben speaking to Sky Sports and reveals Jose Mourinho’s instructions, which, apparently, really do include “don’t sit back”: “He told us to take this team seriously because they are a very god opponent, doing very well in the Championship. Everyone wants to be in the final so it’s going to be a big battle. Let’s do everything to go through. Be strong defensively and when you have the ball, go forward. Don’t sit back and don’t wait.”Hello. Spurs haven’t won a major trophy for 13 years and it would mean a lot to them and José Mourinho to get one in the cabinet as soon as possible. Brentford don’t even need a cabinet (although, as Richard Foster details here, they they did win the London War Cup in 1942, which is not to be sniffed at). Now both clubs have a chance to end long waits, or at least to meet a Manchester club in the Carabao Cup final. Spurs are the obvious favourites but that means nothing to Brentford, who have already ousted four Premier League clubs to get this far. This is Brentford first match of the year, because their joust with Bristol City last weekend was postponed owing to Covid-19. They have a fully fit squad, except for the injured Christian Norgaard. Spurs are without several players, including Matt Doherty, Giovani Lo Celso and Erik Lamela. But they have a big squad and no credible excuses.

We’re on our way home from a furniture store, again. We almost bought something called a credenza, but then John opened the drawers and discovered that it wasn’t made to last.I think there are limits, I say, to what mass production can produce.We just bought a house but we don’t have furniture yet. We’ve been eating on our back stoop for three months. Last week a Mexican woman with four children rang our doorbell and asked if our front room was for rent. I’m sorry, I said awkwardly, we live here. She was confused. But, she said, it’s empty.It is empty. I hang curtains to hide the emptiness, but it remains empty. There wasn’t any furniture in the house where I grew up until a German cabinetmaker moved in with us. He arrived in a truck so heavy that it made a dent in the driveway. He filled our dining room with his furniture, and then he made tiny replicas of that furniture with the machines he brought in the truck. I still have the tiny corner cabinet with lattice doors, the tiny hutch with brass knobs and the tiny dining room table with expertly turned legs. They’re in the basement, wrapped in newspaper. The tiny dresser sits atop my dresser, which is from Ikea.The apartment we just left was furnished with shelves that John made out of cheap pine. They’re in the basement now, reduced to lumber. The ammunition box that I found on the kerb and made into a coffee table is in the back yard, planted full of marigolds. I hate furniture, my father once murmured. He had just visited a warehouse full of furniture made of unfinished pine. This was after the cabinetmaker went to a nursing home and his furniture went away, too. As a child, I burned a hole in the dining room table. The cabinetmaker, who smoked a pipe, supplied me with matches. I loved to burn things, but I felt remorse over the table, which I also loved.The lyric “I burned a hole in the dining room table” is tethered, in my mind, to the liner notes of a Billie Holiday album that I borrowed from the library in college. She was singing songs written by someone else, the notes explained, but she rewrote them with the way she sang. Her delivery transformed a banal portrait of moneyed life into a wry critique of that moneyed life.In the furniture stores we visit, I’m filled with a strange unspecific desire. I want everything and nothing. The soft colours of the rugs, the warm wood grains, the brass and glass of the lamps all seem to suggest that the stores are filled with beautiful things, but when I look at any one thing I don’t find it beautiful. “The desire to consume is a kind of lust,” Lewis Hyde wrote. “But consumer goods merely bait this lust, they do not satisfy it. The consumer of commodities is invited to a meal without passion, a consumption that leads to neither satiation nor fire.”In the end, all the furniture we buy will feel like lyrics written for someone else’s song, except the dining room table made by the Amish. This table will be solid cherry, a beautiful wood. It will be well made, but not quite as well made as the table I grew up with, the table I burned. To get a table like that, we would need to spend much more money. Or we would need a German cabinetmaker to move in with us.“I once had a girl  Or I should say, she once had me,” the car radio sings. John and I both fall silent. It’s been a long time since I’ve heard this song. And I don’t know if I’ve ever really listened to the ending. What happened there, I wonder. Did he make a fire in the fireplace while the girl was at work? No, John tells me, he burned her place down. He is sure of this, but I am not so sure.I can’t stop thinking about it. Norwegian Wood. It bothers me. Soon I’m reading interviews with the Beatles. “It was pine really, cheap pine,” McCartney said about the wood panelling that inspired the title. About the ending, he said: “It could have meant I lit a fire to keep myself warm, and wasn’t the decor of her house wonderful? But it didn’t, it meant I burned the fucking place down.”Our house is a brick bungalow, nearly identical to the house next door. These houses were built by brothers, both dead now. I learn this from my neighbour, who lives in the other brother’s house. He’s a retired postal worker and a saxophone player who still practises every day, though his health is now too poor for him to perform. The interiors of our houses are the same, he tells me, except for my attic, which the former owners of our house renovated. He would like to renovate his attic, too, but he doesn’t have the money. Some relatives of his are in prison and all his extra money goes to supporting their families. I guess God, he says, doesn’t want me to have money. I’m not sure, but I think he’s joking about God.He has told me, already, about attending the same elementary school my son attends, and of being beaten up in the playground.He has told me that he couldn’t, in those days, risk a conversation with a woman like me. He had to keep his head down when he passed a white woman on the sidewalk, he said, and just respond Yes, ma’am if she spoke to him. He has told me, also, of refusing a holiday turkey offered to him by the owner of a mansion by the lake, a rich man who demanded that he wade through deep snow to deliver packages to the service entrance at the back of the house.The former owners of our house, who were white, made extra money by allowing the house to be used as a set for commercials. John discovers this when he gets a call from a casting director who wants to know if the house is available. It’s not available – we live here. But then we learn how much we will be paid. All we have to do is leave the house for three days and two nights and we will earn $8,000.The commercial is going to be for Walmart, the corporation that produced the fortunes of three of the 20 richest people in this country. Walmart couldn’t build stores in Chicago for years but they’re here now, despite ongoing protests over low wages, and they want their commercial set in a classic Chicago bungalow. We don’t own anything from Walmart, but this doesn’t matter because Walmart furniture is moved into the house, Walmart curtains are put up, and some Walmart prints are hung on the walls in Walmart frames. A white set designer and a white director work to create an authentic African American interior. The commercial, they tell us, is going to feature an African American grandmother serving a holiday turkey.Next door, in the house just like ours, lives an actual African American grandmother, the wife of the retired postal worker.We’re getting paid to have our house made over to look like what a set designer imagines their house looks like so that Walmart can try to sell things to people who look like them.John tells all this to his friend Dan, who says, I think that’s the definition of white privilege. I don’t understand, my mother says. How is that the definition of white privilege? This isn’t the first punchline she’s ruined. My mother dropped out of high school and later, after college and a orce, she nearly dropped out of the middle class. She still has white privilege, but she often does not have hot water.I admire how thoroughly she has discarded the life she was born into, the silver in the sideboard and the opera on the record player. She has kept only the books.In one of the fairy tales she told me as a child, a girl is pursued by a witch. As the girl runs, she throws behind her the things she carries in her pockets, the things her mother has given her. She throws down a hairbrush that becomes a thick forest. She throws down a hand mirror that becomes a lake between her and the witch. You must throw away everything you’ve been given, my mother might say. That much I understand. But it has only just occurred to me to wonder what witch she’s running from. And if her witch will be my witch, too.She used to trade eggs from her chickens to a neighbour for expired bread, still good. And when she drove us home from school she would stop at a dumpster behind a restaurant to salvage fruit, also still good. I once asked my mother if she had a retirement account and she laughed at me. I’ve never had anything like that, she said. And then she said, after a pause, My children are my retirement account. You were my investment.She had four children by the time she was 30, but she had no income, no contributions to social security. I was without children at thirty and already working for the university. I have a retirement account, which puts me in a poor position to explain privilege to my mother. Nobody understands privilege as well as those who don’t have it. I guess, I tell her, I don’t understand, either.I’m taking possession of the house by painting it, every room. And the question of what colour in what room is consuming me. I think maybe I should start with historical colours, but I can see the original colour of the walls under the layers of chipped paint: cloying pink. Maybe memory, not history, is the place to start. Buttered Yam, from my mother’s garden. Evening Blue, an old bottle half-buried in the dirt. Forest Moss, the colour of my mother’s little living room, which smelled like woodsmoke.Color(ed) Theory Suite, a work in which artist Amanda Williams painted houses slated for demolition on the South Side of Chicago, began as a collection of colours: Harold’s Chicken Shack Red, Crown Royal Purple, Pink Oil, Ultrasheen Blue, Flamin’ Hot Orange, Currency Exchange Yellow. “This palette combined my Ivy League academic training as an architect with my lived sensibility as a South Side native,” she says. Each house was painted a single colour, from the bricks of the foundation to the shingles on the roof. She painted only houses that weren’t worth anything to anyone – not to dealers, not to squatters, not to neighbourhood teenagers. “Zero-value” was her term. And she painted these zero-value properties in colours drawn from products sold to black people. Every colour, she says, is a code.I’m having trouble finding the right white. I don’t like Opulence White or Chantilly Lace or French Manicure. This conversation is boring, my sister complains. Maybe I’ll give up on white, I tell her, and paint the living room peach. Peach is problematic, she says, laughing at me now.I’ve discovered a brand of paint that I can’t afford. But I could buy it. To afford something like paint, for someone of my class, is to announce your values, most often, not your financial capacity. I can’t admit to valuing paint that costs $110 a gallon. But I find this paint unbearably luminous, and undeniably better than any other paint. At night, when my family is asleep, I study paint swatches from the hardware store and then I open the heavy folds of the catalogue from Farrow \u0026amp Ball and run my fingers over the small squares of paint, slightly raised in estate emulsion. Even the names are better: Matchstick, String, Cord, Skimming Stone. These are not aspirational whites – these whites can afford to be modest. One is even called Blackened.I remember the great revelation of moving up from acrylic paints in high school to oil paints in college. First just black and white on paper, and then a full set on canvas. They were worth the expense, those silken oils in their slim metal tubes. I loved all the colours, especially the cadmium orange, which was slightly toxic. Flamin’ hot. This is the closest I’ve come to painting in years, shopping for paint.I send a swatch of Sulking Room Pink to Robyn, knowing she’ll appreciate the name. “To sulk” in French is bouder, the source of boudoir, a woman’s private room. A room of one’s own, in a dusty, moneyed pink. And then there’s Etiquette, a white described as “a well-mannered hue”. It’s a white that’s hiding behind its own whiteness. Another line for this white poem. My mind is on paint now more often than poetry. I’ve found a new literature: Crisp Linen, Collector’s Item, White Zinfandel, Pashmina, Fine China, Ivory Tower, Mirage White, American White.The paint company Benjamin Moore has declared Simply White the Colour of the Year. This, in 2016, the year a white man will be elected to the White House. The selection of white as the Colour of the Year was “inevitable,” the creative director of Benjamin Moore says. “The colour white is transcendent, powerful, and polarising – it is either taken for granted or obsessed over.”I obsess, which solves nothing. Deep in Thought is my favourite name for a white, but I don’t really like the colour. I wouldn’t want my walls Deep in Thought. On my way to a parent-teacher conference I stop in the hallway of the elementary school to photograph a huge box of institutional toilet paper, the colour listed on the label as Empathy White. Maybe that’s the colour I’m looking for. Or a variant, a concerned off-white like All Apologies. Or something more revealing, like Paperwork White or Payroll White. Or maybe I should just paint it all Property.The catalogues keep coming. I don’t know how they find us, or how to make them stop. Sometimes, two of the same catalogue arrive on the same day. They accumulate in piles, outdoing each other with heavier paper and richer colours. Then the Restoration Hardware catalogue arrives, like a parody of the whole problem, in two volumes, each the size of a telephone book. These are bigger and heavier than my grandfather’s two-volume set of Illustrated English Social History. We put the Restoration Hardware catalogues near the fireplace and sit on them.The Ikea catalogue has a message on the front: “Designed for people, not consumers.” In the photograph, some young people are having a fun, unfussy dinner at a crowded table. There are dirty dishes piled on a cart and a guitar is leaning against the wall. The Ikea catalogue sits on top of a pile of catalogues with photographs of sterile rooms showcasing furniture that has never been touched. This other, messier way of life, Ikea suggests, is not just less expensive, it is more human.John and I have a set of two dressers from Ikea, and Nick and Robyn have the same two dressers. Nick’s is his second of this dresser – the bottoms dropped out of all the drawers in the first one. It was like a building with a perfect facade, Robyn said, where all the floors had collapsed into the basement. I remember a brownstone in New York City like that, with trees growing inside. And a foreclosure in the suburbs still pristine on the outside, but stripped of all its fixtures inside, even the wires and the pipes.The dresser is simple and Shaker in its design. Shakers believed that the end of the world was near, which would seem to be an argument for temporary furniture, but making something built to last was, for them, an act of prayer. “Do all your work as if you had 1,000 years to live,” Mother Ann Lee told her brethren, “and as you would if you knew you must die tomorrow.”There aren’t many Shakers left. Their furniture has outlasted them, as it was meant to. Their values, I was told by a tour guide at the village where Ann Lee died, which I visited as a school child, were embodied in their furniture. I wonder if a Shaker dresser, taken out of the context of Shaker life, still embodies the Shaker dedication to celibacy and hard work. Perhaps it whispers to its owner at night. Maybe my dresser is where my doubts come from.In that village, I saw Shaker chairs hung on pegs and I was taught to sing a Shaker song. The furniture didn’t interest me, but I was captivated by the song, especially the last two lines: “To turn, turn, will be our delight  Till by turning, turning, we come round right.”In my 20s I moved 10 times. On the fourth or fifth move, when I was leaving New York, I left behind a bed frame that my mother had made. It was simple and spare with no headboard – Shaker almost – and designed for celibacy in that it was narrower than a single bed. My mother was upset when she learned that I had abandoned it. I tried to explain that I wasn’t leading a life that allowed for furniture.In California, I slept on a slab of foam that could easily be rolled up and moved anywhere. My boyfriend, who kept his clothes in a large cardboard box, suggested that we make all our furniture out of cardboard boxes. It was an idea that had already been pioneered by Ikea, who made chipboard end tables with hollow interiors. “The ease of self-invention that Ikea enables is liberating,” Lauren Collins wrote, “but it can be sad to be able to make a life, or dispose of it, so cheaply.” Within a year, I had rolled up my mattress and moved my boxes to Iowa, where I found my furniture on the street.“A better everyday life for the many people” is Ikea’s mission, on paper. I think of all the Ikea furniture that I have seen eaten by life. The end tables with broken legs, the cracked slats of futon frames, the chipboard desks left out on the kerb and destroyed by the rain before they can be taken to a new home. Ikea, one of the largest consumers of wood in the world, has made furniture into something that gets used up. It is furniture for the apocalypse. But what I like – what makes me laugh a little about “for people, not consumers” – is the implication that consumers are not people.‘A metaphor is all this really is,” David Graeber wrote. He means consumption, which was once the name for a wasting disease, and is now the word anthropologists use for almost everything we do outside of work – eating, shopping, reading, listening to music. Consume, he notes, is from the Latin consumere, meaning “to seize or take over completely”. A person might consume food or be consumed by rage. In its earliest usage, consumption always implied destruction.Consumption was the opposite of production in Adam Smith’s Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations. He made this inquiry in 1776, when work was being relocated into factories and lives were newly ided between home and work. We still use the maths of that time to subtract what is consumed at home from what is produced at work. In that crude equation, only work that earns money is productive.And as long as there’s no third quantity, like reproduction, the equation works out to zero.She ate it, my father told my sister years ago, when she wondered what happened to my stereo. This was during my first year in New York, and the money for the stereo was a gift from my father, who had told me that he would pay for my college tuition and nothing else, ever. He had three more children to send to college. The stereo was an exception, a surprise for my birthday, and I did eat it. I wanted a stereo but I needed food.Food is destroyed by our consumption, but silverware is not, though the metaphor behind the word suggests that we eat up even our own silverware and dishes, too. “We should think about how far we want to extend the metaphor,” Graeber warned. Yes, we consume fossil fuels, in the “eat up, devour, waste, spend” sense of the word. But we don’t consume music.Music becomes part of us, as food does, but it isn’t destroyed in the process.What is destroyed when we think of ourselves as consumers, Graeber suggested, is the possibility that we might be doing something productive outside of work. • This is an edited extract from Having and Being Had by Eula Biss, published by Faber \u0026amp Faber and available at bookshop• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, sign up to the long read weekly email here, and find our podcasts here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a4608e0462b20002432926f3d090b46882ce28c9/0_2_6048_3627/master/6048.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=0b1d767b915bb1e6790c97fcbd0b4d43","title":"today in focus revisited the clitoris coverup why do we know so little podcast","story":"Medical textbooks are full of anatomical pictures of the penis, but the clitoris barely rates a mention and many medical professionals are uncomfortable even talking about it.

Dr Julia Patterson, the lead for Everydoctor, said doctors fear that delaying the second dose they need to obtain full immunity could lead to them becoming ill or infecting colleagues or patients.“The Covid-19 crisis is escalating and we need to urgently protect those who are working on the frontline. If healthcare workers are left unprotected, they are at risk themselves, and they may also pass coronavirus on to vulnerable patients,” said Patterson.“We were pleased to see last week that healthcare staff would now be vaccinated as a priority. However, five days on, many staff members are still in the dark about when they will receive vaccines.” Hospitals should now lay on clinics to immunise as many staff as fast as supplies of both vaccines allow, she added.Karoline Lamb, 84, said she was “absolutely fuming” that she might not be able to get the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine: “I was so elated when I had the first one. I had no side-effects and I’m booked in for the second one on 21 January, but I’m extremely worried it will be cancelled.”Lamb, from Chalfont St Giles in Buckinghamshire, is concerned that the first dose risks “becoming ineffective”. “If I don’t get the second one within three weeks, I’m worried the first dose could do more harm than good. Had I known the government might not let me have the second dose in time, I would not have accepted the first one.”Meanwhile, close to 3.5m doses of the Oxford vaccine are awaiting release after undergoing checks by medical regulators, the  understands, amid calls for the rollout of the jab to be accelerated in what Labour has described as “a race against time”.The government has said that it already has a batch of 530,000 doses to be administered this week and Sir John Bell, Oxford University’s regius professor of medicine, had said a further 450,000 were due to be available at the start of the week. Several million more doses of the vaccine are understood to have been manufactured in the UK but are yet to be bottled in vials.The NHS will need to start delivering at least 2m jabs a week from next week if it is to fulfil the Boris Johnson’s plan to vaccinate everyone in the four highest-priority groups by mid-February. The four groups the prime minister said will have a first dose amount to 13.9 million people in England, according to Nadhim Zahawi, the vaccines minister.Pascal Soriot, AstraZeneca’s chief executive, said on 30 December that his company would be able to provide 2m doses a week. But Matt Hancock, the health secretary, appeared to play down the possibility of reaching that level when the figure was put to him on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Monday. Hancock said: “John Bell is a great man, but he is not responsible for AstraZeneca’s manufacturing facility.”Labour’s shadow health secretary, John Ashworth, said: “Ministers should be going hell for leather to get 2m jabs a week distributed as soon as possible and then scale up further. We know this virus can mutate and could well do so again. We are in a race against time.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/768c8c6fbb16a9164ee5055ef68c02dadb625a71/20_143_4650_2791/master/4650.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0fae2a2e1c52e5eaa14e96fc37cf3833","title":"time to put self interest aside and find a solution to save the lions rugby","story":"Unions, clubs, TV executives and sponsors can no longer act in isolation if a feasible solution for this summer is to be foundRarely, if ever, has rugby union been in greater need of a silver bullet to solve all its problems. As older readers will remember that was once the Lone Ranger’s trademark, along with the habitual use of a mask to conceal his identity. How rugby’s Covid-threatened administrators would love a face-covered modern saviour to appear from nowhere and rescue their sport from looming oblivion.The mundane reality, unfortunately, is that unions, clubs, television executives and sponsors can no longer act in isolation. Even if the British \u0026amp Irish Lions somehow manage to unearth a feasible solution which preserves their scheduled tour of South Africa this summer, it is unlikely to satisfy everyone. What works for one party is invariably someone’s else’s non-starter.Which is why, with the virus showing all the tenacity of a back-row forward with a persistent grudge, this is no time for self interest. If the Lions’ pride is to be upheld for decades it will only be because the major unions, the clubs and all other stakeholders work together to protect it. Anything less than a genuine collective heave and the whole glorious concept could be permanently compromised.Take, for example, the idea that the Lions tour, given current rising infection rates and the uncertainty surrounding travelling fans, could simply be delayed a year until 2022. Even for the host nation that would be less than ideal, with the defence of their World Cup title in 2023 just over the horizon. For Eddie Jones, whose preparations for that tournament are already well advanced, there is absolutely nothing to be gained from waving his best 20-odd players off to South Africa just as he is looking to coalesce them into an England squad capable of beating the world.It will, accordingly, take a brave man to tell Jones to lump it for the sake of a team who only tour once every four years, or a South African union who badly need the income. Unless Jason Leonard, the Lions’ chairman, can somehow force the RFU’s chief executive, Bill Sweeney, into an old-style arm lock and murmur the ultimate threat – “If we can’t tour you’ll be here drinking with me every night” – it is even harder to see Twickenham subverting its own interests beneath those of the Lions committee. Money always talks and winning the 2023 World Cup would be worth rather more to England than a Lions series win over the Springboks.At this point it is worth gauging the view from South Africa. Informed sources contacted by the  suggest that, if this summer’s incoming tour is a non-runner, their next preference would be for a postponement until either November or the summer of 2022. That, though, would require World Rugby to e headfirst into the argument and rip up a global tour schedule which has already been widely advertised. Would Ireland fancy heading to New Zealand for a three-Test series without their best players? No chance.The next line down on the wishlist – and being examined by Lions officials – would be to shift the whole “tour” to Britain and Ireland, a perfectly fine idea in theory but one which also relies heavily on spectators being present. There would also be a host of other issues. Would a Lions series feel remotely the same beast if it took place on home soil? Who, exactly, would supply the midweek opposition with every major European club side on holiday? With the Euros, Wimbledon, the Open golf and the Olympics already in the diary, would it end up, perversely, damaging the special aura that makes the Lions so wonderfully different?The absolute last resort, it seems, would be to play the series in South Africa with no fans. For anyone who has ever been on a Lions tour it is the grimmest scenario of the lot. What is the point of the Lions if it is not a cavalcade of human enjoyment, a catalyst for camaraderie and a union of four nations on and off the field? If there is any sporting event on Earth less suited to being played in a soulless bubble, it is a winner-takes-all series involving the Boks and the Lions.No real sign, then, of a silver bullet, particularly as northern hemisphere officials are pushing for an early decision. By contrast, there are those who believe infection rates in South Africa are destined to fall within a matter of weeks. If, on the other hand, this year’s Lions tour were to be mothballed now it might allow the Six Nations to be delayed and played, complete with crowds, in July and August instead. Not ideal, clearly, with so much other sport around but better than another soul-sapping, echo chamber of a championship. To have one Six Nations championship played partly behind closed doors in 2020 was bad enough for rugby’s coffers. To have another entire tournament played out in silence would be ruinous.It would be more sensible, surely, to take a longer-term view. If South Africa cannot host this Lions tour they could be guaranteed the next edition in 2025 ahead of Australia. If the touring side were to step aside this summer the blow could also be eased by the firm promise of extra preparation time and a proper 10-match schedule next time. After an eight-year hiatus, the appetite for the returning Lions would be huge, their worth more cherished than ever. By then, too, people might even have started to forget the grim winter of 2020-21, the heavy toll it exacted and the money-driven masquerade that Test rugby almost became.Among the more welcome developments of the past 12 months has been the return of an old friend. Last February the sensational 90-metre torpedo kick by the French full-back Anthony Bouthier – dubbed the “spiral that went viral” – was among the highlights of the entire 2020 Six Nations. On Sunday it was the turn of Leicester’s George Ford to showcase the vertical spiral bomb, an old Dave Alred-inspired favourite that dips and fades as it descends from the clouds. Poor Anthony Watson could barely lay a hand on the ball and the Tigers duly emerged victorious. People often complain there is too much kicking in rugby union: what they generally mean is that there is too much poor kicking. A great kick, on the other hand, remains athing of beauty.Last weekend lightning struck twice. Leinster and Exeter, both recently immune to defeat, contrived to lose on the same day, with the Irish province suffering their first Pro14 reverse in 27 games at home to Connacht. If something similar were to happen this week, at home to Ulster and Bristol respectively, it really would be a jolt to the established order. On the basis that form is temporary and class permanent, however, it might be wise not to bet on another improbable double."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff566fe3a6f8183c6dfff1260fee947efcf9120d/0_214_4104_2462/master/4104.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=e3fc6eaf92c81a1b4276c3ad46d0a282","title":"youtube bans talkradio for allegedly breaching content policy","story":"Station with hosts including James Whale and Julia Hartley-Brewer insists it has ‘robust editorial controls’YouTube has banned the digital station TalkRadio from its platform over repeated breaches of the platform’s content policy, leaving the broadcaster scrambling to find other sites on which it can host excerpts of its debate and discussion shows.The station, part of the TalkSport network, said it had not been told by the platform what the most recent breach was. A spokesperson said: “We urgently await a detailed response from GoogleYouTube about the nature of the breach that has led to our channel being removed from its platform.“TalkRadio is an Ofcom-licensed and regulated broadcaster and has robust editorial controls in place, taking care to balance debate.“We regularly interrogate government data and we have controls in place, use verifiable sources and give space to a careful selection of voices and opinions.”The station was on Tuesday uploading its clips to other social media platforms, including Facebook and Twitter.A TalkRadio insider told the  that the problem was particularly acute for shows that host public debates about the coronavirus. “You can have a debate about an issue and if, in someone’s opinion, it undermines official guidance in any way, then it is classed as medical misinformation,” they said.YouTube’s content moderation system enforces a “three strikes” rule, under which accounts can be issued “strikes” for posting content that violates content guidelines. A single strike carries with it a number of restrictions, but a channel receiving three strikes in a 90-day period will be removed from the platform entirely. One previous strike had been issued on TalkRadio’s account for a discussion featuring the Conservative MP Tobias Ellwood, the  understands.The platform has a specific set of policies around medical misinformation related to Covid, which it defines as information that “contradicts local health authority information or World Health Organization medical information about Covid-19.”At least two of the station’s hosts, Mark Dolan and Julia Hartley-Brewer, regularly speak out against lockdown policies both on and off-air.Shortly after news of the suspension broke, the Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, appeared on Hartley-Brewer’s show, and spoke out in defence of TalkRadio’s right to criticise the government.“I don’t believe in censorship and we have a free and fair press, and we have commentators and interviewers of distinction who do criticise the government’s position,” Gove said, “From Lord Sumption to Peter Hitchens and others, and long may it remain so. I think it’s absolutely right that people should ask questions.”YouTube’s definition of medical misinformation, while similar to that of competitors such as Facebook and Twitter, has drawn criticism in its own right.Commentators have noted that the rule prevents criticism of organisations that have themselves changed their advice – in some cases significantly – over the course of the pandemic.In March 2020, for instance, many tech platforms classed as misinformation claims that mask-wearing could help prevent the spread of Covid now, those same tech platforms class as misinformation the claim that mask-wearing does not help prevent the spread of Covid. In both cases, statements from local and international health authorities lay behind the decision.An Ofcom spokesman said: “This was a decision for YouTube. Like other UK stations, TalkRadio’s radio channel comes under our broadcasting code. When we assess programmes under our rules, we take account of a broadcaster’s right to freedom of expression, and the right of listeners to receive information and ideas.”YouTube has been contacted for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/33e09b0389c0436b60e3e49c0c07f877d17d8423/0_147_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=f73af3ddff96a101a30a027332c9d7b4","title":"how to cope with the winter lockdown","story":"Lockdown in bad weather with little natural light seems daunting but there are routines and techniques that can help usWith new national lockdowns coming into force across the UK, we take a look at how to cope – from staying connected to getting out in the open.Under the new rules in England you can exercise outside once a day in your local area with one person from another household. “As long as you stay 2 metres away it is also the chance for some social interaction,” said Neil Greenberg, professor of defence mental health at King’s College London.While wet-weather clothing might be needed, why not take a look at Ordnance Survey maps and go on an adventure along some muddy footpaths, or explore the signs of nature amid the urban sprawl on your doorstep? And don’t forget that, unlike the first lockdown, playgrounds are open, so children can burn off their energy too.The benefits of exercise can be felt from even relatively short bouts of 15 to 30 minutes at a time, according to Stephen Buckley, head of information at mental health charity Mind.“Even if you don’t have exercise equipment like treadmills at home, there are still options for most ages and abilities including cleaning, dancing, using the stairs and online classes,” he said. Yes – cleaning can make for a great workout.Joe Wicks is bringing back his online home workouts for three days a week for lockdown 3.0, while there are plenty of online classes for yoga, dance, boxing and even – for cycling enthusiasts – “zwifting”.The idea of yet another video call might seem unappealing, but a huge number of activities are now being run online – and getting more sophisticated all the time.Charities such as Macmillan Cancer Support have created packs for people to host their own murder mystery, art groups are holding Zoom life drawing sessions, and there is no shortage of quizzes to try out. Pottery, embroidery, cookery and language classes are among other options, and offer the chance to develop a new skill and get to know new people.But while many may feel the pressure to make the most of another lockdown, Greenberg says we should be wary of attempting too many things at once.“Rather than setting yourself up to fail, try to set one realistically achievable simple goal and only once you have completed that, set another achievable one,” he said. “If you fail to achieve one of them, simply try again and focus on what you have done, not what you have not.”Theatre, concerts and other events are also available online – and are sometimes free. Some are live while others are recordings: among them you can romp through the British Museum’s 2014 Viking exhibition, get a front-row seat to a Met Opera performance or explore the world of ice-age megafauna as part of the Natural History Museum’s series of online lectures.With the sun rising late and setting just after 4pm, the prospect of a lockdown in the dead of winter fills many of us with a sense of foreboding. “If possible, get some nature into your day,” says Buckley. “Take a walk to a nearby park, river or green space and make the most of any outside space you may have, such as a garden. Even something as simple as sitting by a window and watching the birds, or taking care of a pot plant, can be beneficial.“If you’ve been spending a lot of time at home during the coronavirus pandemic, you may already have a routine of activities. But it may be helpful to think about how you can adapt this for the winter months.“Trying out a new winter routine might help give you a sense of change if you’re struggling with how long the pandemic is continuing. For example, you could spend time cooking and trying some new winter recipes, or learning a new skill.”There is a lot of news. But Greenberg said while it was important to stay up to date on government rules and guidance, it was best to avoid “doom-scrolling” – searching out endless articles and comments on the pandemic.“There are lots of different opinions on how long it might last, how bad the next virus is … What happens is you end up fuelling your uncertainty and that leads to more anxiety,” he said.Turning off news feeds and bright screens a few hours before bed could also help with a good night’s sleep, as could avoiding caffeine and smoking before hitting the hay, said Greenberg, while Buckley added that having a set routine benefitted people. If people experience ongoing sleep problems they should seek professional advice, Greenberg added. “If you are feeling more anxious you are less likely to sleep and if you don’t sleep as well that is more likely to make you feel more anxious,” he said.Staying connected is also key during lockdown, said Greenberg. And don’t throw in the towel on plans for the year ahead. “I think the idea of doing that little bit of exercise, finding a new pastime, and not letting yourself say ‘oh gosh, stuff dry January, I’m drinking because it is terrible’ is more important now than ever,” said Greenberg. With adults working from home – and children now joining them – headphones might be a necessity. But experts say a clear worklife balance also matters.“Make sure you take at least a 30-minute lunch break, ideally getting outside for some exercise, if you can,” said Buckley. “Try putting a reminder in your diary when you plan to finish working and communicate this to your colleagues so they know when you’re contactable. At the end of the working day, turn off your computer and any other devices so you’re not tempted to check work emails and try to take your mind off work by doing something else.”Buckley noted that parents might find the demand of childcare meant they ended up working late into the evening, something he said could disrupt sleep and mental health. “If your current working arrangements aren’t working for you and your family, speak to your employer about what support they can offer, including the option of working more flexibly, or working reduced hours,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/580ec7f184d93139f292f3b4fb3b3a982fa52e06/0_310_4748_2850/master/4748.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d04ce817f9cfbff0bf61c25260685314","title":"i wish we didnt have to go through this again reactions to englands new covid lockdown","story":"Snapshots from Exeter and Manchester highlight grim determination but also concerns about family lifeSarah Blakesley, a businesswoman and mum, was having a difficult day. “It’s very hectic and very stressful,” she said. “I just want to get today over with, to be honest.”The start of the third national lockdown was having an impact both on commercial and family life. “I run a cleaning company. Lots of clients are shutting down their offices. I may have to furlough workers.”Blakesley, from Exeter in Devon, also has a 17-year-old who will not be going to college for the foreseeable future. “We don’t know what’s happening with college so that’s another worry. I wish we didn’t have to go through this again. I’m concerned about people’s mental health.”Across the city people were working through tricky professional and family issues.Sue Jones was in one of the city parks with her son and daughter, both of primary school age. She had to take a day off from her job in a food processing plant to look after them. “I couldn’t get childcare for them in time so had to phone in and ask for the day off. I feel so worn down by the idea of another lockdown.”The Covid rates for Exeter are by no means as bad as other parts of the country – there were just under 200 new cases per 100,000 people in the seven days up to 31 December.But most people seemed resigned to the idea that a UK-wide effort is needed. “We’ve got to have a national lockdown. It’s got out of control,” said Alan Taylor, who manages a hardware store in the city centre.“The tiers clearly haven’t worked – people didn’t know what was going on. At least everyone knows the score now.”Ben Mangan, the owner of the Eat on the Green restaurant near the cathedral, said he was disappointed at the lockdown. “But we could see it coming and I agree with it. The situation is so dire, the government had no choice. I think we need to all be in it together. It’s fair that there’s one rule for everyone.”Steph Flisher was sticking a handwritten sign to the window of her dog grooming business informing customers that she was closing. “Safety has to take priority. We’ve all got to come together and get this sorted. The NHS needs us to do this.”Faye Jennings-Mosquera is allowed to keep her zero-waste food and cleaning products store open. “I think the lockdown needs to happen,” she said. Her partner was at home looking after their two young children. “If we have got two months let’s just do it, let’s all wear masks and be respectful to each other.”Around the corner at the food bank, teams of volunteers were working hard to prepare food packages, fearing there would be an increase in people unable to afford the groceries they need.Cllr Philip Bialyk, the leader of Exeter city council, said he “reluctantly” accepted the need for the lockdown. He said deliveries to vulnerable people would be stepped up again and more financial support funnelled to community groups helping people at risk.“There’s nothing more important than defeating the virus,” he said. “That has to be our main aim. We have to protect loved ones and ourselves. Nobody is safe.”There were some doubters. Stan Henderson, a lorry driver, said he thought the tier system should have been persevered with. “We were doing OK in the west country,” he said.But Exeter has had its problems. Just before Christmas the Royal Devon \u0026amp Exeter NHS foundation trust went to Opel 4 status – the highest alert level – due to high levels of inpatients with Covid and a large number of staff absences. There are about 30 patients in its Nightingale hospital on the edge of the city.David Strain, a senior clinical lecturer at the University of Exeter Medical School and the co-chair of the British Medical Association’s medical academic staff committee, backed tighter restrictions and warned there would be no quick return to normality.“It is important to highlight that this vaccination programme will not allow the return to normal life in February, as the majority of adults on which the economy depends are not in the four priority groups. In four to six weeks’ time when the lockdown is reviewed, there is no guarantee that there will be a nationwide lifting of restrictions.”Almost 250 miles north of Exeter in Longsight, Manchester, the mood was weary. Apart from three weeks in July, Greater Manchester has been in some sort of lockdown since March last year.Eliot Riley felt the latest lockdown was “too little too late”. He was hoping to start a teaching job this week at a primary school assisting special educational needs pupils, but after the government’s announcement of tougher restrictions, the school said they did not need him.“I feel like I can’t plan for anything now. I can’t save, and I can’t look forward to anything. Me and my girlfriend had the intention to buy a flat, but that doesn’t seem possible at all,” he said.“We are both in our early 20s, and I feel the pandemic is robbing us of our life opportunities. This should be the most freeing time for us, instead I just feel very restricted.”Saki Hussain, who works at Longsight market, remained optimistic. “There is a lot of difficulty, especially with our children now staying at home. But I hope one day, with God’s help, we will win against this disease.”Jack Weaver, who owns a trophy and engraving shop, said: “You can’t blame Boris. He hasn’t done a good job as far as I am concerned, but I don’t think any of the leaders have. This virus is new and nobody knows how to deal with it. I’m just hoping these vaccines will work and they get them out as soon as possible.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/33023617f482d8f2fa0d42eb84586e1d863199c9/0_137_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fbc7a45859bdfc0a1640a3821f4ce18e","title":"martin kenyon gets second covid vaccine dose","story":"Man who shot to fame after his first jab says process second time round was ‘very efficient’When Martin Kenyon went to receive his first coronavirus vaccination, his pithy responses after being accosted by a TV crew outside Guy’s hospital in London secured him “national treasure” status.He’d had trouble parking, and had consumed a “nasty lunch” before getting the jab after cold-calling Guy’s and asking for it, he told the CNN crew who fortuitously bumped into him immediately afterwards. And he was hoping, he said, that he was “not going to have the bloody bug now”.Now Kenyon, a sprightly 91-year-old, who found internet fame after his interview went viral, is one of the few who have received their second jab.“I went back to Guy’s, and, well, it’s become quite a machine there,” said Kenyon, an Old Etonian and Oxford man who was very active in the anti-apartheid movement, and was friends with Desmond Tutu, and personally met Martin Luther King Jr and Nelson Mandela.“When I went to get the first one, I was the only person there, I think. There was one man there, with a pencil and some paper and writing down a few names. This time it was very different. Very efficient.”Kenyon, who says the immunity from the vaccine means he can now hug his “enchanting” two grandchildren, said second-time round he had no trouble parking his “super little car”, which he is “allowed to drive everywhere around London, because I have a badge, which is brilliant”.“This time, I was able to park absolutely outside the main building in a special slot. So, all was well. It was very painless.”The UK has become the first western country to license a vaccine against Covid. On 8 December, Margaret Keenan, aged 90, became the the first patient in the world to receive it. The government’s joint committee on vaccination and immunisation has published a list of groups of people who will be prioritised to receive a vaccine for Covid-19. The list is:1 All those 80 years of age and over and health and social care workers.2 All those 75 and over.3 All those 70 and over.4 All those 65 and over.5 Adults under 65 at high at risk of serious disease and mortality from Covid-19.6 Adults under 65 at moderate risk of at risk of serious disease and mortality from Covid-19.7 All those 60 and over.8 All those 55 and over.9 All those 50 and over.10 Rest of the population.Kenyon’s recent fame saw him widely interviewed, including by Piers Morgan, causing further merriment when he asked ITV’s Good Morning co-host: “Who are you?”“I didn’t intend to be rude,” he says now. “I think when he was interviewing me I had bits of cotton wool in my ears, and the interview came from somewhere else that I couldn’t see. So, when I said ‘Who are you?’ I think I meant who’s talking, because I couldn’t see the interviewer.”Despite his vaccination, Kenyon intends to continue wearing a mask. “I was given a rather fancy one for my birthday by my daughter,” he said.“In a few days I will be immune. I don’t think I’ll pass anything on to anybody else. I think all will be well. And my family are very pleased.“I suppose it means I can do all sorts of things now. I can behave badly, now. I do most of the time, but generally in secret,” he joked. “I am, of course being very frivolous. But it’s new year, and I think we’ve got to cheer it up a bit.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4fb30dcd675d24ad5a6cb04938fa680a5fd03a89/0_20_4605_2762/master/4605.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=be36c29c115012da78c9fe61b33f9f73","title":"one in 50 people in england had covid in week to 2 january","story":"Figure for people outside hospitals and care homes revealed as number of new daily cases in UK tops 60,000 for first time One in 50 people in private households in England – more than 1.1 million – are estimated to have had the coronavirus in the week ending 2 January.The Office for National Statistics figures were released on Tuesday, as the number of new cases of people in the UK testing positive for Covid-19 topped 60,000 for the first time since the start of the pandemic.The latest ONS infection survey suggests 1,122,000 people in private households in England had the coronavirus between 27 December and 2 January. The total does not include people staying in hospitals, care homes or other institutional settings.The latest figure was up from an estimated 800,900 in the week ending 23 December – the previous period for which figures were collated – equivalent to 1 in 70 people.Dr Yvonne Doyle, the medical director for Public Health England, said: “The rapid rise in cases is highly concerning and will sadly mean yet more pressure on our health services in the depths of winter.“That is why if we can, we must stay at home, reduce contacts and do everything possible to break the spread of this virus.“It is by no means easy, but now more than ever we must all do our part to protect the NHS and save lives.”The daily deaths figure was the highest since New Year’s Eve, when 964 deaths were recorded, although the number is often higher on a Tuesday due to delays in reporting over the weekend.The figures show the total number of people who have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test now stands at 76,305. But separate statistics published by the UK’s statistics agencies for deaths where Covid-19 has been mentioned on the death certificate, together with additional data on deaths that have occurred in recent days, show there have now been 92,000 deaths involving Covid.The ONS infection survey estimates that one in 30 people in private households in London had Covid-19 in the week ending 2 January. The figure was one in 45 for south-east England, eastern England and north-west England. For the east Midlands it was one in 50, for north-east England one in 60, and for the West Midlands and Yorkshire and the Humber one in 65.

Photograph: iStockHow long could school closures last?The Cabinet sub-committee on Covid-19 is meeting on Tuesday afternoon to discuss potential closures of up to three weeks. However, closures could well last longer if community transmission of the virus does not fall significantly. The Taoiseach said on Tuesday that he wants to see the trajectory of the virus falling before they reopen. In much of Britain, schools are set to close until at least mid-February, while in the North they will remain closed for an unspecified period. A review date of school closures in the Republic is set for January 30th.When will remote tuition begin?Schools had been due to reopen on January 6th, but are technically on extended leave until January 11th. Schools will begin remote tuition from then onwards, either in the form of live-streamed classes or work which is assigned to pupils using virtual learning platforms.Are schools in a better place to provide remote tuition?When schools closed last March many scrambled to set up an emergency response. This time around schools are, broadly, better prepared to provide online learning. Teachers are more familiar with remote tuition and virtual learning platforms. There is, however, a digital ide between schools. Some are much better placed to live-stream classes others assign work on a daily or weekly basis for pupils to do in their own time. However, many pupils still don’t have access to devices, reliable broadband or quiet study spaces.What will happen to special schools?It is widely acknowledged that children with special needs lost out most during the previous school closures. Many struggled to engage online and some regressed, losing key skills they had built up over months or even years. On this occasion there is a determination to among Government Ministers to ensure special schools and special classes remain open. While there are health risks, sources say the lower student numbers – with a maximum of six students to a class – make it more viable.Will childcare or early years education stay open?It is likely the sector will close in line with the school system as happened during the previous closures. There may be some limited access to childcare for parents who are frontline workers.What will happen with the Leaving Cert?The Taoiseach said on Tuesday that it was the Government’s firm intention to press ahead with the Leaving Cert in June that is as close to the traditional exam as possible. However, the longer schools remain closed, the more likely it is that calculated grades will be back on the agenda. In the UK, for example, GCSE and A levels will not go ahead as normal and “alternative arrangements” will be put in place.In the Republic, many schools will struggle to hold mock exams and a digital ide means that some students will lose out more than others. Many Leaving Cert students feel anxious about the status of the exams and worry that they have already lost out on months of in-school teaching.In the meantime, a decision will be needed soon on whether the Leaving Cert oral and practical exams will go ahead or be cancelled.What is likely to happen with third level?Minister for Higher Education Simon Harris had signalled that he wanted firs- year students to be able to have some limited on-campus experiences in the new year. This now looks highly unlikely. As a result, the current system on mostly online lectures – with some limited in-person teaching for practicals – will continue.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4450898.1609874226!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"special schools and classes likely to remain open for vulnerable children","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Ombudsman for Children’s has urged the Government to avoid a blanket closure of schools due to the negative affect it will have on vulnerable children.The Government is expected to keep special schools and special classes open for thousands of children with special needs.There are about 16,000 children in special classes in mainstream schools and in special schools, staffed by several thousand teachers and special needs assistants.A further proposal to provide supports for a further 8,000 children with additional needs in mainstream schools – but who are not in special classes – is being examined, according to sources.The idea is that it would be modelled loosely on the summer provision scheme, in which eligible children were able to attend school settings for support last July.Sources say a number of ministers pressed for special education to continue during a\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCabinet sub-committee on Covid-19 met to discuss \u0026nbspthe potential closure of schools until February,Minister for Education Norma Foley is understood to have urged that \u0026nbspspecial schools and special classes in mainstream schools remain open.In addition, Minister for State for children with disabilities Josepha Madigan said she has contacted the Taoiseach and Tánaiste to ensure they remain open and\u0026nbspthat “specific provision” is made for students with special needs in\u0026nbspmainstream classes.The Ombudsman for Children, meanwhile, has urged the Government to avoid a blanket closure of schools due to the negative affect it will have on vulnerable children.                                                                    Dr Niall Muldoon said the closure of all schools, as happened in March last year, is “not a viable option because of the massive impact it will have on our children and their families”.“Without a doubt children with disabilities and children from disadvantaged backgrounds will once more be disproportionately affected by Covid -19 school closures, therefore any long-term measures to reduce transmission in society must consider the substantial negative impact on these groups,” he said.“Education is about more than learning, it is about developing personalities, talents, and abilities of children to reach their greatest potential while also facilitating mental health, play and recreation.“I would urge all of these decision makers to look to how they might generate a nuanced response and facilitate our vulnerable children to attend school as well as how to properly support those who engage in home learning.”Separately, three organisations representing people with disabilities said the removal of support services in education and at home would be “intolerable”.Down Syndrome Ireland, AsIAm, and Inclusion Ireland said the Government must consider the impact that further closures will have on some of the most vulnerable children in the State.Barry Sheridan, CEO of Down Syndrome Ireland, said the supports provided in educational settings such as special school or classes, access to additional teaching time and SNA support are the only tangible resources which they or their family receive from the State.“It is absolutely vital they are retained, if at all possible,” he said.Adam Harris, CEO of AsIAm said children with autism need structure, routine and an opportunity to learn and retain key skills.He said research shows that most vulnerable children experienced increased meltdowns or overloads at home during the last lockdown period.“A large percentage of our communities are unable to engage in online learning owing to cognitive differences,” he added.Enda Egan, CEO of Inclusion Ireland, said the full closure of schools was not a sustainable scenario to repeat and is likely to cause untold suffering to our communities.“ There are numerous models, implemented across EU member states, including providing hubs for students with the greatest level of need, protecting special schools and classes or providing alternative provision.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4450742.1609860563!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"taoiseach confirms school closures until end of month being discussed in bid to reduce mobility","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Micheál Martin said schools were safe but stressed the need to reduce mobility, saying “there is an issue in terms of having a million people on the go” if schools remained open. Photograph: Julien Behal PhotographyPA WireTaoiseach Micheál Martin has confirmed keeping schools closed until the end of the month will be considered by senior Ministers today.He said schools were safe but stressed the need to reduce mobility, saying “there is an issue in terms of having a million people on the go” if schools remained open beyond the delayed reopening date of January 11th.Speaking on RTÉ Radio One this lunchtime, Mr Martin said extending the closure of schools until the end of January was on the agenda at this afternoon’s meeting of the Cabinet sub-committee on coronavirus. The three Coalition leaders and at least six Ministers will participate in the deliberations, with the final decision to be taken at Cabinet tomorrow.Mr Martin said he started his working life as a schoolteacher and remained passionate about education. There was no easy way to implement crude measures but “we have to err on the side of caution”.He said the school year had to be preserved and politicians had to think beyond next week.Asked about the benchmark for reopening schools, he said the trajectory of the disease had to be going in the opposite direction to the one it is going in now.The Taoiseach said he wanted the Leaving Cert to take place in the traditional format in the summer, when a substantial portion of the population was vaccinated. He said January 30th would remain a review date.Mr Martin confirmed Ministers were looking at special education and would have further engagement with that sector because many children with special needs regressed significantly during the last lockdown.Mr Martin said that the issue of childcare for frontline workers would have to be addressed. “We will do what we can. There’s no easy way to implement crude measures.”He also confirmed the construction sector was on the agenda for the meeting. Ministers will discuss whether or not construction should remain open for the rest of the Level 5 lockdown.When asked about the numbers working in the construction sector. Mr Martin said “this isn’t about one sector and how it performs. It’s about societal responsibility.”The Taoiseach said it was likely that the 5km limit would be maintained, which he said was “quite a restrictive measure.”Labour’s education spokesman, Aodhán Ó Ríordáin, said he believes the decision not to reopen schools on Monday has already been made, and it was likely that schools would remain closed until the end of the month.It was not an easy decision for the Government, he acknowledged on Newstalk Breakfast on Tuesday morning but added it was one that needed to be announced as soon as possible.Minister for Children Roderic O’Gorman is meeting representatives of workers and employers in the childcare sector in advance of the sub-committee meeting, which he will attend. It is understood the discussion will focus on provision of childcare services this week, as well as gathering views from the sector on the approach to next week, and public health guidance in services.Last week, Mr O’Gorman announced that the State-funded ECCE programme would remain closed this week, with childcare services remaining open requested to provide services to priority groups. Earlier today, Siptu called for the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) to assess the risks to workers and children in childcare services, saying the sector should be prioritised for vaccination and that those working in it are “extremely frightened” about returning to work. It is understood Minister of State for Special Education Josepha Madigan is pushing for dedicated provision to be made for special schools and special classes, up to and including keeping them open for some students even if the wider school system is shut down, similar to steps taken in the UK. Earlier, Social Democrats co-leader Róisín Shortall said Minister for Education Norma Foley had a responsibility to set out an education plan for the coming weeks. Education needed to continue, she told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland, especially for vulnerable children and those with special needs, along with the children of providers of essential services.A structured programme for remote education should be implemented, Ms Shortall said, adding decisions would need to be taken soon with regard to this year’s State exams as a lot of students were very concerned. “This is a very anxious time, the sooner the situation is made clear the better.”The Government should take the advice of Chief Medical Officer Dr Tony Holohan with regard to the reopening of schools, Ms Shortall said. But she wanted a decision to be taken soon so families could plan.Meanwhile, the Teachers Union of Ireland (TUI) said schools were now better prepared for remote learning with a plan for continuity of learning. General secretary Michael Gillespie said guidance on remote teaching and learning in the Covid-19 context had been agreed for post-primary schools and centres for education.He told Newstalk Breakfast that schools were very unlikely to reopen on Monday, January 11th and that the uncertainty was “not helping anybody”.The closure should last “at a minimum until the 18th” to see if the spread of the virus had been suppressed under the current restrictions.“We’re not calling for a long-term closure – we’re just talking for the minimum time possible to allow this. Schools will open, but they’ll open in a remote context and schools have planned for that.”Schools are likely to stay closed for at least another week and possibly until the end of January due to surging Covid-19 infections, according to senior political sources.Most Ministers privately believe that Cabinet will decide on Wednesday to delay the planned reopening of schools on January 11th, The  understands.However, officials may be asked to examine keeping certain schools open in Level 5 for pupils with special needs.New virus case numbers on Monday surged to a new daily record of 6,110, making the current wave worse than the first one last spring.Dr Holohan, who spoke on Monday with Taoiseach Micheál Martin about the schools issue, said that even though incidence among schoolchildren was lower than for other age groups, it had increased “very, very fast”.Nphet was more concerned about transmission levels in this age group than it was a week ago, he said on Monday night. “We are concerned about our ability to assure the continuing provision of any of the key public services we have tried to protect, and education is one of them.”With regard to the reopening of schools Dr Holohan pointed out that Nphet had “never said” that children did not contract Covid-19. “They do get it, they don’t get it to the same extent as the rest of the population.“The work that has been done across schools, to maintain the school environment as a safe place, we can see that in the data. We’re now in a situation, and we have expressed concerns about this, these levels of infections in children of school-going age have increased very significantly, even if they are less than the average rate in the population.”Meanwhile, the president of the Association of Secondary Students in Ireland (ASTI) has said that State exams must go ahead in 2021 “no matter what”.Speaking to Philip Boucher-Hayes on RTÉ Radio One, Ann Piggott said the contents of exam papers may need to be changed because of the current situation, and that if time was needed to catch up teachers would be willing to discuss the matter with the Department of Education.Ms Piggott called for clarity on the reopening of schools as teachers needed time to plan for remote learning and parents needed to make child-minding arrangements.The union was worried about the increasing levels of the virus in the community. At a meeting with the Minister for Education on Monday, Ms Piggott said they were told that schools were “very safe places” and would reopen on Monday next.“I don’t think there’s honesty in facing what’s happening.”On the same programme Dr Gabrielle Colleran, radiology consultant, warned that if schools closed then some frontline workers would have to stay at home to mind their children. She called for childcare to be provided for such workers so they could go to work when the country was facing the worse of the surge. “We don’t have to reinvent the wheel, other countries have done it.”School principal Colm O’Rourke said that within schools “things have improved by 10 years” since this time last year with regard to remote learning. There had been “huge investment” by the Department of Education and schools were now in a better position to provide online teaching, it was the engagement level that was the issue.The shorter the time out of school, the better, he said.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4450836.1609867021!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"we re stressed and anxious leaving cert students react to likely school closures","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMany Leaving Cert students are worried about the impact of school closures on the planned summer exams. Photograph:  David JonesPA Wire Matthew Colgan Bridgetown, Co Wexford To be honest, I feel school closures may be detrimental to my study, As a Leaving Cert student I worry about how my mocks and orals will be pushed back and I do not feel adequately informed by the Department of Education, who only ever seem to give information to students as an afterthought.I’m extremely worried about the impact the closures will have on my mocks and exams. I do not feel that online learning works for me. Personally, I am more of a hands-on learner and due to the lockdown in March last year, I’m already way behind on my courses. The department’s revision of the exam hasn’t really helped.From how this year has panned out, I would prefer to sit a traditional Leaving Cert exam. I feel that if a conversation was had with students at the start of the school year, my choice might be different, but I do not feel that a system of predicted grading would benefit me personally or any student who is behind on their course – which is almost all of them.I feel extremely uneasy about the prospects of school closing. There’s been no clarity on whether online tuition will be provided or what will happen with our mock exams. This lack of clarity and lack of presence from the minister is what is causing the most stress in my opinion. With mock exams starting at the beginning of February, and weeks of school closures in January, how will they be affected?For students going abroad or applying for scholarships, the mock exams are just as important as the real thing and I don’t see how following, what looks like weeks of closures, they’ll be able to go ahead.Again, the lack of clarity from the Department is the biggest issue. Students are the most important stakeholder in the education system and they’re being kept in the dark.Personally, I’d prefer to sit a traditional Leaving Cert. Keeping a sense of normality is something I’d be really in favour of especially with the chaotic year students have had.I feel closing schools might be the safest option for people. We have seen the number of cases rise to higher than ever before and we need to look at all options to flatten the curve.Personally, I find it hard to stay motivated with online schooling but if I know that it is saving peoples’ lives, I feel more comfortable with closing the schools down for a longer period of time.I am really worried about the impact of closures on the exams. The one thing that we have never been given - but always asked for - is clarity.I know the situation is volatile and it is ever-changing but we need clarity on the plans that are in place. My mocks are scheduled for February 1st. Will they still go ahead now? I have no idea but I need to know what I am meant to be preparing for. It’s the same with the leaving cert exams. I am frustrated with not knowing what is going to happen.Personally, I am happy with a traditional exam or calculated grades. I think an actual Leaving Cert would be something I would prefer though as I am more comfortable with the format and I work well under pressure.Right now, students don’t feel safe with upwards of 5,000 cases a day and going into school with hundreds of other households. This has been a source of immense stress and anxiety for students. However, if schools close fully, this will worsen the digital ide for online learning and disadvantage thousands of exam students.Options for at-home and online learning to the same standard as that given in in-person should also be offered for all those with at-risk family or who are high-risk themselves.The longer we’re closed the more challenges there are around the fairness of the Leaving Cert due to the disparity in accessing online learning. For that reason, I believe exam years should be prioritised in a potentially staggered reopening.With regard to mocks, I do believe they can be postponed. However, the current questions around whether they will go ahead is a source of stress and uncertainty for students which needs to be addressed as soon as possible.If they introduced the calculated grades system, I would have serious concerns having seen how it disadvantaged so many students in the class of 2020.Additionally, key worker parents of children in education were – and still are - put under extreme stress to scramble and find childcare for their children while they continue working on the frontline.We have to ensure that no student is left behind in the months ahead, and that means prioritising services and supports for SEN students and children of key workers so that they don’t feel the brunt of school closures.The prospect of potentially sitting an exam in June with little-to-no adequate preparation for is just one of the many things that are causing a great deal of distress for exam year students across the country.As for a traditional Leaving Cert or calculated grades system, both systems bring many hurdles and obstacles with nameless repercussions. I don’t think there is any clear solution for the class of 2021, but what students do need right now is clarity.The health of myself and my family is my top priority. I understand that schools are deemed a safe environment, but what scares me is being exposed to Covid and bringing it home to my family, and them getting sick. If schools have to close then they have to close but the government needs to have resources in place for students who do not have the facilities for online learning and for the children of frontline workers.Of course I’m worried about the impact of the closures on my exams, this is my leaving cert year, the most stressful year of any teenager’s life in normal times, let alone during a global pandemic. The uncertainty surrounding the 2021 exams has been around since the start of this pandemic when schools closed last March, and when the class of 2020 were sorted out, the class of 2021 felt they had just been left in the dark. Leaving Cert reform needs to happen, people have been saying it for years, and unfortunately it has taken a global pandemic to bring about even slight modifications.I haven’t decided what I would prefer in order to get my Leaving Cert, I see pros and cons in both, but what I do know is that it is unfair for students to be studying for a traditional Leaving Cert exam on top of excessive class tests in the case that there is calculated grades. For the mental wellbeing of both students and teachers we need to know now what is happening.I am very worried myself as I know from last year’s experience that this will have an awful impact on my education. Online education simply can’t match the in-school learning and it is also very tough on students’ mental health to be isolated inside all day, every day. I am very worried for the students who won’t be able to keep on top of their work at home and how this will impact their exams. That being said, I also accept that a lot of students and teachers don’t feel safe in school, particularly during this height of the pandemic.The mocks have always been central to schools Leaving Cert revision courses and for this to be jeopardised I can see most students starting to panic about their Leaving Cert as am I. At this point we are all concerned about our Leaving Cert and we are relying on the Department of Education to make the right decision and we can only hope that they will listen to student voice on this. The Irish Second-Level Students Union (ISSU) have been adamant about getting our voices heard, so it is up to the government to listen and make decisions that are well thought out. Decisions such as closing schools mustn’t be made lightly and it must be understood how this impacts our exams.Personally, I would prefer a traditional Leaving Cert as this is the style of exam I have been preparing for, for the past six years of my second level education.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"About 335,600 people will receive the benefit this weekThe first test is for governments to stop subsidising fossil fuel industry which knowingly contributed to global over-heatingEvery 0.1 degree matters as the world attempts to keep within 1.5-degree rise"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4450757.1609869918!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dublin woman 95 becomes first nursing home resident in the state to be vaccinated","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMaura Byrne, has become the first nursing home resident in the country to receive a Covid-19 vaccination. Photograph: Anthony Edwards, Clinical Photographer, St James’s HospitalA 95-year-old Dublin woman, who lost her husband to coronavirus, has become the first nursing home resident in the country to receive a Covid-19 vaccination.Maura Byrne, who survived the disease, received the first dose of the PfizerBioNTech vaccine at Hollybrook Lodge, the residential care unit managed by St James’s Hospital in Dublin.The State-run care facility in Inchicore is the first nursing home in the country to receive vaccinations. Ms Byrne was the first resident at the care home to be vaccinated on Tuesday.“I feel great at the moment,” said the great-grandmother after receiving the vaccine.She encouraged others to take the vaccine when it becomes available to them.Stephen Byrne, her husband of 70 years, died in April after contracting Covid-19. She was battling Covid-19 in the hospital at the time of his death and unable to attend his funeral.Ms Byrne has been unable to see her family because of visiting restrictions but said she was looking forward to telling her family on a video call on Tuesday.“I’m very, very happy. I’m really happy. I’m lucky. I have an iPad so I have little chats,” said the Dublin woman.“When I go back up now I’ll say: ‘Look! I got the vaccine.’ It’s lovely. They all have messages for you. I have 15 great grandchildren. The great grandchildren would be standing on their heads - they’re really funny.”Ms Byrne’s fight with coronavirus and her death of her husband from the disease featured on the RTE Investigates: Inside Ireland’s Covid Battle that was broadcast in June.“I buried my husband and I couldn’t see him. I watched it on a phone. I wanted to touch my own (family),” she said.“On my husband’s card, he told me that I could ‘cry and want me back or smile and think of the happy days we had.’”Ms Byrne was photographed smiling as she received the Covid-19 vaccine.Mary Day, chief executive of St James’s Hospital, said it was fitting that the roll-out of the vaccine in nursing homes started at Hollybrook as the Dublin hospital is home to the country’s largest acute academic teaching hospital and Mercer’s Institute for Successful Ageing, a clinical research facility for services for the country’s ageing population.“We know that Covid-19 has been particularly challenging for older people and vaccinating our older and vulnerable population and those who care for them is our priority,” she said.Another HSE-run home, Beaumont Hospital’s Raheny Community Nursing Unit, is expecting to have the first dose of the two-dose vaccine administered to its residents on Thursday.The HSE has said that 21 other nursing homes will receive vaccinations this week as it is targeting 35,000 vaccines administered by the end of this week.Private and voluntary nursing homes are scheduled to start receiving their vaccines on Thursday.The HSE plans to roll out vaccines to all 582 nursing homes in the country, public and private, over the next six weeks. There are about 30,000 residents and 35,000 staff in the care facilities.Vaccinator teams will administer doses at each location, making two separate visits, three weeks apart.Nursing homes have borne the brunt of the coronavirus pandemic, with nursing home residents accounting for more than half of 2,265 deaths associated with the virus since March.On December 29th, Annie Lynch, a 79-year-old grandmother from Dublin, became the first person in the State to be vaccinated at St James’s Hospital.Infectious diseases consultant Dr Eavan Muldoon, a breast-feeding mother, became the first healthcare worker in the Mater Hospital in Dublin to receive the Covid-19 vaccine on Tuesday.The 42-year-old mother said she volunteered to be the first person in the Mater to receive the vaccine to reassure people who have concerns about receiving the vaccine while breastfeeding.“We have had several queries from other healthcare workers who are breastfeeding about whether they should get the vaccine and I want to assure them that for their own health, that of their baby and their patients, they should have no hesitation in receiving it,” she said.The Mater said that the vaccination of patients in the hospital will begin shortly.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4450007.1609793884!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"why is ireland s covid vaccination campaign off to such a slow start","story":"December 29th, 2020: Dublin grandmother Annie Lynch (79) became the first person in the Republic to receive the coronavirus vaccine on Tuesday afternoon.

Photograph: Liam McBurneyPA WireWith coronavirus numbers out of control in Ireland and many other countries, there will inevitably be intense focus on progress made by governments in vaccinating their populations against Covid-19.In 12 months’ time, the difference between a slow and a fast rollout of vaccines here will probably be measurable in terms of the loss of hundreds of lives, along with tens of thousands of jobs.So far Ireland has got off to a slow start, leaving the Government and health officials open to accusations of sluggishness and delay. By the end of December one in every 2,500 people had been vaccinated, compared with one in eight in Israel and one in 80 or so in the US and the UK. By that date 1,800 Irish people had been immunised, according to Our World in Data, compared with more than 40,000 in Denmark, a country with a slightly bigger population than our own.The criticisms will only intensify as soaring case numbers heap further pressure on the health service and force much of society to remain shut. The best answer to them is to make serious inroads into vaccinating the population, but this is contingent of there being enough supply.This, in turn, depends on authorisations from EU and Irish regulators, which have tended to lag behind other jurisdictions so far. Another factor is the size of the order made by the EU on behalf of member states for inidual vaccines.It was only after serious pressure from Germany that the European Medicines Agency brought forward its decision last month on the PfizerBionNTech vaccine, and now it is due to make a decision on the Moderna vaccine in the coming days.The agency is not alone among regulators in having issues with the application by OxfordAstra Zeneca for its vaccine, and its requirement for extra data to be provided has pushed back a decision on this until February.Workhorse vaccineThe problem is that this vaccine was conceived as the workhorse of European vaccination programmes, because it is cheap, easy to transport and works in a way similar to existing vaccines, unlike the PfizerBioNTech and Moderna treatments, which use novel technology.The EU went for a strategy of not putting all its eggs in the one basket by placing orders for six different vaccines. It may also, with the benefit of hindsight, have spent too long haggling over price. A number of last year’s likely contenders got delayed, and regulatory decisions moved slowly, leaving the bloc with insufficient orders for the vaccine that was out of the traps first, PfizerBioNTech.As a result, there is little point in the Irish vaccination programme “getting ahead of itself” until a secure and ample pipeline of vaccines comes on stream. Until that happens, we will have to make the best use of what we have. The UK has delayed the second dose of the vaccine so that a greater number can be administered a first dose and so enjoy the partial protection this offers. This approach has split scientific opinion. Even the drug manufacturers are ided, with Pfizer resolutely opposed to any delay in administering a second dose of its vaccine and AstraZeneca more favourably disposed to the idea.For now, this approach has been ruled out in Ireland but another idea we may adopt from the UK is to extract six doses from a vial of PfizerBionNTech vaccine rather than the recommended five. When the right needle is used, the content of the dose can be split six ways, rather than being used five times and leaving some fluid over. This could potentially increase productivity by up to 20 per cent.Who’s the boss?Some countries have decided to start their vaccination programme with working-age adults rather than vulnerable care home residents, but this approach is unlikely to find favour in Ireland.At this point, it is difficult to tell who is running the vaccine rollout programme here. Is it the Department of Health, which has decided the public health response during the pandemic? Or the HSE, which is administering the vaccinations? Or the taskforce that drew up an implementation plan and is still active?While the UK started administering the OxfordAstra Zeneca vaccine at 7.30am on Monday, Irish journalists seeking updates on supplies of the Moderna vaccine here were being referred by the Department of Health to the HSE, and by the HSE to the department. A plan for vaccinations in nursing homes was delayed on Monday, seemingly over consent issues. GPs are still wondering when they and their staff will be immunised.At least Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly was able to announce an increase in this week’s vaccination target from 20,000 to 35,000.None of these early teething issues will matter in the long run, hopefully, but greater clarity would do no harm.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"Northern Ireland secretary could detract from Blair statement of regret, officials feared-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4450887.1609871375!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"covid 19 ban on travel from britain and south africa to be extended by 48 hours","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe ban on travel from Britain and South Africa is set to be extended by 48 hours, it is understood.

Cabinet will consider any further measures when it meets on Wednesday.Sources added that the extension on travel from Britain and South Africa would now last until Friday night, although Cabinet may decide on a longer extension.It comes as the latest genomic testing shows that 25 per cent of positive Covid-19 cases sampled in the State contain the UK variant, chief medical officer Tony Holohan told Ministers at a briefing today, according to Government sources.The new variant is thought to be far more infectious, but samples up to now had suggested it accounted for less than 10 per cent of cases and may not have been responsible for the recent significant increase in coronavirus case numbers. The South Africa strain may be more transmissible.Concerns are particularly high over the South African variant because it is not only thought to be more contagious but there are fears it could affect the current vaccines, unlike the novel strain that has achieved high prevalence in England.In a statement Aer Lingus said it will not operate flights from Great Britain to the Republic of Ireland in the period of the extended ban.The airline said it is operating flights from the State to Great Britain in order to facilitate the repatriation of customers to Great Britain and those with connecting flights in Great Britain.It said customers whose flights have been cancelled will be contacted by Aer Lingus directly, and are entitled to a refund, voucher or rerouting at a later date.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com\"/polopoly_fs/1.4385961!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_940/image.jpg","title":"us on course for a less than revolutionary administration","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t‘Radical laws and sharp ruptures from the status quo require either decisive majorities or support from the other side. A ided electorate allows for neither.’As ever, Tom Wolfe got there first. Readers had expected the author of The Bonfire of the Vanities to “do” Los Angeles or Chicago after his treatment of 1980s New York. Instead, the place that drew his fine eye for trends was Atlanta. A Man in Full considered the city, and the state that it anchors, as America’s potential future. Some 23 years on, Georgia continues to grow in population as several other states shrink. Once uncompetitively Republican, it is now the nation’s political schism in miniature.Nowhere was closer-fought in the US presidential election two months ago. If the Democrats take both of its Senate seats, to go with Joe Biden’s win there, imagine the symbolism. Here is a party going with the grain of the nation’s evolution.But not, it is worth saying, a party with a suddenly free hand. A split Senate, with the vice-president casting decisive votes, does not assure Biden a radical presidency. His chances of that waned when the “blue wave” of congressional gains failed to materialise in November. His subsequent nominations to the executive – their mildness, their familiarity – admit as much. His flirtations with the left are just a few months old but feel a century ago. His first problem is that a Senate majority is only as good as its internal cohesion. Conservative Democrats are not the force they were but, in a tight vote, it takes just a few to scuttle progressive dreams. West Virginia’s Joe Manchin is one who has to mind his red-state electors. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, Georgia-like in its competitiveness, has no more incentive to rile swing- or right-leaning voters.Any defections on his own side would leave Biden exposed to Republican intransigence. What hope there was of a more co-operative party post-November is embarrassing to recall now. In its bogusness and tenacity, Donald Trump’s quest to overturn his election defeat somehow intensifies by the week. Nothing in his presidency became him less than the leaving of it.But leave it he will. It is the conduct of the Republicans who remain in Washington that promises an ordeal for Biden. A dozen or so senators plan to contest the certification of the election result. That is more than a fifth of the Republicans there. Estimates of like-minded colleagues in the lower chamber exceed 100.And this is three years ahead of a presidential nomination race that will only incentivise such pandering to right-wing grassroots. Some of those activists will march against certification on Wednesday. A party that will not grant the president-elect’s legitimacy is not going to consider his legislation on its merits. Clinton and Obama And so the US is on course for a less than revolutionary administration. But then it has known no other for some time. Bill Clinton and Barack Obama were supernaturally gifted politicians. Both lost Congress at their first mid-term elections, and their domestic programmes with it. Clinton did not even have a landmark statute to show for two years of unified government. As for Trump, he secured a tax cut before losing the House of Representatives at the first time of asking – never to recover.Come to think of it, no US administration since the 1980s could be described as transformative, at least on the home front. Presidents still have their executive orders and discretion in foreign affairs. But social change on the Lyndon Johnson-Ronald Reagan scale tends to entail legislation, and lots of it. With the exception of Obamacare, the boldest versions have not survived Washington’s sieve in recent decades.The evidence nudges us to a conclusion that is no less true for its perverseness. The real winners of the age of partisanship are those who hate it most. The winners are the moderates. Radical laws and sharp ruptures from the status quo require either decisive majorities or support from the other side. A ided electorate allows for neither. America’s bifurcation, once it feeds into legislative numbers and conduct, puts paid to grand schemes. Voters in the middle find themselves in the oddest of predicaments: scandalised by the viciousness of politics and yet served by its results.“Moderate”, to be clear, is not a synonym for “good”. This time last year, immoderate measures against the coronavirus pandemic would have saved lives. Splitting the difference on Trump’s attempt to stay in office would be a nonsense. Equidistance from opposing arguments is no guarantor of sound policy. It is with surprise, then, not elation, that we should record this oddity of modern politics.

It is not always one of extreme outcomes. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2021Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"analysis south african coronavirus variant worrying","story":"If the coronavirus was a horror film, we have now reached the obligatory ‘not dead yet’ scare, in which the seemingly conquered monster returns from the grave to give a final fright. Just as light was beginning to emerge at the end of a very long and gloomy tunnel, the South African variant of the virus threatens to undermine the vaccine and testing gains of recent months.Brian Pinker, 82, received the first Oxford vaccine on Monday, yet there are real concerns that he and the hundreds of thousands of others who have had their jabs may not be fully protected against this latest mutation.Clearly the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is expecting some vaccine tweaks to be needed as it has already begun to look at how quickly an altered jab could be approved, and Matt Hancock has said he is very worried.The problem lies in how the virus has mutated. Variants of coronavirus have been around since the beginning of the pandemic and are a natural evolutionary process by which viruses adapt to their hosts as they replicate.Most of these mutations have no effect, but occasionally they can improve the ability of the virus to infect or become more resistant to the body’s immune response. This is one such occasion.The South African variant has three mutations in important genes. One, the N501Y mutation, has already been found in the UK variant and could be responsible for it being so infectious.However, the South African version carries two more mutations (E484K and K417N) that are absent in the British version and make it far more worrying. “These two additional mutations may interfere more with vaccine effectiveness in the South African variant than in the UK variant,” said Dr Julian W Tang, honorary associate professor and clinical virologist, University of Leicester.“This does not mean that the existing Covid-19 vaccines will not work at all, just that the antibodies induced by the current vaccines may not bind and neutralise the South African variant as well as it would the other circulating viruses, including the UK variant.”The South African variant carries mutations in a gene which builds spike proteins – the rod-like structures on the outside of the virus which attaches to human cells.Spike proteins are also produced by vaccines so that the body knows what to look for and what to fight off. So, any significant changes to the spike protein may mean the body can no longer spot the virus, even after vaccination or a previous infection, and antibodies produced in anticipation may not be able to attach properly in order to clear it away.Worryingly, the mutations may also mean that it is harder to pick up cases through the normal Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing, so it could have already spread widely. It quickly became the dominant variant in the Eastern and Western Cape provinces of South Africa.Yet there is still hope. Even if the new variant is more infectious, it may not cause more severe disease. England\u0027s chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, and chief scientific officer, Patrick Vallance, are believed to have briefed Boris Johnson, claiming they are not overly concerned about the new variant.And even if the South African variant becomes more widespread and dominant, both vaccines can be modified to be more effective against this variant in as little as six weeks. Most scientists believe that existing vaccines will still work to some extent, even if the new variant lowers the overall efficacy. The mutations have not altered the shape of the spike protein to such an extent that antibodies cannot bind at all, they just may be less effective. “It is not anticipated that this mutation is sufficient for the ‘South African’ variant to bypass the protection provided by current vaccines,” said Prof Francois Balloux, professor of computational systems biology, University College London (UCL). “It’s possible that new variants will affect the efficacy of the Covid-19 vaccines, but we shouldn’t make that assumption yet about the South African one.”Researchers are working round the clock to find out just how dangerous this new variant is, and new lockdown measures introduced by the Government will undoubtedly help to stem the tide, and give scientists room to find a new solution.Prof James Naismith, director of the Rosalind Franklin Institute, and University of Oxford, said: We can all help if we redouble our efforts to wash our hands, wear a mask and socially distance.

Such is the frequency of the inaccuracies, one might almost think they were deliberate. Perhaps we have brought it on ourselves heaven knows the British harbour unflattering views of the average American, existing on a spectrum somewhere between Homer Simpson and Eric Cartman. But the reasons for the NYT’s slanted view lie very firmly in the past, and its preoccupation with re-writing it to alter the present.It’s not just its dispatches about the UK that the Grey Lady has come under fire for recently — for a paper of record, it has recorded some howlers. The NYT issued one article, following a two month investigation into its award-winning podcast series “Caliphate” stating the paper had “fallen short” of its standards for giving “too much credence” to “false or exaggerated” evidence. Then there was the fallout over a comment piece, written by Republican Senator Tom Cotton, on deploying the US military against protestors over the summer, which led to the resignations of senior editor James Bennet, and star columnist Bari Weiss, the latter claiming she had been the victim of targeted bullying. Staff at the Times had apparently claimed publishing the column represented a physical threat to their wellbeing.Another NYT journalist, Nikole Hannah-Jones, led the charge against the likes of Weiss, and said she was “deeply ashamed” of the paper for publishing the Cotton op-ed. But Hannah-Jones, too, has been at the centre of fierce criticism as the architect of the paper’s feted 1619 Project (for which she won a Pulitzer Prize last year), the stated aim of which is to “reframe the country’s history by placing the consequences of slavery … at the very center of the national narrative.”Despite the accolades, the project has come in for intense scrutiny from an array of commentators and historians, amid claims it promotes factual inaccuracies to push an ideological agenda. The NYT initially defended it before later issuing several corrections — but it is through this last story that we can begin to understand the paper’s continued misreporting of life the other side of the pond. Americans tend to view Britain as a quaint place at best where everyone is either a cockney, an unemployed miner or a public school boy, where the food is bad, the teeth are worse, and we yearn for the days of red-coated flag-waving empire. For that last thing in particular, you can see why a certain animosity might exist at a newspaper bent on pushing a rewriting of history based on the transatlantic slave trade and historical injustice. Britain is the old colonial master — the birth place of the tyranny from which the patriots fought to free themselves, and the nation that brought liberal east coast America’s modern notion of evil “whiteness” to the continent. If slavery is America’s original sin (with an uncomfortable shuffle over questions on the fate of the natives) Britain is the serpent that despoiled this once tranquil Eden. Nor should we discount the fact that the NYT, based where it is, panders first to a community with deep Irish migrant roots, often away from the mismanagement and subjugation of their homeland by the British. All forms of Republican culture, from the country club sets and Ivy League networks to white trash and rednecks, are seen as Anglo-Saxon in heritage. Even the country’s hard Christian streak is typified by the arrival of the Puritan pilgrims aboard the Mayflower — so English that they broke with the Church of England for being a little too Roman Catholic for their liking. Britain, and specifically England, then, must forever be seen through this prism, as the backwards desolation America must leave behind - more a Troy to these Romans than a Greece. Combine that with the lazy comparisons between the Maga movement and Brexit, and the tenuous similarities between Donald Trump and Boris Johnson, and their fates, and you get the full package: America endured Trump and overcame, while backwards old Britain is stuck with Boris and Brexit. Not just a warning from history, but a live action alternative of how much worse things could be. If that is the fantasy world the paper wishes to inhabit, so be it. From afar, we have already seen what isive and delusional outcomes framing stories to suit your beliefs has brought to America in the past few years. Britain too has indulged in its fair share. But let us not pretend that it is anything other than fantasy, regardless of whether it’s a “paper of record” peddling it.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons january 2021","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlTo order The 2020 limited-edition Matt Christmas jigsaw, go to telegraphcartoonjigsawsOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514. To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Restrictions may need to be brought in next winter, Chris Whitty warnsComment: It’s a mystery of our memories that it sometimes pays to forgetGeorgia run-offs: Democratic odd couple carry Joe Biden\u0026#39s hopes of Senate control on their shouldersThe priority list for the Oxford and Pfizer vaccines - and how they will be rolled outBritain\u0026#39s oldest identical twins, 96, reveal that they are both battling CovidFormer Chinese Communist party official sentenced to death in high-profile bribery and bigamy caseWealthy tech boss, Lawrence Jones, is charged with rape and four sexual assaultsOxford Covid-19 vaccine Q\u0026ampA: How effective is it, and how is it different to the Pfizer vaccine?Son of millionaire took his life after realising \u0026#39extent of his his emptiness\u0026#39, mother tells inquestComment: The answer to the exams dilemma?

Opposition politicians have slammed the slow progress as a “state scandal”, calling the sluggish start a national disgrace. Under pressure to take personal responsibility, President Emmanuel Macron held a crisis meeting on the bottleneck with his prime minister and other officials at the Elysée on Monday evening.Hours later, Mr Véran said France would now amplify, accelerate and simplify its vaccination strategy. “By Thursday we will increase numbers in a major way. We will be on an exponential curve,” he told RTL.Vaccinations for people over 75 years of age who are not in care homes would be authorised by the end of January, covering five million people, he said, adding that the campaign would also be widened to include firefighters and home helpers over 50. Anyone who wished to be vaccinated would “in the coming days” be able to register for a jab online, he added.Rules requiring only a doctor or a nurse under the direct supervision of a doctor to inject the vaccine would be eased. A doctor would be allowed to supervise multiple nurses at any one time in a vaccination centre, said Mr Véran.Similarly, rules requiring that any person wanting a Covid vaccine must hold a consultation with a doctor first would also be made simpler.France was on course to receive 500,000 doses of a vaccine developed by Pfizer per week, Mr Veran said. Once approved for use within the EU, 500,000 doses of a vaccine by Moderna would be added every month.However, opposition politicians questioned his assertions and claimed the woefully slow start to France\u0027s campaign masked a dearth of doses.Xavier Bertrand, president of the northern Hauts-de-France region, said: I want the government to tell us the truth: Exactly how many doses have been ordered by France?Mr Bertrand said he had the unpleasant impression that there is a lack of vaccines, while the Socialist deputy mayor of Paris, Emmanuel Gregoire, asked: Where are the doses now?Manon Aubry, a European Parliament deputy for the left-wing France Unbowed, said that 2021 starts just like 2020 ended, with a lack of preparation, amateurism and, after the fiasco concerning masks and testing, we now have the fiasco of the vaccines.Two MPs from the opposition LR party meanwhile called on the National Assembly to summon the health minister for an update.Jean Castex, the prime minister, dismissed suggestions of a vaccine shortage saying this was no time for “sterile arguments”.French health authorities face an uphill struggle convinced the wider population of the merits of vaccination despite the national death toll, now above 65,000. Just 40 per cent of the French public want to take the vaccine compared with 77 percent in Britain, according to an opinion poll last week by Ipsos Global Advisor in partnership with the World Economic Forum.The country has a curfew system in place but no nationwide lockdown and all schools reopened on Monday.The vaccination controversy came amid fears France could be hit by a wave of the new, more contagious variant virus strain that emerged in England.Mr Veran confirmed authorities had detected about a dozen suspected or confirmed cases and were watching for any outbreaks like hawks”.A first case was detected in Tours, in the Loire, after a French citizen returning from the UK tested positive. Other cases have been detected in Corsica and Paris while the biggest cluster was among nine rugby players and staff from Bayonne who contracted the virus after playing Leicester at home on December 19. They self-isolated and have since all tested negative.French health authorities on Monday reported 4,022 new coronavirus cases confirmed in the previous 24 hours, taking the total to 2.66 million. French deaths from Covid-19 now total 65,415.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"iran claims south korea holding 5bn money hostage tanker seizure","story":"The tanker, the MT Hankuk Chemi, was seized yesterday and escorted to an Iranian port under the pretext that it was causing pollution in the Strait of Hormuz, according to Iranian officials.  But the ship’s owners have denied this and revealed the tanker was boarded by armed marines from the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), suggesting that Tehran intends to use it as leverage in a dispute with Seoul over frozen Iranian assets.Ali Rabiei, a spokesman for the Islamic regime, denied accusations of “hostage diplomacy” over the capture of the ship, which was carrying a cargo 7,200 tonnes of ethanol from Saudi Arabia to the United Arab Emirates when it was intercepted by IRGC speedboats and a helicopter off the coast of Oman.   “We\u0027ve become used to such allegations ... but if there is any hostage-taking, it is Korea\u0027s government that is holding $7 billion (£5.15 billion) which belongs to us hostage on baseless grounds,” Mr Rabiei told reporters at a news conference streamed online.Tehran has previously accused South Korea of being a “lackey” of the United States and demanded it release the money which it says it is owed from oil sales made before the Trump administration tightened sanctions on the Islamic republic.The foreign ministry in Seoul demanded the vessel’s release, but insisted it would seek a diplomatic solution to the crisis. It is now reviewing whether a senior diplomat will visit Tehran on Sunday as planned.The incident comes as Iran stoked tensions with the United States, Israel and other western powers by committing fresh breaches of a 2015 nuclear deal designed to limit its enrichment of uranium, the raw material for a nuclear bomb. It has also accused President Trump of “fabricating a pretext for war” by sending B-52 bombers to fly over the Persian Gulf.The Iranian military started a two-day \u0027large-scale drone exercise\u0027 in the north of the country today, (Tuesday) unveiling new hardware including new unmanned “suicide drones” that are designed to hover over a battlefield before ing down to a target.  Iran has previously been accused of detaining ships and foreign nationals as a way of putting pressure on countries it disagrees with.Prisoners include Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the British-Iranian mother, who is serving a five year sentence for spying, which she strongly denies.Her family say her ordeal is due to an historic debt that Britain owes Iran over the cancelled sale of Chieftain tanks following the Iranian revolution in 1979.  More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"lockdown 1 2 3 vs tier 4 differences unable do","story":"England has entered its third lockdown after the Prime Minister ordered the country to once again stay at home in an address to the nation on Jan 4. From Wednesday, Jan 6, the lockdown will become law, and people will only be allowed to leave their homes for specific reasons, such as to shop for essential items or exercise. Compared to the previous lockdowns, these restrictions resemble those we saw in the first lockdown in March.The Government have not committed to a timeframe, but it is expected that some restrictions will still be in place in March. Here are the key similarities and differences between the three lockdowns: In an announcement that resembled the first lockdown, Boris Johnson reiterated the Government\u0027s first slogan - \u0027Stay at home, protect the NHS, save lives\u0027 - amid a significant rise in hospital admissions.You may now only go outside to shop for essentials, to visit those in your support bubble, for medical purposes, exercise, and to work, if you are unable to work from home. The majority of the public - some 44million - were already living under these restrictions in Tier 4 however, the Prime Minister has now enforced these rules across the whole country. They will become legally-binding when Parliament reconvenes on Wednesday. These restrictions are also similar to the second lockdown in November before the tier system which saw non-essential shops begin to close.You are limited to go outside to exercise once a day, which was the case in the first lockdown.You can exercise in a public outdoor place:But, once more, you will not be able to sit down with this person because park benches are again off-limits.Also, unlike the March lockdown, the Government has promised to keep playgrounds open, encouraging children to stay active. Gyms and leisure centres will be forced to close throughout the new lockdown, as they did in March, November, and in Tier 4.Outdoor sports teams will also be postponed with only elite spots allowed to continue.The vulnerable will receive a letter, once again, which instructs them to shield and protect themselves. Mr Johnson announced the Government and local GP\u0027s would advise the vulnerable on what the rules mean for them, saying: If you are clinically extremely vulnerable, we are advising you to begin shielding again, and you will shortly receive a letter about what this means for you.These letters resemble both the March and November lockdown when the vulnerable received a letter of support.Perhaps the biggest difference between the three lockdowns is the question of school closures.The first lockdown saw schools close for everybody except the children of key workers.However, in November, schools and other education settings, remain open, meaning many children continued studying as normal. In this current lockdown, all schools and higher education settings such as universities will close as they did in March, so the children of key workers will be allowed to go to school. Other children and students will have to resume remote learn, until at least February, the government has announced. The closures come after scientists warned that school closures were essential to keep the country’s R number below one.All restaurants, bars and other hospitality settings must close their doors once again under measures which are similar to those of the first two lockdowns. But, unlike March and November, the Government has set tighter rules on drink.Many enjoyed takeaway pints during the previous two lockdowns.So while restaurants can offer food and soft drinks for delivery or takeaway, they will no longer be allowed to sell alcohol, with the Government aiming to prevent people from mixing with alcohol in the streets. Unlike the measures seen last spring and autumn, places of worship will remain open for prayer, and for weddings and funerals.Previously, places of worship were forced to close, with the exception of funerals, or to record a service for a broadcast or live stream. Weddings can only take place under exceptional circumstances, however, funerals can go ahead, and a maximum of 30 people can attend. Just as the first lockdown, we do not yet know how long these restrictions will stay in place. Mr Johnson suggested he expects the measures to last until mid-February at least.However, in an interview with Sky News, Michael Gove said we were more likely to see some restrictions being eased at the beginning of March. This is different to the November lockdown, when Mr Johnson promised the measures would end one month after the announcement, on Dec 2.However, unlike the first two lockdowns, we are now amid the largest vaccination programme in British history, which is the biggest difference between the three. Mr Johnson said: The weeks ahead will be the hardest yet but I really do believe we are entering the last phase of the struggle.Thanks to the miracle of science not only is the end in sight but we know exactly how we will get there.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"one last push misery could government must make lockdown count","story":"Lockdowns work. Well, sort of. Clearly, they suppress the spread of the virus while they are in place. But unless they are replaced with something that will contain a subsequent spread, it’s hard to see how their enormous cost can be justified. This time, though, that something IS in place. Where before we were locking down for the sake of it, now we are doing it as a means to an end: vaccinating the 13.9 million most vulnerable people in the country.Describing it as a ‘third lockdown’ is disingenuous. November was barely a lockdown at all. All one needed to do was walk through central London to see throngs of people socialising, dozens of non-essential shops open, rapidly formed and popped ‘bubbles’, and some very dubious forms of ‘essential exercise’. While the restrictions may have slowed the spread, they were not nearly enough to stop it. To avoid the same pitfalls this time around - when the stakes are so much higher - the Government must of course get serious about ramping up vaccines. But it must also avoid the bear trap too few are talking about: the safety of vaccination centres themselves.It is hard to think of anything more deadly than gathering some of the most vulnerable iniduals together, often indoors, often, in fact, in hospitals which are treating infectious Covid patients. I was shocked this weekend to learn of the conditions in some vaccination centres from a friend who recently accompanied a vulnerable inidual to an inoculation session. The site had set up a narrow queue – indoors –  in a poorly ventilated corridor, with next to no social distancing.If these conditions are commonplace, it’s not hard to see how the whole vaccination programme could backfire. Indeed, a separate inidual linked to the Test and Trace effort tells me that some tracers are reporting speaking to people whose only possible exposure in the last week was in the vaccination clinic itself. No doubt epidemiologists across the nation over will soon be clasping their heads in their hands and evoking the words of a memorable Brass Eye sketch, “this is the one thing we didn’t want to happen.” The Government cannot risk avoidable policy errors that could extend the time our nation suffers under this costly lockdown - which means following Israel’s lead in outdoor and drive through centres is surely a no brainer. One good thing about this new lockdown is that now, all but fringe actors are on the same team. Absolutely everyone from the Covid Recovery Group to the staunchest proponents of harsh lockdowns are willing the Government to deploy an imaginative and rapid rollout that sees restrictions lifted within two months.The Government must not betray their trust. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"jacob rees mogg slammed crossing","story":"NewsJacob Rees-Mogg slammed for crossing coronavirus tiers to attend churchExclusive: The controversial Leader of the Commons was spotted ignoring his own Government’s guidance not to travel between tiers on SundaymirrorShareCommentsByAdam Aspinall:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsThe Leader of the House of Commons attended mass in Tier  but lives in a Tier  area \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get US and UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The controversial Leader of the Commons was spotted ignoring his own Government’s guidance not to travel between tiers on Sunday. He was seen attending St Mary’s catholic church in Glastonbury, Somerset, which is in Tier  and fteen miles from his posh manor house home in West Harptree, which is in Tier . While people are allowed to attend church in Tier  areas the Government’s own guidance is that people should not travel from one tier to another and keep social contact to a minimum. Writer Liz Williams, , from Glastonbury was told Jacob Rees-Mogg visited town to attend the Latin mass conducted on Sunday. She told The Mirror: “A number of people are very cross about this, while not as egregious as what Dominic Cummings did, he is still crossing from tier  to tier  just to go to mass, which we are told not to do. “I think the anger in town is the fact that not only is this not essential, even though he may argue dferently as a Christian, but that he is actually a member of the Government that is setting this policy. “It just seems yet again like there is one rule for us and one rule for the rest of them. “Look I am not a Christian, I am not a Tory, I am just a normal upstanding member of the community who is fed up of this hypocritical approach from the people that are setting these rules.” Father Bede Rowe, of St Marys church, confirmed to The Mirror that Jacob Rees-Mogg attended the afternoon Latin mass at there on Sunday. When askedhe saw Jacob Rees-Mogg at the holy ceremony on he simply said “yes” but refused to be drawn on whether it was appropriate for the politician to have crossed tiers to attend the service and said he did not speak to him. He said: “We are not allowed to speak to people before or after mass due to the Diocesan guidelines. “All I know is that our churches are open and people can come to mass, you would have to speak to himabout this.” Another Glastonbury resident, who says he has attended services with Rees-Mogg at the church in the past but does not want to be named, said: “He is not there every week, but it is a very nice environment to be in.  “The priests there, who are also Benedictine monks, have set-up this kind of little mystic order and they are using all these old kinds of worship that dates from before the Reformation using Latin and the Latin mass that they are doing in there is the thing that has apparently attracted Mogg. “But does the Leader of the House of Commons really need to cross tiers to go to a Latin mass though  “I don’t know why he would have chosen to be there on Sunday, I don’t know why he considered it important enough to completely ignore all the guidance his own people are putting out there. “Recently we had a lot of revellers in town during the Winter Solstice and they raised a lot of eyebrows and got a lot of hostility because they were ignoring the regulations and the bottom line is people are responding the same to him on this as they did with them.” "},{"url":null,"title":"mutant covid variant taking off","story":"NewsMutant Covid iant taking off in UK outside London and South East - see breakdownEnglands chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty warned that the new mutant strain that originated in the countrys south east is now clearly spreading rapidly where toomirrorShareCommentsByTalia ShadwellReporter:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror incoming video whitty-says-covid--iant-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : #

Professor Chris Whitty told the Downing Street press conference that the fastest increase of the new iant remains in the east of England, London and south-east. But it is now taking off in other areas as well, he said. Englandaposs chief medical officer said there were some indications the virulent new strainaposs impact levelling off, following a period of Tier  restrictions in hotspots and as the country enters a third national lockdown.What do you think of the lockdown decision  Share your views in the comments below... However he added hospitalisations across England are rising very rapidly and, of course, we are still in the middle of winter. Prof Whitty also warned there would aposinevitablyapos be an increase in deaths in January.He added that one in  people being estimated to have coronavirus across the UK in the days following Christmas is really quite a large number indeed. He cited the Office for National Statistic estimates, as he said that the second lockdown in November had brought down rates. But he warned the risks will not disappear in the spring, despite the vaccine rollout. In a stark warning, Prof Whitty said the UK could still face restrictions anew next winter. If people donapost take the aposstay at homeapos seriously, the risk at this point in time, in the middle of winter with this new iant, is extraordinarily high, he said. We shouldnapost kid ourselvesthis just disappears with spring.  He said the new iant and the worst period of winter pressures on the NHS had combined to lead to current surging rates of the virus. The UK today recorded , new cases of Covid- in the last  - in the largest daily increase reported so far. And a further  people died within  days of testing positive for the virus as of Tuesday. Boris Johnson told the news conference tonight that in the days leading up to the lockdown announcement the Government had been looking at the new iant of coronavirus.The Prime Minister said officials had become aware of its rapid spread on December . Mr Johnson said it had been hoped that Tier  measures would have had an impact and allow for schools to be kept open.

The Government is finalising plans to tighten up border restrictions, which are expected to include pre-flight tests for anyone entering the country.Asked whether UK residents would be included in the rules, Boris Johnson told a Downing Street press conference: “We will be bringing in measures to ensure that we test people coming into this country and prevent the virus from being readmitted.”But there has been disagreement between departments over whether only foreign visitors or all people arriving in the UK, including residents, to be required to supply a negative test up to  hours before departure. If agreed, it would mean British nationals who travelled overseas for Christmas could be prevented from ing home until they can provide a negative test. A Department for Transport spokesman said: Protecting public health in the UK is of the utmost importance and we are looking at what additional measures could be taken with regards to international travel. Hauliers would be exempt from the plans being discussed by officials and ministers today. Currently arrivals into England from nations that are not exempted under the travel corridor programme have to isolate for  days.

High-profile events such as Glastonbury, TRNSMT and Parkle face having to cancel or postpone events within weeks to avoid the huge cost of scrapping events at the last minute. Industry figures have called for a range of measures to help the multi-million pound sector from disaster - including a government-backed Covid- cancellation insurance. Some . million people attended a festival in the UK in , with festivals estimated to have generated £. billion in gross value added last year. Last month, Germany announced a £. billion event cancellation fund and other countries have introduced measures to encourage festivals. Sacha Lord, co-founder of Manchesteraposs Parkle said smaller festivals would disappear in the wake of more cancellations. Parkle, which attracts some , attendees annually, has been delayed until September  and more than  artists and suppliers have already been booked. If we have got another year like , we have got serious problems, Lord told the Commons Culture committee who are looking at how Government can support the industry. Anna Wade, communications and strategy director of Boomtown Fair, had some  full-time employee before Covid-. She told the committee: “In terms of Boomtown, it is a very similar story as it is for all festivals and events up and down the country. We were absolutely decimated as well. We were first to really shut down and will probably be one of the last to reopen as well. Jamie Njoku-Goodwin, chief executive of the trade body UK Music, called on the Government to help boost confidence in festivals and encourage punters back. And Paul Reed, the chief executive of the Association Of Independent Festivals, said festivals were rapidly approaching the determination point and some larger events would have to make a decision within weeks.  UK Music today published a report calling on the government to provide the music industry with an indicative date for when live events can resume with full capacities. Mr Njoku-Goodwin said: Government is rolling out the vaccine and is openly speculating about ing to normal by the spring - but there is a serious risk that eventhis proves to be a reality, lack of notice and available insurance options will mean much of the  summer music season canapost go ahead. Steve Heap, general secretary of the Association of Festival Organisers, said April was the latest festivals could decide to cancel.

All schools must shut until at least the February half-term and you must stay at home except for five specic reasons. Shielding will resume and all pubs must shut - with takeaway pints banned. Boris Johnson gave a TV address after , people tested on a single day - December  - came back positive.England has , patients in hospital, % more than during the first peak of the virus in April, as a new iant rips through the nation. And the case rate in England up to December  was over  per , - three times the . on December . The lockdown will begin tonight but only actually begin in law as soon as possible - probably tomorrow or the next day. People and businesses are being asked to follow the rules from now, even before they become law. How will the new lockdown affect you  Have your say in the comments below. The new lockdown applies across the whole of England, even the Scilly Isles which had been in Tier . There is no set end date, but it will be reviewed by February . People who have been vaccinated will not be exempt from any lockdown rules. MPs will get a vote on the new measures when parliament is recalled on Wednesday. There is likely to be fury at the PM for delaying over precious days after he knew the new iant was spreading through society. The lockdown is more similar to the first one in March than the most recent in November but there are subtle dferences. Here are the new rules that have been announced and what they mean for you. Full details are also published on gov.uk here. aposStay at homeapos order  There will be a very firm “stay at home” message similar to the March lockdown - and effective immediately. You may leave home for one of these five specic reasonable excuses:To go to work or volunteerit’s impossible to do so from home, e.g. a construction or critical worker who can’t work from home. To shop for necessities including food and medicine. To exercise, which can be with your household or up to one other person from outside your household or bubble. The exercise should ideally be limited to once per day. Guidance is that people should try to do this locally. To provide care or help to a vulnerable person. This includes buying food or medicine for a disabled person or someone self-isolating. To attend medical appointments or seek medical care or fleeing the threat of harm or violence.There are other aposreasonable excusesapos on top of these main five ones. You may also leave home for education and registered childcare,your children are eligible to attend despite closures. You may also leave home to be with your childcare or support bubble,you have one, but you are advised to keep it local. You can also leave home to:provide emergency assistance be with someone giving birth visit someone who is dying visit a care home, hospital or hospice resident fulfil animal welfare reasons including going to a vet attend a support groupattend communal worship or le events such as weddings and funerals fulfil a legal obligation carry out activity related to buying, selling, letting or renting a property fulfil respite care where that care is being provided to a vulnerable person or a person with a disability, or is a short break in respect of a looked-after child.Police will have legal powers to enforce through fines and dispersing orders. Fines will stay at their current level of £ for a first offence. Schools, education and childcare  All primary schools, secondary schools and colleges will shut to almost all pupils from tomorrow. Only children of key workers and vulnerable kids can attend in person. Others will learn remotely. This is in line with the March lockdown and much stricter than the November lockdown. There will be a system to get free school meals to eligible kids but it hasn’t been announced or rolled out yet. BTec exams will go ahead this week but GCSEs and A-levels this summer are unlikely to proceed as planned. Boris Johnson said: We recognise that this will mean it is not possible or fair for all exams to go ahead this summer as normal. The Education Secretary will work with Ofqual to put in place alternative arrangements. Thereaposs no current plan announced to hand out more laptops to disadvantaged children, but itaposs something ministers are looking at.Early years such as nurseries alternative provision and special schools remain open in the lockdown. Nursery age, vulnerable kids and kids of critical workers over  can still attend childcare. University students will not be able toand will be expected to study from their current residence where possible until at least mid February. In person teaching at university will only be allowed for a small number of critical courses previously announced such as those studying to work in the health service. Meeting friends and family  You cannot meet people from outside your household or bubble anywhere - indoors or outdoors. The only exemption is that one person can take exercise outside with one person from another household. But you cannot sit down and have a drink together in the park, as you could previously under Tier . You also canapost do anything that counts as recreation and leisure with them, which was allowed under the November lockdown. When you do meet one person from outside your household, you should stay two metres apart, orthataposs not possible, one metre with extra precautions. Under Tier , children under  or certain adults with care needs didn’t count towards that two-person limit. It’s not fully clear yetthat rule has survived into the full lockdown. Boris Johnson saidpeople were shielding before, they must begin shielding again. They will receive inidual letters shortly. However, itaposs thought that, practically, rules for the million-plus previous shielders remain as they currently are in Tier . The ‘clinically extremely vulnerable’ should stay at home as much as possible and should only leave for exercise and health appointments. They should not go to work eventhey cannot work from home, and avoid busy places including shops and pharmacies. But there is not a special support or food parcel package like there was in March. Contrary to reports, the shielding group is not being expanded to include blanket groups such as the over-s. Support bubbles  Support and childcare bubbles will remain as they currently are under the new lockdown. Support bubbles allow a single-adult household, or a couple with a child under one, to permanently ‘bubble up’ with one other household of any size. They can act as though they’re in the same household. A childcare bubble is where one household links with one other household to provide informal childcare - unpaid and unregistered - to anyone under .Children of orced parentsChildren of orced or separated parents can continue to move freely between both parents’ homes, as in previous lockdowns. Furlough  There is no change to furlough in today’s announcement. Employees not at work can be paid % of their usual salary up to a cap of £, a month, funded by the government. It applies to anyone who was employed on October  last year. The furlough scheme has been extended several times and currently expires on April . Parents who can be at work themselves, but have kids out of school, can be furloughed but that’s up to the employer. Unions have called for firms to “do the right thing and support parents” who can’t work due to childcare responsibilities. All non-essential shops shut  All non essential retail, hospitality and personal care services must shutnot already, and remain closed. Essential retailers which include supermarkets, pharmacies, garden centres, and buildersapos merchants may stay open. Non-essential retail stores that must shut include: clothing and homeware stores, vehicle showroomsbetting shops tailors tobacco and vape shops electronic goods and mobile phone shops auction housesmarket stalls selling non-essential goods.All pubs, cafes and restaurants shut - and takeaway pints banned  Restaurants, cafes, pubs and other hospitality venues must shut. They can continue doing delivery or takeaway - but only for food. Takeaway pints will no longer be allowed from pubs. This is a tightening of the rules since Tier  after people got drinks and gathered outside venues. However, you will be able to walk to a pub, restaurant or other outlet and pick up takeaway food. Andyouaposre getting your takeaway delivered, rather than picking it up, it can come with alcohol. All hairdressers and beauty salons shut  All personal care services including hairdressers, nail bars and tattoo parlours must shut. Spas, massage parlours, and body and skin piercing services must also close.Full list of other venues that can remain open ● market stalls selling essential retail ● businesses providing repair services may also stay open, where they primarily offer repair services ● petrol stations, automaticcar washes, vehicle repair and MOT services, bicycle shops, and taxi and vehicle hire businesses ● banks, building societies, post offices, short-term loan providers and money transfer businesses ● funeral directors ● laundrettes and dry cleaners ● medical and dental services ● vets and retailers of products and food for the upkeep and welfare of animals ● animal rescue centres, boarding facilities and animal groomers● agricultural supplies shops ● mobility and disability support shops ● storage and distribution facilities ● car parks, public toilets and motorway service areas ● outdoor playgrounds ● outdoor parts of botanical gardens and heritage sites for exercise ● places of worship ● crematoriums and burial grounds All gyms and pools shut All outdoor gyms and pools must shut.

So must archery driving shooting ranges and riding arenas.Outdoor team sports will not be permitted.Elite sport - such as the Premier League - will continue.PE lessons and sports clubs for children attending schoolcan continue.

So she decided to treat herself on her th birthday, booking a two-night solo staycation half an hour up the road from her Florida home. It was the first time sheaposd used the rental app Airbnb, and little did she know it would change her le forever. The nanny booked to stay at a property owned by Dennis Weisse,  - and they ended up falling in love. After a three month whirlwind romance, Dennis popped the question despite the -year age gap. She said: “I was beginning to lose hope that I’d ever meet the love of my le. “It may sound corny, but Dennis has transformed my le and he treats me like a princess.” However, things almost didnapost work out as Dennis initially turned down her stay request as he thought she was planning a Covid- rules breaching party. Thankfully he realised his error and allowed her to stay, even surprising her with birthday presents, cupcakes and tequila. Bonding over their love of old school hip hop and rock music, they soon realised that, despite an age gap of more than quarter of a century, they had plenty in common. A whirlwind romance followed, with former UPS driver Dennis proposing to Angie, a nanny, at sunset in September, just three months after they met.  Angie, whose dad is  and mum is , said her family had been supportive of her decision – and had joked with Dennis’ -year-old son about being closer in age to him than her fiancé. In response to critics of age gap love, she said: “I would just say ‘live and let live’. “If you find somebody you love and they happen to be much older or much younger than you, as long as you are not harming anyone  and it is consensual and you love each other, you should never let age get in the way of true happiness and the chance of love.” For the four years before she met Dennis, Angie had been living just half an hour away in neighbouring Lehigh Acres, although their paths had never crossed. Their lives changed forever this summer when, unable to throw a traditional birthday party due to Covid- restrictions, she booked a two-night solo stay at his Airbnb.  “It was actually the first time I’d ever used Airbnb,” she added. Misinterpreting her message, in which she explained it was her th, Dennis thought Angie was planning to host a gathering, so initially rejected her request. She explained: “I wrote a very chatty greeting message for Dennis and told him it was my birthday. “But he misunderstood and thought I was planning to have a party, which I was not – I’m very cautious about Covid – so he rejected my request.” Realising his mistake, Dennis called Angie the following day to apologise – hoping to convince her to come for her trip as planned. “I said I understood and was okay with the rejection, but he was so friendly and such an outgoing and gregarious character. We had a really nice chat,” Angie continued.  “In the end, he sweettalked me and convinced me to go ahead with the trip.” In another twist of fate, Dennis was not even originally supposed to be in the state at the time of Angie’s visit. The way Airbnb works means that hosts do not always stay at the property with their guests. Some rent out entire homes, while others offer a private room. In Dennis’ case, he had intended to be in Colorado, almost , miles away, meaning Angie would have the place to herself. But when a couple who had been looking after the property back in Florida unexpectedly had to leave, he had no choice but to fly home and make sure the house was ready for her arrival. And to ensure she had the best birthday possible, he even arranged a special surprise for her. He said: “Because of all the confusion with the site, I wanted to do something really nice for her birthday. “I had the couple who had been looking after the property arrange some balloons, a birthday banner, card, cupcakes and tequila on the kitchen counter before they left. “If they hadn’t left, I would never have come back to Florida, so never would have met Angie in person. The Lord works in mysterious ways.” When Angie arrived on July  – the day before her th – she was blown away by the gesture. That night, Dennis came back home from Colorado and the pair spent the evening chatting, immediately hitting it off. Dennis stayed in his bedroom, while Angie slept in one of the guest rooms on the other side of the house. She said she was a ‘little bit nervous’ about him being there for her stay, but because of the ‘wonderful phone call’ they had shared beforehand she already felt comfortable around him.  Angie said: “The next morning – my th birthday – we had coffee and he made me breakfast. We drank champagne mimosas on his pool patio. “The conversation got even easier and more relaxed. Despite our age dference it’s very easy to get along and talk to each other.” On July , she ed home to Lehigh Acres with thoughts of Dennis on her mind. Angie, whose previous largest age gap in a relationship was five years, said she ‘ per cent knew’ there was a romantic spark between them. Three days later, she went back to North Fort Myers to stay with him for a few days – and their relationship quickly progressed. “We quickly started to fall in love and became basically inseparable,” Angie said. Their first moment of intimacy sealed the deal for Dennis. He said: “We were floating in the pool and our first kiss was in the water. Again, the light-bulb went off and it was a kiss like no other.”  And at the beginning of September, Dennis invited Angie to move in with him. She added: “He entrusted me with a key and even got down on one knee to offer it to me. “Living together is great. Dennis always cooks lovely meals for me. We make each other laugh, and dote on one another.” Their relationship going from strength to strength, Dennis took things to the next level on September , when he got down on one knee for a second time and asked Angie to marry him on a trip to Captiva Island,  mins away from North Fort Myers on the Gulf of Mexico. She recalled: “We’d had dinner at a fancy restaurant, then afterwards, he got down on one knee again to propose marriage with a stunning sunset backdrop.  “It was so romantic.” It did not come as a big shock to Angie – because they spoke about marriage in late July, and picked out the ring together a couple of days prior to the engagement. She said: “It was no big surprise – but it was a wonderful, wonderful moment.” Now, the couple, whose family and friends are overjoyed for them, are planning an intimate wedding ceremony next year. Reflecting on her amazing love story, Angie cannot believe what was supposed to be a quiet birthday staycation has changed her le so drastically. She concluded: “I could never have imagined I would fall in love with my Airbnb host. My le has been totally transformed.” "},{"url":null,"title":"brewery born cramped ex council","story":"NewsBrewery born from cramped ex-council flat turns into £.m businessThe Wildcard Brewery was born in a cramped living room of a ex-council flat but has now turned into an award-winning business with a £.million turnover a yearmirrorShareCommentsByAdrian HearnClaire Gilbody-Dickerson:,  JAN NewsThe Wildcard Brewery was a micro business born in a cramped living room of an ex-council flat \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Andrew Birkby, , and William Harris, , launched Wildcard Brewery after making their own beer from a home brew kit. They took a shot in the notoriously dficult industry by maxing out a £, personal credit card and rented equipment at an Essex brewery in . Eight years on, and with the help of one of the UKaposs few female master brewers, Jaega Wise, Wildcard is now an award-winning business turning over more than £. million per year. And despite the pub and alcohol industry being severely affected by the pandemic and lockdown, the business in Walthamstow, East London, still expects growth of around  per cent this year. Founder Andrew, originally from Nottingham, said: It has been tough this year, but by being flexible we have managed to find a way through. On the day the lockdown started we opened an e-commerce store and started delivering to doorsteps. We erted beer from kegs into cans. Being smaller and independent meant we were able to move quickly. The online shop is an area that we want to continue to grow. Itaposs been really positive - we sell a lot to local customers but weaposre now also delivering nationwide.  Over the past year weaposve grown by  per cent. If you were to tell me that last January, I would have been disappointed, but all things considered weaposre thrilled with how itaposs gone. After using the brewery in Essex, a process known as cuckoo brewing, they found a pub in Walthamstow which let them use their cellar to brew from infor running mini beer festivals and helping to rejuvenate the venue. By  they got their first industrial unit. Knowing cashflow was important, they opened a tap bar on site and soon outgrew it.  At their current site, they are at capacity, brewing , litres of beer each week and selling online, in pubs and at around  Tesco stores across the UK. When the first lockdown kicked in, they moved everything temporarily to cans and launched their web shop and at the peak were selling £, of beer online per week.To help with working capital, the brewers used Funding Circle on three occasions, including through the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan scheme. They now employ  staff full-time and their first employee was Jaega Wise, a chemical engineer who is their head brewer. In the build up to Christmas, they have seen a big uptake in people buying via their web shop - including customers buying gt boxes and merchandise along with cases of beer. Andrew added: We started Wildcard because of our love for beer and weaposre excited by the journey and the next steps. We were a shoestring start-up with no capital and no family wealth, so we needed to be creative, using personal credit cards and other breweries at the beginning.

He told the Daily Mail that grim news, including Boris Johnson announcing the latest lockdown in England, has left him feeling that any hopes we harboured of ing to something like normality by spring are nothing short of a pipe dream.Other experts were more optimistic, saying there could be a near normal by summer.

Professor Hunter said: The problem is that we are once more facing too many iables, not in the least in terms of the large question mark which hangs over the efficacy of the newly-minted vaccines at preventing infection.

New research reveals many patients with long Covid have been unable toproperly to work as much as six months after infection, and many claim they are not believed when they seek help.One in five people who have tested positive for coronavirus have gone on to develop longer-term symptoms amounting to so-called long Covid.While most people recover from Covid- within two or three weeks, there have been some who have reported experiencing symptoms for months on end. Researchers have made a series of worrying revelations, including indications that children are also susceptible to long Covid a link between the virus and anxiety and depression an inability to think straight or focus inflammation of the heart muscle kidney injury testicular pain urinary problems menstrual changes strokes and seizures - among other symptoms. An England-wide network of more than  specialist clinics is looking to help people suffering from the long-term effects of coronavirus. Here is what we know so far about the still-developing, ever-changing condition. What is it  Long Covid, also known as post-Covid syndrome, is used to describe the effects of Covid- that continue for weeks or months beyond the initial illness. The most-recent official guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellencedefine long Covid as signs and symptoms that develop during or following an infection consistent with Covid- which continue for more than  weeks and are not explained by an alternative diagnosis. The condition is associated with a range of symptoms, from fatigue and breathlessness to anxiety and depression. How widespread is long Covid   One in five people who have tested positive for coronavirus have gone on to develop longer-term symptoms, according to estimates published last month. Data from the Office for National Statistics suggested around , people suffer problems for up to  weeks. But there is also evidence, including cases documented in the US, that symptoms can continue for more than six months.Anecdotal evidence suggests children can be susceptible to long Covid as well as adults.However, there has not been time to glean meaningful data and long-term research into the condition is ongoing.What are the symptoms   According to Nice, long Covid usually presents with clusters of symptoms which may change over time and can affect any system within the body. Lasting symptoms of coronavirus can include fatigue, breathlessness, anxiety and depression, palpitations, chest pains, joint or muscle pain and not being able to think straight or focus or brain fog. The US Centres for Disease Control and Preventionalso has a list of reported symptoms, which include inflammation of the heart muscle, lungabnormalities, acute kidney injury and rashes, as well as neurologicalcomplaints. But it seems it does not stop there.  In the US, the Patient-Led Research Group - a team of researchers who are also Covid- patients - ran a survey of  long Covid patients and recorded more than  total symptoms, also including testicular pain, urinary problems, menstrual changes, strokes and seizures. Such a wide range of symptoms and dferent presentations of illness make it hard for doctors to diagnose and treat the condition. Scientists from the UKaposs National Institute for Health Research , who recently reviewed the available evidence of the symptoms, believe ongoing Covid may not be one illness but at least four dferent syndromes. What is the cause  Medical experts are still trying to figure out what causes long Covid. Sars-Cov-, the virus that causes Covid-, can trigger an overactive immune response which also causes damage throughout the body.  Some believe that the immune system does notto normal after Covid- and this could be one of the reasons for prolonged ill-health.One US study suggested low hormone levels in patients was a likely link to long Covid.Meanwhile, a German study found a majority of men admitted to hospital with Covid- had low testosterone levels.In a study published in the Lancet in November , scientists in Italy found major structural changes in the lungs of deceased Covid- patients. Who is at risk of long Covid  Long Covid is not just people taking time to recover from severe disease. Reports suggest that even people with relatively mild infections can experience lasting health problems.Researchers from the NIHR have said it cannot be assumed that people who are at lower risk of severe illness and death from Covid- are also at low risk of long Covid. They said more work is needed to help those who are suffering, adding that many are not believed when they seek help. What is being done about it  England now has  clinics to address long Covid, harnessing doctors, nurses, physiotherapists and occupational therapists to offer physical and psychological assessments and refer patients to the right treatment and rehabilitation services.

In a New Yearaposs post at the beginning of  - the year she met Prince Harry - she wrote that sheaposs made the same two resolutions every year.She explains that she always hopes to give up biting her nails and swearing, but always struggles. She wrote: The swearing comes in lulls triggered by being overworked or feeling mighty cheeky after a couple drinks. And when it comes to the biting of the nails—well, it still happens with a turbulent flight or a stressful day.  Itaposs unladylike. But then again, so is the swearing. Dammit. But that year she decided to take a dferent approach to setting herself challenges for the year, and it might have even given her a nudge when it came to meeting Harry. She explains that she hoped to accept the unexpected and enjoy the things that werenapost planned - and weaposre pretty sure meeting a prince wasnapost on the radar.

Sarah Milner refused to terminate her pregnancy after receiving the heartbreaking diagnosis at  weeks. Medics had advised the mother-of-three, from Stoke-on-Trent, Staffs, to abort her pregnancy. On April  the -year-old gave birth to Louis, who is a healthy bundle of joy. Sarah is now receiving le-prolonging chemotherapy and has been given less than two years to live after delaying treatment by remaining pregant. She said: I was  weeks pregnant and diagnosed with stage one cervical cancer, which was described to me as being aggressive. When I heard the diagnosis I couldnapost believe that this was really happening to me. It didnapost seem real. I was devastated. When I was  I had a smear test which came back clear. I had my next one booked in, but I had to cancel as I was pregnant with Louis. Because of the aggressive nature of the cancer, the doctors advised me to terminate my pregnancy. However, I really didnapost want to do that.  I wanted to have my baby no matter what. After giving birth to Louis via C-section at  weeks in April last year, Sarah immediately had a hysterectomy and lymph node removal in a bid to fight the cancer. But by November, another lump was found and the cancer had spread throughout the mumaposs body. Sarah added: After I had given birth I was told that it was good news, they had removed most of the cancer and I had a good chance of being given the all-clear. I was over the moon. I thought my decision had paid off and everything was going to work out well for us. Throughout the summer I was having radiotherapy to treat some of the cancer that was in the lymphatic channel and then in October, I had a scan which was expected to come back all clear. I received the results for the scan in November. Another lump had been found and the cancer had spread everywhere. I was told it was stage four and there was nothing  they could do for me. I couldnapost believe what they were telling me once again. My world completely fell apart.  The news crushed me. I knew the risks that I was taking, but it just was not what I was expecting to come back from the scan. My kids, Lily-Grace, who is nine, Bobbie, who is seven and Louis are going to be without their mum. Sarah, who is currently undergoing chemotherapy to prolong her le, married her partner James last month after being granted a special licence. She said: I am now receiving le-prolonging chemotherapy every three weeks.  I have been given around two years to live, but as my cancer is very aggressive, it is likely to be shorter. Since receiving that devastating news, my partner of three years, James, and I got a special licence so that we could have a last-minute wedding on  December. It was a really lovely, local wedding at Stoke registry office. The kids and both of our parents were there and a local wedding shop gave me a dress and a veil to wear. I am just happy that we managed to get married. It was one of the most important things to me.

Claire Haythorne, from Hillsborough, Sheffield, had spent weeks in a coma battling Covid- before doctors administered Anakinra as a last resort, Yorkshire Live reports. Just over a week after taking the drug, which is normally used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, care worker Mrs Haythorne awoke from her coma.Her daughter, Leah, , was gobsmacked by her mumaposs swt recovery, with the doctor who prescribed the medication describing it as a little Christmas miracle. Mrs Haythorne, , was in a coma at Northern General Hospital for weeks after contracting the virus at the start of November.

Mrs Haythorne is now on the road to recovery and set to head home in the coming fortnight to her children Leah, Jordan, , and her husband Tariq. Itaposs been something of a harsh wake up call for the family, who were initially sceptical of how bad the affects of the virus would be on them. As a care worker, Mrs Haythorne found out she had the virus through one of the mandatory tests she had every week at the start of November.She didnapost display symptoms at the time but went home to isolate. Her daughter Leah Haythorne, , said: She was alright to quarantine for two weeks. On Friday she got in bed and by Sunday the th November, sheaposd lost all the colour in her face. You couldnapost recognise her. Then Monday she got rushed into hospital. That was the last time we saw her. Mrs Haythorne continued to deteriorate rapidly while in ICU at Northern General Hospital and was placed in an induced coma on Thursday, November . Leah said: Her kidneys and lungs were proper bad. She was needing lots of oxygen.  After weeks of trying ious cures, on December  doctors decided to start giving her the drug Anakinra or Kineret. Leah said: The doctors said it was a last resort. But the improvements were instantaneous. The eighth was my brotheraposs birthday and thataposs the day she made the most improvement, said Leah. By the th she was awake.

Literally waiting day in and day out. The family became increasingly supportive of each other while Claire was going through treatment, with Leah saying: Itaposs made me and my brother close.

A tribunal has ruled that Catriona Howie was discriminated against when her employers didnapost tell her about a last minute drinks event for staff while she was off work. At the time of the party Mrs Howie had given birth to her daughter, who she named after Elvis Presley, and was on leave caring for her. As a result of the companyaposs failure to include her while she was on her year-long leave, Mrs Howie is now in line for substantial compensation due to aposinjury to her feelingsapos, the  ruled. However, her additional claim that a colleague had discriminated against her by mocking her for naming her daughter after the music legend who died in  aged . The tribunal was told that Mrs Howie worked for luxury kitchen and design firm Holloways Of Ludlow as general manager for six years, starting in . After going on maternity leave in July  - during which she had baby Presley - Mrs Howie and the company agreed she wouldto work the following summer. However, the firm - which has showrooms in London - was struggling financially, the tribunal heard. As a result it decided not to hold a traditional Christmas party that year but organised a trip to the pub instead, putting £ behind the bar. Most of the London based staff attended, the tribunal was told. No one invited . We accept that it was a short notice and informal event and there were no formal invitations. Staff were informed by word of mouth or text message.  Director Sarah Nelson told the hearing that aposit did not occur to herapos to invite Mrs Howie. It was not a proper party and nor was it a normal year, she said. She accepted that she would have been invitedshe had been at work. In February , Mrs Howie was left aposdeeply upsetapos during an email exchange with the companyaposs finance controller Amar Shukla. He messaged her saying: When I...realised that you had named your daughter aposPresleyapos I thought that you are in serious need of therapy! I cannot understand how anyone can be fixated on someone that was dead before they were even born but I guess that is the power and allure of aposthe Kingapos! Anyway I am sure that little Presley is a total bundle of joy and one that will soon be mobile. Mrs Howie told the hearing that she felt that a conscious effort was being made to make her feel unwelcome in the business.  And she said she was shocked when, while trying to arrange ing to work at the end of her maternity leave, she was told that due to the declining fortunes of the business the General Manager role was no longer required. Although the company said it would find her another role, on the day she didto work in July , she was told by Ms Nelson she was being made redundant. Finding the company guilty of maternity discrimination, Judge Corinna Ferguson said: We have accepted thatdid not hold a Christmas party in  in the way that it normally would, but it is not in dispute that there were informal drinks in late December, subsidised by the , in lieu of a Christmas party. We accept there was no deliberate decision to exclude . However, the reason she was not invited was that no-one thought about her. That was because she was on maternity leave. Had she been at work around this time, she would certainly have been invited. She was overlooked because she was on maternity leave.

That was the start of the Industrial Revolution, which put the Great into Britain. But now it’s more profitable to send them home to work, employers are happy to do that. “Bosses predict the end of full-time office working” read the headline over a story that three-quarters of businesses will keep home working that was introduced last year. I suspect it won’t be a matter of choice, but a condition of the work relationship that passes for employment these days. Do you feel your bosses are benefiting from the pandemic  Have your say in the comments section Pandemics can produce profit. If it suits the bottom line, people will have to do the job from their child’s bedroom – or find other work. “Working from home, or workshy at home ” I asked early on. But productivity has held up well, because six out of  say they find it impossible to switch off.  Instead of working from home, we’re living at work. I’ve been doing it most of this century. Fragmentation of employment has been going on for years. Covid- has accelerated the trend, putting greater power in the hands of the employer, who no longer has to provide office space, heating, lighting or car parks. And there will be no office romance on Zoom.

Last night Boris Johnson put England back into a national lockdown from Wednesday, ordering schools to close until the middle of next month. Pictures show shelves looking bare and shoppers leaving with trolleys piled high with items. Toilet roll, vegetables and rice have reportedly been running low in some stores. Retailers have also experienced increased demand for online delivery slots after Mr Johnsonaposs announcement. Food stores and shops selling essential goods are allowed to stay open during the lockdown - prompting calls for people to show consideration for others. Do you think the lockdown is justied  Let us know in the comments belowOne furious Twitter user wrote: People panic buying again.... didnapost they realise that last time people did this they had to throw away most of their food... stop being selfish and think about others that.... we are all going through the same situation. Following the Prime Ministeraposs statement from Downing Street, users reported issues trying to shop online. Sainsburyaposs app is said to have gone down temporarily last night, while Tesco also experienced issues with its online operations and Morrisons and Ocado were forced to place shoppers in virtual queues.Websites appeared to be running largely as normal on Tuesday, but with little availability left for home delivery slots. Sainsburyaposs said it had temporarily limited access to its online groceries service on Monday night to manage high demand for slots and updates customers were making to existing orders. Tesco said bosses were holding discussions to review the item limit for online baskets, as well as product restrictions across popular items such as toilet rolls, antibacterial wipes and pasta.E-commerce expert Rebecca Crook fears supermarkets may struggle with demand. She said: While Iaposm sure many retailers have improved the performance and load capacity of their sites, they havenapost fully scaled to the capacity they need to in order to reach demands like we experienced last night. Cost will no doubt be one of the core reasons for this so they will balance that with providing virtual queues and not providing a great online customer experience."},{"url":null,"title":"tory chairman resigns after fat","story":"NewsTory chairman resigns after fat mums in pot noodle stained leggings AE tweetGareth Baines gave up his position as a Welsh Conservative association chairman after sending the tweet on New Years Eve last yearmirrorShareCommentsByMartin ShiptonLydia MorrisMilo Boyd:,  JAN NewsGareth Baines quit as chairman of Clwyd South Conservative Association \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get US and UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

He remains a member of Chirk Town Council and at the December  General Election acted as agent for the winning Conservative candidate Simon Baynes, who took Clwyd South from the former Labour MP Susan Elan Jones.In another tweet, he said: “Our NHS is treated as a sacred cow and cannot be criticised. Those arguing for reform are deemed to be Satan incarnate. “I’m sorry, but after spending most of my le working on the continent, the NHS isn’t the best in the world - it isn’t one of the best in Europe.  Pales when compared with systems like Germany and Norway.” Mr Baines was strongly criticised after sending out the first tweet. Former local Liberal Democrat council candidate Aimi Waters, a planning analyst and a foster parent, tweeted: “Chairman of Clwyd South Conservatives showing his true colours there. Oh dear. Come on though, are we all surprised  #NeverTrustATory.” A later tweet from Ms Waters read: The actions of the @clwyds chair are totally unacceptable. Residents in #ClwydSouth and #Chirk deserve better especially when we are asked to put trust in these people.” A tweet from Wrexham Labour Party read: “This is terrible and shows what he really thinks about the people who use the NHS.” "},{"url":null,"title":"towie stars sister 8 nearly","story":"NewsTOWIE stars sister, , nearly died from Covid as family want answers on vaccine for kidsEXCLUSIVE: Little Kennedy Mercer - sister of TOWIE star Ky Stratford - spent three weeks in intensive care after contracting the virus, and her dad has called on clarity on when at-risk children will be vaccinatedmirrorShareCommentsByDave Burke:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror am video ky-stratfords-sister-rushed-intensive-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

Little Kennedy Mercer - sister of TOWIE star Ky Stratford - spent three weeks in intensive care after contracting the virus, with medics telling parents Paul and Jeanette to prepare for the worst.The schoolgirl has a rare condition called Spinal Muscular Atrophy , which makes her extremely vulnerable to coronavirus.Her twin brother Karter died from Type  SMA at just five months old, and Paul said he feared losing Kennedy as she battled Covid- late last year. Paul said it isnapost just adults who are at risk of dying from coronavirus, and said clarity is needed on when vulnerable youngsters can be vaccinated. Have you been affected by this story  Email webnews@mirror The dad, from Grays in Essex, said: We didnapost knowshe was going to make it. She went through a torrid time, it literally impacted her whole body. It was awful to watch. The doctors told us they were changing the antibiotics they were giving her, and that it needed to work because there was nothing  they could do. Paul has now called on authorities to clary when high-risk children will be given a vaccine, saying: There are a large group of vulnerable children who will lose their livesthey catch the virus. Weaposre not asking to jump the queue, we just need to know whataposs going on, Paul said. Thereaposs a lot of extremely vulnerable children who would benefit from receiving the vaccine. Current guidance says extremely vulnerable children can be vaccinated - but no timetable has been issued. He said families have been pushing for answers on when youngsters are expected to receive vaccines, but to no avail. In spite of her family making huge efforts to shield Kennedy - including taking weekly tests and separating her from her five-year-old sister Marli, who ed to school in the summer - she became ill in late October.Her temperature soared, and she developed pneumonia and sepsis. As her condition worsened, medics told to prepare for the worst. During their anxious wait at Kennedyaposs bedside at Londonaposs Great Ormond Street Hospital , Paul said there were many other children who were seriously ill with Covid.During Kennedyaposs fight for le, TOWIE star Ky posted on Instagram : We are all so heartbroken as kennedy has severe breathing problems from her terminal illness SMA as it is.So this is very dangerous for her.  Kyaposs post continued: She is in intensive care but really fighting like she always does, so i just need everyone to keep her in your prayers and hopefully she gets through this my strong little girl she doesn’t deserve any of this. Harrowing pictures show the little girl fighting for le as her temperature soared past F, when course after course of drugs failed to make an impact. Thankfully her temperature came down, but we donapost yet knowshe had any long-term damage, Paul said. When Kennedy was discharged in November, she still had inflamed kidneys. She is due to a scan next month to find outthis has improved.Paul said medics told him that antibodies may last for as little as  weeks - leaving Kennedy at risk of reinfection. While shielding, the youngster is missing out on the experiences her parents are desperate for her to have. Every parent Iaposve interacted with who has an extremely vulnerable child is concerned that thereaposs no information, Paul said. Despite the rollout of two vaccines - one manufactured by Pfizer and the other by Oxford University and AstraZeneca - families are yet to learn when vulnerable children will be given a jab.  Both the Department of Health and NHS England declined to comment, saying the guidance on the vaccine rollout was drawn out by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation . The JCVI says: The committee advises that only those children at very high risk of exposure and serious outcomes, such as older children with severe neuro-disabilities that require residential care, should be offered vaccination. Clinicians should discuss the risks and benefits of vaccination with a person with parental responsibility, who should be told about the paucity of safety data for the vaccine in children aged under  years. SMA, which affects around , children and adults in the UK, is a deadly condition which means children struggle to breathe, swallow or even sit up without support.

Jemma said: I was scratching my head when there was a delivery following a night drinking on zoom. I had no idea what the box may contain as I couldn’t remember ordering anything. I couldn’t stop laughing when I opened it to find Boris staring at me. Jemma, who is a single mum, jokes that Boris Johnson is now in her support bubble. However, she has since had to dismantle the cardboard cut out as she once mistook it for an intruder at night. She said: I have to say, the cut out is one of the best things I have ever ordered.  It has provided so much entertainment during lockdown. My friends think I am crazy, they even bought me Boris Johnson books and t-shirts for Christmas. I have had to pack him away though because I kept forgetting he was up and mistaking him to be a random man in my house! He can come out on special occasions now - such as New Yearaposs Eve when my friend Michelle Gibson, , who is really in my support bubble and I sang with him.

She added: It sucks she doesnapost like it but I feel like itaposs kind of rude to tell me they donapost like it and even more rude to assume I should buy a new one.

Some staff will also be in schools to work with the children of keyworkers and vulnerable children and young people.“If parents have concerns about their own children over the weeks ahead, they should inform their own headteacher who will do all they can to support as they always do.“We have very committed head teachers and staff across our schools in Aberdeenshire who will do all they can to provide resources and supports to help parents and young people.“In terms of the vaccinations, I think making teachers and childcare staff a priority would be most welcome.”First minister Nicola Sturgeon said home learning would drive down virus transmission rates.She also said the scientic community was not clear on the impact of the new iant of Covid- on young people.Ms Sturgeon said: “The evidence to date makes clear that thanks to the hard work of school staff and pupils, schools in Scotland have been low-risk environments for Covid. We will work with our partners to ensure that remains the case.“That will include ongoing work on testing in schools and discussions about when, in the context of the overall programme, it will be possible to vaccinate school staff.“And I want to be clear that it remains our priority to get school buildings open again for all pupils as quickly as possible and then keep them open.”Ron Constable, secretary of Aberdeen EIS, said the government’s consideration of the vaccine to teachers shows their members are being listened to.He said: #If it is a case of making sure schools are able to open, suggesting staff be inoculated as part of the programme would be a recognition that staff have been in danger of being infected.#For that reason, we welcome the suggestion our members will be offered vaccinations. It#s something we are very glad about.#It comes off the back of them talking about what they see as the importance of keeping schools open. Hopefully, it shows the concerns of teachers are being listened to.#Mr Constable said it was also “sensible” that the resumption of in-school teaching following the festive was being delayed until next month.He also previously remote learning to be extended beyond the originalto classes of January .Mr Constable said: #It is eminently sensible to push theback as a precaution, because schools are part of the communities they serve.#They have a high R number, and thousands of pupils are moving through communities every day.#It felt inevitable the date would have to be delayed.#The EIS was advocating this some time ago and called for additional days of remote learning at the start and end of the Christmas holidays. We have always felt it would be a good idea.#To be fair to the Government, they have taken pretty quick action because they are analysing the data as it comes in.#Aberdeen councillor Martin Greig had called for remote learning to be extended and is backing the measures announced by the first minister.The Hazlehead, Queen#s Cross and Countesswells councillor also supports a vaccination programme dedicated to teachers.Councillor Greig said: “Unfortunately, the evidence supports this strict lockdown. The Government’s response today has been appropriate but there is much more focused action that has to be done to keep everyone safe. Their leadership has to be consistent and robust to reduce physical contacts now but also to look after the longterm wellbeing of young people.“The virus is inflicting real hardship on families. For most people, it is very dficult to balance school and work needs in lockdown.“School closures could cause young people to lose vital educational opportunities. Online learning has to be developed and improved so that there is less chance of pupils missing out just because they are based in the home.“We need to be kept up to date with the scientic information about the spread of the virus. There will be a gradualto work so the government should already be planning for parents to get more childcare at the point it is needed.“It is likely that children at the earliest stages will eventuallyto school first. As much help as possible should be given so that nurseries and primary schools are ready.“It has been a priority to keep schools ing. Therefore, teachers and school-based staff should always have been a priority. All those working in the educational context should be amongst the first to be protected with the vaccine.”Coronavirus in Scotland – track the spread in these charts and maps\" title\"#Coronavirus in Scotland – track the spread in these charts and maps# # Evening Express\" src\"https:www.eveningexpress fp news specials coronavirus-in-scotland-track-the-spread-in-these-charts-and-maps embed # secretXFFhWZJ\" data-secret\"XFFhWZJ\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_sub_data  ,\"evening-express-web-and-epaper-annual-january-sale\":This offer will auto-renew annually at the price of  ua.. n\",\"free_trial\":,\"evening-express-web-pack--month\":This offer will auto-renew monthly at the price of  ua., you can cancel at any time. n\",\"free_trial\":,\"evening-express-web-pack-mf\":This offer will auto-renew monthly at the price of  ua., you can cancel at any time. n\",\"free_trial\":true,\"evening-express-web-and-epaper-mf\":This offer will auto-renew monthly at the price of  ua., you can cancel at any time. n\",\"free_trial\":true,\"plan_ids\":[\"cancelation-offer-evening-express-web-epaper\",\"evening-express-web-and-epaper-annual-january-sale\",\"evening-express-web-pack--month\",\"evening-express-web-pack-mf\",\"evening-express-web-and-epaper-mf\"],\"subscribe\": ua. per month  u recurring subscription n\",\"label\":\"\",\"highlight\":,\"recurring\":\"\",\"has_multi\":,\"editions\":true,\"durations\":true,\"free_trial\":,\"benefits\":[\"Unlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

She has travelled and trekked throughout the world but now lives in Argyll amongst the scenery she loves. www.heatheryheightsDuring wintry weather and shorter days it can be tricky fitting in longer walks and time for exploring the outdoors.What is fantastic about Knapdale and Kintyre is that we only have to go a short distance to gain truly spectacular views. The three walks in this edition y from relatively short, using tracks and paths to the lovely viewpoint of Castle Dounie, to challenging, where the terrain is tough underfoot and good route finding skills are required. All three start at Crinan harbour before climbing up through oak and birch woods to gain open vistas with views to Jura, Scarba and Mull. The convoluted ridge walks are rugged and wild, the steep sides sweeping down to the Sound of Jura where tides race and swirl. If you are lucky you may see pods of dolphins or even whales.. At the car park a signboard shows the Crinan Trail. This is the shorter of the routes but all three start and finish together. Leave the car park and turn left. Keeping to the road by the shore you will see a trail marker post ahead leading you briefly along the shore before the path heads into oak woods. After m the path bends sharply left. To the right a faint trail heads west towards the Sailor’s Grave but your route starts its steep muddy ascent to the forestry road above.. On reaching the road turn right, after m you will reach a bench and the first junction to your left. Here you have a choice either come back from the track ahead or to your left. All routes can be undertaken in either direction. I suggest for the longer routes you go straight on and for the Crinan Trail you go left.. For the Crinan Trail follow the waymark posts and arrows. After .km the route turns right onto a path and winds up and down with glimpses of views to come. Turn left at a sign for a viewpoint. This will take you up to the knoll atop which the remains of Castle Dounie, a prehistoric dun, command spectacular views over the sound towards the Gulf of Corryvreckan. There it is said the Cailleach Bheur, a giant witch, once washed her plaid in its whirlpools. Enjoy the vista before ing down to the junction and turn left. The path now meanders down to the forestry road. Turn right and head north round the coast above Adnoe Point and back to your path down to Crinan harbour.. For the longer walks, go straight ahead at the bench . Follow the track for nearly km, which leads you round a couple of hairpin bends and above Adnoe Point, before turning south. Keep your eyes open for the waymark posts and turn left onto a path. Head uphill for m. At the viewpoint sign turn right up to Castle Dounie and enjoy. To your south is the ridge that leads to Creag Mhor.. Immediately after dropping from Castle Dounie you will see a broken down wall on your right. Follow this for a short distance until you can start to work your way up onto the ridge to your right, by a couple of birch trees with coners on the skyline above. The ridge walk is convoluted, airy, rough and summits numerous lumps and bumps with fantastic views. Keep to the crest or east side as the drop-offs to the west are impressive but not to be dallied with. The highest rocky bump of Creag Mhor is parallel to the north end of the rocks offshore.. After  minutes of knobbly and exposed ridge walking #you do not fancy tackling navigation along walls in woods # this is now the time to keep an eye out for an obvious wide firebreakin the trees, below to your left. This leads you at a ° angle straight to a forestry track in the valley below. To check you have the right point look across from the firebreak and you should see a wall continue the line on the other side. Head down the firebreak to the track and turn left. This will take you back to the junction by the bench where you can turn right on the forest road then left todown the path to Crinan harbour.. If you wish to adventure on* and are confident with your route finding then continue south on the ridge # crossing over an old wall not on the map # to where it suddenly drops to a tiny col with forest directly ahead. Ahead is a steep little rise with walls on it. One drops to the right but it is the one going southwest into the forest you need to follow, for the next m. Keeping the wall directly on your right, circumnavigating the odd boulder and ducking the odd branch, you will see that the deer have created quite a path and that the way is often clear. Eventually it drops you very steeply down to a stream with another wall directly ahead. Turn left, southeast, up the stream with the wall on your right # it is boggy # until you reach a quaint waterfall on your left. A small break in the wall to your right allows you to escape the trees that have fallen across the wall higher up. Continue with it on your left across a tree harvested area and up the bump ahead. You will pop out onto a track end.. Follow this short track down to the forest road below. Turn right and almost immediately turn left onto a grassy track that crosses a stream and heads east up into the forest. After m you will come to a sharp left-hand bend. Directly in front of you a wall goes steeply up into the trees. This is your route up to Bealach na Moine.

The sector in Scotland accounts for around  per cent of UK production and is worth about £ million annually.One fth of these exports go to the EU, amounting to more than , tonnes a year.This is clearly a disastrous Brexit outcome for Scottish farmers and like all other aspects of Brexit, foisted on Scotland against its will.A terrible negotiating failure on the part of the Tory government, and a devastating blow to an extremely valuable part of Scotland’s farming industry, I am sure it will not be the first damaging impact to be highlighted once the deal is fully analysed.Alex Orr, EdinburghSir,The report on the Piers and Harbours Asset Management Plan and Fees and Charges –  , submitted to the Argyll and Bute Council Harbour Board meeting of December ,  makes interesting reading.At a time when budgets are tight and councils have had to make hard decisions about where to cut services, it is dficult to understand why the council budget should be used to supplement the funding of dedicated ferry infrastructure for which CMAL should be responsible.The asset management plan allocates £,, for planned marine infrastructure works for the year  , of which only £, , is devoted to multi-use facilities. The remainder, £,,, is mostly allocated to single-use ferry facilities, and a huge proportion of that is to provide overnight parking for CalMac ferriesreaders will have to make up their own minds about the merits of spending £,, for an overnight berth at Fionnphort, and £, on a feasibility study for a breakwater at Lismore.CMAL pay back around half of the £,, to the council through harbour dues for the use of council-owned piers, however, that still leaves a whopping £ million gap in the required funding.If past experience of other CMAL projects is anything to go by, the planned eight per cent increase in council harbour fees and charges up to   is not going to cover it.Fergus Gillanders, KilmelfordSir,Last year, , was challenging and, although many people like to give generously to charity at Christmas time, it may have been dficult to make a donation this festive season.It#s not too late # you can still help support the Royal National Institute of Blind Peopleby collecting and donating used stamps from cards and parcels you may have received.Your stamps will be recycled and turned into vital funds that will help RNIB support children with vision impairment.

Food and drink is a staple in households across Scotland for Hogmanay, and it is certainly something that can remain the same, even with these uncertain times.A pot of soup to bring in the bells never goes amiss, and youd be forgiven for thinking that a slow-cooked stew is something of legend at this time of year.But while many families would plan to head out for a New Years Day meal, this will not be going ahead this year.Alternatives could include trying out some new recipes at home, and having a New Years meal at home. Bake some goodies to bring in the bells with, such as traditional Scots tablet or shortbread.Zoom have lted their -minute time limit across the New Year period, so set the camera at the bottom of your table and invite however many guests youd like!First footingA tradition throughout Scotland on Hogmanay, the normal act of first footing will certainly be missed this year, but there may be a way to salvage it.Traditionally, first footing involves the first person who enters the house after midnight bringing gts. It has been adapted through the years, and some now visit neighbours with a tipple and a song before moving on to the next house.While were not allowed in other peoples houses this year, we can certainly adapt the tradition.Ask one of your household to draw the short straw and brave the cold just after midnight and emulate a first footing with your immediate bubble. Or, have a virtual first footing, and make sure to call your loved ones and wish them a Happy New Year.TelevisionAs always, there will be a raft of content available to watch on TV on Hogmanay. Therersquoll likely be old favourites including the likes of Still Game.As ever, there will be several Hogmanay specials to help us bring in the bells from the comfort of our own home. Over on BBC One, Susan Calman will be getting ready for Hogmanay  with ldquoa studio of stars.Live eventsThe events that Scotlandrsquos festive season is famed for wonrsquot be going ahead in person this year.

Naturally, this would not be the last time an IndyRef would be brought up this year.On January , the UK confirmed its first two cases of Covid-.FebruaryBy February , the forthcoming coronavirus pandemic seemed a million miles away ndash with only three cases confirmed by this point.Attention instead was on Storm Ciara ndash a powerful and long-lived cyclone which battered parts of the country with gusts of up to mph.Flooding and heavy wind caused damage to buildings and train services, and on February , a -year-old man died after falling on icy surfaces and banging his head during the storm.Another major news story to unfold in the last year was surrounding former finance secretary Derek Mackay MSP.Once tipped to become the next First Minister, the Scottish Sun revealed the now shamed politician had been pestering a -year-old schoolboy on social media.The paper reported the -year-old MSP had contacted the boy out of the blue without knowing his age the previous August, then sent him  messages over six months.MarchThen came March ndash a month that can only be described as the month coronavirus pandemic really hit home in Scotland.On March , Scotland had its first confirmed case of the virus in the NHS Tayside, followed soon after by its first death on March .By March ,  cases had been confirmed in the country, with the virus clearly beginning to spread into other health boards.The inevitable news then came ndash with all pubs, cafes and restaurants being forced to close on March , before a nationwide lockdown on March .On the same day, Alex Salmond was cleared of sexually assaulting nine woman while he was the First Minister.As the BBC reports, a jury found the former SNP leader not guilty on  of the sexual assault charges facing him, while another was found not proven.A further charge of sexually assaulting a th woman had previously been dropped by prosecutors. Throughout the trial, Mr Salmond said he was innocent of all charges.On March , Clap For Carers was launched - coined up as a way to show appreciation for those on the NHS and other frontline services during the pandemic.The event saw people taking to their doorsteps and windows at pm every Thursday to clap, cheer, ring bells and play bagpipes to show their support.The last formal clap took place on May , followed by an extea Clap for NHS on July  marking the nd anniversary of its establishment.AprilOn April , the Queen made a rare broadcast to the UK and wider Commonwealth, in which she thanked people for following social distancing rules and said the UK ldquowill succeed in its fight against the coronavirus.Echoing the words of Vera Lynnrsquos wartime song, she added ldquoWe will meet again.On the same day, Scotlandrsquos Chief Medical Officer Dt Catherine Calderwood resigned after facing intense criticism for breaking lockdown rules twice to visit her second home during the pandemic.Dr Calderwood concluded with the First Minister that her position was untenable given the need for consistent and trustworthy public health messaging.Sticking with the pandemic, all eyes were on -year-old war veteran Tom Moore on April , who raised millions of pounds for NHS charities for walking more than  laps of his garden.In less joyful news, just four days later on April , Scotlandrsquos new temporary coronavirus hospital the NHS Louisa Jordan opened to receive Covid patients.MayOn May , Boris Johnsonrsquos senior advisor Dominic Cummings faced calls to resign after an investigation alleged he travelled  miles from London to his parentrsquos home in Durham while displaying coronavirus symptoms during lockdown.On May , Cummings held a press conference in the Downing Street Rose Garden, in which he said: ldquoI donrsquot regret what I did. The following day, Tory MP for Moray Douglas Ross, resigned as a Scotland Office minister over his views on the alleged breach.JuneOn June , a man with a kne stabbed six people, including a police officer and hotel staff, in the Park Inn Hotel in Glasgow.The attacker, Badreddin Abadlla Adam, was shot dead by a police officer on the scene.Police said the incident was not being treated as terrorism.JulyAfter a tough few months, beer gardens were allowed to reopen from July  ndash taking advantage of some warm weather that was about to come.Following weeks of guidance, Scotland made it officially law to make it compulsory to wear a face covering in shops across Scotland on July .AugustPupils in Scotland finally began ing to classrooms on August , without the need to socially distance ndash with pupils initially not having to wear face coverings. This was later changed on August , requiring the need for masks in corridors, canteens and other communal areas.The following day, on August , three people died after a passenger train derailed in Aberdeenshire.The .

Ms Sturgeon said the new iant accounts for almost half of all new cases in the country.\"It is no exaggeration to say that I am more concerned now than I have been at any time since March,\" said Ms Sturgeon.Schools will now stay closed for a further two weeks until February  - with plans to reopen on January  scrapped.The new lockdown means that outdoor gatherings are limited to two people from two dferent households.Anyone  or under will not be counted towards that number.Travel restrictions remain in place, with cross-border journeys banned unless essential.Places of worship will have to close again.Ms Sturgeon said that the new measures would not be \"in place any longer than necessary\", but warned that the lockdown could continue past February .The First Minister added that the Borders is currently at more than % of its COVID hospital capacity."},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeons-coronavirus-announcement-full-lockdown-explained","story":"First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has announced that Scotland will enter a national lockdown.As of midnight tonight, it will now be a legal requirement for people to stay at home unless for essential travel.Speaking at Holyrood, Ms Sturgeon said: \"I can confirm now, in summary, that we decided to introduce from tomorrow, for the duration of January, a legal requirement to stay at home except for essential purposes. This is similar to the lockdown of March last year.\"The First Minister added: \"Indeed, it is no exaggeration to say that I am more concerned about the situation we face now than I have been at any time since March last year.\"The decisioncomes as cases of Covid- have dramatically risen across the country, with, new positive cases announced today.Heres the key points from todays announcement:Stay at home messageFrom tomorrow,you live in a Level  areayou cannot leave your home except for an essential purpose - much like back in March.This means when you do go out, stay as close to home as possible and stay away from crowded places.And it remains the case that no-one is allowed to travel into or out of Scotland unless it is for an essential purpose.Schools will stay closedNicola Sturgeon confirmed that schools will stay closed until February  for the majority of pupils.The change will apply to all pupils - except vulnerable children, and children of key workers. And it includes nursery schools, as well as primary and secondary schools.Ms Sturgeon said: \"I want to be clear that it remains our priority to get school buildings open again for all pupils as quickly as possible and then keep them open.\"However, right now, two factors mean that it is not consistent with a safety-first approach for all children to attend school in person.\"First, the overall level of community transmission is too high. We need to get transmission down before schools can safely reopen. A period of online learning will also, in turn, help us do that.\"The second reason is that there is still signicant uncertainty about the impact of the new iant on transmission amongst young people.\"We, therefore, have to adopt a cautious approach.\"So most pupils will be learning online for at least the rest of the month.\"This decision will be reviewed on January  whether they canto school on February .Meeting people outdoorsFrom tomorrow,the rule on outdoor gatherings will change.Previously, up to six people from two households are able to meet outdoors. Given the greater transmissibility of this new iant, the Scottish Government willconsider it necessary to restrict that further.From tomorrow, a maximum of two people from up to two households will be able to meet outdoors.Children aged  and under will not be counted in that limit, and they will also be able to play outdoors in larger groups, including in organized gatherings.However, for everyone  ndash including  to -year-olds - outdoor exercise should only take place in a way which is consistent with the twopeople from twohouseholds rule.Working from homeAnyone who is able to work from home must do so.It will only be a reasonable excuse to leave your home to go to workthat work cannot be done from home.The Scottish Government are asking people and businesses to take this \"really seriously\" because the situation is at least as serious now as it was then.The law already requires many businesses in certain sectors to close in Level .Every business is being asked to look again at their operations and to make sure that every singlethat can be done by people working at home, is being done in that way.Shielding advice changesIf you were shielding and you cannot work from home, our clear advice now is that you should not go into work at all.Hospitals near capacityNicola Sturgeon confirmed that thetotal number of Covid- patients in hospital is close to its April peak.In terms of hospital beds, NHS Ayrshire and Arran is currently at % of its Covid- capacity, and three other health boards - Borders, GreaterGlasgow  Clyde and Lanarkshire - are above % of their capacity.The total number of patients in intensive care in Scotland is already above normal winter levels. Indeed, all mainland health boards have now exceeded their normal intensive care unit capacity.And it is important to be clear that people who are in hospital and ICU now are likely to have been infected  days to twoweeks ago.Other restrictions will also come into effect includingplaces of worship closing,no wakes, two-metre distancing in canteens and further premises closing.The fortnightly review will not simply be a choice between opening and closing schools - we will always seek to maximise the number of pupils we can safely get back to classrooms and nurseries.What help will be provided Grants areavailable for businesses required to close as a result of restrictions.

Clearly, we will stay closely involved and be seeking the best possible outcome as we have done in the past.’TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGOSpy camera scheme takes a step forwardThe group planning to set up a town centre security system in Campbeltown is considering applying to the government for funding.The Scottish Office has just made £ million available to pay for , new closed circuit television cameras to help fight crime in Scottish towns.The driving force behind Campbeltown’s proposed system, Kintyre Crime Prevention Panel, recently received an estimate for the cost of installing a system from a leading security firm. Thorne Security says it could have a system in operation for £,, less than half the amount the  previously thought it would cost.The system would include four cameras to cover Main Street, Longrow, Burnside Square and the area around Hall Street and the cross.Four special television screens at Campbeltown Police Station would allow the police to watch the pictures from the cameras. The images would be recorded on an industrial-quality video recorder at the station. The pictures could alert the police to trouble or help them trace offenders.The team from Thorne Security will be visiting Campbeltown at the end of January to demonstrate the equipment.The secretary of the , Sergeant Douglas Reid of Campbeltown police, has already contacted the Scottish Office for more details about the funding package. Sergeant Reid said: ‘The  is fully committed, following the tremendous public response, to go in as far as possible along this road.’The  is already planning to apply to other local and national bodies for contributions towards the cost of the system.The Scottish Office’s challenge competition will make funds available for groups representing local communities to bid for money to fund CCTV systems.Applicants from dferent areas will bid in competition with each other for a share of the government cash.The first town centre security camera system in Scotland was set up in Airdrie three years ago. New research shows that in the first two years after the system was set up, the crime rate plunged by  per cent.The Scottish Office says there is no evidence that crime was simply being shted to areas outwith the reach of the cameras. Instead the total amount of recorded crime actually fell.FIFTY YEARS AGOMcCartney again!Mr Paul McCartney, ex-bass guitarist with the Beatles, has recently purchased from Mr A Revie, Loch Ranachan Farm, which comprises  acres and adjoins his other farm, High Park.Mr McCartney has been spending a few days on the farm with his we and family over the festive season.One happy Rangers fanMr Crawford Morans of  Albyn Avenue, who is employed with the Ministry of Social Security, has had a good ending to the old year.

In the Clyde, however, the Board of Trade did not insist on this in respect of vessels trading exclusively within what is known as the smooth water area.This area was within an imaginary line drawn from Skipness Point to Fairlie. On the date in question, the accused conveyed a cargo from Glasgow to Tobermory via the Crinan Canal.As soon as he had left Crinan, he was in contravention of the regulations, having entered the more hazardous waters off the west coast.On behalf of the accused, an agent stated that he had traded with the Bloodhound for nearly  years. During the war, the ship had been requisitioned by the Ministry of Shipping, and under the orders of that department had been sent outside the limits of the smooth water area.The accused had naturally thought that what he had been doing during the war, when he traded to ports on Islay and the Ayrshire coast, he was free to do now.Sherf Macmaster Campbell imposed a penalty of £."},{"url":null,"title":"leader january 1 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

In the Bible, more than  times He says: #Do not be afraid# or phrases that mean this. Let us take this truth into the New Year with us.Let us all pray that soon we can say we are not afraid and what a dferent year  is.#Away, then all fears.

Food and drink is a staple in households across Scotland for Hogmanay, and it is certainly something that can remain the same, even with these uncertain times.A pot of soup to bring in the bells never goes a miss, and youd be forgiven for thinking that a slow-cooked stew is something of legend at this time of year.But while many families would plan to head out for a New Years Day meal, this will not be going ahead this year.Alternatives could include trying out some new recipes at home, and having a New Years meal at home. Bake some goodies to bring in the bells with, such as traditional Scots tablet or shortbread.Zoom have lted their -minute time limit across the New Year period, so set the camera at the bottom of your table and invite however many guests youd like!A tradition throughout Scotland on Hogmanay, the normal act of first footing will certainly be missed this year, but there may be a way to salvage it.Traditionally, first footing involves the first person who enters the house after midnight bringing gts. It has been adapted through the years, and some now visit neighbours with a tipple and a song before moving on to the next house.While were not allowed in other peoples houses this year, we can certainly adapt the tradition.Ask one of your household to draw the short straw and brave the cold just after midnight and emulate a first footing with your immediate bubble. Or, have a virtual first footing, and make sure to call your loved ones and wish them a Happy New Year.As always, there will be a raft of content available to watch on TV on Hogmanay. The official TV guide has not yet been released, but therersquoll likely be old favourites including the likes of Still Game.As ever, there will be several Hogmanay specials to help us bring in the bells from the comfort of our own home. Over on BBC One, Susan Calman will be getting ready for Hogmanay  with ldquoa studio of stars.The events that Scotlandrsquos festive season are famed for wonrsquot be going ahead in person this year. However, many are embracing a digital approach for the first time, making it easier for us to enjoy the festivities from our homes.Edinburghrsquos Hogmanay, which usually takes the form of an incredible street party with live performances and festivities, will instead be heading online.

Naturally, this would not be the last time an IndyRef would be brought up this year.On January , the UK confirmed its first two cases of Covid-.FebruaryBy February , the forthcoming coronavirus pandemic seemed a million miles away ndash with only three cases confirmed by this point.Attention instead was on Storm Ciara ndash a powerful and long-lived cyclone which battered parts of the country with gusts of up to mph.Flooding and heavy wind caused damage to buildings and train services, and on February , a -year-old man died after falling on icy surfaces and banging his head during the storm.Another major news story to unfold in the last year was surrounding former finance secretary Derek Mackay MSP.Once tipped to become the next First Minister, the Scottish Sun revealed the now shamed politician had been pestering a -year-old schoolboy on social media.The paper reported the -year-old MSP had contacted the boy out of the blue without knowing his age the previous August, then sent him  messages over six months.MarchThen came March ndash a month that can only be described as the month coronavirus pandemic really hit home in Scotland.On March , Scotland had its first confirmed case of the virus in the NHS Tayside, followed soon after by its first death on March .By March ,  cases had been confirmed in the country, with the virus clearly beginning to spread into other health boards.The inevitable news then came ndash with all pubs, cafes and restaurants being forced to close on March , before a nationwide lockdown on March .On the same day, Alex Salmond was cleared of sexually assaulting nine woman while he was the First Minister.As the BBC reports, a jury found the former SNP leader not guilty on  of the sexual assault charges facing him, while another was found not proven.A further charge of sexually assaulting a th woman had previously been dropped by prosecutors.

This was later changed on August , requiring the need for masks in corridors, canteens and other communal areas.The following day, on August , three people died after a passenger train derailed in Aberdeenshire.The . ScotRail service from Aberdeen to Glasgow Queen Street hit a landslide near to Stonehaven following heavy rain and thunderstorms.The victims were named as driver Brett McCullough, , conductor Donald

across the country.Bruce McColl, the member services manager for the Scottish Craft Butchers Association, was able to provide some insight into our January  delight.He said: ldquoOne theory holds that steak pie became the national dish at New Years because January  wasnrsquot generally taken as a holiday so families were too busy to cook, said Mr McColl.ldquoThey would buy steak pies to feed their families instead, this continues to this day as people want a delicious meal after the previous nightrsquos celebrations.ldquoSo it was essentially one of the first ready meals.Steak pie then could be the nationrsquos hangover cure on what is often the roughest morning of the year for many, after a night of celebratory drinking.Mr McColl added: ldquoThe other train of thought is that people would have it as their main meal on Hogmanay before they started to drink.ldquoItrsquos a good meal to be made in advance so a lot of people have it as their main meal before the bells.ldquoAnother theory is that because it is a big meal you can keep warm and serve to visitors throughout the day, as people come to the house.Steak pie, it seems, fits Scotlandrsquos New Years celebrations perfectly - whether as a meal which can feed a number of visitors popping in throughout the day, soak up the booze from the night before or to line onersquos stomach for a big night ahead.Do you enjoy a steak pie

There was heavy traffic and, needless to say, Irsquod never driven a bus before and hadnrsquot expected to at this moment either.ldquoYou mean drive the bus  I foolishly asked.ldquoThatrsquos why you are here, isnrsquot it  he replied.I was on the bus with two other learners, as well as the instructor. We had been given some rudimentary instructions by him as hersquod driven the bus into the busy city centre, but I hadnrsquot realised we would actually have to drive the bus through busy streets.That was the first time I had driven a bus. It was, of course, an assessment of my capabilities. I negotiated as best I could and quickly learned what a tail swing was, as I nearly shaved off the nose of a woman who was standing on the edge of a pavement waiting to cross the road!The gearstick felt like it had been cemented to the vehicle, making changing gears a Herculean effort, with the engine roaring as I struggled to crunch it into gear. I drove slowly and cars began honking their horns in frustration.There was a big L on the rear of the bus, but I think when people see a bus in the city centre they assume the person driving actually knows how to drive a bus!It was a stressful  minutes and, when I finally pulled over, the instructor looked at his notes shaking his head. I cannot repeat what he said, but it was a generally negative assessment with lots of adjectives.Yet I wasnrsquot written off and was told I needed six full days of lessons as a minimum before sitting my test. Against everyonersquos expectations, including mine, I passed first time.I had done it and realised one of my lersquos dreams.There was a specic reason I needed a bus driving licence: I wanted to be a driver guide and take people around Scotland on tour. My le had undergone some dramatic changes and my le ambitions had changed as a result.It wasnrsquot, of course, about money or climbing a career ladder, but about the hopeful expectation it would make me rich in experiences and give me a new angle on le.My head and heart were full of Scotlandrsquos stories, and this seemed a perfect way to use my love of history and folklore, and share my passion for the landscape that held so many personal memories for me. I felt my le was about to be transformed and indeed it was.So that day I passed my bus driving test was a day of utter joy. Although over  years ago now, I can still feel the elation.I worked for dferent tour companies at dferent times in my le over the following  years. It was something I couldto whenever I needed it. During the last period of my time as a driver guide, a transport manager called Ronnie worked miracles as he juggled my rota to fit round my very complicated childcare arrangements. I will be forever grateful to him for his understanding.Were my expectations of the job realised or did I have an over-romanticised image of it  Irsquod say a bit of both. I tried my best to showcase Scotland, but I quickly understood people travel for dferent reasons with dferent interests.But it opened a window on the world for me. I met so many people from dferent walks of le and dferent countries and cultures. It taught me so much about the way humans behave towards each other and how we handle and respond to experiences in dfering ways.We were all on mini le journeys together, usually three days, sometimes five. In this brief fleck of time, a small group of people would be together amidst the splendour, and sometimes challenging conditions, of Scotland. When connections were made, it was because of shared values, regardless of cultural dferences.I began to see the tours as a metaphor for the way we live our lives, not just in observing others but myself as well. I had never thought the job would be a lesson on the philosophy of le, but that is partly what it became for me.It revealed to me that happiness, enjoyment and appreciation is a default within us, not something to be found, bought or acquired, or even weather dependent!That now seems so obvious but it took years for me to truly understand how we can become so easily trapped in the hedonic treadmill. I know thatrsquos a fancy term, but its meaning is simple: that as we go through le, we quickly take things for granted and so seek new and higher levels of satisfaction which we believe will give us happiness. While we can get a rush of pleasure and satisfaction in new things or experiences, we soon then take those for granted as well. So the cycle continues. We become like dogs chasing our tails in pursuit of what we think will make us happy or give us a more fulfilled le.The tours taught me that appreciation is the key to this. You donrsquot have to be a tour guide to learn this lesson, of course, as we all have our lersquos experiences that teach us. But that treadmill is so easy to fall into, even when you know it offers a  dawn. It can take a conscious effort to climb out of it.That is when we need what is called a hedonic reset: another fancy term for stopping that chase of our tail and taking time to appreciate what we have. This can be done by temporarily depriving ourselves of things we take for granted and so regaining our appreciation of them.A simple example could be when we go camping. I love it, but when I get home I appreciate my bed, my shower and central heating in ways I didnrsquot before we left on our camping trip!The virus has forced a reset on all of us it has taken away many things we took for granted: travel, staying with friends, family meals, a coffee and blether with a friend, hugging loved ones, being with loved ones, browsing in a bookshop. We will all have our list.It has been heartbreaking, with devastating consequences for so many peoplersquos livelihoods and emotional wellbeing, as well as a tragic loss of le.Itrsquos an unwanted, brutal and forced reset, but the le lesson I learnt on the tours has helped me understand that appreciation is the key to resilience and getting through this as best as we can.When times relax, as they hopefully will soon, I know how much I will appreciate hugging my daughter I havenrsquot been able to hug for  months, being able to tell stories to a live audience and have a coffee with a friend in a real cafe. And travel to the places I love within my own country.Perhapsthere is any positive out of this, I hope it will be that I will never again fall into that treadmill of taking things I have for granted.So I say Happy New Year to you, and I mean it in a heartfelt way I never meant before."},{"url":null,"title":"vet-column-consider-welcoming-new-pet","story":"ONCE your new puppy or kitten has settled into your household, there are several things to consider, ensuring your new pet is kept fit and healthy.Register with your veterinary surgeon. This gives immediate reassurancea problem does arise with your pet.At Dunedin Vets, we offer free puppy and kitten checks and for all new pets as soon as you acquire them this may be carried out by telephone during these Covid- times. Lots of advice is given by vets, qualied veterinary nurses and reception staff.Everyone is thinking about vaccination against coronavirus for humans just now. Vaccination has been the major controller of lethal diseases since the process was developed by Edward Jenner centuries ago.We must vaccinate our pets to prevent several fatal conditions. Pups can be vaccinated from six weeks of age. However, vaccinating at  and  weeks of age is the new normal during this Covid- pandemic, when most vaccinations are given.Pups should be kept isolated until two weeks after the first vaccination, then limited contact with other dogs until after the second vaccine. Boosters are given annually against parvovirus, distemper, hepatitis leptospirosis and kennel cough.It is advisable to vaccinate your kitten against cat flu, feline enteritis and feline leukaemia. Two vaccines are usually given three weeks apart from nine weeks of age. Kittens should be kept isolated until one week after the second vaccine. Boosters are given annually against cat flu, feline enteritis and feline leukaemia.Rabbits can be vaccinated against myxomatosis and rabbit haemorrhagic disease , of which there are two strains. One vaccine against the two agents can be given from six weeks of age. Boosters are given annually.Everyone loves a new puppy or kitten, but please be aware of unscrupulous dealers who take advantage of the kind and loving nature of the majority of people.Recently, Kimberly Mackie visited Dunedin Vetsrsquo Tranent surgery with her new puppy Poppy. Poppy is a Jack Russell cross Chihuahua, so is a very small pup. However, Poppy arrived with diarrhoea and very dehydrated, weighing only a few hundred grams.Poppy was examined by vet Chris Monk, who immediately saw how ill little Poppy was.Mum had bought her in all good faith from a family home. It was soon discovered that Poppy had been microchipped and had a vaccination in Eire. Poppy was an import from Eire, a victim of the illegal puppy farming trade.It is so dficult for new owners to know the origin of their pup, especially when the sellers can seem so plausible. Ask to see the parents or at least the mother and other pups in the litter, although they find many ways to circumvent these questions. It is also so dficult toa puppy or kitten once you have cuddled them and instantly fallen in love.The good news is that Poppy, after fluid therapy and medications, and lots of loving care from Dunedin Vets staff and, of course, his forever mum, has made a full recovery and is developing her own special character.We must also consider other preventable conditions which our pets may be susceptible to.Most puppies and kittens are born with a roundworm infestation. Worms are passed to them before birth by their mothers and through motherrsquos milk. This is obviously not very pleasant and potentially these worms pose a risk for humans, especially children.Tapeworms are rarely a problem in puppies and kittens, although one type is actually transmitted by fleas.We recommend worming puppies and kittens at eight,  and  weeks of age with a quality wormer in tablet or liquid form, which will kill most worms.Remember, there may be no obvious signs of worm infestation.Worming should be carried out every three months for the rest of your petrsquos le.Many puppies and kittens arrive at their new home with a population of external parasites. These include fleas and mites.Fleas are passed from one animal to another. Although there are dferent types of dog and cat fleas, they donrsquot mind what they jump onto to feed!Fleas are two to three millimetres long and move quickly through the coat. Flea droppings are black and gritty, and turn reddamp cotton wool is applied to them.Fleas can transmit several diseases, cause allergies and general irritation. Fleas live on your pet, and in the house.You must use a suitable insecticide spray to destroy flea larvae, which can survive for months in the environment. Your veterinary staff can advise what is best for your pet and your home.The rabbit flea is unusual in that it doesnrsquot move very fast. They are often found along the edge of catsrsquo ears and are dficult to remove, so are called lsquostick tightrsquo fleas. Cats pick them up when hunting wild rabbits.Walking dandruff mitesare very common in puppies, kittens and bunnies. They are too small to see but occasionally skin scurf appears to move, which is actually the mites, hence the name.Mange mitesare minute parasites which bury into the skin. Some are passed from mother to young and some spread from pet to pet. Some cause intense scratching, some cause hair loss. Some can be very dficult to treat, requiring specialised anti-parasitic washes or spot on treatment.Ear mites live in the ear canals, causing irritation, lots of wax production and a smell.At Dunedin Vets, we strongly recommend taking out insurance for your pet at a young age. Many breeders will provide initial insurance cover, and many vets will offer free insurance with certain companies for a few weeks. This gives peace of mind whilst you are considering which insurance to purchase. We suggest you look for a lsquolelong coverrsquo policy so your pet will always be covered.Consider a pet health club for your new arrival. Many veterinary practices, including Dunedin Vets, offer this type of scheme. Basically, you spread the cost of your petrsquos preventative healthcare over the year rather than being faced with large bills at booster time, so allowing you to budget monthly for this.Dunedin Vetsrsquo pet health club offers many other benefits and discounts. During these dficult times, many people are finding this a great way to ensure the best care for their pets without burdening themselves financially.Puppies, kittens and bunnies bring so much love to a family and help so much in your wellbeing ndash choose wisely, and look after them well, and you will have a friend and companion for le."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-peeps-past-december-29-31-1995-1970-1920","story":"lsquoPLEASE drink up... the pub is on firersquo was a headline in the East Lothian Courier on December , .Time was called early at the Auld Hoose pub in North Berwick last Wednesday after a fire broke out in the public bar.Customers spotted smoke coming from the floor near a fireplace about pm and the local fire brigade was alerted.The premises were evacuated ndash including an upstairs flat occupied by Jean Borthwick and her Labrador dog, Freeway ndash as landlord Ian McMinn tried to tackle the blaze with a fire extinguisher containing powder.But help was soon at hand in the shape of his brother Hugh, a local fireman, and the rest of the retained crew who began fighting the dense smoke and flames.Sub-officer McMinn explained that cracks in the old hearth at the pubrsquos real fire had caused joists and beams on the floor to burn.AN EAST Lothian pupil became the first from his high school to be accepted to study at the University of Cambridge, reported The Haddingtonshire Courier of December , .Ian Graham, son of Sergeant and Mrs Graham, Tranent, has been accepted for entry into Emmanuel College, Cambridge, in October .Ian is at present in his sixth year at the Ross High School.He was Dux of the School in his fth year and is at present Head Boy.He is a young man of high intellectual ability but at the same time he is an accomplished games player, playing in the School XV and also in the Badminton Club.He is an office-bearer in the Literary and Debating Society and last summer was a gold medallist in athletics at the Scottish Schools Athletics Championships.A MAN was fined pound after being caught stealing a bird from a train station, as reported in The Haddingtonshire Courier of December , .In the Burgh Court, on Friday, before Bailie Main, James Kelly, railway porter, Church Street, Haddington, pleaded guilty to having, on Tuesday, st, stolen a cockerel from a hamper lying in the booking-hall of the station.The Fiscal stated that, about eight orsquoclock on the night in question, a booking-clerk heard a person entering the booking-hall on tip-toe.On going out, he found Kelly alongside the hamper.He made the excuse that the label had been torn off the hamper, and that he was putting it on.The label was afterwards found lying on the floor, but it was discovered that the hamper had been opened and the cockerel removed."},{"url":null,"title":"7am-wait-worth-mum-bonnie-babies-champion-2020-harris-tait","story":"Harris Tait, who celebrated his first birthday on December , was announced as the winner in last weekrsquos Courier.He lives on East Lintonrsquos Longstone Avenue with mum Kirsty, , and dad Andrew, , a maintenance team leader at Torness Power Station.Kirsty described Harris as a ldquofunny and cheeky little boy with ldquosuch a little personality.She added: ldquoHe knows what he wants and is a determined little guy, which I think he takes from me and Andrew.Kirsty, who has been on maternity leave this year but is ing to work on Monday as a customer trade manager at Asda in Livingston, said Harrisrsquo win had been a boost to the family after what has been a tumultuous year.She said: ldquoItrsquos not really been the greatest year and hersquos not been able to interact with other kids and I thought, lsquoWhat have we got to lose rsquo so decided to enter him.ldquoYou never think that you are going to win competitions like these.When the results were announced in last weekrsquos Courier, Kirsty said she was ldquobuzzing and ldquoa bit emotional.

I will set out our decisions shortly.However, I can confirm now, in summary, that we decided to introduce from midnight tonight for the duration of January, a legal requirement to stay at home except for essential purposes. This is similar to the lockdown of March last year.However, before I set out Cabinetrsquos decisions in more detail, I want to explain in some detail why they are so necessary.In the last few weeks, there have been two signicant game changers in our fight against this virus.One, the approval of vaccines, is hugely positive and offers us the way out of this pandemic.But the other - the new faster spreading iant of the virus - is a massive blow.Possibly the most simple way of explaining the challenge we face right now is to compare it to a race.In one lane we have vaccines - our job is to make sure they can run as fast as possible.Thatrsquos why the government will be doing everything we can to vaccinate people as quickly as possible. I will say more about that later.But in the other lane is the virus which - as a result of this new iant - has just learned to run much faster and has most definitely picked up pace in the last couple of weeks.To ensure that the vaccine wins the race, it is essential to speed up vaccination as far as possible.But to give it the time it needs to get ahead, we must also slow the virus down.And because it is now spreading faster, that means even tougher restrictions are necessary.The evidence is now compelling that the new iant is up to % more transmissible than previously circulating strains, and that it may add as much as . to the R number.And according to recent analysis of PCR test samples, it appears that the new iant already accounts for almost half of all new cases in Scotland.That increased and faster spread is undoubtedly driving the very serious situation we now face.Todayrsquos case numbers ndash , new cases, with % of tests being positive - illustrate the severity and urgency of the situation.No new deaths were reported today ndash because yesterday was a Sunday and registration offices were largely closed ndash but since I updated Parliament before Christmas,  deaths have been recorded in the daily figures. That again reminds us of the continuing grief this pandemic is causing.But this is not just about one dayrsquos numbers.We are now seeing a steeply rising trend of infections.Indeed, it is no exaggeration to say that I am more concerned about the situation we face now than I have been at any time since March last year.In the week from  to  December, the seven day incidence of cases per , of the population increased by % - from  per , to  per ,.Test positivity has risen sharply too.The next update on the numbers of Covid patients in hospital and intensive care will be published tomorrow.I would expect these to show that, nationally, the total number of Covid patients in hospital is close to its April peak. And in some boards, the pressure is already very real.For example, in terms of hospital beds, NHS Ayrshire and Arran is currently at % of its Covid capacity, and three other health boards - Borders, Greater Glasgow  Clyde and Lanarkshire - are above % of their capacity.The number of people in intensive care is still signicantly lower than the April peak ndash which partly reflects the fact that treatment of Covid has improved signicantly since last spring.But even so, the total number of patients in intensive care in Scotland is already above normal winter levels. Indeed, all mainland health boards have now exceeded their normal intensive care unit capacity.And it is important to be clear that people who are in hospital and ICU now are likely to have been infected  days to  weeks ago.That means that these numbers reflect what the level of new cases was around  weeks ago.Given that the number of cases has increased signicantly since then, we can expect to see signicantly increased pressure on the NHS over the course of this month.Contingency plans remain in place to double and then treble ICU capacitynecessary.And the NHS Louisa Jordan continues to be available to help meet demand - as indeed it has been doing in recent months. , patients have attended there for scans and outpatient appointments nearly , NHS staff and students have been trained there and it is currently being used for Covid vaccinations.In short, NHS services are coping at present ndash although the pressure on frontline staff is considerable - but already in some areas the position is fragile, and getting more challenging.Andthe rate of increase in case numbers that we have seen in past two weeks was to continue unchecked, there would be a real risk of our NHS being overwhelmed - even with contingency plans in place.In fact, our modelling suggests that without further intervention, we could breach inpatient Covid capacity within  or  weeks.And, of course, a sharply increasing number of cases, in human terms, means many more people becoming ill and dying.All of that explains why we have to act quickly and decisively.The situation in some other parts of the UK - where case numbers are already much higher than here, and where the contribution of the new iant is already greater - shows what may lie aheadwe donrsquot.As things stand, we estimate that we are possibly about four weeks behind the position in London and the south east.The rapid acceleration in London began when it was at about  new cases a week, for every hundred thousand people. Thatrsquos the level Scotland was at a week ago.London is now seeing  new cases a week per ,. Test positivity is around %. And pressure on NHS services is acute.We have an opportunity in Scotland to avert the situation here deteriorating to that extent.But we must act quickly.The advice of our clinical advisers is clear that the increased transmissibility of the new iant means that the current level  measures may not be sufficient to bring the R number back below .It is essential that we further limit interaction between dferent households to stem the spread and bring the situation back under control, while we vaccinate more people.In short, we mustfor a period to a situation much closer to the lockdown of last March.Let me therefore set out in more detail the decisions Cabinet has reached.It is important to stress that these are not decisions taken lightly. I am acutely aware of the impact they will have and I know they will not be welcome.But they are in our judgment essential.As government, our clear and overriding duty right now is to act quickly to save lives and protect the NHS.We know that delay or preication in the face of this virus almost always makes things worse not better - evenit stems from an understandable desire that we all share to wait for more data or evidence.To turn to the decisions in detail. The decisions I will speak about a bit later on schools, let me be clear at this stage, they will apply to all parts of Scotland. However other decisions that I will outline will apply to those parts of Scotland currently at level , which of course is all of mainland Scotland, and they are effectively an enhancement to level .The island areas currently in level  will remain there for now, although we will continue to monitor them very carefully.These additional level  restrictions - essentially ing us to a position similar to the lockdown of last March - will be in place for the whole of January. We will keep them closely under review.However, I cannot at this stage rule out keeping them in place longer, nor making further changes. Nothing about this is easy.The first measure is that our fundamental advice, for everyone, is to stay at home.That is the single best way of staying safe.We consider that this stay at home message and advice is now so important that, from tomorrow, it will become law, just as it was in the lockdown last year.This means it will only be permissible to leave home for an essential purpose.This will include, for example, caring responsibilities, essential shopping, exercise and being part of an extended household.In addition, anyone who is able to work from home, must do so. It will only be a reasonable excuse to leave your home to go to work,that work cannot be done from home.We are asking people and businesses to take this really seriously ndash as we all did in March, during the first lockdown, - because the situation is at least as serious now as it was then.The law already requires many businesses in certain sectors to close in Level . We now need every business to look again at their operations, and to make sure that every singlethat can be done by people working at home, is being done in that way.Businesses have already shown a tremendous capacity to adapt during this pandemic and Irsquom very grateful to them for that - and we need them to consider their operations again, as we all work together to reduce transmissions.The Economy Secretary will be speaking to business organisations about this, including this afternoon. We will also engage with unions on these issues. And we will continue to considermore regulatory action is required.We are also providing new guidance for people who are in the shielding category.If you were shielding and you cannot work from home, our clear advice now is that you should not go into work at all.The Chief Medical Officer is writing to everyone who falls into this category, and his letter will count as a Fit Note for those who need it.Unlike the lockdown last year, the frequency of outdoor exercise is not being limited.It is important for physical and mental health that we can get outdoors for fresh air and exercise as much as possible.However, from tomorrow, the rule on outdoor gatherings will change.As of now, up to six people from two households are able to meet outdoors. Given the greater transmissibility of this new iant, we consider it necessary to restrict that further.From tomorrow, a maximum of two people from up to two households will be able to meet outdoors.Children aged  and under will not be counted in that limit, and they will also be able to play outdoors in larger groups, including in organized gatherings.However, for everyone  ndash including  to  year olds - outdoor exercise should only take place in a way which is consistent with the  people from  households rule.In addition, strict travel restrictions remain in place across Scotland. From tomorrow,you live in a level  area - as the majority of us do - you cannot leave your home except for an essential purpose. When you do go out, stay as close to home as possible and stay away from crowded places.And it remains the case ndash and let me stress this point - that no-one is allowed to travel into or out of Scotland unless it is for an essential purpose.Presiding OfficerA number of other measures will come into effect on Friday of this week.It is with real regret that we consider it necessary for places of worship to close during this period for all purposes except broadcasting a service, or conducting a funeral, wedding or civil partnership.I am well aware of how important communal worship is to people.But we believe that this restriction is necessary to reduce the risk of transmission.While up to  people will still be able to attend funeral services, wakes will not be possible during January. And a maximum of  people will be able to attend wedding and civil partnership services.Presiding OfficerI know how devastating restrictions like these are and I give an assurance that we will not keep them in place for longer than is absolutely necessary.There will also be additional measures in relation to businesses, in addition to the tightening of the essential retail definition that took effect from Boxing Day.The current  metre exemption for workplace canteens will end ndash so canteens will have to ensure that employees sit  metres or more apart, rather than  metre.The number of non-essential services which remain open will be further restricted.Premises which will need to close as a result of these changes will include, for example ski centres, showrooms of larger retailers, and clinics offering cosmetic and aesthetic procedures.I know that many businesses have already been hit by the restrictions which were put in place on Boxing Day.And of course I know that the vast majority of businesses have taken their responsibilities seriously, and have invested in Covid safety measures.In addition, the move to home working has brought challenges for workers and employers. I am hugely grateful for the way in which businesses and their staff have responded to those challenges.Grants are of course available for businesses required to close as a result of restrictions. That support is in addition to support through the UK wide furlough scheme.The Scottish Governmentrsquos financial support for businesses during the pandemic currently totals more than pound. billion.However, we will continue to assess what more the Scottish government can do ndash either in closure grants or other forms of support - to help businesses and those who work for them.We will also work with councils to ensure community and social support for those who need it, including for parents balancing work and online learning.We will confirm additional resources later this week.Presiding Officer,The final substantive issue I want to address - before giving an update on vaccination - relates to schools.We announced before Christmas that most school pupils would learn remotely ndash rather than in school ndash until Monday  January.I can confirm that we have now decided to extend that date and keep schools closed to the majority of pupils until  February. We will review this again in mid-January.The change will apply to all pupils - except vulnerable children, and children of key workers. And it includes nursery schools, as well as primary and secondary schools.There is no doubt that of all the dficult decisions we have had to take today, this was the most dficult of all and its impact is of course the most severe.The evidence to date makes clear that thanks to the hard work of school staff and pupils, schools in Scotland have been low-risk environments for Covid. We will work with our partners to ensure that remains the case.That will include ongoing work on testing in schools and discussions about when, in the context of the overall programme, it will be possible to vaccinate school staff.And I want to be clear that it remains our priority to get school buildings open again for all pupils as quickly as possible and then keep them open.However, right now, two factors mean that it is not consistent with a safety-first approach for all children to attend school in person.First, the overall level of community transmission is simply too high. We need to get transmission down before schools can safely reopen. A period of online learning will also, in turn, help us do that.The second reason is that there is still signicant uncertainty about the impact of the new iant on transmission amongst young people.We therefore have to adopt a cautious approach at this stage.So most pupils will be learning online for at least the rest of the month.We will review on  January whether they can - as we hope -to school on the  February.I know that remote learning presents signicant challenges for teachers, schools, parents and young people, and we will work to support children and parents throughout this.The Scottish Government, Education Scotland and local authorities are working together to further improve the remote learning options which are available for schools.And it is also worth highlighting that since schools ed after the summer, more than , devices ndash such as laptops ndash have been distributed to children and young people to help with remote learning. More devices are being distributed by councils on a weekly basis, and in total we expect our investment ndashwhich builds on existing local authority action - to benefit around , disadvantaged children and young people across Scotland.I also want to stress one final point.Just as the last places we ever want to close are schools and nurseries - so it is the case that schools and nurseries will be the first places we want to reopen as we re-emerge from this latest lockdown.They remain our priority.That is why we are considering whether and to what extent - consistent with our overall duty to vaccinate the most vulnerable first in line with JCVI recommendations - we can achieve vaccination of school and childcare staff as a priority. Many teachers will of course be vaccinated over coming weeks as part of the JCVI priority list.The fortnightly review will not simply be a choice between opening and closing schools - we will always seek to maximise the number of pupils we can safely get back to classrooms and nurseries.Sothe evidence tells us we can get some pupils back safely, we will do that.However ultimately, the best way of enabling more pupils tomore quickly is by reducing community transmission of the virus as much as possible.And all of us ndash by accepting and abiding by the wider restrictions I have set out today - have a part to play in achieving that.Before I leave the issue of education, let me remind the chamber that we already had plans in place for the staggeredof universities and colleges. We will be considering this week whether any further change is necessary.Presiding OfficerBefore I close today, I want to give a brief update on our current expectations around vaccine supply.The Health Secretary will give a more detailed update on vaccination in a statement the chamber next week.However, I can confirm today that well over , people have now received their first dose of the vaccine.The first doses of the Astra Zeneca vaccine are being administered today.In total, over the period to the end of January - including the more than , already administered - we expect to have access to just over , doses of vaccine. Obviously, we hope that increases.These will be split roughly equally between the Pfizer and Astra Zeneca vaccines.However, we anticipate that some of the Astra Zeneca portion will be available only in the last week of January.We do not yet have certainty on supply schedules beyond January but will keep Parliament updated as these become firmer.However, our current expectation, based on assumptions about supply and the new advice on doses being administered up to  weeks apart, rather than , is that by early May everyone over , and people under  with specic underlying conditions, will have received at least the first dose of vaccine.That is everyone who is on the JCVI priority list, and comprises more than . million people.Once everyone on the priority list has been vaccinated, we will start vaccinating the rest of the population, and will do this in parallel with completing second doses for those on the priority list.Those timetables are of course heavily dependent on vaccine supply. And for that reason, they are at this stage cautious.However, I have tasked our vaccination team with exploring and keeping under ongoing review all options to speed up the rate of vaccination and bring these timescales forward as far as possible.I am grateful for the many offers of assistance we have received and while many of them may not prove possible or practical to take up, they will be consideredThe Health Secretary will say more about all of this in her statement next week.Presiding OfficerTo conclude, this is most certainly not the new year statement I wanted to give.And I know it is a statement no one wanted to hear.But as I said at the beginning, we are now in a race between the vaccine and the virus.The Scottish government will do everything we can to speed up distribution of the vaccine.But all of us must do everything we can to slow down the spread of the virus.We can already see ndash by looking at infection rates where ndash some of what could happen here in Scotlandwe donrsquot act.To prevent that, we need to act immediately and firmly.For government, that means introducing tough measures ndash as we have done so today.And for all of us, it means sticking to the rulesIt means continuing to follow the FACTS guidanceAnd it means ndash above all ndash staying at home.That is again our central message.Stay Home. Save lives. Protect the NHS.If we do this, we give the vaccine the time it needs to get ahead and ultimately win the race.I know that the next few weeks will be incredibly dficult.Irsquom sorry to ask for further sacrices, after nine long months of them. But these sacrices are necessary.And the dference between now and last March is that with the help of vaccines, we now have confidence that these sacrices will pave the way to brighter days ahead.So ndash for everyonersquos sake and safety - please stick with it and stay at home."},{"url":null,"title":"new-lockdown-rules-scotland-covid-restrictions-explained","story":"First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced the new rules on Monday afternoon, asthe latest restrictions came into effect from midnight today in all Level  areas of the country andwill continue throughout the month.Speaking at Holyrood, Ms Sturgeon said: \"I can confirm now, in summary, that we decided to introduce from tomorrow, for the duration of January, a legal requirement to stay at home except for essential purposes.

Where  in modern society would this level of accident, injury and probable death be allowed without intervention by the Health and Safety Executive, and prosecution of those causing the hazard  Modern red deer numbers are four times higher than in my young days, kept so by landowners, and the animals are substantially less than wild now, human-familiar and sometimes human-fed. No wonder they are happy around our main roads ndash until hit.The best long-term solution, and probably the easiest short-term solution too, would be the re-introduction of a few wolf packs. The first effect of this would be to scare the deer off easy lower ground where they know they would be vulnerable to wolf attack. The killing of deer by their proper predators would be good for the herd in the longer term, with many wider benefits to the environment. Much evidence of this comes from the reintroduction of wolves to Yellowstone Park in the United States years ago a fascinating short film, How Wolves Change Rivers, can be found on YouTube showing the wider beneficial effects.There are around , wolves in Europe, rising year by year. They are a protected species in many countries and in many regions compensation schemes for livestock damage exist.

She then published a new Independence Referendum Bill.In March , the day before Article  on leaving the EU was passed by Parliament, the First Minister formally requested the consent of Westminster to hold a referendum on Scottish independence. Theresa May said: ldquonow is not the time. The SNP lost a third of its seats in the  snap election that followed.Undaunted, she unveiled a ldquoreset timetable for indyref  which was now scheduled for the autumn of . When that didnrsquot happen she moved the dial to the autumn of , but before that date the SNP switched to supporting a Peoplersquos Vote for Brexit instead of indyref. That didnrsquot happen either. Indeed, the Peoplersquos Vote turned into a Tory General Election landslide of December . A triumphant Boris Johnson announced that he was now Minister for the Union and would reject a Scottish independence referendum for ldquoa generation.Sturgeonrsquos latest forecast is for a referendum in the first half of the new Scottish parliamentary cycle ndash meaning sometime around . You might think that after all these  dawns, independence supporters would have lost hope ndash but not a bit of it. After every deadline has been missed, support for independence has eventually ticked up.More voters than ever appear to have been convinced that Scotland should be an independent country. Some  polls have shown a majority for Yes, reaching a peak of  per cent in a Savanta ComRes poll in mid-December.Of course, that poll excluded donrsquot knows, and all recent polls have been conducted under the shadow of Brexit and latterly the pandemic. It is dficult to know just how much of this is actual support for independence and how much is down to loathing of Boris Johnson and Brexit. However, any objective assessment of the polling evidence would have to conclude that independence is gradually becoming the settled will of the Scottish electorate.This doesnrsquot mean a referendum is in the bag or even that it will certainly take place. Personally, I think the odds of a legally-binding referendum being held in the next decade are fairly remote. This is because the Conservatives now have a very solid majority in Westminster, despite losing a raft of Scottish MPs in .Boris Johnson is triumphant after his Brexit deal and will argue that there is no justication for holding a ldquoisive referendum to break up Britain at the very moment the UK is going through the complex process of rebuilding after the twin shocks of Covid and Brexit.The Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, is also of this view. He is promising further devolution instead of a referendum and has enlisted one of the stars of the  Better Together campaign, the former PM Gordon Brown, to front it. That is the surest sign that, unlike Jeremy Corbyn, Starmer is not prepared to flirt with independence.So, eventhe SNP win the expected landslide in the May Scottish elections, the prospect of Westminster agreeing a legally binding referendum on Scottish independence is remote.Nor will there be much enthusiasm in Brussels for Scottish secession, now that a Brexit deal is in place. Those politicians in the European Parliament who had been saying theyrsquod changed their minds about Scottish independence were mostly playing a tactical game to discredit Brexit. Countries like France and Spain are as resolutely opposed to ldquoseparatism as ever, and are not going to allow Brussels to get involved in the internal politics of a country no longer in the European Union.Nicola Sturgeon has always said that the independence referendum has to be ldquobeyond legal challenge ndash in other words, expressly authorised by Westminster through a Section  Order.She is not interested in declaring UDI after a General Election victory or staging a wildcat referendum of the kind held by Catalonia in . That led to the incarceration of many of the referendum organisers and the self-exile of the Catalan president, Carles Puigdemont.The First Minister is the queen of caution. But that doesnrsquot mean shersquoll do nothing. Her personal popularity has never been higher following her handling of the pandemic, and the SNP has a commanding lead in the opinion polls. The FM is fully aware of just how dficult it is to win an absolute majority in a proportional parliament.But she will probably secure the support of the Greens at Holyrood for a referendum.So what happens then  Joanna Cherry MP, one of the stars of the anti-Brexit court actions, hopes that she will take on the Westminster Government in the Supreme Court,Boris refuses to accept the Scottish Governmentrsquos ldquomandate for a referendum.It is clear, under the UK constitution, that Holyrood has no power to hold a legally binding referendum on independence, but that doesnrsquot mean it canrsquot hold a consultative or advisory ballot asking the Scottish people what they want.There is a chance that the courts would agree that Holyrood has the power to hold a nationwide opinion poll.But would that make any dference  The Scottish Conservative leader, Douglas Ross, is promising to boycott any such advisory referendum and is calling on Unionists not to participate in it. Even some supporters of independence might think that now is just the wrong time to be holding a isive referendum. It could lead to a repeat of the Catalan situation in  when their referendum was condemned as unrepresentative because unionist voters refused to vote.Nationalists might say: a votersquos a vote andpeople donrsquot take the opportunity of expressing a view they canrsquot complain about the result.But it is not Holyrood they need to convince but Westminster. Boris Johnson would use a half-baked referendum result to rule out a referendum even more emphatically than before, and Keir Starmer would back him.We are in a strange limbo, therefore. There is no obvious reason to expect a Scottish referendum in the near future and yet almost everyone does. There is no politically plausible route. However, politics is very fluid right now. We live in turbulent times.Support is clearly rising and it may be that a mass movement of Scottish opinion exerts moral pressure on the Westminster establishment to change its mind. But in the meantime, itrsquos business as usual. Scotland will just have to fake it till she makes it."},{"url":null,"title":"politics-independence-unionists-run-road","story":"Irsquom not one for living by the words of Vladimir Lenin, but they do feel particularly appropriate for our times. The approval of the UKrsquos most voluminous vaccine, aimed at ending the once-in-a-century pandemic, followed hot on the heels of the approval of the trade and security deal struck between the European Union and its first ever departing member, the UK.We live in historically signicant times. However, momentous as both of those events may be, we are about to face a larger one. It may seem counterintuitive ndash hyperbolic even ndash to suggest that the Scottish Parliament elections in four months time carry the same level of importance as coronavirus and Brexit, but they do.In fact, they are more important, and may have more enduring consequences than both. Thursday th May will either be the last election to a devolved Scottish Parliament before Scotland becomes independent, or it will be the last election to a devolved Scottish Parliament where independence is a signicant issue at the ballot box.This is the end game ndash a political title-decider. The field of play looks unremittingly bleak for Scotlandrsquos unionists. That assessment is not based solely on the headline polling numbers, grim as they are .It is what lies beneath that should worry unionists most. In the first referendum, in , the No vote relied on those with good jobs, good prospects and some money in the bank. Not so now Yes has a handsome lead over No in the ABC social class groupings, according to all pollsters.Gender has historically played a role in independence voting intentions, with women thought to be more risk-averse, and tending towards a No vote. No more women now lead with every pollster, in some cases by double-digits.The age profile of No voters is one of those ldquolook away now moments for unionists No leads only in the age group nearing retirement or older. Less than one-in-five under s will vote No. Should the referendum take place in , for the sake of argument, those aged six at the  referendum will be eligible to vote. Current patterns suggest almost all of them will vote Yes.There is no inevitability about this, though. The situation has arisen, in my opinion, largely as a result of push-factors rather than pull-factors. In other words, some of those who would previously have voted No have switched to Yes because of negativity towards the UK rather than positivity towards Scotland.Brexit  Boris  Covid  Probably all three, and probably a whole lot of other reasons. It is important. Many potential Yes voters are not emotional nationalists rather, they are pragmatically and clinically assessing le in an independent Scotland as being, on balance, better than le in the UK.He or she who is pushed away can be pulled back. But it will require the UK Government and its ruling Tories to make a series of radical changes which they have thus far shown themselves unwilling to do, or unable to do, or perhaps both.Truthfully, I donrsquot knowthey have it in them. I read an article at the weekend on a prominent Conservative blog in which the writer surmised that Scottish MPs could be made to like being at Westminster so much that independence could be stopped in its tracks. It was yet another ldquoDo these guys have any idea  moments, of which I experience many.There is a dference between unionist leaders and nationalist leaders. Nationalist leaders, unlike their foot soldiers, are clinical rather than emotional. They make decisions and create policy which they may personally find unpalatable, and which their supporters certainly do, because they know it will help them win Unionist leaders, on the other hand, are as emotional as the foot soldiers. They spend their time bleating about lsquoour precious Unionrsquo and concocting ious plans for how a referendum can be avoided that they never ask themselves the question: how are we going to win If they ever get around to doing so, they will understand that the answer is: by doing things we donrsquot like.The central tenet of what should become the new  of the UK Government is a great programme of decentralisation. They can call it what they wish ndash home rule, federalism, devo max, devo plus. Thatrsquos a job for the advertising agency. What matters is what it means.It means that people in Scotland are no longer forced into a binary choice of being a nationalist or a unionist. I donrsquot identy as either, and Irsquod bet the house that I am not alone.It means that Scots can choose the future that, until not so long ago, polling identied was the one they preferred ndash running almost all of their own affairs but within the context of a more powerful, but looser, UK.It means that the problems which have scarred Scottish devolution will not be experienced in the other parts of the UK, which are on the same journey, but further behind.And it means that, for perhaps the first time since devolution, unionists will hand nationalists a poisoned chalice rather than a golden ticket.They donrsquot have to like it.

It also raises several questions which Ms Sturgeon really needs to answer in , especiallyshe wants to attract more sceptical voters to her cause.This is a particularly frustrating tendency of the First Minister and many other nationalists: the idea that Scotland is uniquely dferent to other nations. Ms Sturgeon says in her article that ldquoScotland, like all nations, is unique, but what does that literal fact prove If Scotland was unique in any profound political sense, we would need a unique political system, but Scotland is largely the same as its neighbours: it faces the same problems, the same issues, the same challenges, and thatrsquos why we cede some of our sovereignty.:Nicola Sturgeon: Scottish independence has never been about separatismMs Sturgeon accepts this when she talks about the EU, so why doesnrsquot she accept it when she talks about the UK A tactic used by the SNPis to state something which is not proven and to state it frequently, loudly, and repeatedly. ldquoDevolution is under threat. ldquoA referendum will happen next year. ldquoIndependence is inevitable. And now: ldquothe majority of Scots support independence.Ms Sturgeon does it again in her article. ldquoA consistent majority of people in Scotland, she says, ldquonow say they are in favour of becoming an independent country even though we cannot knowthatrsquos true or not. The polls show a majority of those who express an opinion now support independence, but thatrsquos not the same as a majority of Scots. Around % of those questioned say they donrsquot know and you donrsquot need great statistical skill to realise % could swing the result.:Opposition needed to challenge the SNP on Scottish independence says Tony BlairSo, the question is: why is Nicola Sturgeon saying it anyway, that the majority of Scots support independence  And the answer is shersquos saying it in the hope of bringing about a three-stage process. Stage one: we believe it. Stage two: we accept it. Stage three: we support it. Itrsquos happened before and it can get parties over the line.Nicola Sturgeon loves the V word: values. The founding values of the EU, she says, are dignity, freedom, equality, the rule of law andrespectfor human rights, and these are Scotlandrsquos values too, she says. She also writes that ldquounfortunately for those of us in Scotland, we are hellip at the sharp end of a very dferent project, driven by very dferent values: Brexit.But what is she suggesting here exactly  Is she suggesting the other nations of the UK ndash specically England ndash do not support values such as dignity and freedom  If so, thatrsquos a pretty outrageous thing to say and a rather unjustied example of Scottish moral superiority. My question would be: in what way exactly are Englandrsquos values dferent from Scotlandrsquos  And in what way are ldquoScotlandrsquos values not universal values In some ways, this is the most important question because it goes to the heart of the intellectual inconsistency of a party that supports leaving the UK and joining the EU. Ms Sturgeon says that more and more people in Scotland believe our aspirations can best be met by contributing to the shared endeavour and solidarity of the EU.:Boris Johnson doubles down on once in a generation referendum claimBut what is the dference between a shared endeavour between Scotland and its neighbours across the Channel, and a shared endeavour between Scotland and its neighbours on the same island  The other obvious question is how the First Minister could justy continuing to promote independence the UK was more federal. Scotlandrsquos membership of a completely federalised UK would not, in any material respect, be dferent to Scotlandrsquos membership of the EU. In both cases, decision-making is pooled on some subjects and we do not always get our way.As she makes clear in her article, Ms Sturgeon accepts this shared-sovereignty model when talking about the EU ndash indeed, she appears to be in love with it ndash but when the same principles are applied to the UK, itrsquos a dferent story. In her article, she also suggests an independent Scotland would be a ldquobridge to aid understanding between the EU and the UK. Itrsquos the best joke in the article.The final question is the most tricky one in a way, strategically, for the First Minister. She says Scotland is the victim of a ldquohard Brexit and that there will be disruption in the short term and new barriers in the longer term. But you can sense the strain in this part of the article, and for obvious reasons.The first problem is thatyou say something will be a disaster before it happens, some people will believe you, but you canrsquot go on saying itthe disaster doesnrsquot happen. Most Scots will not notice any changes post-Brexit andthey do, theyrsquoll be small, and thatrsquos undoubtedly going to neuter the ability of the SNP to carry on catastrophising. Itrsquos why you can hear the slight beep-beep of a reverse from the First Minister and the downgrading of her language to phrases like ldquoshort-term disruption.The second problem is that Ms Sturgeonrsquos desire for a softer Brexit highlights the inconsistency running through her outlook. She is desperate to cede sovereignty to one union but take it back from another, and for many voters thatrsquos confusing. Such as Scots who voted Yes in  and Leave in . Or Scots who voted No in  and Remain in . Or Scots who are desperate for a coherent internationalist philosophy. Or even Scots who started  with a resolution, quickly broken, to be less grumpy.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

HIGNFY was born in a dferent eraand its survival into a fourth decade is remarkable.It first aired around the time I started university, and as a politics student, it was a brilliant reference point for understanding the events of the day. Id never seen anything like it before. Their irreverent take downs of the pompous and preening with their wit and wordplay was a sheer joy to watch and the show has been essential viewing ever since.: The Christmas gt I didnt want . . . Covid in the familyWho needed lecturers when Ian Hyslop and Paul Merton were twisting the comedy kne, testing the boundaries of free speech.Hyslop: the great satirist, moral compass, fount of knowledge but with a cheeky self-deprecating air that avoids preachiness. Merton: the wayward truant son, whose surrealist flights of the imagination and razor-sharp wit often elevates the show into the realms of absurdist genius.Unsurprisingly, HIGNFY has come in for criticism. On the left, it has been accused of propping up the establishment, turning us into ldquogiggling couch potatoes unwilling to think too hard. Indeed, it is claimed the show unwittingly helped Boris Johnson become Prime Minister, with his several appearances allowing him to finesse his shambling posh-boy persona.In contrast, on the right, Hyslop, in particular, is often the target of much venom, whose occasional scathing diatribes have been described as humourless ldquostandard-issue BBC socialism.:Do they know the Christmas song is dead However, I find it reassuring that neither side of the fence can claim ownership of the show. Surely it means they are doing something right. It is just entertainment after all - its not obligated to change the system nor is there a risk of it doing so.But it isnrsquot without its faults ndash some episodes are better than others, and a lot depends on the right chemistry between the regular two, the host and guests. The lockdown episodes filmed via Zoom calls proved almost embarrassingly lacklustre.Sadly, the storm clouds are gathering and its future is by no means certain. Neither of the showrsquos standard bearers are getting any younger. Sometimes Paul seems jaded, while Ian can come across as grumpy. And worse still, director-general Tom Davie has vowed to tackle perceived ldquoleft-wing bias in the BBCs comedy output.But to say the show has let the Johnsons of this world off the hook is simply unfair. It wasnrsquot the programme that voted him to power. And Johnson didnrsquot exactly display leadership qualities as the showrsquos host ndash he was hopeless.

But where would be the funny in that The Scotsman and the Welshman showed how it should be done in the first series. The plot was simple. Tennant and Sheen were supposed to be starring in Pirandellorsquos Six Characters in Search of An Author. Then came Covid, and rehearsals had to be done via video conference.

Also on the call was A Big Name Celebrity, whose identity shall not be revealed lest it spoil your enjoyment of the show on catch up.Enough to say said celebrity is famous for his niceness. But here he was, being snarky about Staged, calling it unfunny and the performers lazy sorts who thought comedy was about making stuff up on the hoof. It was shocking, like watching the Queen make a corgi cry.Sheen tried to humour the grump. ldquoI do think some quite brave stuff has come out of the more improvisatory approach, he said, only for the national treasure to bat back, ldquoDo you Once again, creators Simon Evans and Phin Glynn had successfully walked that fine line between luvviedom, and a right royal send up of all things luvvie. Viewers could relax. Television was still eating itself, with sprinkles on top for good measure.There was more not so good news for the Celtic duo, which bodes well for the rest of the series. Much play is being made of the special guest stars to come. The last run featured Samuel L Jackson and Judi Dench, a pretty high bar.No matter how starry the guests, this will forever be the Tennant and Sheen show.

However, the reality is that money spent on space is, of course, actually spent here on Earth.ldquoThe move from public to private investment in this sprawling sector enables us all to benefit from space technology and information in so many ways.ldquoThis investment can help us in our battle for a better, cleaner Earth. We can use low-cost access to space in order to improve our local economy while enhancing the lives of people around the planet, be it through education, navigation, healthcare, entertainment or most critically, environmental protection.ldquoBusinesses, whether in the industry or interested in growing through the opportunities offered through the space sector, stand at a threshold, where there is a real chance to use their transferable skills and experience to move into a rapidly expanding market, regardless of whether they are an engineering firm, safety consultancy, legal practice, logistics company or anything .ldquoThe opportunity is there to extend your business not so much into the final frontier, but into a new commercial frontier.Smith was part of the team that launched Skyrora, the rocket company based in Edinburgh, before setting up AstroAgency.

It features a mix of  discussions and networking and has attracted participants from around the world.The recent funding win from UKSA means the company can assist the Scottish Space Leadership Council, an outcome-led group that needs to evolve to meet the growing demands of the sector, to become a formalised entity, with the ultimate aim of connecting and promoting Scotlandrsquos fast-growing space ecosystem nationally and internationally.UK Science Minister Amanda Solloway said the funding would arm local leaders across the UK with the tools they need to put their local areas at the front of the commercial space race.UK Government Minister for Scotland Iain Stewart added: ldquoThe investment in Scottish projects will contribute to regional economic growth and support the development of the space industry across the country.The SSLC was formed in  as a voluntary, cross-sectoral representative organisation in response to the need for greater connection and collaboration within the Scottish and wider UK space community.Scottish Trade, Investment  Innovation Minister, Ivan McKee, said: ldquoThe SSLC, with strong support from the Scottish Government and its agencies, already plays an important role in the development of our growing space sector, most recently bringing together the developing spaceports across the UK to form the Spaceports Alliance.

At the moment, secondary legislation being developed as part of the Space Industry Act  has just gone through a critical period of consultation that will help to shape its effectiveness.The SSLC recently took the initiative to lead a consultation of the space sector on how to help achieve this ambition during a series of workshops.

North Uist intends to focus on launching sounding rockets. These typically carry instruments for data gathering and research for shorter duration sub-orbital flights.John Innes, chair of the Scottish Space Leadership Council, added: ldquoThe international race to build launch capability ahead of other global competitors is very much underway. The Spaceports Alliance will facilitate an inclusive, collaborative approach in order to navigate the sector through the challenges and opportunities posed by the prospect of UK launch in the very near future.The Alliance, which was mediated by the SSLC and endorsed by the UK Space Agency and Scottish Government, will allow Scotlandrsquos spaceports to accelerate the development of the UKrsquos launch infrastructure. Further developing launch sites across the UK, including Spaceport Cornwall, are expected to join the working group and broaden membership to a widerlevel.Collaborations like the UK Spaceports Alliance are vitalScotland is going to create a thriving NewSpace sector. The SSLCrsquos continuing mission is to enable and organise these collaborations on a UK level.To balance the needs of a thriving space sector with the need to protect the earth, the next set of initiatives the SSLC is planning is a series of environmental workshops in collaboration with the UK-wide partners.They aim to bring together industry, academia, and leading environmental groups to chart a more environmentally sustainable future for the sector and to explore ways to address specic environmental challenges together.-------------------------------------Eyes of the world are on us as country expands into lsquoNewSpacersquo marketThe Scottish space ecosystem is attracting attention from across the world according to one specialist firm.AstroAgency is a Scotland based space-focused strategic marketing company with international clients from as far afield as Canada and Florida.Founder Daniel Smith said companies across the continents were waking up to the potential of expanding into the lsquoNewSpacersquo market.Gore Space Centre of Excellence ndash W.

Although transfer tests start this weekend, no announcement was made on Monday night.With all non-essential retail already closed, and ato school for thousands of children delayed, the Executive’s lockdown options are limited.The most recent plan was for primary pupils to be taught remotely for the week from January -, while for secondary school Years  to , remote learning is due to last for the entire month. Sources on Monday night indicated there would be an extended period of remote learning until February.Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill said Health Minister Robin Swann and Education Minister Peter Weir would bring recommendations to an Executive meeting today about exams.Earlier, First Minister Arlene Foster had hinted at such a move.“If it’s the case that we need to close schools as we did in March last year I will deeply regret that,” she said. “But we will of course take whatever action is needed based on the medical evidence in front of us.”Boris Johnson’s announcement that pushing ahead with all exams in England this summer “as normal” would not be fair or possible also puts pressure on Mr Weir to postpone this weekend’s first transfer test for pupils hoping to attend grammar schools in Northern Ireland.Mrs O’Neill on Monday called for it to be abandoned. “The transfer tests should not proceed,” the Sinn Fein vice president said. “The Education Minister needs to act now.”It is understood that the two exams bodies that run the tests will make announcements on Tuesday. Mrs Foster said they were private bodies that make their own decisions, but will have to abide by health advice.Schools had already been advised by Mr Weir to have contingency plans ready should there be a need to cancel the tests.A Department of Education spokesperson said: “The minister has highlighted the need to ensure that all schools hosting the tests have carried out a full risk assessment and that the arrangements for the tests are compatible with public health guidance and public health legislation.“The minister has stressed that there cannot be any compromise to ensuring the safety of children and families.”But the Department added: “The minister has also highlighted the need for schools to ensure that contingency admissions criteria are in place in the event that entrance tests cannot be operated.”After his announcement on Monday night, the Prime Minister said the Government had been doing “everything in our power to keep schools open”.“The problem is not that schools are unsafe for children,” he said, adding that children are still very unlikely to be severely affected even by the new iant of Covid. But he said schools may act as “vectors for transmission”, causing the virus to spread.He added that all the devolved nations share his thoughts, and are taking similar steps.SDLP education spokesman Daniel McCrossan has now called on Mr Weir to follow suit.“The Prime Minister announced that all GCSE and A-Level exams have been cancelled in England,” he said.“It’s time Peter Weir made the same announcement and cancelled exams and the transfer test. The SDLP have been calling for exams to be cancelled for months. The minister must act.”Public sector union Nipsa last night called on Mr Weir to close schools “until they are safe”.Belfast Related Content\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_b-d-b-ae-ef_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_b-d-b-ae-ef_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_b-d-b-ae-ef_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_b-d-b-ae-ef_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_b-d-b-ae-ef_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"VideoCoronavirusCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Extended period of remote learning for schoolsThere will be an extended period of remote learning for schools in Northern Ireland, the Executive has said.

After the most dficult of  months, Jon Tonge rates our ministers.Arlene Foster: First MinisterThis was the First Minister#s best year in a while, although that may damn with faint praise.Mrs Foster got her job back, devolution was restored, she sailed through the RHI inquiry report and earned praise even beyond her community for Covid consistency.Then her party bizarrely forced a cross-community vote against lockdown before agreeing to tougher restrictions within a fortnight. That at least united lockdown zealots and sceptics in anger and bafflement.Brexit yielded an Irish Sea border, and many blamed the DUP as midwives of their misfortune.Arlene nonetheless celebrated five years as DUP leader, most spent not dealing with Sammy Wilson or Edwin Poots.She was also confronted by the biggest rebellion in DUP history as  MLAs refused to support their leader on the Executive Functions Bill.Yet all the endless talk of leadership challenges remains just that - chatter. Foster remains the undisputed leader of unionism as her beloved country enters its centenary. Michelle O#Neill: Deputy First MinisterPaid a price for attending what seems the longest funeral in history, given the arguments it still attracts.Having survived a curious party leadership challenge from John O#Dowd in , the Deputy First Minister began the year promisingly. Sinn Fein#s quiet compromise on a standalone Irish Language Act helped facilitate New Decade, New Approach and theof Stormont.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseMichelle O#NeillPA FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueMichelle O#Neill Via existing legislation, Irish language provision was to be extended and a dedicated commissioner appointedO#Neill#s party got most of what it wanted, on terms nonetheless acceptable to the DUP. O#Neill#s pronouncements on the need for an all-island strategy to deal with Covid made good sense. But at the end of June came that funeral furore. This extended even beyond those whose views on republican commitments to public safety were shaped by an earlier era.We did not really miss the joint briefings from the First and Deputy First Minister. Loveless marriages on public show are not a great watch. But their absence symbolised the void in joined-up government. And no one was surprised when Michelle found  reasons why she was unable to attend Arlene#s big centenary party next year.For the Deputy First Minister, the hope is to seize the main office in . Sinn Fein#s strong performances in the South increase expectations, and pressure, on its northern leader. Robin Swann: HealthThe lockdown king had a strong year, commanding respect across the political spectrum. LucidTalk surveys showed most of the public backed tough Covid restrictions. Swann immunised Northern Ireland from the wildlyoptimisticus virus strain offered by the Prime Minister.The Health Minister must have had moments of regret at choosing the one job more taxing than his former role leading the UUP. Still, such experience helped with the crisis management.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseRobin SwannMichael Cooper FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueRobin Swann Northern Ireland#s NHS crisis long pre-dated Covid, shocking testimony to the three-year absence of devolved government. Swann helped prevent total collapse and quickly settled the health workers# strike.Critics suggested Swann was optimism#s antidote. They criticised his early warning that , might die as alarmist, % beyond the actual toll. There remained concern over whether the Covid focus was at the expense of other treatments. Businesses raged against stop-start lockdowns. Van Morrison declined the invitation to the Swann Christmas household bubble. Ironically, Swann ended the year being criticised for being too soft in not imposing a travel ban from Britain.But overall, no one could accuse Swann of swerving science or ducking extraordinarily dficult challenges. Edwin Poots: AgricultureAppeared at times a masked version of Sammy Wilson in terms of lockdown scepticism and leadership challenges.In an extraordinary scientic breakthrough in October, Poots seemed to discover a mutant strain of the virus in which transmission in nationalist areas exceeded that in unionist communities by six to one.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseEdwin Poots FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueEdwin Poots When sticking to his agriculture brief, Poots is well regarded as a capable and often conciliatory minister who listens and engages. The DUP old-school veteran is on top of the issues and commands the respect of the farmers and the community he serves.Whatever Poots# aversion to some aspects of lockdown, there were no rule breaches amid the grief of the funeral of his father earlier this year.Ended a dficult year testing positive for Covid-. Peter Weir: EducationSometimes seemed so keen on keeping children in school at all costs you half-expected them to be in class on Christmas Day morning. But it#s a strange world when an Education Minister - or Under-fire Education Minister, to give Peter Weir his full title for most of the year - gets criticised for wanting children to go to school.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClosePeter Weir FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":truePeter Weir Arguments over transfer test locations at least deflectedfrom the age-old battle about the tests themselves. Public opinion is evenly ided. Those whose kids are most likely to pass are most in favour of the tests, funnily enough. Such arguments will persist long beyond the DUP minister#s tenure.An Arlene loyalist, Weir deserves credit for wanting to keep education as normal as possible. He recognised that remote learning experiences y wildly and disadvantage most those in greatest need. Nonetheless, January classes in school look unlikely.

Barman Andy Nutt is preparing to pour the last measure at the well-known local pub.Reporter: Liam Tunney::  Dec   addthis, Knobbsrsquo Tavern closed in March, just before the pandemic arrived. In the week leading up to its final hurrah, we caught up with barman Andy Nutt and a few regulars.A well-known County Derry pub that has been in operation since  will close its door for the final time on Thursday.Knobbs’ Tavern in Kildoag, between Claudy and Donemana, was originally a grocery store that serviced the local area, but the community it sustained has been shrinking.On Saturday, they held a packed farewell concert, and when the County Derry Post caught up with a few of the regulars on the Friday afternoon, they were in reflective mood.“We’ll miss the yarns and the company,” said previous owner, Jack Knobbs, who was perched at the corner of the bar with his dog, Honey.“It was originally what they call a licensed shop and the first time it was opened as a bar was in . Until , the shop was still here and the bar could only hold maybe seven or eight people.“It would have been mostly locals in the bar and then in  they built on the upstairs and it would have hosted a lot of music – mostly country and western music.” googletag.cmd.push Jack is quietly spoken but points me in the direction of black and white photographs on the wall, where he featured in the Kildoag Wanderers FC side and the local cricket team in a previous era.Both teams used the bar as their base, and the social aspect the rural pub brought to the area is something Jack feels will be greatly missed.“The place would have been packed out on a Saturday night – people would have come from Donemana, Waterside and Claudy for the music.“We just enjoyed the craic. You had the odd tall story told. It’s hard to beat a good story, evenit’s not true!”Mervyn McComb lays claim to being the bar’s oldest customer. “I’ve been coming here about  years,” boasts the -year-old. googletag.cmd.push  “I was in it when the old bar was in the other room. Then, when they opened up the lounge, the place was packed to the rafters. “A lot of old bars seem to be closing up, there’s not the customers there used to be. It’s going to be badly missed. “It’s local people that come here.”Right on cue, a loud cheer erupts from the men as another regular walks into the bar, while Ian informs me the bar has its own taxi driver in residence.Barman Andy Nutt prepares to explain further. He mutes the small television mounted above the bar. This is serious stuff now.“There were six women arrived from Cumbria in England on a Tuesday night. They were on a biking tour and on their way to Park.“They came in and asked to use the toilet and I said that was no bother at all. One of them askedthis was a bar and I said it’s been called many things, but you could definitely call it a bar.“She askedthere was any chance they could have a drink and to cut a long story short, they ended up leaving the bikes here!“They stayed all night so I said I would get them a taxi man to get them back to Park. I rung up Eddie Curry and askedhe could do a run.“Eddie said ‘I’m definitely not going to Park’. Then I told him it was six women and he asked what time I wanted him down!     “I got a text from them that evening then – I think they were in Portrush.“It said: Andy, no Guinness at pound., no gin and tonic at pound. – we shouldn’t have left you!”The tale is typical of the kind of comical, slightly embellished yarns that used to be commonplace in bars across the country, but rural decline is threatening to silence them.Mervyn McComb’s son, Ian, believes that people make the bar what it is.“It’s a good wee bar, with great people in it,” he says. “There were memorable nights here every weekend. It was always good craic.“There used to be bands in upstairs and the place would have been jammed. It always did a good trade, was well run and there was never any trouble. “I’m  now so I’ve been coming here maybe  years. It will be sorely missed and it’ll hurt the community.”The range of presentation cheques that adorn the bar’s walls give an indication of how the community will suffer without its hub. Each year, the bar ran a charity drive and the evidence of their impact is clear in the many comments left on social media following news of Knobbs’ closure. Nicola Doherty fondly recalled a vintage tractor rally held at Knobbs’ after her father had beaten cancer.She commented: “We held our first tractor run in there when my dad beat cancer and bought a vintage tractor. “We hoped for a few tractors to show up and to raise a couple of hundred, but the place was packed, and we raised pound, for the Sperrin Room. “Great memories, I’m sad to see it close the doors.”The doors will indeed close, but Saturday night’s punters were treated to the nostalgic sight of the rafters reverberating to the sound of the Father and Son Remo band in the lounge above. There is a black cat that Jack Knobbs says follows him to and from his house to the bar on every visit.It sits almost sentry-like on the windowsill outside Knobbs.On a bright summer’s afternoon, Jack’s feline companion would be treated to a breathtaking view of the Faughan valley, but on Knobbs’ farewell night, Storm Jorge’s wind and rain battered its weary walls.The storm will have calmed by Thursday, as Andy Nutt prepares to close the doors. There is no doubt that Jack Knobbs will be there to oversee what will be an emotional moment.Knobbs concedes to the march of time.“I’m just a customer now,” says the former owner.“Sometimes I sit too long.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Until now. Liam Tunney talks to an ex-member of the infamous Gorilla Gang, who were responsible for many a headache at Slaughtneil discoThe Slaughtneil GAC committee used to meet every Monday evening. The meeting was supposed to be a general meeting about club business, but usually got bogged down with the disco. Discussions often revolved around two groups of boisterous young men in particular – the Gorilla Gang from Draperstown and the Banana Gang of Bellaghy. The latter were set up in reaction to the former, whose name was notorious around south Derry throughout the s. “The name was actually originally meant to be ‘Guerrilla Gang’,” an ex-member told the County Derry Post. “About  or , things were getting hot and heavy and the likes of Ballinascreen was getting saturated by the British Army. googletag.cmd.push “There would have been fighting with the UDR or the Brits, andthey came into Draperstown, the Gorilla Gang would have gathered up a posse and put them out. “There were two or three gangs in Draperstown at that time. One of them was the Wombles and the other one was the Sixtown Clowns. “They all used to fight amongst each other at small discos that used to be on round Draperstown before Slaughtneil started. “The police knew about the Gorilla Gang. I had a few older brothers that went to Spain, and on their way home they were pulled in at London airport and quizzed about the gang!” googletag.cmd.push As the disco’s popularity began to grow, the three gangs soon set their grievances aside as the possibility of taking their local scuffles to a wider field presented itself. “The disco took in the whole of south Derry, so there was more boys to fight with outside your own town,” he recalled. “It was just like that at those times around dance halls. In the early s, before Slaughtneil, the older Gorilla Gang would all have been over in Dungiven fighting at the Castle. “There were a wile lot of boys in the Gorilla Gang that were mad for fighting, and then everyone started making up their own gangs to fight us.     “I think that’s where the Banana Gang came out of, that they were going to get the Gorilla Gang at Slaughtneil. “I think the Banana Gang gave the Wombles and the Sixtown Clowns a bad beating one night and then they didn’t want to go anymore. “Well, they were mad to go, but they couldn’t because they were scared of the Banana Gang. They came to the Gorilla Gang and askedthey could join up.” The merger prompted a rivalry that lasted throughout the late s and caused the Slaughtneil bouncers no end of trouble. Our ex-member feels that the gangs’ propensity for bravado and fisticuffs helped boost the crowds that flocked to the hall on a Friday night. “Four carloads of us would leave the town to go down to Slaughtneil. We didn’t chance taking the bus, becauseyou were fighting, the bus driver wouldn’t let you on,” he said. “I remember going down to Slaughtneil and being told these Banana Gang boys were gonna be there, and two nights in a row, we went down, and they weren’t there. “The third night we went down, we thought they weren’t turning up, so maybe only five or ten of us went and we got some beating from the Banana Gang that night – they all turned up! “God help them bouncers. I don’t think Slaughtneil would have been Slaughtneil without it. Everybody was going, girls and all, to see what was going to happen next week. “If there was a small scuffle in the car park, threats were made about who was going to be there next week that wasn’t there tonight.  The characters’ nicknames roll off the ex-member’s tongue. Bungle. Flan. Rocky. Numan. Turk. Goggles. Nelly. Bruce. Shiny, who ‘couldn’t beat eggs’ but drove the getaway car. The King, who would run out onto the pitch and shout, ‘I’m the King of the Gorillas and I eat bananas for breakfast’ before a dust-up. Johnny the Donkey, who played the role of negotiator when the gangs were thrown out of the car park and arranged to meet halfway between Draperstown and Bellaghy to finish it off. An eclectic mix, but one name resonated more than others. “Flathead was the feared name. He was a real tight boy, he would have fought anybody man to man,” he said. “We would have said, ‘you boys will be in trouble next week, we’re taking big Flathead with us’, and everybody would have been at Slaughtneil the next week for the big punch up outside! “Even the bouncers were a wee bit scared of big Flathead because he was big for his age. There were some characters about.” While the rivalry between the two gangs was intense, it never created any lasting grudges and the member recalled how, by chance, he encountered one of his nemeses years later. “I hadn’t seen this boy for years, until I was going along one day in the car through Rocktown and heading for Bellaghy,” he said. “I saw a man walking along the road in the pouring rain and I stopped to seehe wanted a lt. “He hopped in anyway and was talking away to me and when he was getting out of the car, whatever way he turned sideways I recognised him. He caught on then to who I was too. “We were good friends at school, but then he was in the Banana Gang and I didn’t really want to let him know that I wanted to kill him, and he didn’t want to let me know either!” Time and people move on. The exploits of the Gorilla Gang may seem shocking when viewed through a st century lens, but our ex-member says it was a dferent era. “When I look back, I never knew of a man being hurt badly. When I hear the gang mentioned, it makes me laugh,” he said. “There were no mobile phones, no fancy cars. Anybody that had a car, it had cost them maybe pound. That whole thing is just lost. “I know it wasn’t good going to all them dance halls and fighting, but at the same time, no one was doing drugs or anything, it was just a punch-up. “Just a locka lads with a few beers in them, that fell out with another group of lads and there were a load of myths and legends that never even happened. “There were a few nights when I was younger that I maybe woke up in the morning with a black eye and a cut forehead and I said to myself, ‘oh my God, what am I at ’, but apart from that, I’ve no regrets. “We were all young cubs. Apart from the odd bleeding mouth and a bust lip, there wasn’t much harm done.” “God help them bouncers, those men got some torturing! Them boys did some organising to keep that all going. “For a club on top of a mountain, they did well to actually get people to get up there. There’s not even a pub.” It’s unlikely south Derry will ever see the likes of the Gorilla Gang again, but their mention invokes howls of recognition and intrigue. With a chuckle no doubt brought on by the memory of discos past, the ex-member had one idea that might have some under lockdown pining for its end. “I couldn’t say that I’ve any enemies out of it, put it like that. If we could get a Banana Gang-Gorilla Gang reunion night gathered up, I’d say we could have a good laugh!” See also: If you build it, they will come: Slaughtneils field of dreamers Spinning the soundtrack to a timeless era South Derrys ballroom of romance The goose that laid the golden egg Bringing Muhammad to the south Derry mountains The night a TV star came to Slaughtneil  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Joe Cassidy and captain Ciaran McNally took Michael McMullan on an wander into the past... Twelve years before helping Cathal Scullion to strike gold in an Ulster Club final, Joe Cassidy was setting up goals. This time, in the colours of Ballynease PS. A week after losing the  Castle Cup final, by virtue of a last minute goal, to a Johnny McBride and Bosco ONeill inspired Moneymore, the sides met again. googletag.cmd.push The shoe was on the other foot this time. Only a goal would save Bellaghy, thought Cassidy as he stood over the late free. With the benefit of hindsight, only Ronaldo would have found the net from the environs of right wing. Ciaran McNally began his run from full-back. He took a complete gamble. “I just swung at er with an auld scuffed box, and she fell into the net,” laughs McNally, who was the teams goalkeeper  months earlier.  Joe Cassidy and Ciaran McNally celebrate success with Ballynease PS This was the start of McNally and Cassidys winning run. They were on Bellaghys Ulster minor winning team six years later. Under McBrides captaincy, the Bellaghy duo played for Derry in the  All-Ireland minor final defeat to Westmeath. googletag.cmd.push By that time, Cassidy had secured the first of six senior medals as a list for the  win, which ended Bellaghys eight year absence from the pinnacle of Derry football. McNally had to wait until his debut year of  for senior glory and he would pick up four more championships and captain them to Ulster glory. “The best team, more often than not, always wins the championship,” Cassidy begins. “We had two dferent Ulster minor winning teams– two complete new sets of players.” Sam Maguire winners Karl Diamond, Danny Quinn and Joes older brother Damian were also to the fore.     “There was the likes of Gerry McPeake, Seamus Birt, Damian Brown and Benny Lee, boys that had a bit of experience.” The pieces of the puzzle were slotting into place to rule the Derry club scene. ---- Kilmacud Crokes goalkeeper Mick Penders late penalty save, from Damian Cassidy, denied the Tones a second All-Ireland on St Patricks Day , but after going on to dominate the race for the John McLaughlin Cup, Crossmaglen became their nemesis in Ulster. “They beat us in and . Both times, there wasnt the kick of a ball between the two teams,” McNally outlines. The  All-Ireland final, between Dublin and Galway, was the video of choice on the Bellaghy bus as they headed to their  Ulster semi-final date with Enniskillen. The irony wasnt lost on Joe Cassidy. Dublin had three men sent off, including then Derry senior boss Brian Mullins. Later that afternoon, Bellaghy also finished with  men as they bowed out of Ulster. “In those first four of five years, we got to Ulster finals and semi-finals regularly,” McNally adds. Without an Ulster title, Bellaghy were going to underachieve, he remembers thinking at the time. Joe Cassidys thoughts also flash back to the  final and having it won until John McEntees late equaliser. In the replay, Bellaghy were also a point up going into injury time. Cassidy remembers Damians free dropping in around the Crossmaglen square. If they even had kicked the ball dead the title was theirs, he laments. “The ball got played out to the wing to Oisin McConville and he ran about  yards,” Joe adds. “With hindsight, the best thing wouldve been to do a Sean Cavanagh and pull him down....wed have been Ulster champions.” Three passes later, Cathal Short – who played on the same UUJ Freshers team as Cassidy and Gareth Doherty months earlier– slid the ball past Kevin ONeill and Cross were on their way to their first All-Ireland. Lavey knocked Bellaghy out of the  championship, before Seamus Birt and Colm McElwee took charge at the start of a three year stint that brought three league and championship doubles. For, Joe Cassidy,  was their best chance of winning an All-Ireland. By , Paul Diamond – who Cassidy rates as one of the best he played with – was out of favour. Gone was the experience of Danny Quinn and Damian Cassidy. “For us, hewas a leader. He was one of those boys I loved playing with, he could hit you with a pass from about  yards away and not all midfielders had the ability to do that. Damian was the same. You just needed to make a half a step and Damian had the ball popped in your hand.” After a comfortable win over Lavey in the  county final, Bellaghy were back knocking on Crossmaglens door in the Ulster final, but super-sub Michael Moley scored the winner. Ballinderry qualied for the final the following year, after beating Lavey out the gate at Bellaghy. Joe Cassidy, who was stewarding at the game, remembers Conleith Gilligans fist pump towards a vocerous Shamrocks support after being replaced late in the game – as a bring on Bellaghy type salute. “That county final was one of my favourite ones. It was at Ballinascreen and it was on a Sunday night. There was an unreal atmosphere and a young group ofboys brought flares. “I remember walking behind the band...McNally and dferent boys were giving Gilligan a few welcome messages, so they were. Louis McPeake scored Bellaghys goal but they needed points from man of the match Damian Cassidy and Gavin Diamond to seal victory. That season ended with that defeat by Enniskillen. Without the elusive Ulster title, Bellaghys dinner dance in Arbys the following February was like a ghost town, Cassidy remembers. “Even though we had won the league and championship double...because you had done so bad in Ulster, it nearly looked like a bad year. There was a real dead atmosphere. “Youre expectations were to win an Ulster and, after seeing what Crossmaglen had done, the ultimate was to win an All-Ireland.” Despite a winning start to the  season, Bellaghy werent firing on all cylinders. Danny Quinn was player coach and was taking  percent of the training.  Ulster Club Champions  “Mammawas manager. You would land at training and everything was organsied, so he had those traits,” stated Cassidy. “Before that era , training was pretty pre-historic. My first innovator with training was Henry Downey at school. In around the club scene, Dannybegan to innovate things, he was coming off the back of county level. Mickey Moran came on board as Bellaghys trainer later in the summer, following Sligos exit out west. “That sortve gave us the kick up the backside that we needed, with someone of Mickeys level coming in. His training was top drawer.” One of Ciaran McNallys recollections of their Ulster winning campaign was how damn lucky they were to even get to Clones. The wheels almost coming off the wagon against Lavey in Greenlough. “It was a one or two point game, with a few minutes to go,” McNally remembers, when a loose ball pinged around in the Bellaghy penalty area. “I think it even hit the post and was heading across the line. All anybody had to do was get a toe to it and we were gone, then we ended up winning Ulster.”Joe Cassidy goes past Martin Calf in the  Ulster Club final. A six point win over Loup didnt satisfy the Bellaghy fans who now had lofty expectations. “People around the town were taking it for granted that wed beat the Loup and we, as players, could feel that, McNally continues, knowing it was going to be a battle. “I remember getting slated after it and people were saying youse were terrible and I remember saying....we won.” There was a draw with Slaughtneil in semi-final before Fergal Doherty, in his second senior season, hammered over a point in the early stages of the replay. “He would have been nervous in around the changing room, he was young at the time,” his captain outlines. “I remember the roar and relief from himand it was great from our respective.” The final was another showdown with their rivals Ballinderry again. It was a damp squib. Both McNally and Cassidy acknowledge almost falling over the line in a - to - victory. “Somebody needs to just stop that man,” McNally remembers thinking as the Shamrocks defensive rock Niall McCusker ferried the ball from corner back, up the wing before his diagonal ball went out for a . “The ball then came in, dropped short and we cleared it. Then came the relief with the final whistle.” ---- With three-in-a-row now secure, Bellaghy needed a win over Castledawson to keep their league hopes intact but an ankle ligament injury sustained in that game put Joe Cassidys Ulster club hopes in doubt. Bellaghy received a bye in the first round of Ulster, following Cargins suspension dished out after their final with arch-rivals St Pauls. Cassidy came on as a sub late in their semi-final victory over Cavan champions Gowna, who Bellaghy also met on their way to the  title. On the other side of the draw, Castleblayney disposed of Crossmaglen in the quarter-final before falling to Errigal Ciaran. “I had an idea ...you dont break up a winning team and we had played well in the semi-final,” Cassidy admits. Bellaghy won the toss and elected to play against the breeze. Bellaghy owned the ball in the first half but a litany of wides saw them trail - to - at the break. Peter Canavan had fired over the bar for the games first score, but never got a kick off David ONeill who dominated the Tyrone legend in the air. Cassidys worst nightmare was being paired off against Neilly in training games. “Between him and Sean Marty , I dont know how many roastings I got over the years.” Birt gave Cassidy the nod to warm up at the interval and six minutes into the second half, he entered the fray. “I was coming in fresh and the first ball I got, I turned and fired this thing over the bar from  yards. You looked like a super player but the breeze was carrying it.” Bellaghys defence, which included man of the match Peter Diamond, held Errigal scoreless for a full  minutes until Mark Hartes consolation goal in stoppage time. Six minutes before that, Cathal Scullions goal put the game to bed and Bellaghy could savour the march to glory. “Karl Diamond put the ball into the corner,” Cassidy recalls, with the help of watching the game again in his father Dan Joes Ballynease museum of GAA. “Gavin Diamond came off the shoulder, I flicked it to Gavin and it became a two versus one. He put it into Chubberwho put it into the back of the net.” Cassidy and McNally, interviewed separately, both speak with a laugh of Scullion swinging his jersey over his head in celebration. “I will never forget Peter Docon the terrace, jumping up and down. At that stage, you knew you had it. There is no better feeling when you have trained your whole le to try and win something,” Cassidy enthused. For McNally, it was always about learning from defeats and the steeliness it helps to generate. “I always tell people its not all badit makes you come back the following year that bit more determined.” It took Scullions goal to cement the result. Some years later, Ciaran lost his fatherand mothersuddenly but he clearly remembers his father telling of the sheer joy on the Clones steps, as Bellaghy eventually ended their Ulster losing streak. “The supporters were so disappointed in previous years. To have that picture in your head, of us being home and hosed, it was special.” At the final whistle, McNally embraced goalkeeper Ciaran Donnelly before being whisked off to the presentation area by an Ulster Council official. After years in the Ulster wilderness, the Tones skipper stood alone, before bellowing into the microphone to urge the throngs of joyous royal blue clad players and fans to join him. McNally didnt tempt fate. No speech was prepared, but two things came flooding back. He firstly made sure to commiserate with Errigal Ciaran. He knew the drill, having had one hand and four fingers of the other on the Seamus McFerran Cup before McEntee, Moley and Short – on three separate occasions - pulled it out of Bellaghys grasp. He also had a sincere word of thanks for Seamus Birt and Colm McElwee who took an awful lot of abuse following defeats to Cross and Enniskillen. “I hope you are as quick to come forward and thank them,” McNally told the Bellaghy faithful. “They done a lot of work, won us three-in-a-row and an Ulster.” Following the customary post game meal in Paudge Quinns restaurant, the team bus – rocking from the sing-song inside – rolled into the middle of Bellaghy. The players marched up to Muldoons shop and back to the Diamond, before heading to the club to celebrate long into the night. “Those are the nights you will never forget,” Cassidy insists. “There is no tomorrow, just endless partying, craic and everybody is in good form. There is something special about waking up the morning after a club final. There is no hangover, you just cant wait to get to speaking to people and meeting your family.”  Ciaran McNally rasies the Seamus McFerran aloft in the Clones tunnel. His younger brother Ryanlooks on. In the All-Ireland semi-final, they were defeated by eventual winners Crossmolina. It was an emotion Bellaghy knew only too well. Crossmaglen , Ballinderry and St Galls also beat the Tones on their way to lting the Andy Merrigan Cup. Patrick McAndrews goal gave the Mayo men a - to - interval lead. With eight minutes to go, two Gavin Diamond points had the margin down to two points before Ciaran McDonald was sprung from the bench. “He was carrying an ankle injury, but the next thing he came on and fired over a couple of absolute reevers and they beat us by four,” states Joe Cassidy, who one of Bellaghys only two scorers that day. Later that night, in the wee small hours, Ciaran McNally sat out on the swing in the family garden. Staring into oblivion, until the birds began to chirp. It was time to reflect. “I just couldnt go into the house,” he said. Despite people trying to soften the blow earlier in the night, McNally knew it was going to be a long way back. For Cassidy, he feels he speaks for everyone of that era - highlighting the regret of not winning an All-Ireland. “After that, managers came in and tried things and what youll find is...managers will generally get the blame, iniably from players – and I include myself in that,” Cassidy said. “It is only with experience and hindsight, you realise it had f**k all to do with management. It was to do with hunger and lots of us were making excuses.” Ballinderry beat them in , a final Bellaghy played better than their grind a year previous. First round defeats at the hands of the Shamocks and Glenullin prevented them from getting back to a decider until Slaughtneil beat them in the  final. Under the tutelage of Damian Cassidy, they realised that John McLaughlin wasnt a million miles away again. “One of his main attributes as a manager is his ability to get best that he can out of squads. Every night at training, he challenged you, states Joe, who was top scorer in the  championhship. Their - to - win over Loup in  took Bellaghy to  on the roll of honour. It was followed up by an Ulster win in Crossmaglen but that was the last hurrah in the winners enclosure. St Galls, with future Bellaghy boss John Rafferty at the helm beat them in an Ulster final. “Money couldnt buy what I got out of it,” McNally sums up of his career. “The only travesty about it is that you get too far down the line before you realise it. It was taken for granted.” “You see things now, with families all gathered aroundtaking photos...we didnt do that because we thought thats the way it was.” Its a regret. McNally got his hands on championship silver in four of the first five years of his senior career. “If I had a few lean years before it, you maybe wouldve knew to appreciate it,” he concludes. When Joe Cassidys lofted ball landed in the Moneymore goalmouth all those years ago and McNallys fisted goal brought silverware back to Ballynease, it was only the beginning of a journey to the steps of the Gerry Arthurs stand...a day when Bellaghy were kings of Ulster.

Michael OKane took on the role at St Colmcilles Primary School in Claudy after Easter this year, with schools already closed by the first Covid- lockdown. He was nominated for the award by parent Fiona Garrett, who told presenter Stephen Nolan that Mr OKane had helped her children with two particularly tricky transitions. “My son Matthew was transitioning from P to big school and my daughter Oacuterlagh-Janetransitioning from nursery to P,” she said. “My daughter has a statement of special educational needs. During lockdown, she became very distressed at the sudden change of routine and Mr OKane really helped with this. googletag.cmd.push “He did this by doing videos to show her where her new classroom was going to be, what it would look like, who her new classroom assistant was going to be and how to sanitise your hands properly. “He also helped my son with the P leaving transition. My son started becoming distressed at not seeing his friends and the fact they wouldnt get a last opportunity to all be together. “Mr OKane arranged a wonderful Year  leaving mass, where he shot a beautul photo and video of the group together with his drone. “Matthews short, but positive experience of Mr OKane actually inspired him to want to become a teacher now.” googletag.cmd.push Miss Garrett said Mr OKane had gone beyond the call of duty to make sure parents were looked after too, and said he was a special person. “He is so good with children who have special educational needs. He goes above and beyond, going that extra little step just to make everything run smoothly. That takes a special person,” she said. “He goes out of his way to be so approachable and friendly. “Hes in the thick of it with the children, showing them how to use their talents and getting the best out of everyone, including his staff. “He really cares for his school family. Absolutely anything is possible with the right support and Im so grateful.”     Michael admitted it was a shock to receive a call from Stephen Nolan, initially askinganything was wrong, but he regained his composure to pay tribute to the schools staff. “I only started here at Easter and I inherited a fantastic school with fantastic staff and I dont think Ive done too much myself – everybody in the school has really pulled together,” he said. “Im just looking out the window here on a dreary Monday morning and thats the sort of thing we need to hear. Im in shock here, but Id just like to thank the staff, and in particular Fionas childrens teachers. “Theres a fantastic team in Year  who made children feel comfortable in coming back to school. “Its been tough, but everybody has gone above and beyond from teachers, classroom assistants, our building supervisors and cleaners. “Im going to relay this to all the staff because it will lt everybodys spirits,” he added.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Foyle MLA said: “The past year has been hugely damaging for all sports, given the loss of gate receipts and other revenues. “Having two soccer federations on an island this size never made commercial or sporting sense and there had already been signicant support, North and South, for existing proposals to create an all-island structure. googletag.cmd.push “However, in the wake of the Covid pandemic and the impact it has had on the game, more and more soccer clubs are assessing their long-term sustainability and finding that the appeal of an all-Ireland league is obvious. “Structured proposals are already in place and signicant progress has been made regarding potential sponsorship of an all-island league. “It is also abundantly clear from the success of other all-Ireland sports such as rugby, boxing, golf, GAA, hockey and cricket that we can achieve great things when we work on an all-island basis. “This should not be a politically sensitive issue but rather one of what makes best economic and sporting sense to soccer clubs throughout the island. googletag.cmd.push That is the basis on which we will pursue our discussions with the minister and as we continue to progress this issue in the time ahead.”      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Eileen received the vaccine from Dr Michael McKenna at her local GP surgery on the Falls Road, Belfast. The rollout of the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine follows approval from the Medicines  Healthcare products Regulatory Agencylast week and paves the way for a signicant acceleration of Northern Ireland’s vaccination programme. Speaking at the vaccination clinic, Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride said: “Today marks the first phase of our population vaccination programme and is a positive step forward. The vaccine programme will transform the situation but as always we must all remain patient. googletag.cmd.push “First and foremost we must act to protect those most at risk of severe disease and death. As approved by the MHRA and recommended by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisationprioritisation will be given to those aged  years and over. The programme will then be rolled out based on age and other clinical vulnerability factors.” The JCVI has recently updated its guidance and has recommended that as many people on the JCVI priority list as possible should be offered a first vaccine dose as the initial priority. Dr McBride said: “The evidence has very clearly shown that both the Pfizer BioNTech and the Oxford Astra Zeneca vaccines provide very high levels of protection after the first dose. googletag.cmd.push Providing that level of protection on a large scale will have the greatest impact on reducing death and hospitalisations, protecting the Health and Social Care system. It is the right thing to do for the public health.” Speaking after receiving her vaccine, Eileen said: “I am delighted and privileged to receive the Covid vaccine today. I feellikeI can really look forward to the year ahead now that I have been vaccinated. The nurses, doctors and staff have all been brilliant today so I would also like to say thank you to them.” Dr McKenna said: “We are very pleased to get this vaccination programme started for this vulnerable group of people.     Many of this group will have been virtually housebound since the start of the pandemic so today’s vaccinations are very welcome. I, like other GP practices, look forward to vaccinating more of my patients who are  or over in the coming weeks, moving on thereafter to other patient groups.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Students save a considerable amount of time by using the laneway to get to and from school.The former Down Council attempted to secure funds to upgrade the laneway and carry out a much-needed resurfacing and lighting scheme but liaising with representatives from a number of statutory agencies including the Housing Executive and Roads Service, the ownership issue could not be firmly established.Describing the laneway as a ldquovital link for residents who live at the Langley Road area in particular, Cllr Walker hopes that, with the publicrsquos help, he can find out who owns the land.ldquoThere are several street lights along part of the laneway but the Department for Infrastructure insists that it is not responsible for the land, he said.Cllr Walker says it is necessary to find out who owns the laneway as work is starting to upgrade Ballynahinchrsquos masterplan which includes a number of new walking trails in and around the town.ldquoWhy not include Beedhamrsquos Lane in the planned trails andwe could find out who this piece of ground it could pave the way for its upgrade, he continued.ldquoPeople could be forgiven for thinking that it leads to a farm. Given that we are in the midst of winter, the laneway is an awful state and children who are walking to school are literally getting covered in mud.Cllr Walker has suggested that it would not cost a signicant sum of money to upgrade the laneway which he suggests has the potential to become a key component of the townrsquos planned new walking trails.ldquoIf anyone can help me identy who is responsible for this piece of land could they contact either myself, the Langley Road Residentsrsquo Association or Newry, Mourne and Down Council, he said.Cllr Walker added: ldquoThe upgrade of this particular laneway has been raised on numerous occasions in the past, but nothing has ever been done.ldquoGiven the high volume of pedestrian traffic which uses it, itrsquos important work gets underway to upgrade it.ldquoIn seeking to find out who owns the laneway I hope that it can be determined of this particular piece of ground is a registered right of way..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd December 2020 Caldwell.jpg","title":"Caldwell’s goal seals cup win  ","story":"DOWNrsquoS U- hurlers will have cause to celebrate Christmas with a little more cheer after they clinched the Peadar Oacute Laithaacutein Cup with a two-point win over Meath in Navan on Sunday.Two minutes into injury time, and with the sides deadlocked at - apiece, it looked aswe were heading to extra time when Ryan Byas struck over a wonderful m sideline.Meath looked to have sealed victory from a doggedly tough Down side with virtually the last play of the contest.However, straight from the resulting puck-out Michael Dorrian raced clear of midfield and floated the sliotar towards the edge of the box.Francis Caldwell reached highest and as he slipped past both Cottrell and Ennis in defence.A deftly-placed one handed flick out-foxed Jack Fagan as he lunged out to intercept the sliotar. He could only watch on but as it bypassed his attempts and nestled in the back of the Meath net.Finn Turpin opened the day with the first score of the game inside a minute. Downrsquos captain, Tom McGrattan, knocked over a free a minute later, but by the end of the first quarter Meath were in front as midfielder Joey Cole got the next three scores.McGrattan levelled matters from play shortly afterwards, as both defences were kept busy.On several occasions in the first half, Down threatened the Meath rearguard as goal chances went begging with James Clarke, Michael Dorrian and Caldwell all having attempts saved, blocked or bundled away from danger.Down struggled in the middle of the park and found it hard to win any puck-outs against a physically strong Meath team.They did though throw themselves into every tackle. Jarlath McCollum, Deaglan Mallon and James Higgins played out of their skins, harrying, hustling and shutting down any potential danger as Meath tried in vain to breach the Down defence.A McGrattan free and a Caldwell point saw Down edge into a two-point lead in a very scrappy final ten minutes of the half.With less than three minutes to the whistle, Meath hit a purple patch with four unanswered scores, two courtesy of the dangerous Ryan Byas and the others from corner men Rory Fagan and Josh Harris.Playing with a slight breeze in the first half, Meath knew thatthey were to ensure a victory on home soil, they would surely need some daylight between themselves and their northern opponents before the change of ends.Thankfully for Down, Turpin, Dorrian and Clarke kept Meath on their toes as they eventually managed to engineer the last score of the half.Oisiacuten Coulter popped the sliotar over from out near the side-line to leave just two points between the sides at the end of the half.Within the opening two minutes of the restart, Oisiacuten Coulter continued a good vain of form and had the sides level for the fth time, as both sides refused to yield.Joey Cole pointed four minutes later as the Royals introduced Matthew Cully to full forward, his introduction would breathe new le into their attack.Down initially struggled to handle the burly full forward, who ended the day with three superbly-taken points whilst under severe pressure from their Ulster counterparts.The lead changed hands again as two McGrattan frees and a Michael Dorrian point gave them a slight edge with the game fast approaching the second water break.A Jack Meagher score, followed swtly by Matthew Cullyrsquos first of the day, when he picked Downrsquos pocket after a quick puck-out had failed to reach its intended target, shook Down. Instead of leading going down the home straight, it was level at - each.With  minutes played Denis Darby won a sideline for the home side and when Byas hit the sweetest of strikes straight over Pearse Smythrsquos crossbar there were scenes of jubilation and euphoria from the Meath bench as surely it looked asJustin Coyne would be presented with the cup.Sean Young had this young Down side well drilled and it was a credit to the teamrsquos spirit that within the next  seconds Downrsquos goal machine, Francis Caldwell ensured that it would be a victory for Down in the strangest of seasons five days before Christmas.After seeing Tom McGrattan lt the cup, a delighted Young was magnanimous in victory and praised Meath for the high standard of Hurling that made this contest such a thriller.ldquoWe knew coming into the game today this would be a very dferent challenge than last week, he said.ldquoMeath are always a big strong physical side with a spread of talented Hurlers in their ranks. We knew it wasnrsquot going to be easy to play them in their back yard, it was going to be a monumental task to get over the line.ldquoI thought the game was nip and tuck in the first quarter as our main objective was not to concede any early goals playing against a stf breeze in the first half. I canrsquot praise the boys enough, our bench helped us over the line and it was a superbly taken goal from Francis.Meath: J Fagan, R Ennis, H Cottrell, E Cole, P Connelly, J Coyne, K OrsquoGorman, J Cole , E Grehan, R Byas , J Meagher , S Donnelly, R Fagan , J Harris, S Cunningham .Subs: M Cullyfor Harris, E McCormack for Donnelly, D Darby for Cunningham.Down: P Smyth, J Higgins, D Mallon, J McCollum, N Kelly, C Savage, F McFall, R OrsquoNeill, J Duggan, F Turpin , T McGrattan , M Dorrian , O Coulter , J Clarke, F Caldwell .Subs: S Milliganfor OrsquoNeill, F MacManus for McGrattan..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd December 2020 Castlewellan.jpg","title":"Castlewellan woman’s releases debut children’s book  ","story":"A CASTLEWELLAN woman has joined the ranks of childrenrsquos book authors.Kathleen McPolin, who is a Speech and Language Therapy Assistant in Downpatrick SureStart, has just published the first in an exciting new series featuring the farm-based adventures of Boomer and Blanky.Produced by Shanway Press in Belfast, the books are aimed at encouraging early yearsrsquo interest in reading and promote new vocabulary.Part of Kathleenrsquos work with SureStart over the past  years has been helping to facilitate rhythm, rhyme, and story sessions each week for children - with their parents or s.ldquoBecause this age group have short attention spans, I find the books that really capture their attention are the colourful ones with few words but yet have a story to tell, explained Kathleen.After finding it dficult to get the right books to cover everyday topics such as transport, weather, clothes, and food in a short-story style, Kathleen decided to create her own.ldquoChildren love to see the same characters appear regularly in their books. They become familiar with the characters and enjoy the new vocabulary in each story. My stories are intentionally short with the aim of retaining the childrsquos interest.ldquoThe language is at the childrsquos level, Kathleen continued. ldquoI have used repetitive language because this is a great way to encourage early words and sounds.

On the side of a rural road, devoid of street lights, all but hidden by trees, was an old fashioned car, with smoke escaping from its engine.Standing beside the car, kicking it was a young woman in a bridal dress. She appeared to be beating up the motor. Jim applied the brakes of his vehicle and rolled down the window.lsquoCan I help rsquo The young woman looked at him with burning blue eyes, turned away and thumped the boot. lsquoUseless piece of junk,rsquo she shrieked. The young woman attempted to give the car one last kick, missed and ped with a thud on to her rear. Jim got out of his car. Trying not to laugh he rushed over to the young woman and attempted to help her to her feet.She pulled her arm away and with an effort dragged herself up using the carrsquos half open door.

The lady could not walk to her own wedding, besides it was growing dark. She grabbed his coat in near panic. lsquoMy ring,rsquo she cried. lsquoIrsquove lost my engagement ring!rsquo She dropped on to her knees. lsquoThis is a nightmare and you are not helping.rsquoJim walked at speed to his car and grabbed a torch as the bride crawled around the ground, feeling the earth in a vain attempt to retrieve the ring. Jim ed and shone the torch about the trees and grass. She grabbed his leg and pointed towards her car.lsquoItrsquos cursed, the car is cursed, and so are you.rsquo She bit him on the knee. lsquoGet off me,rsquo he shouted. She sat back on a muddy mound. lsquoI may have overreacted,rsquo she said. lsquoIs my lipstick smudged rsquo She wiped her hand across her lips. rsquoI think it might be smudged.rsquoJim did not answer, choosing to rub his knee, shine the torch, find the ring and hightail it to his unclersquos house as fast as possible. lsquoItrsquos all go,rsquo she said, trying to make conversation. lsquoIf my father could see me now, he would be so proud.rsquo The young woman adjusted her veil. It slowly drooped on to the side of her head and from there drted towards her lap. She picked it up and tossed it away.Jim located the ring beside the front wheel. lsquoIrsquove got it, Irsquove got the ring.rsquo He retrieved it and gave it a amateur polish. It was silver with an small amber stone as its centre piece. He read the inion lsquoTo M.K, Saul rsquo. It must have been handed down through her intendedrsquos family.lsquoYou great big sexy man.

Jim had spotted a somewhat sad looking gentleman on the road a few minutes before. lsquoShall we go rsquo asked the bride, as she gathered up her dress and walked towards his car, tripping over her loose shoe, all the while muttering under her breath.They didnrsquot speak much during the short trip to the church lsquoYes, I am looking for a ring.

The car came to a halt outside the little church. Warm lights beamed from inside. Jim thought it was an odd time of day to get married and a strange time of year. A few indistinct people stood around the grounds of the church.The bride opened the door, lsquoIrsquom here,rsquo she said and fell out of the car, lsquoIrsquom alright,rsquo she said painfully, stood up and slipped. Steadying herself, she kicked his car and her shoe dropped off. She picked it up and without so much as a thank you, disappeared, muddy and wet, into the church, resembling a worn-out scarecrow more than a bride. Jim waited a moment before driving off.Uncle Will and Jim talked and joked as they caught up with all the news over tea and cake. lsquoDid you ever meet Maureen Walsh rsquo asked Uncle Will. Jim shook his head as he helped himself to an extra slice of cake.Your grandfather was meant to give her lt to her wedding. She and he didnrsquot hit it off.rsquoUncle Will poked the dying embers of the fire. lsquoHe wasnrsquot one for bathing,rsquo he mumbled under his breath.lsquoShe died a few hours ago.

It was slightly bizarre, as one was a track and field meet, and the other a cross country race.As most of us donrsquot know what day it is, let alone which month, this blending of two dferent seasons seemed acceptable to many.The ANI Winter Track Series, spread over two nights, included a range of distances with East Down ACrsquos Neil Curran opting to give the km a blast. He has mostly been training solo since March and was glad of the opportunity to mix with some speedy competitors.He raced well and was pleased with third place in his heat. He recorded a time of .. which is only five seconds off his PB for the distance and proves that he remains in good form, despite the lack of racing to keep him sharp.In  his attempts at this distance exceeded the  minute barrier so this represents commendable progress overall. Keep at it Neil.The first cross country event of the  autumn season was also the last of the year. The Bobby Rea Memorial had been scheduled and rescheduled as restrictions rose and fell, but finally got away on Sunday at the Billy Neill playing fields in Comber.There was a limit on the entries and waves were allocated to permit social distancing. Sadly there were no spectators allowed. East Down AC had only three runners taking part as the change of date had affected overall attendance.The first to test the underfoot conditions were the senior men with Aaron McGrady representing East Down.The race got underway after a short period of silence in honour of John McKeag, the Ballydrain Harriers stalwart who sadly passed away the previous Monday in his th year.Aaron had hoped to fit in this particular race as a marker for his form ahead of the Intermediate Championships scheduled for mid-January but now likely to face abandonment due to the lockdown proposed to be implemented for six weeks after Christmas.The race consisted of two laps of .km each, the shorter distance designed, like the ision of the runners, into waves of up to a maximum of  runners each, to prevent mass overtaking to comply with social distancing requirements.As only half of the over  entries turned up, it was necessary to use only two waves.Aaron was drawn in the first wave alongside the faster runners and though he prefers to start relatively slowly and then set out to catch those in front, he doubtedit would be possible on this occasion so he was well to the fore from the off and came through at the end of the first lap in fourth place.However he stuck with his pre-race plan and when the runners re-appeared at the end of lap two, he was in third place behind Mark McKinstryand Craig McMeechan , and comfortably maintained his position until the finish line.He said afterwards that he was happy with how the race had gone and had no regrets about his tactics. The first three recorded times were ., . and . respectively, which is pretty hot running on a cross country course that was holding a fair amount of overnight rain. Well done Aaron.The second race was for senior and masters women and East Down AC again had only one representative mdash the ever-enthusiastic Sharon Madine.Sharon started conservatively in the second of the two waves, but proceeded to make steady progress and at the end of her two laps she had a time of . against her name. When the results of both waves were combined she placed overall th but first in the over- category. Well worth the efforts Sharon.The third and final event of the day was for Male Masters and again a sole East Down AC runner mdash the evergreen Dee Murray. Another who seems to have lost none of his competitive edge during the pandemic, Dee simply turns up and runs as hard as he can.On Sunday this meant that his time of . gave him th place overall and second in the over- category. Well done Dee.In spite of the absence of spectators, all who turned up said that it was well organised and they were glad to have taken part. As one of the few interested official observers, I have to agree with that.Sandwiched between these two events was the East Down AC annual Xmas predicted K at the Downshire Estate on Thursday evening.This is a fun event where runners try to guess how long they will take to cover the distance and then without a watch or other timing device do their best to match it. With the emphasis on accuracy and pacing rather than speed the way is wide open for all to snatch the prize.The top five were impressively close to their predicted times with fth place going to Johnny Holmes, who was seven seconds out. Deirdre Weatherall and Colin Shields tied for third equal - each with a five-second deficit.Seamus Savage was four seconds off his guess, which was good going, but it would have been hard to beat the winner Maureen Kelly who was a mere one second to the better of her guess. She was delighted to top the table and over the moon to find that her prize was a hamper of goodies as well as a pound voucher for Bells Supervalu Crossgar. Congratulations Maureen.Even though the runners had to be split into waves and social distancing was enforced, it was the best that was on offer due to current circumstances and it was a good boost to club morale. Instead of charging the normal entry fee, members were asked to donate food items which have been duly delivered to the Fountain Foodbank in the town.All in all it was a successful night for all concerned and an uplting end to a less than inspiring .

The enthralling cup tie ended - after  minutes with the sides locked at - after extra-time at Hampden Park.Hazard, who was recently handed the number one jersey by Hoops boss Neil Lennon, made both his European and Scottish Premiership debuts and retained the starting jersey for Sundayrsquos final.The stopper mdash who has also forced his way into the Northern Ireland international squad mdash was delighted to play a major part in his sidersquos cup final victory.And while his current contract expires in the summer which allows him to negotiate with other clubs in January, should he favour a move away from Celtic Park, leaving the club he has supported since he was a boy is the last thing on his mind.Conor described Sundayrsquos cup final as ldquocrazy day for him and his family who watched the match at home.ldquoThree weeks ago, I would never have been able to picture what happened there on that pitch, he said moments after his penalty shoot-out heroics.ldquoI am just absolutely over the moon. Irsquove been a Celtic fan my whole le and to get this opportunity, well I am just delighted, he said.ldquoTo play for such a worldwide club, we know what the fans expect and how much they drive us towards winning. It is an honour to play for them. I want to fully focus on each match, playing week in, week out here at Celtic, and hopefully it will come together.Conor said the final was a ldquomomentous day for him and his family, explaining that his lsquophone hasnrsquot stopped ringing.Conor grew up in Downpatrick and developed his skills in the Celtic academy, travelling across to Scotland for games from a young age.ldquoThe club means everything to me, he said. ldquoWe used to get up at am to get on the boat to go to matches and we wouldnrsquot be home until three the next morning. Itrsquos something I always dreamed of growing up.Conor has spent several spells out on loan in recent years in order to build-up his first team experience, readying him for a career between the sticks for Celtic.He got his chance to impress against Lille and Kilmarnock r as Celticrsquos form hit a rocky patch, but being selected by Lennon for the win over Hearts at Hampden Park was a huge confidence boost.ldquoI have to thank all of the staff and the manager for putting trust in me, said Conor.ldquoIt was a huge honour in such a big game. Thankfully, I was able to repay that trust with the two penalty saves. I have put a lot of work in and gone on loan spells waiting for my chance. The coaches have helped me a lot throughout the club.Sundayrsquos cup win clinched the domestic treble for Celtic for the fourth successive campaign, something that has never before been achieved. It is also the th time Celtic have been crowned Scottish Cup winners, with the Downpatrick man admitting the team has a lot of work to do to try and achieve its aims and targets this year.ldquoThe final was only my third game for the club, so Irsquom taking each day as it comes. As a team and as a group, this win could be a major factor in turning things round, he added.Conorrsquos family watched his cup final heroics at home in Downpatrick as fans were not allowed to attend the match due to coronavirus restrictions. However, they were over the moon with his achievements.ldquoI donrsquot think I have any fingernails left after that, laughed his beaming dad Gary. ldquoWe didnrsquot know up until the last minutehe would get the nod to play or not. We knew he did well in the European game and certainly made a case for himself. He only found out on Thursday from Lennon that he would be playing.Whilst there was undoubted pride from his dad, Gary said Conor has deserved his break due to how hard he has worked.ldquoHe has put so much time into Celtic over the years and done all the right things. All the close family are so proud of him, his mum Pauline, his younger brother Jack. He was superb.ldquoConor very much wants to be able to go on and make himself number one for Celtic. He is only  and this was just his third appearance, so hersquos been doing well. He had a loan spell at Dundee and did very well there and that has put him in good stead.Gary said Conor has also been drawing high praise from his Northern Ireland manager Ian Barraclough after breaking through for the senior team too.ldquoBarraclough has spoken really highly of Conor. He did very well for him when he was the manager at under-age level and the boss knows what he can do in training, he said.Conorrsquos family are no strangers to sporting success either.

The pupils I spoke to were confident and articulate users of the digital resources at their disposal. The school has developed effective support links during the pandemic to support distance learning.St Josephrsquos also received a special recognition badge last month for Cyber Resilience and Internet Safety, becoming the third primary school in Northern Ireland to be awarded this badge.The school had completed a pioneering education initiative developed to encourage online safety and cyber resilience amongst pupils in schools.The assessment report noted: lsquoSt Josephrsquos is a dynamic school which has a careful, considered and planned approach to developing and delivering a safe and secure digital technology learning environment for their pupils and have fully engaged their parental community in this development.rsquoPrincipal Laura Fitzsimons said: ldquoWe are delighted to have been awarded these prestigious titles which highlight the schoolrsquos continual investment in resources and training.ldquoWe are very pleased and proud of our teachers, student digital leaders and all our pupils for their commitment to digital learning.ldquoIt was particularly pleasing to receive this positive news in light of the challenging times which we are currently living in..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd December 2020 Talking.jpg","title":"Talking about coercive control  ","story":"TODAY there are mothers and their children from the wider Downpatrick area living in refuges run by Womenrsquos Aid.There may be more over the Christmas and New Year period as the festive time can be a dangerous time for people living with their abuser.The prospect of a six-week lockdown means that demand for help is also set to increase as Womenrsquos Aid supported , women and children during the last lockdown.Eileen Murphy, chief executive officer of the charity, has in her -plus years of working provided support to women from the Downpatrick area.Based in Newry, she works closely with the South Eastern Domestic Violence Partnership run by the local Health Trust and in partnership with other agencies, including the PSNI.ldquoOur refuges run at % capacity but we also work with many women who never stay in our refuges, said Eileen.She is all too aware of the worry and fear that some women will be experiencing over the holiday period.ldquoMothers will be trying to make the best Christmas Day possible for their children, no matter the situation. They will be hoping that he [the abuser] will be OK, she explained.ldquoI have seen over the years that women and children develop this radar with antennas scanning all the time to judge his mood, howrsquos he walking, howrsquos he eating, scanning constantly all the time, thinking is it safe, is he OK, are we annoying him  It will not matter as he is only one who can control his behaviour.While Eileen is keen to highlight that Womenrsquos Aid will provide   help to women, she also wants to dispel some myths about domestic abuse and violence and to talk about coercive control mdash any act or a pattern of acts of assault, threats, humiliation and intimidation or other abuse that is used to harm, punish, or frighten victims.ldquoOne of the main things we do for women when they come into the service is to help her understand that there was not anything she did as therersquos nothing she could have done which would have stopped him, she said.ldquoWe have women who have had to beg to have a shower and we have women who phone us who are literally hiding in a hedge as hersquos walking up and down the street trying to find her.ldquoA lot of us think its black eyes and broken bones but the real damage is the psychological torture that is going on where women and children are terrorised in their own home. They are led to believe that everything is all their fault, they are at the root cause of whatever incident. When you are living with that  , you are only surviving.Womenrsquos Aid recently launched an awareness campaign called lsquoUnlock Your Lockdownrsquo to highlight their services to women who are living in fear or under threat.Eileen said: ldquoI would say that any woman who is worried at how she is going to get through Christmas andit is to do with her partner, then I would say to ring us and have a chat. We donrsquot force anybody into the service and we donrsquot make women leave home, thatrsquos always their choice.ldquoWhat we do is to work with her and help her to determine where she is and whatrsquos the best option for her. It can be either just one phone call to her engaging in full services for anything up to two years.She stressed that the first thing Womenrsquos Aid do when a women calls them is to assess the risk she and her children are in.ldquoThe first we do is assess the risk, to find out how safe she is, where she is, where her children are, what is the immediate priority  she stressed.ldquoDepending on the level of risk, we may had to do several dferent things. It could be that a woman is hiding out at a family member or friendrsquos house, so it might involve the police or social services.Then we try to manage the risk and reduce it as much as possible and then we try and work with out how best to help her move forward and to keep her safe. For the top % of women who come to us, we would hold a Multi-Agency Risk Assessmentconference and then we would work with them on a continuous basis.ldquoHowever, I would like to stress there is no such thing as low level risk of domestic abuse for women because the only person who is in control of whether that risk is high, low or medium is the perpetrator.She is dismissive of abusers where an incident of abuse involves either drink or drugs.ldquoIf you keep terrorising the people that you love and continually use the excuse of alcohol or drugs I donrsquot buy that, said Eileen.ldquoWhat drink and drugs to is give him an excuse for violence. When itrsquos over he will say it was the drink or whatever. But I always say to that isI woke up tomorrow morning to see my partner battered or bruised and he told me I had done it last night with drink in me, would I take a drink again  Yet these guys continue to do it.ldquoThere is no doubt about that we work with traumatised women and children and people try and deal with it in many dferent ways.

Engraving by David Edwin sIto the account of Dr Crawford again today because there was a reference in it to Francis Rynd - “the Irish inventor of the hypodermic needle.” As you read this page, the roll-out of vaccinations here and around the UK has reached enormous proportions, with the figures rising fast and burgeoning rapidly in other countries too. And all of this is all possible because of an Irish physician, Francis Rynd, born in Dublin in .Some biographers focus on Rynd’s student days in Trinity College Dublin, where he was apparently regarded as ‘wayward’, preferring his hectic social leto his medical studies. \"Alexander WoodThe Lancet, one of the world’s most authoritative medical journals, reveals the historic signicance of Francis Rynd’s medical innovation which has made today’s massive vaccination programme possible. According to the Lancet, Rynd “made subcutaneous injections” to a woman patient in  for neuralgia , using a ‘syringe’, described as a “slender trocar and cannula” - a metal awl for cutting into the skin and a hollow tube.“It was inserted subcutaneously,” the Lancet recounts, “and the trocar retracted by means of a spring. Narcotic liquid descended from the hollow handle into the puncture site as the instrument was withdrawn.”At the time Francis Rynd was a surgeon in Dublin’s Meath Hospital , and was treating a woman who had suffered for years with severe neuralgic pain in her face. \"Report on Rynds Procedure in The Dublin Medical Press She’d been prescribed a solution of morphine, taken by mouth, to kill the pain, but this had failed miserably. Rynd decided to try putting the morphine directly under her skin, close to her facial nerves.He designed his innovative hypodermic needle and on June ,  performed the world’s first ever subcutaneousinjection, basically giving his patient what today would be regarded as a powerful local anaesthetic.His syringe incorporated two standard medical implements - a trocarto puncture the skin on the woman’s face, and a cannulawhich allowed the morphine to flow under her skin. In an article headline “Neuralgia, Introduction of Fluid to the Nerve” published in  in the Dublin Medical Press, Mr Rynd was reported to have said that after the procedure the woman slept well for the first time in months.For six years previously, after falling off a wall, -year-old Margaret Cox had been in acute pain “over the entire left side of her face…shooting into the eye, in the cheek, along the gums of both upper and lower jaw.” The Dublin Medical Press described Hynd’s procedure - “a solution of fteen grains of acetate of morphia, dissolved in one drachm of creosote, was introduced to the supra-orbital nerve, and along the course of the temporal, malar, and buccal nerves, by four punctures of an instrument made for the purpose. In the space of a minute all painhad ceased, and she slept better that night than she had for months.”Surgeon Rynd’s new procedure was soon used widely to treat pain and was championed around the world as “the greatest boon to medicine since the discovery of chloroform”. Florence Nightingale benefited from it herself during an illness and declared: “Nothing did me any good, but a curious little new-fangled operation of putting opium under the skin, which relieved [the pain] for  hours.”But it was an Edinburgh physician called Alexander Woodwho was first to properly publish an academic paper on the subcutaneous therapeutic injection of drugs in . He used one of the “elegant little syringes constructed … by Mr Ferguson of Giltspur Street”, and was thus championed as the inventor of the hypodermic syringe. In Rynd’s initial design, the liquid being injected simply flowed slowly out of the needle under gravity. In  a plunger was added to the syringe, allowing for a faster injection, directly into a vein, against the flow and pressure of the blood. So Francis Rynd should also be thanked for making blood tests possible - the addition of the plunger allowed the taking of blood samples, which could then be subjected to diagnostic tests. After his invention became a vital tool in hospitals and surgeries Rynd became an important figure on both the Irish medical and social scenes.A history of the Meath Hospital and County Dublin Infirmary published in  records that “Francis Rynd was a perfect gentleman, and had very polished manners he mixed in the best society, had most of the nobility in Ireland among his patients, dressed most fashionably, and was a great favourite with the ladies.”Francis Rynd died in Dublin in .   \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularDays after Brexit, many products vanish from Sainsbury’s in Northern Ireland and are replaced with Spar brandSouth East Antrim UDA issue threat against Arlene Foster say PSNIIs the ‘Beast from the East’ set to  Funeral held for former Real IRA Chief Michael McKevittFULL statement released by NI Executive after last night’s emergency meeting on Coronavirus regulationsMost PopularScrapping the transfer test this year could be the end of grammar schools in Northern IrelandSecond Yellow weather warning for ice could bring NI to its knees....againNI weather alert - sub-zero temperatures of -°C in next  hours as Met Office issues yellow status weather warning for Northern IrelandNI road closed in both directions after road traffic collision - motorists asked to seek alternative routeSympathy expressed after young female pedestrian Lucy McIlhatton is killed on major NI road                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\" ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-lhVmIH sc-bYSBpT cqvPrG\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"     NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"     SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"     Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"     LestyleEating OutChristmasCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlesCoronavirusGetting outMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessPublic NoticesFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"  to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

There will now be a border between Northern Ireland and Great BritainAs we enter Northern Ireland’s centenary year it is clear that unionists are not in the place they would wish to be.The establishment of an internal border within the UK separating Northern Ireland from Great Britain should be the straw that breaks the camel’s back.

They may talk about ‘an agreed Ireland’ but show an unwillingness to contemplate any vision for the future which does not amount to anything less than a united Ireland.The time has long passed for all unionists to unite in their rejection of mandatory coalition, a tool Sinn Fein IRA use to achieve their goal to de-British Northern Ireland. It is absurd to think the party that controls the finance of our country wishes for that very country not to exist.Darrin Foster, Portadown——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityMike Kingston, who this week collected his long service medal to recognise the achievement, has shared his pride and some of his memories over the years.Mr Kingston, who is married and has two children and two grandchildren, joined Penarth RNLI on November  , as a volunteer crew member ndash and quickly progressed to become leboat helm.Along with his fellow volunteer crew members, he attended hundreds of incidents, launching day and night in all kinds of weather conditions, to go to the aid of people in trouble at sea.Since his retirement from being a sea-going member of the team, he has spent the last  years as shore crew and one of Penarthrsquos Deputy Launching Authorities, liaising with the coastguards when they request assistance, and managing the leboatrsquos launch.Mr Kingstonrsquos leboat career has extended beyond the UK. In , he was a member of a crew of just eight leboat volunteers from across the UK who flew out to aid the relief effort in flood-stricken Mozambique.Together, the team faced the dangers of crocodiles, hippos, poisonous snakes and anti-personnel mines, navigating rivers that had burst their banks, in a rescue mission to bring desperately needed medical relief to , people in villages marooned by flood waters.ldquoWe had five small D class inflatable leboats, and had to ferry doctors and medical supplies to areas that had been written off as impossible, as helicopters couldnrsquot land there and they were inaccessible by road, he said.ldquoIt was so hot that the soles of my boots melted. We had to spend the night on sandbars where we took turns to keep watch, as the crocodiles were very keen to join us.Since he joined the crew, Mike has combined his volunteering with his paid job in the South Wales Fire and Rescue service. He joined the service back in , at just , and progressed from his position as a firefighter, to the lead instructor for recruit training, finally finishing his career in  as Chair of the Water Rescue group, and a member of the servicersquos all Wales flood response team.Over the past four decades, -year-old Mr Kingston has seen huge changes in the way the RNLI operates.He has seen Penarth leboat station move from its original home in the deck chair store underneath the current Coffi Co building on the Esplanade, to its current location just up the road in a purpose built, modern leboat station.ldquoIrsquom sure the people of Penarth will remember the hand held maroons that were fired off by a leboat crew member to call the rest of us to the station for a launch, he said.ldquoBut even before that, I remember when the Pier Master would get us down to the station by firing the maroons out of a small cannon.ldquoNowadays, technology has moved on and we use pagers, mobiles phones and computer systems to respond to a shout.ldquoThese systems are a lot more sophisticated, but itrsquos still the same feeling when yoursquore called out of bed in the early hours of a freezing cold January morning.ldquoNo matter how times have moved on, one thing that remains constant is the unbelievable commitment of the whole RNLI team.ldquoThere have been so many highs and lows over the past  years. As all the team will know, itrsquos good to feel that yoursquore part of a team, giving something to your community.ldquoBut there have also been some sad times when people have lost their lives. Irsquom proud to have been a part of Penarth RNLI family.Thanking him for his  years of service, Jason Dunlop, Penarth Leboat Operations Manager said: ldquoOn behalf of all at Penarth leboat station, I would like to congratulate Mike on this fantastic achievement and thank him for his commitment and support to saving lives at sea over the last  years. We are all volunteers at Penarth RNLI, we give our time freely to support our local community.ldquoMikersquos contribution to the charity over the years has not only been volunteering his time, hersquos also been happy to share his wealth of experience with the crew as we train and work together when someone needs our help.

These projected figures are the highest we have ever seen in this County and are likely to reach almost , cases per , in the seven-day period up until Christmas Day.If you compare that with the figure of  cases per , when we entered the local lockdown, you can see how serious the current situation is. We can no longer be complacent.We know from the first and second waves that as case numbers increase, more people get seriously unwell, and we will inevitably see more deaths from Coronavirus - many of which can be avoided,we act now.We are deeply concerned that hospitals and primary care services across Cardf and the Vale of Glamorgan are now under unsustainable pressure due to COVID-, and sadly, but inevitably, the number of people who are becoming very sick is increasing daily.Each and every one of us has a responsibility to act now. We must all follow Welsh Government coronavirus regulations, butyou can also take further actions to protect those you love, then we urge you to do so.We should not meet with anyone outside our household bubble and keep contact with people outside our household to an absolute minimum until the current threat has passed, but especially in the run-up to Christmas.We know that staying away from loved ones will be painful for many, especially at this time of year, butwe do this now, we will be doing everything we can to protect our family and friends for the months to come.We know many people think that the vaccine is going to become more widely available, so everything is going to be okay. Regrettably, that is simply not the case. If we donrsquot change our behaviour now,many people will die before the vaccine is rolled out, people who donrsquot need to die, possibly people who you know.The full roll out of the vaccine will take many months, so now is not the time to be complacent. Very few of us are immune and the virus is still prevalent in our communities and our hospitals. By practising social distancing, washing our hands regularly and wearing face coverings we will all be doing our bit to help.So, our message is simple.Wash your hands regularly oryou canrsquot do that use sanitiser hand gel.Please try and stay at home and only go out for essential reasons andit is essential to go out, please do so in quieter periods.If you do go out, wear a mask when required and keep socially distanced by at least  metres, wherever possible.Please do not mix with other households or your friends.Work from home,you can do so.If you develop symptoms such as a new and continuous cough, a temperature, or a loss of taste or smell please self-isolate with your household and arrange a test.These small steps can really help us all to keep our communities safe.As a Health Board and Council, we are fully mobilised in the fight against COVID-. Doing so continues to be a huge challenge and is one that we will best achieve,we do it together, just as we did in the Spring.We are asking every one of you to achieve this challenge together.Letrsquos stop the spread, and letrsquos keep the Vale of Glamorgan, the NHS and our loved ones safe.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Hospitality businesses would have joined them on pm Christmas Day, with a level four lockdown coming into place on Monday, December . The five day lsquorelaxationrsquo period would have still been in place according to these rules, but a change from three households mixing to two.But on Saturday, December , all this changed as prime minister Boris Johnson held a press conference to update the UK on the rapid spread of the new strain of coronavirus and announcing that the South East of England, including London would be moved into tier four.Tier four means residents must stay at home with some limited exemptions ndash which includes workunable to do so from home, however, working from home is strongly advisedit is possible. Non-essential services must also close. People also must not enter or leave a tier four area.This also saw a change to Englandrsquos Christmas restrictions, with households banned from mixing, apart from single households, which would be allowed to form a bubble to avoid isolation.Areas in the lower tiers were still allowed to continue to mix with up to three households ndash however, only on Christmas Day.So, what did this announcement mean for Wales The announcement by the prime minister was focused specically on England, but it was followed by Walesrsquo first minister making an announcement of his own the same evening. He announced that the tier four lockdown would come into place from midnight on Saturday, December , meaning businesses had a matter of hours to come to terms with the news and people rushed out to do some last-minute Christmas shopping before all the non-essential retail closed.Some of the supermarkets across Wales have now taken their lsquonon-essentialrsquo items off sale.The festive period bubble rule has also changed, with a maximum of two households allowed to mix on Christmas Day.MORE NEWS:Mr Drakeford said in a statement on Saturday evening that the pattern of transmission in London and the South East of England, which is linked to the new iant of coronavirus, is ldquoremarkably consistent with the rapid acceleration of transmission in Wales in recent weeks.Also in the statement, the first minister said that latest evidence had suggested the new strain is present throughout Wales and that it needed an ldquoimmediate response.After meeting with the Welsh Governmentrsquos Cabinet on Saturday and taking into consideration advice from senior medical and scientic advisors, he said: ldquoThe situation is incredibly serious. I cannot overstate this.ldquoWe have therefore reached the dficult decision to bring forward the alert level four restrictions for Wales, in line with the action being taken in London and the South East of England.Dr Chris Williams, incident director for the Novel Coronavirusoutbreak at Public Health Wales said in a statement: ldquoAs indicated by the Welsh Government, the immediate introduction of new restrictions is related to the identication of a new more transmissible iant of Coronavirus. Public Health Wales has been working with UK partners to investigate and respond to this iant.ldquoIt is normal for viruses to undergo mutations, and we expect this to happen. Although the iant is easier to transmit, there is currently no evidence that it is more severe.ldquoWe are reminding people that all current guidance relating to Coronavirus continues to apply to the new iant, including advice relating to symptoms, social distancing, self-isolation, and vaccination.ldquoThe new iant shows up as positive in Public Health Walesrsquo existing Coronavirus tests, and people must continue to seek a test in the usual waythey develop Coronavirus symptoms.ldquoIf you or a member of your household develop a cough, fever or change in sense of taste or smell, you must self-isolate immediately and book a free Coronavirus test by calling .ldquoPublic Health Wales urges everyone to follow the rules, to avoid transmission of Coronavirus and to protect everyone in our communities, including the most vulnerable. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

People of all faiths have been unable to gather as they would wish for their festivals, such as Passover, Easter, Eid and Vaisakhi.

Across the Commonwealth, my family and I have been inspired by stories of people volunteering in their communities, helping those in need.ldquoIn the United Kingdom and around the world, people have risen magnicently to the challenges of the year, and I am so proud and moved by this quiet, indomitable spirit.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityIt is expected that at least , doses will be available within the first two weeks of the rollout.Last week, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agencyauthorised the AstraZeneca vaccine as safe and effective following stringent clinical trials - just three weeks after the first coronavirus vaccine, Pfizer BioNTech, was approved for use across the UK.The Welsh Government and NHS Wales have been preparing for the vaccinationsrsquo approvals and delivery since June.Around  million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine have been procured for use in the UK.Two doses will be needed, with an interval of between four and  weeks between doses.This is a change from previous advice for both vaccines of a four week gap between doses, as the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisationhas recommended that as many people as possible in the top priority groups should sequentially be offered a first vaccine dose as the initial priority.Based on a UK-wide priority system, the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine has already begun to be administered to frontline health and social care staff, as well as care home residents and staff and people aged over  and the AstraZeneca vaccine will enable more.Latest figures to end of Sat th December show that more than , people have so far received the first dose of the vaccine.Every health board in Wales will receive their allocation in proportion to the size of its priority population and ability to deliver, as outlined by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisationrsquos prioritisation list.Unlike the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, the AstraZeneca vaccine is stored at normal vaccine fridge temperatures.This means it will have few storage and transportation issues, making it much easier to use in community settings such as care homes and primary care settings like GP surgeries.People are asked not to phone their GP, pharmacy or hospital asking when they will get a vaccine.When someone is in one of the groups eligible for the vaccine, they will be invited to attend a dedicated clinic which will have been set up to ensure patient safety and that of the healthcare professionals.Correspondence will come from local health boards and the vaccine is free of charge through the NHS.People are warned to be alert to scams asking for money or personal information.Health minister, Vaughan Gething said: ldquoToday marks a key milestone in our fight against the COVID- pandemic.\"The roll-out of the AstraZeneca vaccine has been called a lsquogame changerrsquo and this is true - its potential should not be underestimated.ldquoIn less than a month Walesrsquo NHS has mobilised the largest vaccination programme our country has ever seen and so far more than , people have received their first dose.ldquoNow, only  days since regulatory approval of the new vaccine for use in the UK, a second vaccine is here and ready for use, signicantly adding to Walesrsquo defences in the face of coronavirus and protecting our most vulnerable.Senior responsible officer for Walesrsquo COVID- vaccine programme, Dr Gillian Richardson added:ldquoIt is fantastic news that there is now a second vaccine to help protect our communitiesrsquo most vulnerable from the harms of COVID-.ldquoPace will be governed by supply, which will start slowly this week but build vastly over the coming weeks and months.\"However, vaccinations are happening in GP surgeries from today and we will also see an increase in our vaccination centres over the course of this month.ldquoIt is so important that people continue to wait their turn for the vaccine ndash you will be contacted when your time comes.\"Please do not contact your GP or local pharmacy and add unnecessary pressures to their workload. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.
