Who has a house so large that you can simply ignore a howling dog or carry on with Zoom calls for work? Endlessly having to say \u0027No, Toffee\u0027s not being tortured, we are just trying a new separation technique\u0027, is not going to endear you to colleagues.There are two answers it seems to me. The first is that in many households the return to work will be gradual. Many offices are not intending to open fully this side of Christmas. Maybe one person in a couple will leave for longer. This is not going to be a sudden thing. And (to be deadly serious for a moment) there are plenty of people who are nervous about leaving home or have no job to return to.The longer term answer is that we need to be as faithful to them as they are to us. Dogs are loved because they are so constant, so wholly loving, in the face of everything the world throws at us.That is why — if you are lucky enough to have one — they have been such a boon during these awful days. They soothe family rows. They reduce your blood pressure. They ease tension.So we ought to be just as constant. Are we really going to lock them in a cage in another room? Of course not. We still need them as much as they need us.And they will come good again when we are vaccinated (I am being optimistic here but not unrealistic) and we all go back to something approaching normal. Dogs will adapt much better than those hyper-sensitive New Yorkers suggest. They are only as neurotic as we let them be. One walk a day again? Hey ho. Kids gone back to school. Whatever? Adults out for longer in the day?I suspect the dogs of Britain, mentally stronger than the average Manhattan pooch, will take it all in their stride. There may be some better welcomes home but we in turn will be even more pleased to see them.But in the meantime let us focus on doing our bit for our best friends who have been here for us throughout the lockdown and will always be with us while humans and animals coexist on earth.We do not need to give them odd-ball psychotherapy as if they were extras in a Woody Allen film. We just need to treat them kindly. We shall come out of this nightmare with a debt owed to dogs.It can be repaid with a bone, a pat and a walk in the park.And perhaps they can sleep upstairs?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/33c21ce8c637af9db46a2ce8ee3513e99a90d5d4/0_0_983_590/master/983.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1ca2537d58c2df1ca44162a2d8105619","title":"great british art quiz national library wales","story":"The National Library of Wales set today’s quiz, which enables you to explore the art collection of British museums closed due to Covid-19 – while answering some fiendish questions along the wayThis quiz is brought to you in collaboration with Art UK, the online home for the UK’s public art collections, showing art from more than 3,000 venues and by 45,000 artists.

Debating in another essay (The Natural Death Centre) a friend’s proposal that they jointly buy a plot in Highgate cemetery, she envisaged her possible headstone: “Jenny Diski lies here. But tells the truth over there.” Solitude being her thing, she decided against the grave share, but her DIY epitaph remains appropriate. For in these brilliant, singular, posthumously published columns from the LRB, she writes in an adjacent way: the truth is “over there”.Diski does not strain to engage with writers she is more likely to ask why it was necessary for their books to exist in the first place. She inquires of Jeremy Treglown’s biography of Roald Dahl: “What is the function of an adult biography of the man?” before interpreting the poisonous pull of Dahl’s stories on children: “They speak to the last overt remains of the disreputable, unsocialised, inelegant parts of themselves the grownups are trying so hard to push firmly underground.” She knows herself all about the feral child-within-the-adult, as The Friendly Spider Programme – about overcoming her arachnophobia – reveals, ending with a hairy inspiration to out-Dahl Dahl.Sometimes, Diski writes loftily: she seems to float above her subjects – writing as weightlessly as a bather in the Dead Sea, buoyed up by salt. In Did Jesus Walk on Water Because He Couldn’t Swim? she is especially entertaining and erudite (she worked so hard at all these pieces). This is a review of The Children of Noah: Jewish Seafaring in Ancient Times. And again, she is incredulous at the book’s existence, remembering how, growing up, even as a non-practising Jew, the sea ”didn’t seem kosher”.In her introduction, Mary-Kay Wilmers, editor of the LRB, writes: “One of the pleasures of reading Jenny Diski, especially the essays, is that pleasure is such a large part of it.” Diski was worth hiring on any subject: feed her base metal, she turned it into gold. When not writing about herself, she is at her best considering the nasty andor nondescript. Her subjects include Jeffrey Dahmer, Howard Hughes and Richard Branson, and she does not let Christine Keeler get away with a stuffy, faux-respectable take on her past. It is only because she has forced her way through “every damn word” of Keith Richards’s coarsely self-serving autobiography (in which he reveals Mick Jagger has a “tiny todger”) that she is determined to go ahead with her review. She is the most undeceived of writers – and surprising. Who else would combine reviewing a biography of Denis Thatcher with a reading of Melville’s Moby-Dick?In Mirror Images, a review of Piers Morgan’s The Insider: The Private Diaries of a Scandalous Decade, the pleasure is in the power-play: Blair and Morgan become diminutive figures, dwarfed by Diski’s writing. Her skill as a novelist assists: an invented exchange between Morgan and Rupert Murdoch is priceless. She is adversarially entertaining rather than belligerent. Why fight when – if you have the skill – you can arrange for writers to fall on their own swords?Wilmers writes: “Jenny liked sleep and often took to her bed she liked blankness of all kinds: white surfaces, uneventful days.” The question arises: how much did depression feed her writing? In these essays, her gloom is steadying, her melancholy cheering. In the entertaining Moving Day, her “live-in lover” moves out: “It feels like sadness, but not mine or rather, not a personal sadness, but one of great immensity, and slightly up and to the left of me, where I lie saturating the pillow.” Here, once again, is that sense that what matters is an aside.Other autobiographical essays are superb: A Feeling for Ice, about whiteness, psychiatric hospital and an estranged mother Fashion As Art, about her relationship with clothes and Staying Awake, in which she describes sleep beautifully. And I love her perkily comfortless piece about old age, However I Smell, in which she lets it be known that her hairdresser keeps saying to her: “Ah bless.” She writes: “There are other signs that I am no longer young, but the ah-bless is the most open and public.” Blessing Diski was an impertinence – little did these innocents know upon whom their blessings were landing. Her writing will forever remain young, funny and rebellious. And her essays – dare I say it – earn a blessing even when what they consider is cursed.• Why Didn’t You Just Do What You Were Told by Jenny Diski is published by Vintage (£18.99).

For someone buying a £500,000 home, the saving is worth £15,000.Miles Shipside, a Rightmove director and its housing market analyst, said: “The unexpected mini-boom continues to gather momentum as more nations reopen.“The busy-until-interrupted spring market has now picked up where it left off and has been accelerated by both time-limited stamp duty holidays and by homeowners reappraising their homes and lifestyles because of the lockdown.”Martin Walshe, director at estate agent Cheffins in Cambridge, said: “We’re as busy as we have been at any time in the past five years, and demand is at such a level that we have had over 25 properties go to sealed bids in the past four weeks.”Marc von Grundherr, director of London agent Benham \u0026amp Reeves, said: “Prices are up, inquiries are through the roof and sales are being agreed like billy-o, and that’s even before the effects of the temporary stamp duty reprieve have had time to kick in.“Prices will rise further as a consequence of this unprecedented demand – albeit somewhat fabricated by a chancellor determined to bolster the flagging economy via the property market.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/073887411d344f86cb72a0d8d2f969a00820b98e/0_103_4610_2767/master/4610.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e1e4cb169842370991d09fe8e401d3a2","title":"most uk firms plan to invest less in next three years finds survey","story":"Covid-19, risk of no-deal Brexit and geopolitical tensions are dragging down spendingAlmost two thirds of companies plan to cut investment spending over the next three years as they look ahead to a slow recovery that will delay almost half from clawing back pre-Covid-19 levels of sales before next summer.The gloomy outlook followed a string of forecasts throwing doubt on the likelihood of a V-shaped recovery this year.The prime minister said on Friday that he expected most of the economy to be open by Christmas and office workers to begin returning to work in town and city centres.Experts at the OECD, the Paris-based forecaster for wealthy nations, recently warned that Britain’s economy is likely to suffer the worst damage from the Covid-19 crisis of any country in the developed world.The survey found that firms were likely to cut idends and share buybacks, which are at 10-year lows, to shore up their financial reserves.In a blow to pension funds and inidual investors, the UK idend monitor found 176 companies cancelled their idends altogether and another 30 cut them.The report said: “Together these made up three quarters of all the companies that usually pay in the second quarter. Just 61 increased their payouts.”Half the impact of cuts came from the financial sector while Shell’s cut, along with smaller oil companies, made up another £2.2bn, the report said. Nine 10ths of industrial companies cut payouts, costing investors £2bn.Make UK, the body representing manufacturing and engineering companies, said the industrial sector was facing a wave of job losses unless further action was taken by the Treasury to extend subsidies into next year.It said the government must retain the job retention scheme for some industry sectors for another six months to avoid a loss of highly skilled jobs on a scale not seen since the 1980s.Rishi Sunak plans to end the furlough scheme in October but faces a rising tide of warnings that unemployment will rocket without an extension for the hardest hit sectors.Stephen Phipson, chief executive of Make UK, said the specific measures would only be equivalent to moves taken by major European competitors in Germany, France and Italy.“At present, the prospect of a V-shaped recovery for industry seems remote. Therefore, if we are to mitigate the worst impact of potential job losses, government must extend the furlough scheme for key strategic sectors to provide them with vital breathing space,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea61988ba1c3f85889d2631c18417bac168fa946/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a3409e93c007d41e96772c189244ba1f","title":"britain crossroads dread hope politicians","story":"Our politicians are lacking in imagination, so it is up to us to make the case for the type of country we want to live inBoris Johnson may be calling for a return to offices and hoping for a return to “significant normality” by Christmas, but the feeling of dread hanging over this strange, uneasy summer is becoming inescapable. A second wave of Covid-19 now seems to be a racing certainty. And a gathering avalanche of numbers attests to an economic disaster that is probably already upon us.For all the noise it generates, politics is failing us. The government presents a spectacle of absurd displacement activity, purging the higher ranks of the civil service, doubling down on Brexit, and floating plans to yet again reorganise the NHS. If you want a conclusive symbol of conservatism’s passage into the politics of grim surrealism, consider that £705m is about to be spent on a “Brexit border” centred on a vast lorry park in Ashford, Kent, where hauliers will play out the futile stupidity of our exit from the EU on an hourly basis.The left, meanwhile, has its own problems. Even if the Labour party seems to be in the early stages of reconnecting with the electorate, its reaction to the defeat of Corbynism has so far been a pronounced policy inertia. And beyond Westminster, the most vocal elements of supposedly progressive opinion seem to have more to say about so-called cancel culture and letters in high-end American magazines than they do about a social and economic disaster that could be worse even than that of the 1930s. As symbols of the myopic smallness of politics in the face of gigantic challenges, the right has its very odd campaign against face masks my side has month-long arguments about JK Rowling.How, then, to get over a mounting feeling of fatalism and fear? Last week, I immersed myself in the latest writings from Anthony Barnett, the veteran thinker and activist whose work goes back to the watershed of 1968. His expansive, ideas-filled book, The Lure of Greatness, was by far the best treatise on the politics of Brexit. Now, in an extended online essay cheerily titled Out of the Belly of Hell, he has turned his attention to the Covid-19 crisis, and what it means for the way in which many countries have been run for the past few decades. What is compelling about what he says is its ambitious historical sweep and sense of possibility: the gift of coronavirus, he insists, is that it “makes it clear that the future of humanity is a matter of our choice”.Globalisation, as Barnett sees it, has two increasingly irreconcilable aspects. It embeds “profit maximisation and marketisation” but also a generalised capacity for people to become citizens, with expectations of rights and protections. Millions of us might be exploited, but we also have a deep awareness that “we share the same planet … at the same time as each other”. In ensuring one of these aspects has clashed with the other, the pandemic has commenced a new era, so far manifested not just in the politics of the virus itself but in what has swirled around it: the Black Lives Matter upsurge is the most obvious example, and there will soon be more.Everything changed when economies were effectively suspended to save lives: as a result Covid-19 “has precipitated an ideological breakdown”. But breakdowns are not the same as revolutions: “You can recover and be strengthened by the experience or just go back to how you were … The outcome is decided afterwards and has to be achieved, it is never inherent in the crisis.” We are now faced with the “incompatibility between the economic market dogma that claimed to shape the wealth creation of the world, and an expectation of the right to life that, it turned out, accompanied its growth”. The two key questions of our time are whether a more human, collectivist way of thinking can finally be pushed to the fore, and what a different kind of economy and society might look like.If the absence of these big themes from the mainstream conversation around coronavirus is frustrating, the solution is surely to begin talking about them anyway, and thinking on a scale commensurate with that of the crisis itself. In the short to medium term, we may soon have to move to a partially directed economy, whereby we embrace the logic of a green new deal, and shift labour and resources from parts of the economy fast being left behind to more sustainable ones. By way of putting people to work and beginning to move against the social conditions that have exacerbated Britain’s experience of the outbreak, we need a huge public housing programme, partly focused on repurposing the town and city centres that are now in urgent need of reinvention. The line between paid work and voluntary activity and care ought to be blurred by a basic income. The way we collectively deliver public services should be reshaped by what Barnett calls an “explosion of empathy, social awareness and networking”, recently seen in the way that spontaneous community action has helped people affected by the virus.Which brings us to what kind of state we should want. As I have written a lot recently, England’s handling of the pandemic proves that its creaking, centralised system of government, full of ossified practices and institutionalised prejudice, needs to be thoroughly localised and democratised. This is the best way to safeguard against future pandemics and outbreaks. As opposed to the Johnson-Cummings model, whereby regeneration is somehow to be dropped on places from on high, it is also how new economic futures can be shaped by the people who will deliver and benefit from them.The 21st century’s digital blur means we tend to think that truly historic events are things frozen in black and white, or chronicled in epic documentaries. But make no mistake: more than any other period in most of our lifetimes, this a time of massive significance, bringing with it a sense of both crisis and opportunity. Amid constant detours and distractions, all of us need to think about the future before it hits us like a hammer. The problem with dread, after all, is that sooner or later it becomes self-fulfilling."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d2d524ba59367a17cd5974d48eacfea92a82dfe/0_159_512_307/master/512.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d7216813a8bd5cf19989f070975a53e8","title":"how to argue talk dissent disagree","story":"It is time to stop manufacturing dissent and find other, more constructive ways to disagree with one anotherWhen I was about 10 years old, the boys in my class suddenly decided en masse to try to get the girls to punch them in the gut to prove that they could take it. For the propositioned puncher, there was no way of winning: if you followed through and failed to fell them, you were weak if you declined, you were a loser. The situation eventually got so out of hand that actual fights broke out, until the random phenomenon was eventually replaced by another playground fad.As adults, instead of “Punch me!” we now find ourselves followed around by people saying “Debate me!” What comes next follows the same logic of the infantile game: you either engage, and end up in a pointless altercation that descends into rancour or you decline, and are accused of being fragile.The forums in which we find ourselves debating issues – Brexit, immigration or “identity politics” – are structurally designed to exacerbate, rather than resolve or even explore, differences. Conflict is favoured over conversation, animosity over inquiry. Usually, disagreements that happen on social media are picked out and repackaged by traditional media outlets. We see it all the time: a public figure tweets a controversial statement, social media users come out for or against, print and online media amalgamates the content into 600 words, and perhaps “the debate” makes the six o’clock news. There may be a relatively small number of people actually online, and an even smaller number actively arguing, but their activity is magnified, consumed and, ultimately, monetised and pressed into the service of political agendas.Even the language we use to describe the interlocutors shows how conflict is manufactured. We have “provocateurs” and “controversialists” who demand a hearing. Characters such as Katie Hopkins and Nigel Farage are given platforms and coverage in our “polite media”, spreading misinformation about immigration and race, which contributes to racism and xenophobia. In these conditions, engaging in a back-and-forth with someone holding an opposing viewpoint is not a constructive act with the aim of reaching common ground, or at least an understanding of the other: it is to feed an insatiable appetite for public spectacle.We have been heading in the direction of this discursive dead end for a long time. A copy of the Spectator from 15 years ago, dedicated to race and edited by Boris Johnson, featured majority white, male writers and journalists who could have graced the magazine’s cover today. This small group of people cycles in and out of journalism, politics and public relations, with little to advance but their own personal ambitions. Provocation has become a necessary skill for a career in the media, rather than the ability to engage in a healthy debate as a means to promote the cause of political accord and social cohesion.Those who profit continue to repeat the words “debate”, “ersity” and “freedom of speech” as if a mantra to ward off criticism, and through accusations of intellectual intolerance attempt to shift the blame on to those who won’t indulge real-life intolerance. To opt out of a debate is to be accused of “living in a bubble” or an “echo chamber’, rather than just wanting to go about our daily lives with as little unnecessary aggravation as possible.Much of this moral panic is linked to a liberal crisis of confidence that came about after 2016. In a state of shock after the election of Donald Trump and the Brexit vote, liberals decided that the reason they had failed to anticipate these seismic events was because they were out of touch, walled off in their ivory towers. To gain a sense of understanding of the world, and rediscover the path to power, they needed to engage with a wider field of opinions. A bigger dose of liberalism, in the form of an expanded marketplace of ideas, was going to save them. Bring on the racists and the xenophobes and the climate-change deniers just don’t call them that. Punch us in the gut we can take it.Between guilty liberals, a rightwing government happy to substitute policy for macho posturing, and the toxic feedback loop between social and traditional media, the concept of open disagreement has become orced from its utility and virtue.The result is a society and public discourse roiled by conflict for the sake of it. We are falling into a trap of manufacturing dissent under the impression it is a noble pursuit that will make us stronger. But we are weaker, more exhausted and more ided than ever.In valuing only how to argue, we are forgetting how to, or even why, we should talk. If the ultimate purpose of debate is to encourage pluralism and tolerance, we need to realise that these ends cannot be achieved when the means has been infected by bad faith. Debate, ersity of thought and freedom of speech can only positively foster pluralism when they happen spontaneously, and aren’t leveraged to advance an unflattering view of the participants or their politics, which is then used by traditional media for clicks, print sales and viewing figures.An immediate step that can be taken is to recognise what lies behind this fetishisation of disagreement culture, and reclaim what debate is for in the first place. No one is under any obligation to subject themselves to argument for the hell of it. Whether it’s student debates on university campuses, exchanges on the floor of the House of Commons, or the squabbles broadcast into our homes every day, there is no moral virtue in seeking out friction for spectacle. The way to foster social cohesion is actually to “debate” less, to recuse ourselves from conflict culture, and try to find ways to disagree, unmediated by others, on our own terms."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1201a88fa6fe7a59d2aaff1bd0c3d162f1a84305/39_0_3422_2053/master/3422.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1fa8de7709ab271c28d8f34e1dd23eca","title":"back garden archaeology britons unearth artefacts during lockdown","story":"Neolithic arrowheads and a snake-shaped belt hook among finds uncovered by gardenersNeolithic arrowheads and an ancient belt hook are among several historical artefacts unearthed in Britons’ back gardens during lockdown.The British Museum’s portable antiquities scheme has been notified of a number of archaeological discoveries from people who had extra time to tend to their gardens during the weeks of restrictions.Among these treasures is a post-medieval belt hook in the shape of a snake found in Herefordshire, and a medieval silver coin discovered beneath a lawn in Stoke-on-Trent. In Coventry, a rock with script thought to date from the fourth century was found. Meanwhile, eight fragments of Roman greyware pottery were found in the Leicestershire village of Wymeswold.Peter Reavill, a finds liaison officer, said that fossils “found when people have been digging flowerbeds” were sent to his local museum in Shropshire.“With so many people spending so much more time in their gardens, there have been some really interesting finds,” he told PA Media.“I’ve seen some tobacco pipes, some pieces of pottery and even prehistoric flint tools found in people’s gardens.”While they may not be valuable treasure, they often say something “very interesting about the local history”, he said.“People find stuff all the time, and put it on one side and say, ‘That’s interesting, I’ll do something with that.’“But they’ve had the time now to get in touch and say, ‘I found this. What is it?’“And that’s one of the benefits of lockdown – people have had time to consider where they are and who have gone before them – most importantly they have had the time to get in touch with their discoveries.”Michael Lewis, head of portable antiquities and treasure at the British Museum, urged gardeners not to be embarrassed about checking whether their discovery may be significant.“During the period of total lockdown, a number of garden finds have come to light as people have been digging their gardens whilst off work or unable to go out as much as usual,” he said.“Finders can be shy about showing finds liaison officers their garden finds, but we are keen to see what is discovered by the public. Often people don’t realise the archaeological significance of what they find.”They are urged to notify the British Museum’s portable antiquities scheme, at finds.org.uk, about the objects, which help experts and the public learn about the past.“Most finders get to keep their discoveries,” Lewis added."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/375b90b140103564a07711bf97f3ab8e13676b35/0_225_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=15d6de4f731541c5d2368cbc3f7505df","title":"words we think we know but cant pronounce the curse of the avid reader","story":"Do you know how to say apropos? What about awry? We want to know which words you’ve mispronounced – and how you found out your mistakeWhen I mispronounced tinnitus (ti–nuh–tuhs is correct, ti-nai-tis is not) recently and was kindly corrected, my embarrassment was a fraction of when I said apropos (a–prow–pow instead of a-pruh-pow) to a large table of people in London when I was in my 20s. That day I was not kindly corrected, but only realised my mistake after howls of laughter and a whispered, “Maybe that’s how they say it in Australia?”Since then, I have learned that mispronunciation is often the downfall of people who read widely as children and form the incorrect pronunciation in their mind before actually hearing the word said aloud. I still blush when I think about the apropos scene, but it did not stop me from giggling when I heard a friend had mispronounced awry (uh-rai is correct oar-y is not) – a word I did not discover how to say properly until well into my teens. According to the New York Public Library, it is one of the most mispronounced words in the English language.Annals (not ay-nals), Hermione, misled (does not rhyme with thistled) and glower also feature in the library’s list.TV shows have regularly made fun of people who make their unorthodox pronunciations public, from Kim waiting for her “cardonay” to the barrister on Not the Nine O’Clock News questioning an “al-ee-bee” and: “Thanks, I bought it at Ver-sayce.”But our own genuine failings are usually funnier.A colleague pronounced facade with a k sound, another thought burial rhymed with Muriel and yet another was mortified to discover that segue was not pronounced seeg.

This is demoralising, damaging and dangerous. Owing £30,000, £300,000 or £3m makes no difference to your annual repayments,” Lewis said.In response, David Wallace, SLC’s deputy chief executive, said the new online service was the result of extensive consultation with its users, who wanted more up-to-date information about their outstanding balance, as well as holding two meetings with Lewis’s organisation.“We think we’ve done a really good job here for customers, the feedback we’ve had was good. So we were really disappointed at the reaction from Moneysavingexpert,” Wallace said. “We’re providing the balances that the customers have asked for, and it certainly hasn’t put off any prospective students from taking out student funding for higher education. So we think we are doing the decent thing for customers by listening to them and responding.”SLC said the online service provided context “on the unique nature of student loans and the conditions of repayment” and makes clear that graduates should carefully consider their financial circumstances before making voluntary repayments.“The quick payment option also makes it easier for the small proportion of customers who have someone – such as a parent – making repayments on their behalf and for overseas customers who are required to make monthly repayments,” a spokesperson for SLC said.Moneysavingexpert’s analysis found that while the new site has added more explanation on how income-contingent loans work, too much emphasis was placed on making extra repayments, which facility is offered to users even before they log on. “Whether the explainers will be seen and understood against the noise of the numbers provided is questionable,” it said.Lewis said that despite his efforts to provide clearer explanations, backed by the Russell Group of leading research universities and the government’s review of student funding led by Philip Augar, the SLC persisted in highlighting “this scary, but often irrelevant” outstanding loan figure.“So I was flabbergasted to see they went live with a ‘quick repayment’ system, without detailed warnings, cautions and explanation. That’s irresponsible and dangerous beyond belief – it’s doubling down on the damage.”Wallace said a “technical glitch” meant that information about future repayments had not been displayed when users logged in to make additional repayments but that had been fixed after Lewis’s organisation had pointed it out.SLC administers loans and repayments for nine million current and former students. Students who started university in England last year are forecast to accrue more than £40,000 in loans from the SLC, on average, by graduation. Last year the company’s income-contingent loans totalled £140bn, more than double the amount of five years earlier."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/22e94686d21919711b6ccfb8f1e7008c4e188ec0/0_513_7435_4460/master/7435.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=012b5ba824d41eed681d2846421ec632","title":"natasha abrahart parents launch legal action against university of bristol","story":"Parents of Natasha Abrahart claim she was victim of negligence and disability discriminationThe parents of a student with severe social anxiety who took her own life on the day she was scheduled to face “the ordeal” of an important oral test have launched legal proceedings against her university, claiming she was the victim of negligence and disability discrimination.Natasha Abrahart, a student at University of Bristol, was found dead at the age of 20 in her flat after she failed to attend a “laboratory conference” involving a presentation to almost 50 fellow students and staff in a 329-seat lecture theatre.Her parents, Robert and Margaret Abrahart, have filed a county court claim alleging the university fell short in its duty to “to take reasonable care” of their daughter’s “wellbeing, health and safety”.They argue the university did not do enough to support Abrahart when staff had known for six months that she suffered from panic attacks and was struggling.Robert Abrahart, from Nottingham, told the : “Natasha was bright and academically able. Her self-esteem was rooted in her academic ability and achievement. However, because of the discrimination that we believe she suffered, Natasha became acutely and increasingly distressed. The fear of failing, not performing, or not progressing on the course affected her deeply and she became pre-occupied by feelings of worthlessness.“We believe that the university should have done more to support Natasha throughout her second year. The pain of losing Natasha is something that will never leave us.”In the claim, Abrahart’s parents say she had three suicidal episodes before she died and feared losing her place on the course if she could not complete the laboratory conference.Abrahart’s parents believe the university is in denial over their daughter’s death and taking legal action is the only way they can get to the  truth of what happened. She is one of 11 Bristol university students who have taken their own lives in the last four years.Abrahart added: “We know nothing will bring her back but we feel the University of Bristol should at least acknowledge what happened in the lead-up to Natasha’s death, show some remorse or regret, and apologise. Until that happens how will the university prevent the same mistakes that we believe occurred from happening again? We will continue to campaign to ensure that other students don’t endure the suffering Natasha did.”Their claim is for disability discrimination under the Equality Act 2010 and negligence. The family’s lawyer, Gus Silverman, of Irwin Mitchell, said: “The university owed Natasha legal duties not to cause her psychological harm and to ensure its assessment regime didn’t discriminate against her as a disabled student. Natasha’s parents are firmly of the view that the university didn’t meet these legal duties.“Natasha’s parents have had to turn to the civil courts to seek justice for their daughter. They are determined to try to improve the standard of care provided to vulnerable students around the country.”A university spokesperson said Abrahart’s death in April 2018 “deeply affected” everyone but particularly her family and friends, as well as the staff and students who knew her best.The spokesperson said: “Legal proceedings regarding Natasha’s death are now under way, and so it would be inappropriate for the university to comment further at the present time.“We recognise mental health as one of the biggest public health issues, which is why we have adopted an institute-wide approach to foster an inclusive and safe environment for all students and staff. We are also committed to reducing the stigma around mental health and creating space for it to permeate through every aspect of the university’s culture and experience.”The university argues that staff repeatedly tried to help Abrahart and measures were in place to help her to continue on her course.It points out that at the conclusion of the student’s inquest last year the coroner did not criticise the university but flagged up concerns over the role of the Avon and Wiltshire Mental Health Partnership NHS trust (AWP), whose care she was under, for not putting in place a management plan that would have given her hope and managed her risk.In the county court claim, Abrahart’s parents say the coroner ruled the adequacy of support provided by the university to be outside the scope of the hearing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/884c16c3490b5b97485a30323814eb4a6313d950/0_160_6016_3611/master/6016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9394a121f22805365eb4ba012e1407da","title":"share your photos from the big butterfly count 2020","story":"As the world’s biggest butterfly count gets underway once again, we’d like to see photos of what you’ve seenToday sees the start of the UK’s annual Big Butterfly Count, organised by Butterfly Conservation, which asks people to spend 15 minutes in an outdoor space and count the amount and type of butterflies, and some day-flying moths, they see.We’d like to hear about the butterflies that you spot too – and we’d also like to see photographs, if you’re lucky enough to capture them.

We saw this in the 2008 financial crisis emissions very quickly returned to pre-crisis levels,” she added.One of the greatest threats to the UK’s carbon savings this year is a surge in demand for road travel as more people opt to use passenger vehicles over public transport to avoid contact with the coronavirus.Another threat to carbon reductions in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak is the number of people who may continue to work from home during the winter months.“We have been lucky that lockdown has happened during warm summer months. If there was a second lockdown during the winter, homes would rely on gas-heating to keep their homes warm all day, which would produce far more emissions than during the summer. It would probably counter most of the savings from less commuting,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/309e4082f1c877a00e47674327532483435bbeef/0_66_4132_2479/master/4132.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9ec35aad664b58d9c699f78db8eaa28f","title":"red kites thriving in england 30 years after reintroduction","story":"Three decades after 13 were flown in by jet from Spain, there are nearly 2,000 breeding pairs of red kites across the country In July 1990, 13 red kites had to be flown by British Airways jet from Spain before they could grace the skies of the Chilterns.Thirty years on, nearly 2,000 breeding pairs of red kites display their distinctive forked tails as they soar over virtually every English county, in what has been hailed as one of the most successful reintroduction projects in the world.As conservationists celebrated the anniversary of the once persecuted bird of prey’s revival, Tony Juniper, chair of Natural England, the government’s conservation watchdog, said there was “pretty strong momentum” for other reintroductions.The last British “sea eagle” was shot in 1918. Birds were reintroduced to the Highlands from Norway 45 years ago. Their population increased very slowly at first but there are now 123 breeding pairs, and has inspired lucrative ecotourism on the island of Mull.After being successfully returned to dozens of European countries, an official trial began in Knapdale, Scotland. But unofficial releases on the River Tay in Scotland and the River Otter in Devon have seen the animal multiply. Scientific studies have shown its dams are habitat for fish, amphibians, invertebrates and birds, while also storing floodwater and filtering pollutants.Although the historical evidence for storks being regular breeding birds in Britain is debated, wild birds have been introduced on the Knepp Estate, West Sussex, breeding successfully for the first time this summer.This butterfly fell extinct in 1979 but was reintroduced with caterpillars from Sweden. It took several decades to re-establish but the world’s biggest population now flies in Somerset and Gloucestershire.This bumblebee became extinct in 1988 and specimens from Sweden were returned to land around Dungeness, Kent, in 2011. So far, it appears not to have re-established itself but dozens of local farmers are now using bee-friendly methods that have seen other rare bumblebee species increase in the area.A species only found at northerly latitudes, with a more pointed head and longer legs than the common frog, it became extinct in Britain in 1995. Specimens from Sweden have since been successfully returned to two sites in Norfolk.A rare heathland species once in danger of extinction, it has been successfully re-established at dozens of new sites in its Surrey-Hampshire-Dorset stronghold and on dunes in Wales, Kent and Devon and Cornwall.Last year Natural England issued licences to allow five white-tailed eagles to be placed on the Isle of Wight as part of a long-term project to bring breeding pairs of this large raptor back to England, following its successful reintroduction to Scotland. The government’s 25-year environment plan commits it to reintroducing species where there are environmental benefits.Juniper said he had “enormous high hopes” that the eagles – which have since been tracked spending weeks in Oxfordshire and flying high over London – would follow the success of the red kites. Projects to return beavers and white storks are also under way.“People are looking at many other species, not only birds, but also mammals and invertebrates, to put back some of the living fabric of our islands that’s been depleted over many years from habitat destruction, persecution and chemical pollution,” said Juniper. “As we face the global nature crisis, this is extremely important for people to know – that it is not a one-way street and we can reverse the flow of these historic trends if we put our minds to it.”Persecution over centuries and egg collectors saw red kite numbers drop to a few breeding pairs in central Wales. The species slowly recovered in its Welsh stronghold, but in 1990 only 38 chicks were raised there.Its Chilterns reintroduction by Natural England, the RSPB and other partners saw it spread along the M40 corridor, eating carrion found on the motorway. By 1996, at least 37 pairs were breeding in southern England. Today, there are more than 10,000 red kites across Britain.The beavers that were returned to Scotland are now a protected native species again. In England, although a scientific trial of beavers living freely on the River Otter in Devon this year concluded that they delivered enormous benefits, not just for bioersity, but flood management, water quality and tourism, the government has yet to authorise their return.A decision on beavers in England had been due by the end of the summer but Juniper said he couldn’t give a timetable because of delays caused by the coronavirus crisis.Juniper said “a very eloquent case” had been made by many conservationists for the return of the beaver, but other candidates for reintroduction into England, such as lynx and wildcats, could take longer.“There are some candidates that naturally rise to the top of the list and others because of the sheer complexity of the challenges at hand, such as the lynx, that will require some more thought yet,” he said.Another reintroduced species, the white stork, has fledged chicks in the wild for the first time in Britain since a pair were recorded nesting on St Giles cathedral in Edinburgh in 1416. Nests on the Knepp estate in West Sussex produced the first wild-born British chicks this summer.But some conservationists have argued that there is little evidence that white storks were ever widespread in Britain, and questioned whether enough work had been done to assess the impact that the predatory bird might have on rare amphibian and reptile species.Juniper said he had no reservations about the white stork’s return. “Like any generalist predator, they are going to thrive or not, depending on how much there is to eat. If there isn’t much to eat, there won’t be many of them. What we want is both – predator and prey in healthy, dynamic ecosystems.“Some of these big animals like white storks and white-tailed eagles become ambassadors for a far bigger discussion around nature recovery. If those animals are thriving, then we know we have a healthy natural environment.”According to Juniper, the new post-Brexit farm subsidy system could be a tool to deliver this.

But the company said the pandemic had prompted many people to look for new ways of earning cash, and that, amid a looming jobs crisis, growing numbers were on the hunt for opportunities to supplement their income.It said the spike in sign-ups came amid predictions that the economic impacts of Covid-19 would be “disproportionately felt by women”.Sian Erith, who lives in Norfolk, kickstarted her Avon business during lockdown as restrictions forced her to take a break from a career in hairdressing. Using social media to generate online sales at a time when personal selling was not possible, Sian said she earned £600 in her first three weeks.Avon was founded in 1886 by David McConnell, a travelling book salesman who found that female customers – who often answered the door because their husbands were at work – were more interested in the free perfume samples he offered as an additional perk. McConnell recruited women to act as sales agents for the products he mixed from an office in New York.Avon’s UK business launched in 1959, and the first “Ding dong, Avon calling” TV adverts aired in 1964, and it soon became a British catchphrase.The rise of social media has fuelled rapid change in the beauty market, helping to launch brands backed by online influencers, such as Rihanna’s Fenty Beauty and Kylie Jenner’s Kylie Cosmetics, which are now challenging the big, established names.However, the company – now owned by the Brazilian beauty group Natura, also the owner of The Body Shop – remains one of the biggest names in the world of “direct selling” – which does not use shops – and claims to have a huge reach in the UK. It claims to be one of the top three beauty brands in the country “with six million women seeing an Avon brochure every three weeks”.Angela Cretu, Avon’s chief executive, said: “As the recession tightens its grasp on communities in the wake of Covid-19, people are looking for new ways to earn.” She added that the company was preparing for “a tidal wave” of new sign-ups.Cretu also said that many of the reps played a crucial role within their communities, as they often provided support to vulnerable iniduals by picking up prescriptions and helping with shopping."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7fa65e277ef5b17e7c24ff9e1dee26517d305f6e/0_168_4000_2399/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cb2f099972fb9547cf66f08581580d44","title":"haley joel osment on the sixth sense a lot of child actors have a positive experience","story":"His role as a cherubic 10-year-old with a classic catchphrase made him world famous. He talks about how he coped with the early attention, working with Kevin Spacey, and why he loves playing bad guysHaley Joel Osment thought he was finished for the day. It was 1998 and the 10-year-old was shooting The Sixth Sense, directed by M Night Shyamalan. With 10 minutes left on set, they wanted to squeeze in a short scene. It required Osment’s terrified character, who, memorably, sees dead people, to confront a bloody ghost. Osment had to get into the right mindset, fast. The young actor threw himself against a door, again and again, until he was sufficiently shaken. “If they’d known I was going to do it, they probably would have stopped me,” he says of Shyamalan and the other adults on set. “It came to me spontaneously – and I guess it worked.”I see little of that intensity in the 32-year-old man facing me via Zoom. Still boyish-looking, despite a dark beard, Osment is upbeat and quick to laugh. He returned to his home town of Los Angeles last autumn, after 13 years in New York, and found this house a week before lockdown, when he was shooting a forthcoming series of Goliath for Amazon. After the extraordinary success of The Sixth Sense – a box office phenomenon, his performance lauded by critics and rewarded with an Oscar nomination, while his character’s most famous line quickly became a catchphrase – he has enjoyed a different kind of career lately. He works steadily, on screen but somehow under the radar, probably not recognised as the Sixth Sense kid by most of his audiences.In recent years, he has appeared on TV in What We Do in the Shadows, The Kominsky Method, Silicon Valley, Teachers and The Boys. Last year he had a supporting role in the Ted Bundy film Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile. Since lockdown, he says, there has been “endless opportunity for quiet reflection at home”, including on his time as a child star.Though his father, Eugene, was an actor (and ran a theatre on Santa Monica Boulevard), Osment fell into acting by chance, after being spotted at the age of four in Ikea. His first screen appearance was in an ad for Pizza Hut in 1993, which led to him being approached by the casting director for Forrest Gump. Forrest Jr was only a small part for five-year-old Osment, but his screen test with Tom Hanks still circulates on social media, thanks to their heartwarming double act – and Osment’s cuteness.Shyamalan had worried that Osment was too much of a “cherub” to cast in The Sixth Sense. But the boy was also serious-minded and precocious. For Osment’s final audition of three for The Sixth Sense, he wore a suit. The director has said he was moved to tears by the boy’s vulnerability and depth, especially in his delivery of the now-classic line: “I see dead people.”“I’d been working with it for such a long time, the material was really ready by the time I saw him,” Osment says. His dad had helped him to prepare for the audition and shaped his early career. “His relationship to the craft was so resistant to doing stuff that didn’t have a purpose and wasn’t quality work,” says Osment. “There’s always going to be plenty of opportunities to bail out for a big pay cheque … so to have someone like that, who really cared about protecting artistic value before I was old enough to understand what that meant, was such an important influence.”On set, Osment was also bolstered by Shyamalan and his co-star, Bruce Willis. “I don’t think I could have done it, had there not been that sense that they believed in me.” Although Shyamalan himself was only 28, and under pressure to deliver on his multimillion dollar script, he did not push that on to his cast, says Osment. “I remember him dribbling a basketball from his director’s chair between lighting changes. He just projected calm.”Willis, too, was convinced of the film’s success, telling Shyamalan that he had felt the same way in making Pulp Fiction. There was the sense that “we were building this story together”, Osment says. In those pivotal early years, he says he never felt manipulated, or negatively motivated to perform. “That’s why it’s still something that I love doing, almost 30 years later.”Then Osment found himself back at school, where “the big news of fifth grade” was Nintendo 64 and a new Star Wars film. It was an undeniable “shift in gear”, he says, but one that felt natural to navigate. He was not treated as a celebrity and because The Sixth Sense was classified as unsuitable for children under the age of 13, he says: “Most kids in my class didn’t even see it.”Osment’s younger sister, Emily, 28, had “a way tougher path” to fame, says Osment, playing Miley Cyrus’s best friend, Lilly, on the Disney Channel’s Hannah Montana. “That show was squarely aimed towards creating a mania in that age group. She had to deal with a lot more strange invasions of privacy, not being able to have a normal school life. And what exacerbated all of that was she had to be on social media. I resisted until I was, like, 27.”In 2006, aged 18, Osment moved to New York to study experimental theatre at New York University. His parents wanted him to go to college and Osment wanted the college experience. “I did work that practically nobody saw for a long time, which was not a great career move – but, ultimately, was important for me to figure out whether this was what I truly wanted to do for the rest of my life,” he says.In 2008, he made his Broadway debut, playing a heroin addict in a revival of David Mamet’s American Buffalo, to mixed reviews. Post-graduation, in 2011, a spate of oddballs and villains followed, from an obnoxious millionaire in the film Entourage to a greasy-haired Nazi in Kevin Smith’s Yoga Hosers and a virgin teacher in Sex Ed. “That was definitely a very fun period of playing a lot of bad guys,” says Osment. He agrees it might have been a belated rebellion against his angelic childhood image: in fact, Osment says, he grew a beard “to try to hide in public. That didn’t really work at all.”His public path through adolescence was “free of major indiscretion”, as the New Yorker approvingly put it. In 2006, driving while drunk, he overturned his car, for which he was fined, sentenced to rehabilitation and put on probation for three years. But that was the “terrible mistake” of an arrogant teenager in car-centric Los Angeles, says Osment. “It could not have had less to do with Hollywood.”The popular narrative of the child star may be the “spectacular blowup”, he agrees, “but I think the percentage of people having a positive experience working as children is much higher than most people imagine.” You just don’t hear about the child actors who “move on to something else that works for them”, or who have such long careers their youthful roles recede in the rear view, says Osment.“Being an actor, you can never count on things being smash successes all the time. I remember having that feeling with The Sixth Sense – like, ‘It’s not always gonna be like that.’” He hopes his next move will be behind the scenes, into writing and directing, which was part of his motivation for returning to Los Angeles, he says.Even as he begins the next stage of his career, he does not resent being asked about the past. “I’m lucky to have a positive relationship with those periods that can sometimes be difficult for other people.” When it comes to his early success, he says: “I feel like I’m always building on it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89277de4cf05925126f9ec302218a4c49d530469/346_166_1417_850/master/1417.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6b1fdddc7a2091206b4eceaa86a5b43e","title":"arsenal mikel arteta fa cup manchester city europa league","story":"Mikel Arteta believes convincing players to join Arsenal will not be difficult even if their impressive FA Cup semi-final win against Manchester City does not lead to European qualification.A goal in each half from Pierre-Emerick Aubameyangknocked out the holders . If Arsenal go on to beat Chelsea in the FA Cup final, Europa League football will be secured and they also have an outside chance of qualifying via the league. Arteta is bullish about strengthening in the summer window, regardless of whether they qualify for Europe or not. “I don’t think we should bring players that need a lot of convincing,” he said. “The feeling I get when I talk to a lot of people is that the players still want to come to the club because of the history, the way we do things, our values, the fans we have, our stadium. That’s a really attractive thing, that’s my feeling.”“Every game has a different plan. We have to be very analytical and realistic with our options, where they are and how we can make them better. The resilience we showed at the back was enormous and the efficiency up top as well, because you need that. I am really happy with that.”Guardiola had billed the semi-final as an important mental test before the Champions League last-16 second leg with Real Madrid next month, which his side start with a 2-1 advantage. City have secured second place in the league so the manager has to ensure his players remain fresh.“What the players have done is incredible. But we were in a FA Cup semi-final – so we have to play the whole 90 minutes and we played just the second 45. In the first half everything was sloppy and not the right speed for this kind of game, when you want to reach a final.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b041a05d38b1cdc34a057f987edfea78383dad48/0_69_6840_4104/master/6840.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=84dc67910342a8ea29e167ab2ca253ce","title":"de geas decline continues as uniteds fa cup chance evades his grasp","story":"The Spanish goalkeeper handed Chelsea at least one goal at Wembley and his manager may soon have a decision to makeAmid the chaos of Spain’s World Cup in 2018, perhaps the greatest casualty was David de Gea. The days when his heroics repeatedly papered over the cracks at Manchester United feel a long time ago. It can be debated whether De Gea was at fault for the first and third goals, but he was clearly to blame for the second and, in those two moments, United’s long unbeaten run disappeared, and Chelsea’s passage to the FA Cup final was secured.Frank Lampard had left out Kepa Arrizabalaga for his Cup keeper Willy Caballero, although given no goalkeeper has conceded a higher proportion of the shots on target he’s faced since Opta began collecting the data, he may have done so with a sense of relief. Ole Gunnar Solskjær will perhaps wish he had done something similar. Although he made a number of changes to a putative first-choice lineup, both a reflection of the fact his side had played Crystal Palace on Thursday and an indication that Champions League qualification remains the priority, he preferred De Gea to Sergio Romero, who had played in the four previous rounds.Quite what happened in Russia will perhaps never be known, but the De Gea who came back from the World Cup two years ago was not the same keeper who went. It’s easy to come up with theories, very hard to know just what can have caused such a deflation. The sight of De Gea’s long, sad face, made even more mournful by his preacher’s beard, ruing another error as he slaps the turf has become grimly familiar.Rather it’s the positional sense and, perhaps, as Pep Guardiola highlighted with Joe Hart, the capacity to shift the ball quickly that eludes him. Thrust into a high-pressure situation, asked to fulfil a role with which he was not entirely comfortable, with a last-minute change of manager, it’s as though De Gea suffered a complete disintegration of his self-belief, something manifested in the Cristiano Ronaldo shot that slithered under him in Spain’s first game.Or perhaps it’s that without the carrot of a possible move to Real Madrid, De Gea’s focus has slipped a little. Perhaps there’s a physical issue, although he is only 29. But whatever the reason, De Gea has gone from being arguably the best keeper in the league, a beacon of reliability who was capable, as in that fabled game at the Emirates in December 2017 when he made 14 saves, of denying an opponent almost single-handed, to being somebody from whom mistakes are no longer a surprise, somebody who is in danger of becoming a liability.Not that De Gea was the only issue with United. The change in formation (admittedly to the 3-4-1-2 that so troubled Chelsea in the league at Stamford Bridge in February) and personnel will be blamed for United’s disjointedness, but they had been scratchy against both Southampton and Palace last week. It may be nothing more complicated than fatigue.However, the fact remains that Chelsea would not have won so comfortably, and may not have won at all, had it not been for De Gea’s error. Twice he was beaten by near-post touches on crosses. Neither was easy to save, and the second was unexpected given it came off Harry Maguire, but they’re the sort of reflex block at which De Gea used to specialise. The first particularly, as it spun in off De Gea’s shin, seemed almost a physical representation of his diminished status, as though his leg would somehow have had greater magnitude in previous seasons and made sufficient contact to kick the ball to safety rather than merely slowing its progress over the line.The second goal was a howler at any level, a straight, low, Mason Mount shot of no great velocity that crept through De Gea’s arms. That’s the image that will stay in the mind, and perhaps make Solskjær ponder a change. Is De Gea’s form gone for good? And does his preference for a low block fit the sort of football the manager envisages his side playing in the future?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cebd4e239f7a3ae6c736ec6f8b371212de2e801f/399_61_1780_1068/master/1780.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=60bc01fbb629a14868c687fdee029e3e","title":"harry kane is really special for tottenham says jose mourinho","story":"José Mourinho praised the “special” impact of Harry Kane after the striker’s second match-winning performance of the week brought two goals against Leicester and gave Tottenham a significant boost in their chase for a Europa League spot.Kane had scored twice at Newcastle on Wednesday and his latest pair came alongside a marvellous ball to Son Heung-min for the opening goal in Spurs’ 3-0 win. Kane has now scored 23 goals in club football during a season that appeared to be over when he tore a hamstring at Southampton on New Year’s Day.“Everybody thinks – I think, you think – he’s a fantastic player, and Tottenham is so lucky to have him because he is the player and the person and the Tottenham boy,” Mourinho said. “All this together makes him a really special player for us who probably wouldn’t be so special playing for another team. He’s really special for us and we want him to be happy. He wants victories and he wants to score goals.“I’m so happy that after such a difficult injury it’s going in a direction where he will end this season perfectly, and he will take that into next season.”Spurs have now taken 13 points from five games and the 3-1 humbling at Sheffield United on 2 July appears something of a watershed. “The team is being a team,” Mourinho said. “Even against Sheffield we were a team – a bad team but a team. I think the team is understanding better the principles of playing how we want to do, and I think it is a good step.”Mourinho explained in detail that he had sought to allow Leicester’s centre-backs, in particular Ryan Bennett and Wes Morgan, to advance with the ball and move out of their “comfort zone”, with the expectation Spurs could exploit the space behind. It worked perfectly and Brendan Rodgers, who may yet lead Leicester to the Champions League with a victory against Manchester United on Sunday, was left to lament a performance he felt was “a little bit leggy” at times."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7df6c6a0f4b8cdb488a500a55d05b6897e51aac5/0_62_6016_3610/master/6016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=24fff6487a4d99f3ed39f84d96a977cc","title":"shared screen time can help five unexpected ways to really connect with your kids","story":"From toddlers to teens, here’s how to keep the lockdown closeness thrivingAnnabel Rosenhead, a psychotherapist who’s co-authored Happy Confident Me with parenting coach Nadim Saad, reveals five simple but effective ways to keep connecting:1. Talk franklyFrom teachers wearing masks at school to cancelled holidays, coming out of lockdown can mean tricky conversations and how you approach these topics can make all the difference. Rosenhead explains: “Our children – whatever age they are – are our mirrors. So, before you talk to them, check in with yourself. ‘Am I stressed? Overwhelmed? Anxious?’ and address what you need, even if it’s just five minutes in a room by yourself. Because it’s not what you’re saying but how you’re saying it that’s important.“Then, think about what you’re going to tell your children (don’t just blunder in) and get on the same level as them – difficult conversations are often best had when you’re doing something together, such as going for a walk or playing snap. With a four-year-old, it could be colouring in, while for teenagers it may be gaming together or cooking.”3. Let them take over“The way children have been really affected by the pandemic – from younger ones right the way through to young adults – is a lack of agency. As a child, you don’t have much control anyway but now that’s shrunk right down,” says Rosenhead. “Any sense of independence at school is no longer happening, which can also affect their self-esteem and mental wellbeing. So you need to counter this with connection, communication and giving them their agency back.“For example, I’ve been going on daily bike rides with my 10-year-old daughter and I now let her cycle on the road, which I never would have done before lockdown. I let her choose the route, even when she’s got me riding all over the place it’s giving them the opportunities to decide things.” So from navigating with your map app to picking items for online shopping or Googling holiday destinations for the future, let your kids take over some big decisions.5. Do something brand newSearching out recipes for sourdough starters, asking Alexa how to plant tomatoes, downloading Couch to 5K … hobbies have come into their own in lockdown. “Shared experiences are enormously bonding and learning together is a great leveller,” recommends Rosenhead. “Children and teenagers are so used to being told what to do but if you’re both out and about learning something new, you’re doing it as equals. These things give a sense of togetherness and will build memories.” So, yes, studying “How to pogo” videos in the park creates an important parent-child connection. “Hopefully, this time together will be one of the good things our children will take with them into the future,” says Rosenhead.From helping your kids stay connected with their friends to sharing time together as they acquaint you with the intricacies of TikTok, getting the most from your mobile data has never been more important.Keep connecting with our unlimited data plans.

Then, coronavirus arrived and working from home became vital to keeping many businesses afloat.So, how can you convince your employer to make flexible working the new normal? Here’s the evidence you need …Working from home worksA global pandemic is nobody’s idea of a perfect backdrop for a major change in working practices, but in spite of the obstacles, millions of office workers have transformed into home workers and our jobs are still getting done. Twitter’s CEO Jack Dorsey has even told his 5,000 employees they can choose to work at home forever. “We want employees to be able to work where they feel most creative and productive,” explained a spokesperson. Bhutta isn’t surprised. “OK, we didn’t choose this situation,” she says. “But flexibility is clearly available in many more jobs than had been advertised on that basis. We need employers to ask themselves, has there really been a significant drop in productivity? I think they’ll find employees have been doing their best in very challenging circumstances.”People are working smarterA huge amount of time during the office working day is wasted on interruptions and unnecessary meetings. “We all know the stress of presenteeism, of having to sit in a meeting room for an hour while someone drones on – it drains activity,” says Tracey Follows, founder of the strategy consultancy Futuremade. “Working from home allows you to take control of how and when you use your energy,” she says. This in turn can lead to increased efficiency.It makes employees happy You want to jump on a video call from the park? Download documents at the beach? Thanks to Vodafone’s unlimited data, you can. Helping employees to achieve a better work-life balance is an obvious way to support them and encourage their loyalty. “Flexible working means the employer gets an engaged, happy employee who is able to concentrate on their job while they’re working because they can also plan for the school pick-up or to visit elderly relatives,” says Bhutta. “When people have autonomy they are loyal and committed, which leads to benefits in terms of productivity.”The traditional office is outdatedOne look at the deserted skyscrapers in our cities shows that it’s time to retire any romantic attachment to Mad Men-style central offices. Especially now that screen partitions between desks, regular deep cleaning and one-way traffic systems will need to be implemented to help prevent future waves of coronavirus. Offices could well transform into occasional spaces where people meet for training days or to collaborate on projects. Even the CEO of Barclays Bank, Jes Staley, has acknowledged that “the notion of putting 7,000 people in a building may be a thing of the past”. While, sadly, this might signal the end of the office biscuit tin, it could save employers hundreds of millions pounds in annual office costs.Businesses can access more talentSaying goodbye to the traditional office means an opportunity to welcome in new staff, talent and ideas from all over the world. “Flexibility opens up the workforce to many more people,” says Follows. “It gives opportunities for talented people who live far from big cities, who are from different socioeconomic backgrounds or have disabilities. It’s an opportunity to be grasped.”Employers get to be human tooDuring this crisis, thanks to all the video meetings, we’ve got to know our colleagues and bosses as actual people who have overloaded bookshelves, home schooled kids and cute puppies in their lives. Employers have become relatable, not just an intimidating presence at board meetings. “Seeing people’s kids and dogs popping up on video calls has meant that people’s responsibilities have become visible in the world of work, in a way that they weren’t before,” says Bhutta. “It’s been a real opportunity to see people beyond their role at work. And that’s something we don’t want to turn the clock back on.”From uninterrupted video meetings to deciding when and where you work best, getting the most from your mobile data has never been more important.Keep connecting with our unlimited data plans.

And it’s a trend that’s set to continueIt doesn’t take a statistician to work out that we’ve all been online a lot in the last few months. From home schooling and streaming to ensuring your household has all the essentials (which may or may not have been purchased from Deliveroo), the number of gigabytes we’ve used and the time we’ve spent online has ticked ever upwards.But exactly how much more are we online now? What’s using up most of our data? And what will happen as lockdown ends? Turns out it does take statisticians to work all that out – which is why we’ve looked at their reports to compile this list of five facts about you, the internet and your data usage. You’re welcome.1. In lockdown, we’ve each been online for four hours and two minutes a dayYou always knew you had it in you to be a record breaker, didn’t you? You were right. According to Ofcom’s new Online Nation 2020 report, an annual survey looking at how the UK’s internet usage is changing, the four hours and two minutes we’ve averaged online during lockdown is a new high. And it’s an increase of 37 minutes a day per online adult compared with January 2020.Even without lockdown, we’ve been using the internet more than ever before. In the past year before we were locked down, we were online for 17 minutes a day more than the previous year. The biggest users? 18 to 24 year olds, who logged on for an hour more each day than adults overall.“That’s one of the more interesting stats that we found,” says Jory MacKay, RescueTime’s marketing manager. “This means that essentially each time you look at your phone you’ve got a 5050 chance of setting off a chain reaction of phone check ins.”5. Why unlimited data deals are great for familiesYou know that feeling when your work Zoom call’s audio goes so robotic and stuttery it’s like a Daft Punk remix? And on investigation, it turns out that the rest of your household is variously streaming video, online gaming and generally draining so much of your bandwidth that they might as well have attached a tap and be dispensing pints of it in the street?“As households are doing their learning, communicating, streaming – everything – online, that puts more pressure on the home internet,” says Gilani. “One answer is to have your own separate connection – whether through your phone or a dedicated mobile broadband connection – which means you can do what you need to do without interrupting what the rest of the family does. You can then get on with client calls while another family member is playing Fortnite.” In a pandemic, these are good problems to have.Staying connected has never been more vital – and it often seems that everyone in the family wants to be online at the same time.

For her, this was a great treat a widow since before we were born, she loved to be with us, and she loved the feeling she was treating us. But we were perhaps a bit more ambivalent. Our treat came with… complications. Granny was blind, and new places were tricky for her (not that she’d ever admit it). Additionally, she was a terrible snorer. In a holiday park chalet only twice as big as a bus shelter, the chances of us getting a decent night’s sleep – or any sleep at all – were slimmer than a Wham bar (original raspberry flavour).But we’ll come back to Wham bars. The point is that we went to Withernsea, in the East Riding of Yorkshire. This was not a glamorous place. At the time, I’d barely heard of it – why, I wondered, couldn’t we go to Bridlington? – and in the decades since, I’ve never met a single other person who has ever been to the town, let alone stayed there for a whole week. Google it, and you’ll find that its greatest claim to fame is the fact that it’s the birthplace of the actress Kay Kendall – and who’s heard of her, these days? (Please don’t write in I adore Kay Kendall, though perhaps not quite enough to visit Withernsea’s lighthouse, which now houses an exhibition devoted to her.) But I digress. No, Withernsea, was not glamorous. On the first day, I gazed out at the gunmetal North Sea, and thought sulkily of those friends lucky enough to be taken to Spain. God, life was so unfair.And yet, I’ve never forgotten that place, with its pier towers that look like the turrets of a castle. It’s always with me. I cherish the memory of my granny, who let us have ketchup with lamb chops, and I tend to hold it (meanly, perhaps) in my mind when I hear spoiled 21st-century children talking about their all-expenses paid holidays abroad with mummy and daddy, as if such things were a human right. Above all, though, it has for me become a kind of symbol even, perhaps, an allegory. Those chilly, haphazard days, at once both quite boring and replete with illicit delights, are the British summer holiday of yore in microcosm: its absolute crumminess its ineffable perfection. Thinking of one particular picnic we had on its wide, dun-coloured beach, our skin goosepimpled and our toes glazed with damp sand, I’m apt to come over all Marcel Proust (save for the fact that where he needed a plump madeleine, shaped like a scallop and soaked in tea, fully to stir his remembrances, I ideally require a homemade corned beef sandwich, a bag of Walkers French Fries and, for afters, a Blue Riband wafer). An exquisite pleasure invades my senses, and for a brief moment, yes, the vicissitudes of life become indifferent to me, its disasters (almost) innocuous.Don’t tell me you don’t know what I’m on about. Especially in this moment. For haven’t our thoughts turned even more than usually to the past during this long, sad lockdown? My sense is that many of us, if not most, are retreating, to various degrees, into a certain nostalgia. In large part, this is because the future is so uncertain. There’s comfort in how things used to be seeking it out is a perfectly natural thing to do in a time of collective mourning. But perhaps, too, it has to do with the fact that the future is going to look quite a lot like the past, at least for a while. This summer, after five decades of package holidays and low-cost flights, most of us will be holidaying at home – just like we used to. (As the former MP Nicholas Soames puts it, albeit with some overstatement, in British Summer Time Begins, Ysenda Maxtone Graham’s new book about the long school holidays, once upon a time “no one went abroad, except to fight a war”.) People, then, are getting ready: for bad weather, bad roads and, quite possibly, bad food.If you’re my age, and from my kind of background, you remember both states: the nirvana of, say, one’s first visit to France, with its remarkable yogurts and its even more remarkable cheese – and the rather less transcendent experience of “breaking your journey” to the Lake District with roadside Dairylea cheese triangles and an orange Club that you would try not to throw up later as your dad made heavy weather of every gear change, and your mum tried not to cry on account of her map reading having been described as “absolutely bloody rubbish”. I was nine when I first went to France on holiday, and 25 before I stepped foot in any other foreign country (save for Israel, but that doesn’t count because we lived there). The vast majority of my childhood holidays were spent in the UK: at the seaside with my granny in a cottage in Northumberland and at other rented properties (see also, youth hostels) in the cold, damp north with my mother and stepfather and in a hotel in Cumbria with my dad. Occasionally, my stepfather sends me and my siblings digital versions of the zillions of slides (believe me, they were all the rage at one time) that can be found in his attic, and they always make us hysterical with laughter. The meagreness! The deprivation! The chilblains! It’s like a Monty Python sketch gone wrong. It’s like Oliver Twist, only with baked beans and Orange Maid lollies. (My stepfather, incidentally, used to add curry powder to baked beans, the better to make them taste… more exotic.)Ah, yes. The food. It was quite bad, and quite limited, and yet we enjoyed it so much. Well, sort of. In hotels, it was always the same. To start: fruit juice, soup or pâté with toast. To follow: some kind of roasted meat with some kind of sauce, and soggy veg. Pudding was trifle or (that great multipurpose word) “gateau”. In seaside places, you ate fish and chips. Or… fish and chips. In holiday cottages, it was pretty much like a weekend at home: spaghetti hoops on toast, say, or tinned tomato soup. Camping? Camping was hell. The least comfortable weekend of my life was spent at Ingleborough in North Yorkshire. We went with another family, and they (the lucky bastards) had a camper van, from inside of which they watched us, hot tea and biscuits in their hands, labouring over our guy ropes in the howling wind. Biscuits, by the way, were the ultimate holiday food, easily transportable and consumed in vast quantities in all the above places. Like an army, we marched on them. I was mad for Viscounts and Breakaways (the biscuit equivalents of champagne), but I could also put away my body weight in squashed flies and custard creams (the biscuit equivalents of pomagne).I remember eating out hardly at all. In most places, there was a Chinese restaurant, and an Indian. But for some reason, these were for “locals”, not visitors. I guess there were other places, but either they were very bad indeed, or prohibitively expensive and not for us the casual dining trend, at which it’s so easy to sneer (but I never will), was still far in the future – pizza was fairly hard to come by – and even middle-class families were so much more careful, not to say parsimonious, then. Pubs did food – well, sandwiches and ploughman’s lunches – but if you were a kid, you had to sit outside with your slab of cheddar, your pickled onion and your small cow pat of Branston (guzzling your limeade, you wondered, almost fearfully, what kind of debauchery was taking place within – did it also involve vinegar?). No, away from base, packed lunches were the thing. I still thrill to the phrase “packed lunch”, suggestive as it is of Sandwich Spread and Salt’n’Shake crisps – though there was always the fear that my mother would include a stinky hard-boiled egg (in my memory, she was obsessed with hard-boiled eggs, secreting them away absolutely everywhere, including her handbag).Cut to 2020. Things have changed unimaginably. You never used, for instance, to see much seafood on the coast, bar those little polystyrene pots of sharp cockles to be eaten with a wooden fork what was not battered went elsewhere. These days, though, you’re apt to find it all over the place: in shacks, and cafes, and restaurants even in fish and chip shops, sometimes. The word “langoustine” trips from mouths as easily as the word “saveloy” or “pasty”. Lovely bread is easy to come by. The smallest, rural places often have good delis and proper sandwich shops. And there are good restaurants special restaurants, in fact, whatever certain metropolitan critics might have you believe. I know a place in Northumberland not too far from the dank cottage where we used to spend long afternoons communing with our biscuits, where you can eat the kind of things that used only to be available in France: local meat, game, fish and cheese exceptional salads. Except – I can hardly believe I’m writing this – the cooking is miles better than it would be in France now, where something has gone badly wrong (but that’s another story).And yet… this summer is different, freighted for all of us like no other with complex emotions and the high stakes that are the inevitable result of having been cooped up at home for so long. I think we’ll be after every delight available to us, up to and including lamb shanks and nettle risotto. But we will also want – we will also need – various other things, too: the foods of our pasts, soothing and slightly comical and mostly happily inexpensive.I can’t speak for you, but I know what I want when I’m done with all the moules marinieres and Cotherstone cheese on sourdough, with the smoked this and the salted caramel that. I’m thinking of crinkle-cut chips and FAB ice lollies of shepherd’s pie eaten after walking in the rain, with frozen peas and those little tinned carrots, salty sweet, that I haven’t eaten in thirty years of a parma violet or a Refresher, lodged below my tongue until it melts. I would like to eat a mint Viscount once again, peeling back the foil slowly. I quite fancy – I can hardly believe I’m writing this – some tinned ravioli, or a bag of iced gems, neither of which I particularly liked the first time round. I could really go for a steak pie, followed by a custard slice. At the pub, let there be two bags of scratchings, one for now and the other for one pocket of my waterproof (in the other, inevitably, would be some liquorice comfits). I want to go back to where we began, a Wham bar (original raspberry flavour)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/94f9de38e11cf9f03489544b5fc1f26645808b34/0_124_7457_4475/master/7457.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fb34ce32db26099b9abc246c9358cf58","title":"twice in a lifetime milstones missed in covid19","story":"Can you reschedule a landmark moment? We talk to a musician, a centenarian, a graduate, an engaged couple and an Olympic hopeful about their special occasion that got cancelledI was in the Irish National Rowing Centre in Cork in March, getting ready to go on the water, when I heard that the Olympics were postponed. That was on a Tuesday. I needed a plan. I’m a junior doctor I’d taken time out of medical training for rowing. I got straight on the phone and asked if I could come back to work the next week. Within two hours, I had all the forms filled in. I was on the general medicine ward in Daisy Hill hospital in Newry the following Wednesday.I was doing medicine long before I ever rowed. I gave rowing a go in my second year at Queen’s University in Belfast. I started winning British university titles. I posted good times and came 15th in the men’s single sculls at the World Cup 2018. But you’re not going to make your name coming 15th. I was ready to leave rowing behind me. After my final year of university, I gave the Irish trials one last lash. My coach suggested Ronan Byrne and I would be good double sculls partners. We decided to give it a shot.We had a short period to work together, starting in April last year in Cork. We’d a half-day off every week. I couldn’t drive home and back in that time so it was a massive decision to train full time. I didn’t see my friends, gave up a relationship and had to leave my mum, who is on her own since my dad passed away five years ago. It was validating when we qualified for the Olympics representing Ireland at the World Championships in August. It was something to bring back home and say to people I went away, I’m sorry but this is what I did.Initially I thought I’d be happy just going to the Games for the T-shirt and the experience, but when we started producing results, I realised we were contenders.When the Olympics were postponed, it felt like another year lost. I’m supposed to complete my first 12 months of medical training within a three-year window and I’d already given up a year of that to full-time rowing. I couldn’t change the Olympics postponement, but I could complete my foundational year in medicine before the Olympics in 2021.It was daunting coming back to medicine. I knew I’d be returning to a different healthcare system than the one I left. I’m on the general medicine ward it’s been very busy. It’s good to have a purpose and to go back to something that is appreciated by the public. I still train every day on a rowing machine in the garage and, since lockdown eased, I’ve been back out on the water. But medicine is my job when rowing stops this is what I do. My passion is emergency medicine. I love those situations where you have to act now. I’ll finish on the ward in December and go back to rowing full time ahead of Tokyo 2021. We want to win it.Niamh McManus and David BennettNiamh: We got engaged in Sicily last year. We didn’t want a long engagement. A year felt like enough time to stress about a wedding. We had all the hard stuff done and we had eight weeks to go when it all fell apart.David: Niamh’s mum rang me in early March. She asked me: “Is Niamh out of the room?” She didn’t want her to hear what she was going to say. She thought there was a very good chance the wedding would have to be called off. I was heartbroken, but she was right.Niamh: I knew the wedding wasn’t going to happen. Pulling a wedding apart is not any fun at all. We are mindful of much bigger problems in the world, but this meant a lot to us. I was looking forward to those special moments you get to have with people, like the dress-fitting with my mum. Dave is a personal trainer and a musician he has a music project called Short Pier and the session musicians who play with him were due to be our wedding band. We had to cancel that. We had guests who were travelling from Nigeria and Australia.David: When the cancellation emails came through, it was difficult to take. But we still hoped to get married in the registry office. But when the registry office cancelled, I’d had enough. I said to Niamh, we have our rings, you can wear a nice dress, I can wear something nice. We can go to the river in our neighbourhood where we can exchange vows and rings and, in our eyes, we’ll be married. Nobody can cancel on us because I’m not going to cancel on you. You’re not going to cancel on me. We went ahead on 21 May, our wedding day. And it was magical.Niamh: It was just ourselves. Two dogs watched. A photographer friend came down and took some photos and we got a Thai takeaway afterwards. Our families were a bit sad, They’d love to have been part of it. A lot of people sent cards or rang, which I really didn’t expect. That meant an awful lot. It was so nice to know that in the middle of all their own problems people were thinking about you as well. We’re not legally married so hopefully we’ll be able to do it all together next year. But I feel married now, actually.David: I do, too. Absolutely. Niamh’s my wife.I was always a songwriter and dancer. So when my dance track, Hideaway, became a hit in 2014, it gave me the opportunity to do both. I was performing every day for two years. It became my life. I went from playing open mics in front of five people to being on the stage at Wembley, six months later.I had started writing my next album when I was in a car accident in July 2017. The Uber I was in was knocked off the road. I saw the car coming, curled into a ball and was thrust forward. I suffered a traumatic brain injury. That was the end of that era for me.Brain injuries are painful in ways you can’t explain. I lost balance on the left side of my body. To begin with, I fell down stairs, I had bad headaches and problems with digestion. It’s an injury that no one can see. I had to stay home all the time. If I went out, I would come home in excruciating pain. I could barely do anything.When I first started in music, just getting a song out was a huge milestone. Coming back, it is very different. Last year, I went on this tiny acoustic tour. I kept it small. I gave myself a few months to get my stamina up and I surprised myself. It was amazing. So from there it became about setting new milestones.This year was set to be a big milestone for me. I was getting back to dancing. I’ve been dancing in my new music videos. I’ll dance and then I’ll crash for three days afterwards because my brain is so tired. I navigate my career based on the injury. I was set to open for my friend Lindsey Stirling this summer on her tour. I wasn’t ready to do my own headline tour but I wanted to tour so bad. I knew I could do a 30-minute set if I started rehearsing and building my stamina up. I’d planned to dance and sing in the show. The pandemic ended those plans.I was at home in Toronto when I heard from my manager about the tour cancellation. I wasn’t shocked because by that point almost every tour in the world had been cancelled. But it would have been a big stepping stone on my road to recovery. As hard as it was to hear that the tour was cancelled, I understand the need to keep people safe during the pandemic.It simplified the way I look at the world. When people get bad news they fall fast and hard. I don’t fall any more. I stay on level ground. My health is good now. Each day I’m stronger. I have no idea when we are going to be touring again. My life isn’t the same without it but I look at it this way: I have more time to be a better performer. So when we do tour again, I will be able to do a full show. That will be amazing.Kiesza’s album, Crave, is out on 14 AugustI celebrate my birthday every year. It’s no different turning 100. I just like parties – I like my friends. It was awful not having one this year but I’m saving it up. I’m going to have one as soon as we can get going.Oh, it’s awful right now but when we get free it will be lovely. The first thing I’ll do when it’s over is go for a long drive, up and down the moors. My friend takes me. I love the moors. I was brought up in the New Forest and the drive is as near the New Forest as I can get. It’s like being home.I was born in Croydon. My mother died when I was three. I didn’t know her. I never saw a photograph of her. It would be nice to see that. I had a lovely stepmother, she was wonderful. I’ve been in Devon most of the rest of my life. I had a dairy herd and was a Land Girl on my farm during the war. Then I joined the Women’s Voluntary Service, working in Germany.It is like the war now you can’t do what you want to. But we got used to it then, the same as we get used to it now. I do miss church. I’ve been going to St Mary’s Church in Mariansleigh for 50 years. I never miss a Sunday. I did my own shopping until a few months ago. I still do my own cooking. I do have carers, but I don’t like other people doing my cooking for me.I heard in May that we would be graduating in absentia. It’s a disappointment. You don’t go to Cambridge just to graduate, but there’s a real sense of closure that you get in that moment. You get to be with your friends and be aware that you actually finished a Cambridge degree. That’s quite a solid moment. To have that taken away was deflating.I did my degree in music. I have my gown, so I’ll take some pictures in that. It would be nice to spend some time with my family. I was hoping to have my grandma, Joyce, at graduation. She’s the only grandparent I have left. She came to England from Jamaica in the 1960s and she did everything she could to give her children and her grandchildren a better life. She used to drive me to piano lessons she always loved me to perform. Being her first grandchild to go to university was a big deal for her. I’d hoped that graduation would have been a moment we could have shared.Graduation offers a sense of closure. I was the only black girl in the music faculty throughout my degree. A lot of the time at Cambridge it was easier to not think about how I stood out and felt isolated. Now, it hits home that I did the whole thing on my own. Graduation would have been a big moment, especially considering some of the things I’ve experienced in the music faculty.At a dinner in my first week at Cambridge, I had a conversation about rap and hip-hop with an academic who told me that black music was noise. I’m a big fan of musical theatre. It’s what I’d like to do as a composer. I talked about how Hamilton is a hip-hop musical. He said, yes well, it’s not very good. I decided to put up a fight and said maybe hip-hop is poetry. You may as well start as you mean to carry on. This person got the idea I wasn’t going to back down.Teaching in my faculty wasn’t necessarily gendered or race specific but my course focused a lot on white men. It’s isolating to not see anyone who looks like you or to know there are histories that aren’t being talked about. I wanted to open the academics’ eyes to something new. I wrote my dissertation on Amanda Aldridge, the black woman who music forgot. She was the daughter of the first black Shakespearean actor, Ira Aldridge. I’d never heard of her – there was very little written about her work as a singer and composer.I come from an educationally privileged background, which I am aware of and grateful for. I got a scholarship to a private sixth form, which really helped push me towards Cambridge. In an ideal world, a younger black girl would have seen me graduate and perhaps thought, maybe I can do that. I was the only black girl in GSCE music, the only black student in A Level music, so I knew Cambridge would be difficult, being the only person like me in that space. But I got there."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c3877f84a53fba55fe48db13588109bbfbcf90dd/254_0_3741_2247/master/3741.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=102c4e8a17394e20083f74d2fa07e9e6","title":"beauty boys men makeup teenagers cosmetics industry","story":"Gen-Z boys online are chipping away at the taboo against men wearing makeup – with or without the makeup industry’s helpIn March of 2019, 17-year-old Elliot Ceretti walked into his local convenience store with a couple of friends. He had been re-watching the 10th season of RuPaul’s Drag Race, and one of the show’s drag queens, Aquaria, had inspired an unfamiliar but exciting longing in Ceretti.He loaded his basket with the cheapest makeup products he could find, and a glue stick to glue down his brows. When he got home that night, he waited until his mother and sister were asleep and locked himself in the bathroom, applying makeup like he had seen on the show. That night, he brought Ella Souflee, his drag persona, to life for the first time.He went on like this for four months, sneaking into the bathroom after lights out to become Ella Souflee, until one day his mother walked into his room while he was in drag. She was surprised, but supportive, and in June Ceretti started a public Instagram account to showcase his looks.“Instagram was and still is the only way for me to talk and share this with others like me,” Ceretti tells me. “We all support each other and lift each other up because it’s rare to get such a response from anyone outside of our community, so we have to take on that role and celebrate what we do for ourselves.”Even in an era of increasingly progressive views of gender and sexuality, boys who wear makeup fear public ridicule and rejection. Like Ceretti, they cannot be sure their families will be supportive. There’s little evidence that the mainstream beauty community will be supportive, either.Of the combined 19 beauty editorials and advertisements in the summer 2020 issues of Cosmopolitan and Harper’s Bazaar, for instance, not a single one features a male or (out) non-binary model. Harper’s Bazaar featured one male expert in its beauty section — in a small sidebar on hair care.Or take the Sephora at Jersey City’s Newport mall, home to legacy brands such as Dior and Charlotte Tilbury. Before the lockdown, a couple of laps around the store wouldn’t yield a single advertisement featuring a male model, not even in the Milk Makeup section, despite the fact that the brand released a pointedly gender-neutral advertisement in 2017.The cosmetics industry should look much different than it does today. In 2016, James Charles, at 17, became CoverGirl’s first male model. The move seemed to signify a dramatic change in the mainstream perception of cosmetics. The next year, Maybelline partnered with the male makeup artist Manny MUA. In 2018, Bretman Rock, 19 at the time, designed collections with ColourPop and Morphe, which bolstered its 2017 launch by collaborating with male beauty vloggers including Manny MUA, James Charles, and Jeffree Star. Star has his own brand, Jeffree Star Cosmetics, which routinely features male models.Since then, legacy brands have taken small but perceptible steps towards inclusivity. A chart mapping the shade range of Tarte’s Shape Tape foundation features one male model in a lineup of women’s faces. In 2019, the actor Ezra Miller appeared in Urban Decay’s “Pretty Different” campaign alongside the musician Lizzo.The industry eventually lost its momentum, though, and the result is a strange dissonance between what we see on privately run social media accounts – a booming community with millions of followers between Instagram and YouTube – and the advertisements run by many legacy cosmetics corporations. Cosmetic brands saw an opportunity to profit from the excitement and the novelty around the emergence of beauty boys. Once the initial buzz died down, however, many brands lost interest. Instead of welcoming them into their regular rotation of models, most brands dismissed beauty boys (and gender-inclusive marketing) as a passing fad.But men wearing makeup is not a new idea: in the 17th century, men wore makeup and dressed as women during performances of Shakespeare’s plays. In Georgian England, aristocratic men wore voluminous wigs, paled their complexions with white powder, and painted their cheeks and lips with rouge. Drag probably emerged as an art form in the 1890s, when William Dorsey Swann, a former slave and early gay rights activist, began holding drag balls. Even 20th-century vaudeville performances featured so-called female impersonators.But while these men performed femininity as caricature or parody, Instagram and YouTube’s beauty influencers have shifted that paradigm in the last decade. By publicly declaring that wearing makeup can be an aspect of their daily lives, the young men who populate and follow Instagram and YouTube’s beauty community have become even more subversive than RuPaul’s drag queens.“I try to push the rules of makeup to show how it isn’t to cover yourself up. I like to think of it as a way to bring yourself out,” says Adam Marshall, a 17-year-old aspiring makeup artist. “I don’t want to change facial features I just want to enhance and display them.”The online beauty boys community has chipped away at the taboo against men wearing makeup, mostly without support or publicity from major cosmetics companies. Social media held the door open for LGBTQ+ teens, from Nikita Dragun to Bretman Rock, who were done waiting for mainstream cosmetics brands to recognize them.The lack of representation at upscale beauty brands is starting to feel pointed, but the truth is undeniable: teenage boys armed with Instagram accounts have queered the cosmetics industry. Both Marshall and Bailey told me they don’t think wearing makeup is feminine or masculine. Their perception of the self exists outside the restrictions of gender, and that gives them real freedom to create and re-create their identities as often as they want.“For men, every time you put makeup on it’s a political movement, showing that it’s not taboo, that it’s normal and shouldn’t be looked at twice,” Ceretti says. “Putting on makeup for a man is breaking down gender norms. It may seem like a bit of concealer or a pit of powder but it’s changing the way people look at gender.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/edd1fac1604276a174d101380ba9d56071e09a24/0_491_4897_2937/master/4897.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=25c5e4642cc483b9e0a7912dff90ff1f","title":"i forgot how to cry as a man hrt gave me a range of emotions i never thought possible","story":"While many focus on the physical aspects of gender transition, for Cadance Bell, the greatest benefit was existential, like putting the right fuel into an engine for the first timeI forgot how to cry as a man. Laying in an economy box at the end of the funeral home was my departed grandmother. Flowers my mum had chosen hung from a borrowed vase. I sat with my family, numb. I knew I should feel something about her death, but I was empty.A celebrant was riffing from a lectern. “Sharon, I hear, was a lovely woman,” she said. “It’s Shirl,” came a hesitant voice from the audience. I cringed. “Sorry, Shirl. And now, she’s up there in the Lord’s kingdom in a great big room, with all of the friends who got there before her, and they’re so happy. They’re laughing with Sharon and they’re smiling, and they’re all eating her favourite cake!”I exhaled, deeply. “Right,” I said, standing up. “I’m out!” I squeezed my hairy, manly frame past the mourners in my row. I stepped on my mum’s toes, apologised, and then slipped up the aisle and out of the building.Outside, I stood with my back against the wall and watched the morning traffic on the Mudgee highway. I thought about times I’d spent with nan, about her dry and endless Anzac biscuits – so tough you could prop up a wonky fridge with them.I wanted to cry. I knew I should, but I couldn’t. I hadn’t cried in years. At that point, I barely felt anything, and it seemed like a betrayal of my grandmother’s love. But I was as dead inside my male body as she was inside the box.A decade later, I’m a transgender woman. Thanks to hormone replacement therapy – or HRT – I feel again. There is a lot said about the obvious changes from HRT. The changes to secondary sex characteristics – skin, hair, fat and breasts. There is too much said about primary sex characteristics – that is, genitals. But for me, the real value of HRT is existential. It’s putting the right fuel in your engine, like filling up with unleaded instead of diesel at the pump.Trans women often describe the emotional benefit of their transition not so much by feeling something new, but by resolution. We’ve upgraded to high-definition emotions, feelings which are just below the surface instead of buried in entrenched layers of gender dysphoria. We still have to allow ourselves to feel, but because we no longer spend so much time hating our bodies, we can enjoy our existence again.Sometimes it can be overwhelming, especially after decades of feeling afraid to express yourself as the wrong gender. I still remember my first laughingcrying fit. A friend had given me the phone number for a person I idolised and told me they were expecting my call. The rush of gratitude, excitement, nervousness and giddy joy turned me to soup. One moment I was laughing, the next I was bawling. Then I was laughing about crying, and crying because I was laughing about it. To feel that range of emotions was something I never thought would be possible, and yet it’s now a monthly occurrence.There are other benefits, too. The loss of a male sex drive has been liberating. I loathed unwanted arousal, and as a guy it came often. Sometimes the male body just decides: it’s time to be aroused. I could get erections from the vibrations of a bus, from dropping a pie and sauce, from watching an ibis drink sweet nectar from a bin.For many men, this is a great perk. I would envy guys who could ride waves of testosterone, standing proudly, hanging one. They seemed so at ease and comfortable. But I would e beneath the waves, a part of me hoping I’d be swallowed in the undertow.With HRT, my sex drive has completely changed, and it’s joyous. I no longer feel driven or distracted by arousal. Nowhere is this more important than around my women friends. I can enjoy their companionship at a deeper level, as they share with me their favourite ways to be. I don’t fear that my body might betray me in their company.There is a heavy price to being transgender. Especially if, like me, you transition after your teenage years, when hormones have already wreaked havoc upon your body. My partner is also trans, and to complete our transitions in our 30s we’re up for at least $200,000 between us. If we did everything we wanted surgically, that amount could double. We might spend as much to live in ourselves as we would buying a rural house.The defining quality of people is that we shape our reality. Animals respond to information. We change it. It’s what has brought us medicine, clothing, houses, warm water and humble toilets. None of these things are strictly needed to live, but they make our existence better.Voluntary evolution is the hallmark of humanity. Gender affirmation, through hormone replacement therapy, is an awesome celebration of that quality. Trans and gender erse people today are in the forge of evolution, we are wayfarers, nova heralds. We seek out and discover new ways to be.It means I can be comfortable with who I am within myself, who I am around others. It’s made me a better person. When you transition, so does everyone around you. They must unlearn who they thought you were. That discovery can sometimes be daunting, but there is so much more love and joy to be found with a person who loves themselves. I often wonder what my grandmother would make of my newfound happiness, what she might say to see me evolved.It’s such a beautiful thing, I can cry."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/67128cbe623d9faa3df410b8b956cc6c03ea254d/0_0_4896_2752/master/4896.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=8d9cf0a6dc7cfa9e2252b4c3502365f3","title":"tree of the week i whispered to the lone pine asking it to hold on until we returned","story":"In a weekly series, readers tell us about their favourite trees. This week: a Scots pine in Devon Whenever Mike Stannard’s friends or family come to visit him in Thorverton, Devon, he takes them to see his favourite tree, a slanted Scots pine on top of Raddon Hill. “We sit with our backs to the tree and admire the view,” he says. “I think about all the people I have been there with over the years. My daughter, who lives in Italy, and my son who lives in the US, know this tree well. I think about them when I am up there.”The retired paediatric radiologist, originally from Exeter, worked in the US for three decades before returning in 2002. He came across the tree on a walk. “When my wife and I first saw this idiosyncratic pine from a distance, almost 20 years ago, I mistook its unusual slant for some kind of radar array,” he says.Mike, 78, and his wife left the village in 2004 to return to the US to care for his mother-in-law. But they came back to Thorverton every year to visit friends and the tree, known locally as the Lone Pine. “It is the only survivor of a clump of pines on Raddon Top, an imposing site of bronze age and Neolithic remains,” he says. “An annual pilgrimage to this hogback hill and to this pine was an essential part of those visits – to touch its bark and to whisper a few words to ask it to hold on until we returned.”Mike was reunited with the pine in 2011 when the couple moved back to the village. He now often climbs up the hill to spend time looking at the landscape of the Exe Valley from the tree, with only the occasional sheep for company. His daughter trained as a photographer and took a picture of him standing by the pine for her portfolio.The tree has also inspired Mike to unleash his own creativity. He made a Lone Pine Christmas card in 2018, which featured tractors in place of the wise men’s camels. “Our Thorverton neighbours seemed very amused by it, and we have received no notice of excommunication to date,” he jokes. Last year, his wife made him a Lone Pine Valentine’s Day card, with illustrated hearts hanging from the tree’s canopy.Each time he visits the pine, it brings back fond memories. “I see it from across the fields. I go up to the tree often and pat its scaly bark. The bark has been worn by animals rubbing against it over the years and there are spikes of former branches, but it has mostly remained the same.”Mike hopes the tree will be around for many years to come: “A grove has been planted next to the tree by locals so one day, in the course of time, there will be successors to the Lone Pine, but in the meanwhile I’m very glad it’s still here.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d06e9876e56a109880dc4f6337fc0c711a99bac9/0_0_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cae181181d56571f209654e96cfc1ce7","title":"i feel ive been taken for a ride by evans cycles","story":"My ‘in stock’ order failed to arrive and it was ‘still being built’In May, desperate to get a bike, I used Evans Cycles website to order one for £1,049. It was showing as in stock but, soon after, I got an email saying it would be with me in 10-14 days.On 1 June, I was told it was still being built but would be shipped in two to four days. Since then, I have heard nothing. You cannot get hold of Evans, and I feel I was duped.The bike was clearly not in stock or it would have been delivered. Frustratingly, I could have purchased one elsewhere and am no nearer to receiving my bike, or a refund.Right at the start of lockdown we had a plea from a reader whose bike had been in for a service and got stuck in an Evans Cycles shop that had closed that night. We asked whether there was anything that could be done as it was his only form of transport and desperately needed it back. The company’s PR people ignored us.We also sent this complaint and, again, have been ignored. It saddens me to write this because Evans used to be a great store full of helpful, knowledgeable staff. But since Sports Direct took over, things seem to have gone rapidly south.This is one of several emails we have had in recent months, mostly complaints about unfulfilled orders, and an inability to contact the company. There are also lots of very unhappy customers on the firm’s Trustpilot page reporting similar experiences.We advised you to take the matter up with PayPal which you used to pay.

West also suggested that women should be given $1m when they have a baby.The rapper took to the stage at the event wearing a bulletproof vest, and “2020” shaved into his head. Without a mic, he proceeded to address a rowdy audience of a few hundred people, asking for complete silence before asserting that future events “will be in rooms where the acoustics will be incredible because I will be involved with the design”.Tubman is one of the most respected figures of 19th century America. An African American who escaped slavery, she helped enslaved Black men and women travel north to freedom and fought for the Union during the Civil War. She later became a supporter of women’s suffrage.But the event hit peak emotional intensity when West began to tell a story about what he believed was ine intervention into his life in a way that caused his wife, Kim Kardashian West, to refuse to terminate a pregnancy.“I was having the rapper’s lifestyle,” he said. “I was sitting up in Paris, and I had my leather pants on … and I had my laptop up and I got all of my creative ideas … And the screen went black and white and God said, ‘if you fuck with my vision I’m going to fuck with yours’.“And I called my wife and she said, we’re gonna have this baby. I said we’re gonna have this child … So even if my wife were to orce me after this speech, she brought North into the world when I didn’t want to. She stood up and she protected that child.”West then started crying when speaking about his father, who he said had wanted his mother to have an abortion when she was pregnant with him.“My mom saved my life. My dad wanted to abort me. My mom saved my life. There would have been no Kanye West because my dad was too busy,” he said, sobbing into his hand, before shouting: “I almost killed my daughter! I almost killed my daughter!”He then called up to the stage a pro-choice activist who had been yelling questions to him in response to his story. He claimed he understood “why someone would make the choice of getting an abortion” and eventually clarified that his position wasn’t that abortion should be banned, but rather that maximum financial assistance should be made available to women who do have children.“My stance is not to make abortion illegal at all. It should always be legal. But there should be an option of maximum increase available … Maximum increase would be, everybody that has a baby gets a million dollars,” he said. He did not say where this money would come from.“It takes a village to raise a child,” he said. “Society has been set up for single moms to not have a village, to not have a child.”West’s remarks, which were mostly yelled in order to be heard by the crowd, repeatedly circled back to his Christianity.Struggling to be heard, West repeatedly told audience members to be quiet at the same time as assuring them that he was “not trying to quiet their voices”. The event ended after West was substantially drowned out by the shouting crowd.West announced his intention to run for president on 5 July but he missed the deadline to qualify for the ballot in several states, and it was unclear if he was willing or able to collect enough signatures required to qualify in others.Last week, he qualified to appear on Oklahoma’s presidential ballot, the first state where he met the requirements before the filing deadline.West needed to collect 10,000 signatures by noon Monday to appear on the South Carolina ballot, according to state law. The entertainer tweeted out a list of locations around the Charleston area where petitions could be signed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8bf6ddb322154c7cfd98c28ae621894420caa8a0/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ba2342b8d8d87c2feb23020c0baf6886","title":"k pop black fans creatives industry accountable race","story":"As K-pop grows, international fans and those writing and producing songs want the industry to to develop a more sensitive understanding of raceOn Tuesday 2 June, Grammy award-winning songwriter and music artist Tiffany Red returned home from a trip to her local mall, where she had encountered the national guard armed with large rifles, an experience that left Red “traumatized”.Exactly one week before, George Floyd had been killed in Minneapolis, and tensions in the country were rising as hundreds of thousands took to the streets in protest. Tuesday 2 June was also #BlackoutTuesday, a global “social media moment” that grew out of the music industry’s #TheShowMustGoOn, an initiative created to “hold the industry at large” – including major corporations and their partners who benefit from the efforts, struggles and successes of Black people – accountable.Still processing her experience at the mall earlier that day, Red opened her inbox to find a message from her South Korean music publisher, Ekko Music Rights, regarding a $66 payment for a song she had written for one of K-pop’s most popular groups, NCT Dream – a straightforward business transaction with zero acknowledgment of what Red, a Black American woman, may have been going through given the news cycle then.For Red, who has worked with artists such as Zendaya, Jennifer Hudson and Jason Derulo, this was a final straw. She had already decided to stop writing K-pop music because she felt she was poorly compensated, but Ekko’s aloofness spoke to a continued concern she harbored about the industry at large: that despite K-pop’s reliance on Black music and culture, the industry didn’t actually support Black lives.Within K-pop, blackface, mouthing or saying racial slurs, and purely aesthetic uses of Black culture and hairstyles are still common. In recent weeks, as the media has painted K-pop fans as politically active and engaged for overwhelming racist hashtags with videos of their favorite acts and reserving thousands of tickets to artificially boost expected attendance at Donald Trump’s Tulsa rally, official statements of support for Black lives have trickled in from a handful of groups and idols.Arguably the most well-known K-pop group in the world, BTS, and their parent company, Big Hit Entertainment (whose CEO has stated publicly that “Black music is the base” of the septet’s musical identity), were some of the most vocal, and the only group to donate money – $1m – to Black Lives Matter. But many contend that the industry overall has failed to show unified support for the movement. Now, Black creatives and fans are holding them accountable.SM Entertainment is one of South Korea’s three largest entertainment companies. It is credited with producing the first K-pop idol group, H.O.T., in 1996, which established the “SM performance” style that the brand still employs today: a combination of impressive visuals, dance, rock, rap and hip-hop that took inspiration from Black American artists of the MTV generation. Songwriter and producer Micah Powell attended six SM songwriting camps between 2015 and 2018. At one camp, he wrote a song called Devil and created a dance move to go with it, which he then showed to SM executives. “The entire staff lit up,” Powell says of their reaction.Devil became the lead single of SM group Super Junior’s 2015 album of the same name. When Powell watched the music video for Devil for the first time, he was shocked to see that his dance move, a hip tap and high clap combination, had been used as part of the song’s chorus, without his permission, and without credit or compensation. Powell’s background vocals on the track had also been used without payment or credit.More than two weeks after Red posted her frustrations with the industry on Instagram, SM Entertainment, the “sister company” of Ekko Music Rights, released a statement that read: “We stand with our Black collaborators, friends and fans” and added that “we are new to this conversation”. Red’s frustration is palpable as she scoffs at this: “You aren’t new to this conversation, you are a part of this conversation. We are the people who make your music. Why would you ever think that you’re excluded from this?”“I am Black before I am a K-pop stan,” says Ellie, 19, who prefers to use her first name to avoid the harassment some K-pop fans face when they speak out against popular groups, “and when I was first discovering NCT 127, the Limitless video really offended me.”Limitless, a 2017 single from the SM group NCT 127, was produced and composed by a handful of successful Black American producers. In the song’s music video, the company styled some members of the group in hairstyles typically worn by Black men and accessorized them in clothing that directly referenced Black hip-hop artists.Ellie notes that while styling like this is what’s been deemed “unique and fresh” within the industry, it’s “all been seen before within the Black community”. She is a huge supporter of NCT 127 and has slept on the street three times to see them in person during appearances in New York City. She also danced with the group when they made a surprise appearance last year in Washington Square Park.After seeing Red’s Instagram posts, Ellie, Gilpin, and fellow fan De’Andra Johnson, 23, who lives in Inglewood, California, organized #SMBlackout, a hashtag event “to bring awareness to the importance of Black fans and Black creatives in SM’s roster”.One week after the #SMBlackout event, SM released its official statement. Ellie says those six sentences, which were only posted in English and did not lay out a plan of action, “did not hold any weight”. Gilpin adds: “I was confused by the ‘we’re new to this conversation’ part because we’ve been trying to have this conversation with them for years and they decided they didn’t want to listen.” She says that if they are truly interested in creating change, “now is the best time for them to come forward and actively participate, especially since the industry has been moving into a huge global spotlight. To me, it’s not a political or controversial stance. It should be a no-brainer for anyone, any company, any industry to stand for human rights and equality.”Johnson notes that she is still waiting for statements from YG and Pledis, which produce a handful of chart-topping groups she also likes. Other K-pop fans are waiting on action from the companies that manage their favorite acts, including JYP, whose CEO has incorporated blackface into his performances as a solo artist and also named practice rooms at the company facilities after Black artists he admires.For Red, this moment is the beginning of a new personal mission: to bring change to the music industry through activism. “It’s needed, it’s missing. There’s no one protecting the artists and there’s so much to protect us from,” she says. She will continue producing her solo music at home in Los Angeles, but doesn’t have any intention of writing for others any longer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/41dbf6cb2953c82aabeaf15bafb52c97b48976c5/0_0_3491_2095/master/3491.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=41c2fc16e2a162be1ab3f0906f4b4450","title":"poland divided and right wing populists win again podcast","story":"A narrow win for the populist incumbent Andrzej Duda in Poland’s presidential election cleared the path for the right-wing Law and Justice party to pursue anti-LGBT policies and further assault the courts and free press. ’s Christian Davies reports from WarsawThe re-election of Andrzej Duda as Poland’s president this week was by the narrowest of margins and has sent liberals in the country into a tailspin.

It has also launched what local British campaigners are describing as a “warm” campaign, with the minister for inclusion, Hana Jalloul, telling Britons who want to remain that “this is, and always will remain your home”.It coincided with a joint statement with the British ambassador to remind Britons their rights are “guaranteed” if they are living there before 31 December.The country’s national statistics show 360,000 British nationals have already registered to be in the country with 104,000 living in the Andalucía province, including 62,000 in the costas around Malaga.Alicante and Valencia account for a further 97,000, with 40,000 and 29,000 in the Canaries and Balearics respectively.Sue Wilson, the founder of Bremain in Europe, a campaign group for Britons in Spain, said the fact that the Spanish government have chosen a simple declaratory scheme allowing rights to be “guaranteed” without an application for settled state a “great relief to British immigrants”.“We are grateful to the Spanish authorities for making the process as simple, seamless and painless as possible.”However, there is concern that there are tens of thousands of Britons who are off the radar, some elderly or vulnerable, and some who just don’t use the internet who may be more difficult to reach.The Foreign Office is working with three organisations in the country, including Age in Spain, with a big communications push to try to reach the over-65s around the Costas and Alicante.“I suspect a large number of people are out there who may not understand that there is an issue that they have to deal with because of Brexit, some of whom may not like to approach officials because they don’t know or fear how it might impact on things like taxation, health care,” said Helen Weir, the director of Age in Spain.Weir also said there was an important message to get out to relatives back in the UK. “If you have a relative in Spain who may not have residency or cannot cope with officialdom because they don’t speak Spanish or because they can’t cope with bureaucracy, you can contact Age in Spain and we can put them in touch with people who can help.”Of the 26 member states (Ireland is an exception, with British and Irish having reciprocal rights to remain in each others country after Brexit), Spain is considered one of the most advanced in preparations for the human cost of Brexit.France was due to open its application process on 1 July but has put it back to October because of Covid-19 and pressure will mount on countries to extend the deadlines for applications beyond 30 June next year to accommodate the challenges caused by the pandemic.So far, 14 countries, including Italy, Sweden and Portugal, have extended the deadline for British people to register or apply for settled status until October next year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9ed12c0f70af7ce1b47e76112fa274b6f425a67/0_33_863_518/master/863.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=026741aacd30c517d27b9c64c3308e7f","title":"uae mission mars al amal hope space","story":"A rocket carrying the unmanned probe, known as Al-Amal in Arabic, joins China and US in race to red planetThe first Arab space mission to Mars has blasted off aboard a rocket from Japan, with its unmanned probe – called Al-Amal, or Hope – successfully separating about an hour after liftoff.A live feed of the launch showed the rocket carrying the probe lifting off from the Tanegashima Space Centre in southern Japan at 6.58am (9.58pm GMT).Almost exactly one hour later, the feed showed people applauding in the Japanese control room as the probe successfully detached.In Dubai, the launch was met with rapturous excitement, with the UAE Mars mission’s deputy project manager Sarah al-Amiri declaring it “an indescribable feeling” to see the probe blasting off.“This is the future of the UAE,” Amiri, who is also minister of state for advanced sciences, told Dubai TV from the launch site.The Emirati project is one of three racing to Mars, including Tianwen-1 from China and Mars 2020 from the United States, taking advantage of a period when the Earth and Mars are nearest.In October, Mars will be a comparatively short 38.6m miles (62m km) from Earth, according to Nasa.Hope is expected to reach Mars’s orbit by February 2021, marking the 50th anniversary of the unification of the UAE, an alliance of seven emirates.Unlike the two other Mars ventures scheduled for this year, it will not land on the planet, but instead orbit it for a whole Martian year, or 687 days.While the objective of the Mars mission is to provide a comprehensive image of the weather dynamics in the red planet’s atmosphere, the probe is a foundation for a much bigger goal – building a human settlement on Mars within the next 100 years.The UAE also wants the project to serve as a source of inspiration for Arab youth, in a region too often wracked by sectarian conflicts and economic crises.On Twitter, the UAE’s government declared the probe launch a “message of pride, hope and peace to the Arab region, in which we renew the golden age of Arab and Islamic discoveries.”Several dozen probes – most of them American – have set off for Mars since the 1960s. Many never made it that far, or failed to land.The drive to explore Mars flagged until the confirmation less than 10 years ago that water once flowed on its surface.Omran Sharaf, the mission’s project manager, has said the Hope probe will offer a special perspective on the elusive planet.“What is unique about this mission is that for the first time the scientific community around the world will have an holistic view of the Martian atmosphere at different times of the day at different seasons,” Sharaf told a pre-launch briefing.“We have a strategy to contribute to the global effort in developing technologies and science work that will help one day if humanity decides to put a human on Mars.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/635329a568012fdbaae60ce649ec216c61493732/0_0_5000_3333/master/5000.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9fb3d3e513738536586b8b9e681598ce 700w","title":"have you become unemployed due to coronavirus","story":"Following news that almost 650,000 people have left company payrolls since March, we would like to hear from those who have lost their jobs due to coronavirusThe number of people on company payrolls in the UK has dropped by almost 650,000 since March, as unemployment continues to soar due to the coronavirus pandemic.We would like to hear from people who have lost their jobs as a result of coronavirus over the last three months.You can get in touch by filling in the form below.

We are worn out from working full-time at home and part-time home schooling. I am heartbroken that my nine-year-old son will have much of his holiday to fill by himself while his parents are expected to commit their time to work.“I don’t understand how holiday clubs can’t open when pubs and restaurants can, and schools have taken some year groups back,” she added.No residential, UK summer camps have been able to open this year after government guidelines released in early July stipulated that “holiday providers should not be offering overnight or residential provision for children”.Activity day-camps have either not opened or have cut the number of places they offer by more than a half to adhere to government guidance that they keep children in “small consistent groups of no more than 15 children”. Where consistent groups of 15 cannot be maintained, groups must only be outside and with a 1:5 staff ratio.World-camps.org, a directory of more than 100 camps in the UK, said not a single camp that advertises with them has opened this summer. “They all blame government restrictions andor global travel restrictions, which mean it’s just not financially viable for them to open this year,” said Alex Peipers, the co-founder of the site. “Some parents are even sending their children abroad to camps because the UK ones aren’t open,” he said. “We’ve had lots of requests from UK parents about camps in countries where the measures are less strict, such as Switzerland, Sweden, Denmark and Austria.”SuperCamps, an Ofsted-registered provider of more than 40 day-camps across the UK, has not opened a single camp this year. Nor has the YMCA, Camp Indy or Barracuda, which owns 48 sites across the UK.A Barracuda spokesperson said: “These guidelines are not practical for holiday clubs who accept children for differing time frames dependent on parental needs.”Some sports clubs that operate in the open are managing to run classes but clubs that are technology-based have experienced a boon: “We’ve moved entirely online and are now able to reach double the number of children we usually would,” said Kirien Sangha of Fire Tech Camp."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3086711e19089780e65a037524d7db2300cfb89/0_319_5760_3458/master/5760.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=7a003dbaec4575e94f2275749e670006","title":"lewis hamilton formula one racism hungarian gp","story":"Lewis Hamilton issued a stinging rebuke to the leaders of Formula One and some of his fellow drivers after the sport’s failure to deliver a coherent anti-racism message before the Hungarian Grand Prix. Hamilton won the race but was highly critical of the lack of progress F1 is making in supporting its stated commitment to tackling racism.“There definitely is not enough support for it,” he said of the pre-race anti-racism gesture. “Many drivers seem to be of the opinion that they have done it once and are not going to do it again. It’s almost like it has gone off the agenda. It’s lacking leadership. There needs to be leadership from the top.”At the opening race in Austria there was time set aside for the drivers to make a collective gesture since then it has been a decidedly ad hoc affair. In Budapest the drivers assembled for the national anthem and once more what followed was shambolic and disorganised at best. Some drivers did not attend, some were late, some did not wear the “End Racism” T-shirts and, again, only some chose to take a knee.Hamilton, F1’s only black driver, believes the issue is being dismissed by some drivers. “I don’t think it is being taken seriously,” he said. “There are perhaps people who have not grown up around it and don’t understand. There are those that think because of that it doesn’t affect me. I have heard those comments: ‘It doesn’t affect me so why should I do it?’”He was also disappointed that more was not being achieved and that other teams had not adopted the strong public commitment to ersity that Mercedes have. “We haven’t made any progress,” he said of the sport. “We have said things, statements released and gestures such as kneeling but we have not changed anything except perhaps some of our awareness.”Hamilton has been outspoken in his support for the Black Lives Matter movement, and said he would be demanding action from the president of the FIA, Jean Todt, and the chief executive of F1, Chase Carey. “I will get in touch with F1 this week and I will speak to Jean because no one else is going to do it,” he said. “My dream is by the end of the year we know and understand things better, we stand united, and F1 is on top of it.”F1 responded to Hamilton’s comments with a statement: “Ending racism and increasing ersity and inclusion in F1 is a clear priority. We set out our plans for ersity and inclusion last November and have in recent weeks announced additional plans to create a Taskforce to tackle these issues and a foundation with over $1m already donated to create apprenticeships and job opportunities for under represented groups. We want to make lasting change and are acting to do this.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/550957c19e0129d0ca6e39968654cc3e705e5b0a/120_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4ff661ec4c7380f3680a7736a7f9ac25","title":"comedian joz norris you build the thing","story":"Originally planned as an Edinburgh show, You Build the Thing You Think You Are is now a film – and a different proposition to live-streamed lockdown comedyJoz Norris’s new experiment starts with a provocation. “To me,” says the comic, “a live-stream show can only ever feel like a rough approximation of what live comedy used to feel like.

Before the festival was cancelled, he had a show ready for Edinburgh 2020, about his recent experience of moving house – and losing himself, he felt, while doing so. The show, so specific to this moment in his life, couldn’t wait until 2021. He didn’t want to can it altogether – but neither did live-streaming appeal. So Norris has turned You Build the Thing You Think You Are into a 50-minute film. It now has a seven-day run online, with each screening followed by a live Q\u0026ampA.The story it tells is of a pivotal moment in Norris’s life, as he leaves the flatshare where he spent his 20s. OK, so that old Brixton flat didn’t add up to much. “This is not a room for a person,” his landlord’s wife says of his bedroom. “This is a room for old boots and broken things.” But it gave Norris a sense of himself that he loses entirely when obliged to relocate.You can imagine the show it would have made onstage – something like Daniel Kitson’s 66A Church Road, perhaps, another hymn to a well-loved home. Spliced with that moment in Mat Ewins’ 2017 show when Ewins pulls back the curtain on all the silliness: the subtext of You Build the Thing … is Norris’s loss of confidence, as he enters his 30s, in his identity as a funny man. There’s no real apotheosis here you wait in vain for Norris’s quiet crises to reach their resolution. What is conclusive, though, is the success of the material’s transfer to film. Shot almost entirely in Norris’s new house, it’s tightly edited, enjoyably meta, full of sly visual touches – and really does recreate the spirit of the creative live comedy Norris misses so much.Those who love that brand of comedy equally may share Norris’s scepticism of laughter-by-live-stream – a scepticism that maps on to lockdown-era comedy an existing schism, between entertainers and artists, club comics and “creative” comics (for want of a better term). The former would prioritise the hurly-burly and spontaneity of liveness the latter put craft and construction on a higher pedestal. For them, Norris’s You Build the Thing … will be as much of a treat as an earlier and even more rewarding standup-to-film transfer, Tim Key’s Megadate (or Wonderdate, in the BBC version). Vive la difference, I say, while feeling lucky that lockdown, if it’s dented comedians’ incomes, is doing nothing to dent their creativity.• 20-26 July on Vimeo.

The union said transparency was essential in checking if Uber was exercising discrimination or unequal treatment between drivers. It will also allow drivers to organise and build collective bargaining power over terms of work and pay in a way that is currently impossible.It came at the start of a significant week for Uber’s business model in the UK. On Tuesday, the company begins its supreme court challenge against landmark rulings that the former Uber drivers Yaseen Aslam and James Farrar, founders of the ADCU, should have been treated as workers rather than self-employed contractors and so should have benefited from the minimum wage and paid holidays.The boom in online shopping during the lockdown saw the parcel delivery company DPD create another 6,000 self-employed jobs, which rely on the use of handheld terminals that track time and motion.“This is about the distribution of power,” said Anton Ekker, the Amsterdam privacy lawyer leading the case. “It’s about Uber exerting control through data and automated decision-making and how it is blocking access to that.”He said: “The app decides millions of times a day who is going to get what ride: who gets the nice rides who gets the short rides. But this is not just about Uber. The problem is everywhere. Algorithms and data give a lot of control but the people who are subject to it are often no longer aware of it.”The claim says Uber uses tags on drivers’ profiles, for example “inappropriate behaviour” or simply “police tag”. Reports relate to “navigation – late arrival  missed ETA” and “professionalism – cancelled on rider, inappropriate behaviour, attitude”. The drivers complain they were not being provided with this data or information on the underlying logic of how it was used. They want to how that processing affects them, including on their driver score.The union members Azeem Hanif and Alfie Wellcoat claim Uber has failed to fulfill its obligations in its response to their requests under general data protection regulations (GDPR). They want to see their detailed driver profiles, comments about them made by Uber staff and how more than two dozen categories of data gathered about them are processed, legal papers show.“Uber collects large amounts of data that provide a very penetrating picture of, among other things, the use of the Uber driver app, the location and driving behaviour of the driver, communication with customers and the Uber support department,” the claim states.It argues that under GDPR regulations, which are similar in the UK and the Netherlands, app workers have the right to access “profiling” data, which includes evaluations of a person’s reliability, behaviour, location or movements.A spokesperson for Uber said: “Our privacy team works hard to provide any requested personal data that iniduals are entitled to. We will give explanations when we cannot provide certain data, such as when it doesn’t exist or disclosing it would infringe on the rights of another person under GDPR. Under the law, iniduals have the right to escalate their concerns by contacting Uber’s data protection officer or their national data protection authority for additional review.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba872b5939fca67c212775309aff711f947a95dc/530_117_4549_2731/master/4549.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=14c6bee664b7f6f542fd29dd41319d7a","title":"a suitable boy india bbc historical drama mira nair vikram seth","story":"It has 110 actors, is based on one of the longest books in English - and it’s the BBC’s first historical drama with no white characters. But some think the series doesn’t go far enough. We take a look behind the scenes‘This is an Indian story,” says Tanya Maniktala, “so it’s about time it was told by us.” The 22-year-old actor is speaking by video call from Delhi about playing the lead in a groundbreaking BBC adaptation of Vikram Seth’s novel A Suitable Boy.The six-part series is the first time the BBC has had a historical drama cast entirely with people of colour, and the first time that Seth’s 1993 novel – one of the longest in the English language – has been adapted for the screen. “It’s a landmark,” says BBC commissioning editor Mona Qureshi. “With a novel like this, where there aren’t characters who are white, it makes sense to have an all south Asian cast. It has been a long time coming.”A Suitable Boy is set in 1951, against the backdrop of a newly independent and post-partition India. It tells the story of 19-year-old Hindu Lata, played by Maniktala, who is under pressure from her widowed mother to find an appropriate husband. A chance encounter with the Muslim boy Kabir sees Lata fall in love, but their religious differences echo the wider clashes between Hindus and Muslims in the country. When Lata’s mother learns of their affair, the relationship is forbidden. There follows a vast, intergenerational coming-of-age story, involving four families and more than 110 characters over the course of 18 months, right across India. It is a grandiose reflection of a nation coming to terms with a new identity.The series was three years in the making, Seth having agreed to the series on condition that Andrew Davies – who has adapted everything from Pride and Prejudice to War and Peace – was at the helm. It was clear to director Mira Nair from the outset that the show had to be played by south Asians and filmed in India. “I never subscribe to making films that exoticise India,” Nair says. “So we had to shoot on location, to recreate this atmosphere of crumbling aristocracy, rather than spiffing it up.”Nair, who was the first woman to win the Golden Lion at the Venice film festival with her 2001 film Monsoon Wedding, says her own childhood in the Indian town of Bhubaneshwar mirrors Lata’s. “I grew up in these bungalows as a daughter of a civil servant, just after this time when the country found its voice in freedom.”This interpretation of Seth’s world interweaves romanticised scenes of the misty Ganges at dawn with bustling, dusty markets, the decaying Raj, and westernisation creeping into dress and music. We witness the placid natural beauty of northern India, as Lata secretly meets with Kabir in the opening of the second episode while, conversely, her Anglicised older brother puts on a double-breasted suit for an alcohol-fuelled evening of jazz dancing in the metropolis of what is now Kolkata.All the while, the seeds of Hindu nationalism grow as temples are erected next to centuries-old mosques and peaceful protest descends into police violence. Despite being set almost 70 years ago, it is a context that worryingly reflects current Indian prime minister Narendra Modi’s fierce nationalism and stoking of religious violence.“The seeds of much of what we are facing today were planted in the 1950s,” Nair says. “Vikram’s story drew on his own time of writing, the 1990s, just as we do with this adaptation today. For instance, the Hindu temple that is being built next to the mosque in the first episode is based on the destruction of the Babri Masjid mosque in 1992. What we are living through has a history, so this show is not a museum piece in any way.” This is most powerfully expressed in a scene where local Muslims march at a temple – and a jittery police force responds by opening fire on the crowd of adults and children. Their bodies are left in the street to be recovered by their families.Even for Maniktala, there are parallels between her life now and her character’s, despite being generations apart. “I felt there was so much in common with me and Lata,” she says. “A mother trying to find a suitable boy for her young daughter is something that still very much happens now, but I really like Lata because she wants to be valued as an inidual, rather than be the shadow of someone else. She isn’t afraid to make mistakes, which I am still learning from. She can handle being judged.”Before she was cast, Maniktala was working as a copywriter in an advertising agency. After being spotted by a casting director, she was called in for a Skype interview with Nair. “I had been looking for my Lata for a year and must have seen over 500 people,” says Nair. “Then I saw a grainy tape of this girl with dark circles under her eyes and I was immediately drawn in. Tanya is amazing because she has a kind of sweetness, as if she has not been fettered by the world. She’s truly at the brink of growing up, which is a really unusual quality in a young person in the 21st century.”Contrasting Lata’s innocence is the courtesan Saeeda, played by Bollywood veteran Tabu. “Saeeda represents this bridge between the crumbling world of the Raj and modernity,” she says. “It felt so important to be playing this complex and powerful female role – someone who is all over the place emotionally, spiritually and sexually, who depends on male patronage to live but who also has such an independent mind and a rich knowledge of life. We are all products of our environment and although Saeeda represents a dying profession, she just wants a better life like so many today.”While Maniktala brings a wide-eyed incredulity to her role, Tabu’s Saeeda is seductive, world-weary and self-assured, in one scene captivating the wayward son of a politician with just a passing glance during one of her performances.One aspect of the show that is certainly new is its casting. In the wake of global Black Lives Matter protests following the police killing of George Floyd in Minnesota in May, there has been a re-evaluation of the representation of people of colour on screen. Blackface-referencing shows such as Little Britain have been pulled from streaming services, white actors have stopped voicing black characters on certain animations, and in June the director Steve McQueen called the British TV and film industry a whitewashed product of “blatant racism”.Qureshi feels that a newfound openness from audiences will help push through more ersity. “Audiences are really open to following stories with new faces and our palates have become increasingly sophisticated,” she says. “I genuinely think that the industry is a very different place to when I started in the mid 90s. Then I might have agreed with Steve McQueen’s sentiment, but we’re working towards ersity being represented across a range of genres now and that’s the most crucial element. This show is just the start.”She mentions the casting of mixed-race actor Vinette Robinson in 2019’s BBC adaptation of A Christmas Carol as a step in the right direction, even though it did prompt a backlash. Yet for some, such as writer Nikesh Shukla, despite the direction of Nair and the cast, having a white writer at the helm remains a “slap in the face”, as he wrote on Twitter. Perhaps meaningful change can only come with unimpeded opportunity and representation.As a director who has championed challenging, diasporic narratives throughout her 30-year career, Nair does not see A Suitable Boy as a milestone. “When people say the casting of the show is radical, it’s only radical to you guys,” she says. “It’s about time that this western world understands that we have extraordinary talent and that should be normalised.”Maniktala agrees. “Who can portray this story better than Indians who have grown up with those values and morals?” she says. “My grandfather, who was from what is now Pakistan, used to tell us stories about partition. So this history is close to us – it is something my family have experienced.”Ultimately, with over 110 actors in a production shot over three months on location, Nair’s goal is for viewers to find themselves enveloped in the often conflicting worlds of India, rather than consuming the show as an inconsequential period piece. “We’ve taken great care to recreate the detail of these worlds which are rapidly changing,” she says. “The Urdu language, which is currently being wiped out, is expressed in nuances by the ways in which the vendors in our fictional town of Bhrampur change their Urdu calls by season. Now, you might not get that but it all goes towards creating the extraordinary richness of the ever-changing subcontinent.”For those who do get it, there is a deeper message. “History repeats itself but we don’t seem to learn from it,” Maniktala says. “Perhaps this show will provide a new perspective, one for a new generation to take heed of. It is an Indian telling of our own story. Here, you’ll view us as we are – and how we came to be.”• A Suitable Boy starts on BBC One at 9pm on 26 July."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad66075d70b8371b40b50dc79c4442707df4f2db/0_20_3318_1993/master/3318.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e26c9f87f9b255f26b92dcc1d44e5656","title":"tv tonight the dancing plague that struck 16th century strasbourg","story":"Jonathan Glazer’s short experimental film explores the phenomenon that gripped residents of the French city for days.

Or, through a tear, will we present the face of a weak Europe, undermined by mistrust?”Dutch prime Minister Mark Rutte said on Monday EU leaders were making progress but warned discussions could still fall apart. “At times it didn’t look good last night, but I feel that on the whole we are making progress,” Rutte told reporters in Brussels. The summit will reconvene at 4pm central European time on Monday.The leaders have been in intense debates over the size of the recovery fund for countries hit hardest by the coronavirus pandemic and the EU’s seven-year budget, known as the multi-financial framework, which is due to start next year.There are also stark differences over the nature of the conditions attached to the emergency funding and the balance between grants and loans on offer. The money will be borrowed from the capital markets by the European commission.Rutte has insisted he cannot be expected to take on extra national debt in order for the EU to make cash payments to member states without his parliament having a say.In response, Orbán, the nationalist prime minister of Hungary, who was an anti-communist dissident in his youth, accused Rutte of aping Soviet methods to crush dissent by failing to properly set out the terms on which funds would be blocked.The Netherlands is seeking reassurance that commonly issued debt will be properly spent and wants the ability to hold back disbursements where there are governance concerns.“They would like to introduce a new mechanism that didn’t exist until now,” Orbán told reporters, of the Dutch proposal for a country to be able to stop funding to member states undermining the rule of law. “I think it is questionable whether it has a basis in the treaty at all. I am coming from an ex-communist country. When the communist regime decided to attack us, they use unclarified legal terms exactly as the same as written in the proposal of the Dutch man … Saying ‘general deficiencies’. When I was arrested by the police and I asked them what I had done which is illegal, they say general deficiencies. What the fuck does it mean?”In response, Rutte said on Monday: “We are not here because we are going to be visitors at each others birthday party later. We are here because we do business for our own country. We are all pros.”The row over the rule of law was dwarfed, however, by a more significant dispute over the size and form of the recovery fund, with “frugal” countries of the Netherlands, Austria, Denmark and Sweden defying France and Germany in trying to reduce the level of grants.EU diplomats said the four northern member states, to the evident frustration of the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, were pushing to reduce the value of grants available from €500bn to €350bn while increasing the size of the rebates they currently have on their budget contributions. The whole recovery package would also be reduced to €700bn from the €750bn initially proposed by the European commission.Luxembourg’s prime minister, Xavier Bettel, said that in seven years of attending EU meetings, “I have never seen positions as diametrically opposed as this”.“The negotiations are difficult, perhaps one of the most difficult I have ever been involved in, yet the spirit of compromise has not yet disappeared,” tweeted Latvia’s prime minister, Krišjānis Kariņš.With tempers running high, Macron at one point banged his fists on the table in frustration. He also claimed that the countries seeking to reduce the size of the recovery fund were acting like the former British prime minister David Cameron during previous budget negotiations, warning that such an approach would end badly and damage Europe.During Sunday night’s dinner, several leaders made emotional interventions. The Italian prime minister Giuseppe Conte warned Rutte that hero status at home would “last a few days” but that he risked being blamed for letting Europe down.The summit had been markedly bad-tempered from the first day on Friday, and Michel was forced to table a new set of proposals on Saturday morning in an attempt to reboot the talks.Epidemics of infectious diseases behave in different ways but the\u0026nbsp1918 influenza pandemic\u0026nbspthat killed more than 50 million people is regarded as a key example of a pandemic that occurred in multiple waves, with the latter more severe than the first. It has been replicated – albeit more mildly – in subsequent flu pandemics.How and why multiple-wave outbreaks occur, and how subsequent waves of infection can be prevented, has become a staple of epidemiological modelling studies and pandemic preparation, which have looked at everything from social behaviour and health policy to vaccination and the buildup of community immunity, also known as herd immunity.This is being watched very carefully. Without a vaccine, and with no widespread immunity to the new disease, one alarm is being sounded by the experience of Singapore, which has seen a sudden\u0026nbspresurgence in infections\u0026nbspdespite being lauded for its early handling of the outbreak.Although Singapore instituted a strong contact tracing system for its general population, the disease re-emerged in\u0026nbspcramped dormitory accommodation\u0026nbspused by thousands of foreign workers with inadequate hygiene facilities and shared canteens.Singapore’s experience, although very specific, has demonstrated the ability of the disease to come back strongly in places where people are in close proximity and its ability to exploit any weakness in public health regimes set up to counter it.In June 2020, Beijing suffered from a new cluster of coronavirus cases which caused authorities to re-implement restrictions that China had previously been able to lift. In the UK, the city of Leicester was unable to come out of lockdown because of the development of a new spike of coronavirus cases. Clusters also emerged in Melbourne, requiring a re-imposition of lockdown conditions.Conventional wisdom among scientists suggests second waves of resistant infections occur after the capacity for treatment and isolation becomes exhausted. In this case the concern is that the social and political consensus supporting lockdowns is being overtaken by public frustration and the urgent need to reopen economies.The threat declines when susceptibility of the population to the disease falls below a certain threshold or when widespread vaccination becomes available.In general terms the ratio of susceptible and immune iniduals in a population at the end of one wave determines the potential magnitude of a subsequent wave. The worry is that with\u0026nbspa vaccine still many months away, and the real rate of infection only being guessed at, populations worldwide remain highly vulnerable to both resurgence and subsequent waves.Macron told reporters of his concerns about attempts to reduce the size of the recovery package, insisting there would not be a deal “made at the cost of European ambition”. Merkel had warned there was no guarantee of success.A second meeting has been pencilled in for the last week of July but there are concerns that a second wave of coronavirus infections could stand in the way."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c12d9261d3bc086afcb621192a8d3b94210da05/0_28_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0898ea02d4fd30fda31ddfd38fe97783","title":"cheap popular and it works irelands contact tracing app success","story":"Irish-made app has more than 1.3m downloads, in stark contrast to the UK’s effortsA government minister once compared Ireland’s health care system to Angola – a political minefield of dysfunction, bureaucracy, waste and inefficiency. The nickname stuck.Yet this morass has just produced a shiny success: a Covid-19 contact-tracing app that is popular and appears to work.Since launching on 6 July, the Covid Tracker app was downloaded 1.3m times in eight days – the fastest-downloaded app per capita in Europe – and has started picking up cases of infection.“We’ve been delighted by the take-up rate. It’s gone beyond the initial hopes,” said Colm Harte, the technical director of NearForm, the company that made the app for the Health Service Executive (HSE).The app uses a phone’s Bluetooth signal to exchange a digital handshake with another device also running the app when users come within 2 metres of each other for more than 15 minutes. The anonymous keys are stored in a log on the phone, which health authorities may ask users to upload if they are diagnosed with Covid-19. The log can then be used to track unnamed contacts, who are alerted about possible infection.NearForm made a similar app for Gibraltar, which launched last month, and one for Northern Ireland, due to launch within weeks. “It’s the same core platform. It’s built on the Irish solution,” said Harte.“An Irish solution to an Irish problem” is a derisive term in Ireland for attempted fixes that are daft or quixotic. In this case, though, there seems no need for self-deprecation.Ireland has made a tool against the pandemic not only for Ireland but for part of the UK and for a British overseas territory – while Britain flounders in its own attempt to produce an app.The NHS Covid-19 app was meant to roll out in England in May. That slipped to June. Last month, officials ditched the app in its original form and backed an alternative designed by Apple and Google. The government said it might launch in winter.The Irish are not crowing. Authorities originally hoped to launch the app in March, only to encounter complications. And its effectiveness remains unclear. “It still has to prove its mettle,” said Seán L’Estrange, a social scientist at University College Dublin who has studied tracing.Even so, the take-up rate is impressive, said L’Estrange. “What that shows is the credibility of the app, the confidence in the initiative, and the enthusiasm for participating in the collective project to contain the virus.”The €850,000 (£773,000) price tag is “dirt cheap” given that the average cost of identifying each case of infection is €42,000, said L’Estrange. “Even if it fails to produce the goods, little has been lost.”This suggests Ireland’s health system, plagued in normal times by bloated management, turf battles and duplication, can do well in a crisis.“The whole of the organisation attuned itself and focused on coronavirus,” said Fran Thompson, a HSE spokesperson. The pandemic allowed the HSE to shortcut the regular tender process and select NearForm in mid-March. “It probably saved six to eight weeks,” said Thompson.NearForm employs 150 people and builds software mostly for private clients. It is based in a former council office in Tramore, a seaside town in County Waterford, but has international pedigree, with developers scattered across 21 countries. Clients include Condé Nast, Intel and Microsoft.Following Singapore’s lead, NearForm’s developers raced to build a centralised app that used smartphones’ Bluetooth connectivity to trace people who come into close contact with infected people.By April, they had a version but were struggling with Bluetooth. It worked with Android but Apple’s iPhone operating system sent apps to sleep when unused and Bluetooth could not activate them.“We quickly hit the same problems as other countries,” said Harte. A centralised system also raised alarms about storing data and breaching privacy.Then Apple and Google came together and offered an app that would support public health apps and let Android and iOS phones connect even while locked. Their decentralised version held no data in a single official database, alleviating privacy concerns.The Irish were among the first to grasp Silicon Valley’s offer in late April. “We got in early and it was full steam ahead. It allowed us to move on,” said Harte.Britain, meanwhile, persisted with attempts to make a customised app until last month when it made a U-turn and embraced the model preferred by Apple and Google.NearForm claims to be the only company to have built apps with interoperability across borders and jurisdictions – Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, and Gibraltar and Spain.Using the same source code and supplier should facilitate a coherent all-Ireland response to the pandemic – a decision that raised no political problems at the Stormont assembly.Thompson credits Ireland’s fast take-up rate to the population’s trust in government, desire to do the right thing and good user experience based on consultation and behavioural research.Stephen Farrell, a computer scientist at Trinity College Dublin who has studied contact-tracing technology, said the app’s impact on the pandemic may remain unclear. “I’d not be surprised if we never end up with a definitive answer to that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/013fcfb2fe5755aabbca1bde23ee0ac6c0e32048/71_0_1260_756/master/1260.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2778d42b4a8038b22391dd775d891aeb","title":"chinas first climate striker cant return to school","story":"Ou Hongyi, who took part in the #FridaysforFuture protest, says she has been told she cannot return to school unless she stops her activismTakes initiative. An independent thinker. Engages in study outside of the curriculum. Cares deeply about her community and the world around her. Stands up for her convictions and beliefs.These are all qualities that would appear to make Ou Hongyi a suitable candidate for studying at her dream institution of Harvard University.For Ou, however, those qualities may scuttle her chance of even graduating from high school or taking college entrance examinations.As the first young person in China to engage in Greta Thunberg-inspired Fridays For Future climate strikes, Ou, 17, has become a target for the authorities who see that activism as a challenge to their control.Ou claims she has been told by authorities to ditch her climate activism as a condition for her restarting studies at Guangxi Normal University affiliated high school in Guilin, where she studied until late 2018.Ou, who also goes by the English name Howey, suspended her studies in December 2018 after being told she was “not suitable” for the international programme there and decided to study for the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) and US college admissions SAT test on her own. But, following the wishes of her parents, and with dreams of pursuing higher education, she has been attempting in recent months to re-enter the school.Her parents have been called several times by provincial education authorities, Ou told the , urging them to stop her climate activism and not to conduct interviews with foreign media.Ou said her principal, Li Linbo, also told her in a meeting on 29 May that she must promise to end her climate activism before being readmitted, a claim corroborated by her father.Several attempts to reach her principal, including calls to his office and personal number, as well as faxed questions, were not responded to.“I don’t want to stop,” Ou said of her climate activism. “I want more people to know.”Authorities also required Howey to have a psychological test before applying for readmission. “The only negative thing it said was I’m stubborn,” she said.Ou Jun, her father, told the  that her parents would not force her to give up her beliefs, but added that they were worried about her obsession and how it could derail her future. “She has anxiety about the climate,” he said. “We hope that she can graduate from high school, enter university, and hope that she can pay less attention to climate change issues.”While currently the top global carbon dioxide emitter, China is expected to meet its Paris Agreement pledge of peaking carbon emissions at or before 2030. China’s leader, Xi Jinping, has also put the development of an “ecological civilisation” at the core of his policies, which would appear to be a natural fit with Ou’s own obsessions.It is not necessarily her concerns for the climate that have sparked a pressure campaign from authorities, Kecheng Fang, an assistant professor at the school of journalism at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, told the .“Most importantly, because it is about collective action,” he said. “No matter what kind of collective action it is, it’s considered highly sensitive.”While expressing concern about climate change is not forbidden, there has been a narrowing of discourse on the subject, particularly if it calls into question the ambition of authorities, Fang said. “The underlying logic is that basically you can talk about those topics that are considered less sensitive, but it matters how you talk about it.”While she waits to return to school, Ou has started her own initiative called Plant for Survival, whereby she is encouraging young people in China to plant more trees. From last November through to this January, the group planted more than 300 trees in and around Guilin."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19cc101e00831b0a7314db106c37a261568a4d4f/0_267_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=5c03f0166831a0ea5e14d34306b01521","title":"how coronavirus is reshaping europes tourism hotspots","story":"The collapse of visitor numbers amid the pandemic offers cities a new opportunity to rethink their business modelby  Stephen Burgen in Barcelona and  Angela Giuffrida in RomeBarely a year ago the graffiti on the walls of Barcelona read Tourists Go Home. Now that they have gone, the city – along with others that are heavily dependent on the tourist trade – fears an economic meltdown and is hastily drawing up plans to lure visitors back while placating tourist-weary residents.But Covid-19 has got the mayors of some of Europe’s most heavily visited cities, academics and urban scholars all singing the same tune: the collapse of the travel industry caused by the virus offers a unique opportunity for cities plagued by mass tourism to rethink their business model.Barbora Hrubá, of the Prague tourist agency, said the Czech capital wants a “different type of visitor”. Xavier Marcé, the Barcelona councillor responsible for tourism, said: “I don’t want more tourists, I want more visitors.” “We’re a city in crisis and are trying to do something different,” said Paola Mar, his counterpart in Venice.“We want to have a sustainable visitor economy that doesn’t harm the liveability of our city,” said Heleen Jansen, corporate communications coordinator at amsterdam\u0026amppartners, a non-profit organisation that advises Amsterdam on how to market itself.However, good intentions are one thing, concrete proposals another. According to Janet Sanz, Barcelona’s deputy mayor, cities that have grown dependent on tourism are paying the price for having a monocultural economy and now the challenge is to ersify.Easier said than done with the scale of tourism in these cities. Barcelona, which has a population of 1.6 million, received 30 million visitors in 2019 Venice, 270,000 residents, 25 million visitors Amsterdam, population 873,000, welcomed 19 million tourists.In Venice, mass tourism has in recent years been seen as a threat to the city’s survival, but now the debate has switched to how it will pull through with fewer visitors.“This is a time for reflection,” said Mar. While the city is yet to devise any bold measures to manage tourism better in the future, some smaller changes are afoot.“Owners of property that was rented to tourists have signed an agreement with the council and Venice’s universities to now rent to students,” said Mar. “It’s a good sign.”Other cities, including Amsterdam, Barcelona and Lisbon, have taken steps to curb the Airbnb phenomenon that has pushed up rents and driven residents out.Jaime Palomera, spokesman for Barcelona’s Tenants’ Union, wants the thousands of tourist apartment licences that were granted in perpetuity by the Catalan government in 2011 to be revoked. He also says the government should legislate against letting single rooms to tourists, a loophole that allows landlords to get around the law banning renting out entire apartments.As in Barcelona, much of Venetians’ antipathy towards tourists has focused on the giant cruise ships. But neither city has jurisdiction over the port and any form of control will have to come from central government.“We no longer live in fear of the monsters crashing,” said Matteo Secchi, who leads the activist group, Venessia. “But I feel for the staff at the cruise ship terminal who are now at home. We are against big ships and have always said we need a solution, but the workers must be protected.”With tens of thousands of jobs at stake, the headache for cities is how to rethink tourism without causing mass unemployment.Marcé believes it is less a question of numbers than of distribution. He wants to encourage tourists to visit other parts of the city and not just the traditional sites. This is a view shared by Amsterdam in its six-point post-Covid-19 plan, although it concedes that it is difficult to discourage visitors from congregating at iconic sites.“Thirty million visitors managed the way they were up until the beginning of this year is not sustainable,” Marcé said. “The same number with different interests dispersed to different areas may not be such a big problem.”Octavi Bono, the director general of tourism for the Catalan government, agrees. “We don’t want more or less tourism, we want better tourism with a better distribution of tourists by season and by location. We are continuing with an agreed marketing plan.”Agreed by whom? asks Pere Mariné, spokesman for Barcelona’s federation of residents’ associations. “He says that because they’re thinking about businessmen, not citizens.”“As for Marcé’s idea of decentralisation, I’m not opposed to it, but that entails promoting the city in a different way, and the plans they’ve approved recently point to more of the same, mass tourism.”Marcé says the problem is that the Catalan coast is crowded with tourists who want to spend a day in Barcelona, a problem not shared by Paris, Berlin or Amsterdam. Limiting the number of beds in the city has no impact on day-trippers, he points out.In Amsterdam, Geerte Udo, chief executive of amsterdam\u0026amppartners, says they are working on a “campaign about the rediscovery of the cultural offer, the old centre of the city and other different neighbourhoods, the local entrepreneurs and the public space. In this way, the campaign contributes to the renewed bond between residents and their city, environment and each other. It builds on our aim to seduce Amsterdamers to rediscover their city.”At a time when many residents are revelling in the tourist-free streets, squares and beaches, it seems odd that both Amsterdam and Barcelona are urging them to “rediscover” the city. It gives the impression that the citizens abandoned the city when in fact they feel they have been expelled from it.In the meantime, no one expects travel to recover significantly this year, so for now it is a question of wait and see.“We think the low-cost market is going to change, both because of effects on airlines and attitudes to mobility,” Marcé said, adding that low-cost accounts for only 4 million visitors to the city.Mar also believes there will be a natural change in tourism as a result of the pandemic.“Tourism will be completely different,” she said. “Not everyone will travel like they used to. And those who do travel may want to do so in a calmer way, maybe they will see less but enjoy the experience more.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/51b26da5ea6c675ecd1b94692f963ea9a1a133ed/42_0_1357_814/master/1357.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6e6873647d82328a6ac6bbc654747719","title":"new zealand is not that big a place the nine month 20000 search for two lost dogs","story":"Poodle Dice and fox terrier Weed went missing last October, but owners insist ‘we can feel them out there’A couple living on the South Island’s Otago Peninsula are not giving up hope of finding their beloved dogs – despite having spent $20,000 (£10,400) and nine months scouring the country for them, to no avail.Nine-year-old black poodle Dice and three-year-old fox terrier Weed went missing from Alan Funnell and Louisa Andrew’s home in October last year.Since then, Funnell has spent one weekend a month traversing the South Island searching for them.He and Andrew say they have put up about 400 signs and spent at least NZ$20,000 in their mission.“Our dogs to us are like our family, we just know they are out there somewhere,” Funnell said. “New Zealand is really not that big a place.”The saga started when Andrew went to feed the couple’s chickens and let the dogs out of the car. They ran off, perhaps chasing a rabbit, and did not return.“We called and called, and they didn’t come,” said Funnell. “We love our animals. They are great wee dogs. We are not going to give up until we find them.”Members of the public have helped with putting up signs which are now spread throughout country – from the tip of the North Island to the bottom of the South Island.The couple have raised more than $10,000 to help with the search from almost 300 donors. “We got a huge amount of support throughout New Zealand and we are lucky to have that,” Funnell said.Funnell thinks the dogs were picked up by tourists after a sighting came through of two dogs being tied to a campervan in the area.“We have been through a rollercoaster of emotions in the process of it all. We are sure they are alive. We have come to being positive about things,” said Funnell.“We can feel them out there.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f9e673ad33857a048362cc9b7ea9b9dfe5eff18/0_341_5365_3219/master/5365.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=6dd466da634ddfc087f6639f3ab62614","title":"great outdoors life moves outside during pandemic in pictures","story":"From art to religion, coronavirus has forced educational, cultural and social life into the open air on an unprecedented scale across the world"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Countries face a rapid ageing of their populations which will place enormous strain on their societiesOne Change: From plastic bottles to paper bags, our huge reliance on throwaway items needs to changeNational Economic and Social Council sets out actions needed for sustainable recovery"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney: A predator denning in parks, gardens and wasteland gets mixed responsesA beefed-up, independent National Parks and Wildlife Service would be just the ticketMichael Viney: Wild grasses have loved the mood swings of our climate this yearAnother Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping changeThree terrapins as pets seems a bit ambitious considering their needsThe list of causes of damage is long, making it hard to know where to start"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: Yui MokPA WireThe vast majority of the Irish population are still vulnerable to catching a coronavirus infection, according to early results from a study to investigate exposure to Covid-19 in the population.Initial findings from research into a random sample of healthy people in Dublin and Sligo indicate that less than 5 per of the population have been exposed to the disease.They show the State is still some way off achieving herd immunity, where 60-90 per cent of population become immune to a virus to halt it spreading.More than 5,000 letters were sent out in Dublin and Sligo – areas of the country with higher and lower known levels of infection respectively – to participate in blood tests for Covid-19 antibodies.The research, known as a seroprevalence study, measures antibodies in the blood of healthy people to better understand past rates of infection across the population. A person develops antibodies to protect against future infections from the illness.Almost 2,500 people participated in the study with blood tests taken from final participants last week, one month after the study was launched.Dr Cillian De Gascun, director of UCD’s National Virus Reference Laboratory, which helped co-ordinate the study, said that the rate was slightly higher in Dublin than in Sligo. He said that finding out that less than 5 per cent of the population as a whole being exposed to the virus was “a little bit disappointing”.“What that means is there is a very large susceptible population there, and that is one of the reasons why we have to be so careful with moving through the reopening phases,” he said. “Because so many people have not had the infection and if the virus kicks off again, it will transmit very readily to people purely because there is no significant level of population immunity at this point.”Follow-up studyDr De Gascun said researchers would look to repeat the tests with different sections of the population over the next six to 12 months and return to people in whom antibodies were detected to see if they would participate in a follow-up study to assess how long they have immunity.“We are seeing suggestions that antibodies probably don’t last much past three or four months but it is still early days, so if we can get a cohort of people together and resample them at intervals over the next six to 12 months it would be interesting to see how long the antibodies last,” he said.He expressed disappointment at a response rate of less than 50 per cent out of the more than 5,000 people contacted. He thought more people would have participated given the profile of the virus.Serological surveys are considered a valuable tool to measure the extent of the pandemic given the number of people who can have the virus but show no symptoms. The initial results of the Irish seroprevalence study is similar to analysis in other countries.A study of 60,000 people in Spain – one of the countries worst affected by the Covid-19 pandemic – found that about 5 per cent of the population had developed antibodies, according to a report published in the Lancet.The area around Madrid, the hardest-hit part of the country, had more than 10 per cent prevalence of antibodies, more than five times the level of less populated coastal provinces.A study by Germany’s infectious diseases agency, the Robert Koch Institute, detected antibodies in only 1.3 per cent of 12,000 blood donors tested earlier this month. More than half the residents tested in Italy’s northern province of Bergamo – one of the worst affected areas in the world – were last month found to have Covid-19 antibodies.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4308105.1595153123!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"older children spread coronavirus just as much as adults study finds","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe study is more worrisome for children in second-level schools. This group was even more likely to infect others than adults were, the study found. Photograph: iStockIn the heated debate over reopening schools, one burning question has been whether and how efficiently children can spread the virus to others.A large new study from South Korea offers an answer: Children younger than age 10 transmit to others much less often than adults do, but the risk is not zero. However those between the ages of 10 and 19 can spread the virus at least as well as adults do.The findings suggest that as schools reopen, communities will see clusters of infection take root that include children of all ages, several experts cautioned. “I fear that there has been this sense that kids just won’t get infected or don’t get infected in the same way as adults and that, therefore, they’re almost like a bubbled population,” said Michael Osterholm, an infectious diseases expert at the University of Minnesota. “There will be transmission,” Dr Osterholm said. “What we have to do is accept that now and include that in our plans.”South Korean researchers identified 5,706 people who were the first to report Covid-19 symptoms in their households between January 20th and March 27th, when schools were closed, and then traced the 59,073 contacts of these “index cases.” They tested all of the household contacts of each patient, regardless of symptoms, but only tested symptomatic contacts outside the household.The first person in a household to develop symptoms is not necessarily the first to have been infected, and the researchers acknowledged this limitation. Children are also less likely than adults to show symptoms, so the study may have underestimated the number of children who set off the chain of transmission within their households.Children under age 10 were roughly half as likely as adults to spread the virus to others, consistent with other studies. That may be because children generally exhale less air, and therefore less virus-laden air, or because they exhale that air closer to the ground, making it less likely that adults would breathe it in.The study is more worrisome for children in second-level schools. This group was even more likely to infect others than adults were, the study found. But some experts said that finding may be a fluke or may stem from the children’s behaviours. – New York TimesEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Securing pay and pension justice in sector is \u0026lsquovery much unfinished business\u0026rsquo says SiptuNative American tribe raised funds for Irish famine relief in 1847Parties ided over publication of list of countries while advising public not to travelMinister suing Western Building Systems over alleged defects in 40 schools in StateOn a remote farm in Australia, Donegal woman\u0026rsquos children enrol in School of the AirPharmacists say they have been \u0026lsquoignored\u0026rsquo by Government and call for support packageGovernment planning for schools to reopen fully in September but teachers warn this may not be possibleSinn F\u0026eacutein cannot lead conversation as party is \u0026lsquotoxic to unionists\u0026rsquo, says Colum EastwoodPostmark will be applied to mail sent in England and Ireland until August 9thCabinet meeting on Monday cancelled as Taoiseach remains in Brussels at EU summitEamon Ryan says such a measure would need agreement from Stormont and LondonTributes to CervicalCheck campaigner (39) who sued state over misreading of smear test resultsLimerick woman\u0026rsquos taxing court battle stood in stark contrast to Varadkar\u0026rsquos initial pledgeCathal Berry urges Government to implement national cyber security strategyLithuanian Arunus Butkus (53) found unconscious in street on Friday and died at scenePeople will not be covered if they travel to countries on safe list, insurers warnStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4308275.1595181257!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"jack charlton to be commemorated through special postmark","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPaul McGrath holding a letter with a special postmark paying tribute to Jack Charlton. Photograph:  MaxwellsPA The life of footballing hero Jack Charlton will be commemorated by a special postmark applied to mail sent in England and Ireland.The former Leeds United defender, who won a World Cup winner’s medal while playing for England in 1966, died on July 10th aged 85.After a successful career in England, as a manager he helped lead the Republic of Ireland to their first major tournament finals in the late 1980s and early 1990s.To commemorate his contribution to both nations An Post and the Royal Mail have collaborated for the first time to create a postmark in his honour.The postmark, which reads “Jack Charlton, 1935 — 2020”, will be applied across stamped mail posted in England and the Republic of Ireland from Monday until August 9th.David McRedmond, chief executive at An Post, said: “Jack Charlton will always have a special place in the hearts and minds of Irish people.“He gave our nation many of our happiest and proudest moments.“Jack was the greatest example of a culture shared across these islands: that a proud Leeds player, a tall English football hero could become an Irish legend.“That’s why it is so fitting that he should be the subject of the first joint postmark between An Post and the Royal Mail.”Following the announcement of Charlton’s death, tributes poured in from his former clubs and the wider football family.Taoiseach Micheal Martin said: “He was an iconic figure on and off the pitch, in England and Ireland.”Stuart Simpson, chief executive at Royal Mail, said Charlton was a “football hero” in both countries.Highlighting the postal services’ first-time postmark collaboration, he added: “The commemoration of the life of Jack Charlton is a fitting occasion to do so.“Jack was an integral member of England’s 1966 World Cup winning squad and played a key role in the Republic of Ireland’s football history.“We would like to extend our condolences to the family of Jack Charlton from everyone at Royal Mail.”English Football Association chairman Greg Clarke said Charlton was “a true giant of English football”, adding: “He left an indelible impression on our national game and was guaranteed an affectionate and warm welcome wherever he went”.In a statement, his family said he led an “extraordinary life” and remembered him as a “thoroughly honest, kind, funny and genuine man who always had time for people”.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4308615.1595228374!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"thousands of health and community staff to step up campaign over pay restoration","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThousands of staff in State-funded organisations providing health and social services are seeking pay restoration. File photograph: Cate McCurryPA WireThousands of staff in State-funded organisations providing health and social services as well as community employment scheme supervisors are to step up campaigns over pay restoration and pensions, the trade union Siptu has said.Both groups staged industrial action in February just before the country was hit by the coronavirus pandemic.Meetings are expected to be held this week to map out an updated campaign.Siptu said “strong and concentrated action” was needed from the Government to deal with long standing issues facing workers in the community and voluntary sector.Siptu deputy general secretary for the public service John King said securing pay and pension justice for workers in community services remained “very much unfinished business”.Staff in organisations which receive grant aid to provide services from the Health Service Executive (HSE) - known technically as Section 39 bodies - are seeking the restoration of pay which was cut following the economic crash nearly a decade ago.Unions contend that while Section 39 organisations were urged to cut staff pay in line with reductions in remuneration to public servants during the austerity years, the personnel involved have not seen pay restoration, unlike direct State employees.Community employment supervisors want the Government to implement a 2008 Labour Court recommendation to give them access to an occupational pension scheme.Mr King said: “Over the next number of weeks, we intend to intensify our campaign for pay and pensions justice. . We have seen throughout the Covid-19 crisis community employment supervisors putting their shoulders to the wheel and keeping essential community services going across the country. Section 39 workers have also stepped up and continued to provide frontline social and health services to the most vulnerable people in our society. It is time these essential workers are valued, respected for the contribution they make and that it is recognised by the Government that these workers have a right to pay restoration and pension provision in line with the improvements secured in recent years by public service workers and across the private sector.”‘Forgotten sector’Siptu community sector organiser Eddie Mullins said the community sector had long been the “forgotten sector” which had experienced disproportionate cuts during the years of austerity.“Before the Covid-19 outbreak, hundreds of community employment supervisors and Section 39 workers came together for a national day of protest to highlight the failure of the last Government to deal with our members outstanding pay and pension claims. This issue is not going away,” he said.In April 2018, the then minister of state at the department of public expenditure Michael D’Arcy said community employment supervisors were employees of private companies and not of the State. He said it could cost the State up to €188 million a year to pay for pensions for staff in exchequer funded community and voluntary organisations, as well as a further €318 million for ex gratia lump sums.In a note to the Oireachtas Covid-19 committee earlier this month the Department of Health said in October 2018, a deal was reached at the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) on pay restoration for staff in 50 Section 39 organisations on a pilot basis. It said this process commenced in April 2019 with further payments due in October 2020 and October 2021 as appropriate.However it indicated that there had been no developments in relation to staff in about 250 other Section 39 organisations .“There had been initial engagements in recent months between the parties on this matter under the auspices of the WRC. HSE management has indicated its willingness to undertake the preparatory work around implementation of pay restoration for this next group. The HSE has also confirmed the following:“However, despite the engagement that took place, it was not possible to reach an agreement. Management remain available and committed to the process. It is hoped that when the demands of the pandemic allow, engagement at the WRC can be reconvened.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4308364.1595201177!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"irish economy to get injection of up to 7bn in stimulus measures","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Finance Paschal Donohoe is  understood to be working on a scheme that will offer a tax rebate to encourage people to holiday in Ireland this year. File photograph: Getty The Government will commit to a spending package approaching €7 billion to boost the State’s economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic when it publishes its July stimulus plan this week.Senior sources confirmed yesterday that more than €6 billion – split between straight expenditure for grants and stimulus, tax rebates, and the credit guarantee scheme – had already been committed to.The figure is likely to rise, with further measures being added when the plan is considered by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Recovery, which is chaired by Tánaiste Leo Varadkar, to be finalised at a full Cabinet meeting on Wednesday.Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe is also understood to be working on a scheme that will offer a tax rebate to encourage people to holiday in Ireland this year.Mr Varadkar and Government colleagues have given broad indications of what will be included in the stimulus package, including an extension of the Wage Subsidy Scheme and the Pandemic Unemployment Payment until spring next year.A continuation of the commercial rates waiver is also expected, as well as a larger restart grant for businesses that were forced to close as a result of coronavirus.Brussels deadlockThere was deadlock in Brussels last night between European Union leaders on the scale of a plan to help drag the continent out of the recession caused by the pandemic. Marathon talks to bridge isions over a proposed €1.8 trillion package, comprising the seven-year EU budget and a one-off €750 billion recovery fund, have been taking place since Friday.European Central Bank president Christine Lagarde said reaching an ambitious financial aid package for the bloc was more important than sealing a quick deal at any cost.The summit is one of the longest-running ever, with member states eager to keep trying to find a compromise, given that a failure to do so could spook financial markets and fuel doubts about the efficacy of the EU in times of crisis.The EU economy is forecast to contract by a record 8.3 per cent this year, with some member states hit far worse than others by the downturn.The European Commission has proposed a recovery fund of €750 billion, which it would borrow from financial markets and distribute to member states.The bulk of the money would be given out in grants that do not need to be paid back by national governments but would be recouped through joint EU levies such as a future plastic tax. But the proposal was blocked by disagreements about the size of the recovery fund and how it would be allocated to member states.Irish demandsCountries including Ireland demanded a change to the system for calculating how much of the funds each member state should get, hoping for a greater proportion. The main objections came from group of “frugal” countries – Austria, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Sweden – which pushed for a more modest package, and for a reduction in the amount of grants, fearing they could incur liabilities and face punishment from domestic voters opposed to monetary distribution in the EU.Meanwhile, Minister for Public Expenditure Michael McGrath said that in addition to measures announced already, the Government was examining if projects that were “shovel ready” in areas such as transport could be started sooner.A plan to retrofit 500,000 homes to improve their energy efficiency is also expected to begin earlier than expected, as part of the “green economy” section of the stimulus plan.Sinn Féin and Labour have already published alternative plans to stimulate the economy with spending commitments of €8.6 billion and €10 billion respectively. Mr Varadkar has said it is the Government’s preference to keep the deficit to €30 billion this year and that there was a limit to the amount that could be spent on stimulus measures.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Many cities and states locking down again as new infection figures hit record highsChina warns it will deliver \u0026lsquoresolute response\u0026rsquo to any move by UK to sanction officialsDozens missing as overflowing Brahmaputra River damage crops and triggers mudslidesMore than 150 people have died or are missing in flooding and landslidesTwo other teenagers who ate meat from same infected animal being treated with antibioticsAlmost 4cm-long nematode roundworm is thought to have come from raw fishThousands displaced after heavy rains trigger flash floodingMove after Japan\u0026rsquos capital records highest daily cases \u0026ndash 224 \u0026ndash since pandemic beganInfluential sister of Kim Jong-un says meeting makes no sense without reward for PyongyangMayor was reportedly subject of criminal investigation into sexual assault allegationsBilateral military deal driven by Tehran fury at bombs and arson blamed on US and IsraelBeijing calls on Australia to stop interfering following response to China imposing new security law in territoryGlory to Hong Kong, deemed to contain \u0026lsquostrong political messages\u0026rsquo, can no longer be sung or playedMost deaths have come from hardest-hit Kunamoto prefecturePM\u0026rsquos image undamaged as Bharatiya Janata party proves adept at deflecting blameFor three decades the armies of the two most populous countries have been patrolling a disputed border in the HimalayasDozen people missing on southwestern island of Kyushu as government pledges to boost rescue effortsArmy deployed to patrol the NSW and Victoria borders, closed for first time in 100 yearsFlooding and mudslides on Kyushu force hundreds of thousands to evacuate homesGlobal wrap: Subcontinent overtakes Russia, as border between Australian states to closeStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4308602.1595228710!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eu summit 390bn proposed to help states recover from covid 19","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFrench President Emmanuel Macron, center, leaves the European Council building early on Monday during an EU summit in Brussels. Photograph: Getty ImagesEU leaders will try to strike a deal on Europe’s financial response to the coronavirus pandemic on Monday following a fraught weekend of talks in which they argued over the size of a recovery fund for the bloc.Overnight negotiations broke up at 6am on Monday morning after Charles Michel, president of the European Council, floated a new figure of €390 billion in grants for stricken countries. This was lower than proposals going into the summit but higher than earlier demands from an alliance of so-called “frugal” nations including the Netherlands. Diplomats said the new grants figure represented a breakthrough in marathon four-day talks that have been beset by isions. Leaving the summit, Austria’s chancellor Sebastian Kurz, one of the advocates for a smaller fund, said he was “very happy” with the result after a day of “tough negotiations”.The talks will resume at 4pm Brussels time (3pm in Ireland). If a deal is struck on the size of the recovery fund, the focus will shift to a governance mechanism for its disbursement — another isive topic.Governments will also need to resolve a disagreement on whether to tie distribution of aid to respect for the rule of law after resistance from Poland and Hungary. Seven-year budgetLeaders have been negotiating since Friday morning as they seek a co-ordinated EU response to the worst economic crisis since the bloc’s inception. Not only are they attempting to unlock a deal authorising the European Commission to borrow unprecedented sums to seed the recovery fund but they are also attempting to settle the EU’s upcoming €1tn seven-year budget.The main sticking point over the weekend has been the level of non-repayable grants that the recovery fund will be permitted to give hard-pressed member states.Earlier on Sunday, the leaders of Austria, Denmark, the Netherlands and Sweden said they wanted to scale back proposed grants to €350bn, coupled with another €350bn of loans, in a total recovery package worth €700bn.The offer, which was conditional on rebates to their EU budget contributions, was backed by Finland but received a frosty response from nations that have been hardest hit by the pandemic. During the summit dinner, French president Emmanuel Macron railed against the frugal countries and compared their strategy to Britain’s ill-fated demands for a smaller EU budget under former prime minister David Cameron.Italian prime minister Giuseppe Conte said failure to strike a deal would lead to the “destruction of Europe’s single market”, according to diplomats.The offer from frugal leaders represented a change from their pre-summit position that no grants should be distributed under the recovery fund. But it was still a substantial cut from draft proposals going into the summit. France, Germany, Spain and Italy had pushed to keep the grants ringfenced at no less than €400bn — a figure that was itself shy of the €500bn originally advocated by Berlin and Paris in May.Mr Michel is expected to table a fresh negotiating blueprint on Monday, including the new €390bn figure alongside proposals for budget rebates for the frugal states and Germany. Leaving the summit on Monday morning, Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte said the talks were “back on track”. Still working“We are still working. We have made progress but are not there yet,” Mr Rutte told journalists on his way back to his hotel.Leaders will also need to agree on how to police the recovery fund after Mr Rutte insisted on the right to veto grant payments if countries failed to stick to their reform promises. The issue sparked fierce resistance from Italy over the weekend. Diplomats said the dispute over governance would likely be solved once the level of grants was agreed.Hungarian premier Viktor Orban over the weekend also presented another roadblock by threatening to veto a compromise that tied distribution of aid to respect for the rule of law. Budapest demanded that any potential sanctions to suspend cash payments would need the unanimous support of all governments.Speaking to journalists on Sunday, Mr Orban accused Mr Rutte of hating him and Hungary.Mr Orban’s stance was backed by Poland, which joined Hungary in rejecting a draft plan that would require a qualified majority of member states to back potential cash sanctions.One diplomat said Hungary and Poland’s position was designed to extract more money as part of a final compromise.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Israeli prime minister still awaiting final approval from Washington for implementation of controversial planGovernment under pressure as initial lifting of restrictions now seen as having been too rapidEndeavour intended to stoke Arab and Muslim pride over rich heritage of discoveryCases confirmed in doctors and nurse with concern virus will move fast through campsHealth officials say country in \u0026lsquodangerous place\u0026rsquo after early success in curbing epidemicSpeculation grows that \u0026lsquofire\u0026rsquo may have been deliberate attack on facilityIsrael\u0026rsquos move on West Bank and Trump peace plan blocked by Palestinian rivals\u0026lsquoDefender of Israel\u0026rsquo Boris Johnson says move would be \u0026lsquoviolation of international law\u0026rsquoPlan to annex parts of West Bank condemned by UN commissioner as \u0026lsquodisastrous\u0026rsquoSome 9.3m Syrians are now food insecure, an increase of 1.4m in past six monthsSeparatist insurgents from Balochistan province claim responsibility for attackNo group claimed responsibility for the attack and Taliban has denied involvementThousands of children could die from preventable diseases because of dire state of healthcare, UN warnsArab world unites in opposition and warns of dire consequences if annexation proceedsOnly under-65s can take part and pilgrims will be quarantined before and after pilgrimageWorld community urged to reject move to intensify \u0026lsquoprofound human rights violations\u0026rsquoAmple evidence uncovered of movement\u0026rsquos widespread persecution of Yazidi minority and other ethnic minoritiesSarah Hegazi\u0026rsquos simple gesture at a concert led to outrage, persecution and heartbreakDemonstrations against prices and wages erupt in Sweida and spread to DeraaStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com\"/polopoly_fs/1.4192672!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_940/image.jpg","title":"us democratic","story":"The process to choose the Democratic nominee to take on Donald Trump in November’s US presidential election is well under way.States across the country are in the process of choosing\u0026nbsptheir preferred candidate, either through a primary contest or a caucus.

And there would have been more than a million non-Covid deaths resulting from missed treatment if the health service had been overwhelmed in dealing with the pandemic.But charities said more should have been done to get medical care up and running quickly when it became clear early on that the NHS was not stretched. Nightingale Hospitals in particular were largely empty even at the peak of the pandemic and have only recently been reassigned for normal care.Dr Sonya Babu-Narayan, Associate Medical Director at the British Heart Foundation and Consultant Cardiologist, said it was a priority to restore heart and circulatory care: “This report is a sobering wake-up call for governments and the NHS across the UK to urgently restore and maintain care for people with medical conditions including heart and circulatory diseases.“Although the latest statistics have shown fewer excess deaths in recent weeks, people are still experiencing delays in accessing vital treatment and care, which could make them sicker and ultimately lead to more deaths from both undiagnosed and existing conditions.“The growing and significant backlog must be tackled to prevent a tidal wave of illness overwhelming the NHS whilst it’s fighting Covid-19.”Last week, the University of Oxford found that 5,000 fewer heart attack patients had attended hospital from March to May, many of whom could have died through lack of medical care.The Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) also warned that delays in diagnosis and treatment meant many people who would have recovered from their illness were now facing incurable cancer.Modelling by the ICR suggests that a three-month delay to surgery alone across all Stage 1-3 cancers could cause more than 4,700 attributable deaths per year in England. Clare Turnbull, Professor of Cancer Genomics at The Institute of Cancer Research, London, said: “Lockdown and re-deployment of NHS workers as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic is causing significant disruption to cancer diagnosis and management. “For patients with cancer, delay of surgery has the real potential to increase the likelihood of advanced disease, with some patients’ tumours progressing from being curable – with near normal life expectancy – to non-curable – with limited life expectancy.“At this point, it is crucial to ramp up capacity as quickly as possible to allow cancer services to clear the backlog accumulated during lockdown.”Figures released last week from Target Ovarian Cancer showed that more than half of women with ovarian cancer surveyed said their treatment had been affected by coronavirus.Annwen Jones OBE, Chief Executive of Target Ovarian Cancer, said: “It’s hard to overstate the difficulties faced by women with ovarian cancer during this pandemic. We must not let them down as health services recover. “It is urgent that we now see comprehensive plans and a timeline for the full restoration of diagnostic, treatment and support services. This is the only way to avoid worse outcomes and a devastating toll on women’s lives.” Data compiled by The  showed that by the end of May there had been more than 23,000 excess deaths in care homes or at home, not linked to Covid-19, since the middle of March. There are also fears that the government’s ‘protect the NHS’ message was too effective, with many people staying away from hospitals when they needed urgent medical help.In April, Chief Executive of NHS England Sir Simon Stevens was forced to issue an urgent message asking people to come forward if they needed treatment.However the report did predict some good news for lockdown. Experts calculated that there would be approximately 200 - 500 fewer road traffic and air pollution deaths, 67 fewer murders and a small drop in work related accidents during the six month first wave period.There may also be a positive impact on health as a result of increased physical activity as people take the opportunity to use their one instance of daily exercise, the authors state, although they also warn that some may become more sedentary whilst staying home. And there is some evidence that recessions can improve mortality rates, possibly saving a few thousands lives.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"must make tiktok social media giants pay lip service child safety","story":"During the last few months of lockdown, it’s not surprising that children have spent more time online than usual – from home learning and Joe Wicks’s PE lessons, to keeping in touch with friends and family on Zoom, or just playing games, alone or with friends.The outside world has changed in so many ways as we have lived through lockdown. But the risks that children face online are still there, as the ’s investigation into TikTok reveals.The fact that some adults have been using TikTok’s private messaging service to groom children, and have only been banned for a week for doing so, is shocking. Yet sadly it is not surprising. This is an all too familiar story of tech giants putting profits before the safety of children and failing to properly protect kids from those who want to harm them.It is a reminder too of the argument I have been making for some time - that platforms which encourage and allow children to sign up cannot just be left to regulate themselves.This is not a new problem. I have been Children’s Commissioner for over five years and I’ve lost count of the number of times I’ve read about children coming to harm on social media sites or gaming platforms.I’ve published reports detailing how children themselves say they are worried or anxious about things they have seen or done online. So often when things go wrong there is nobody to report it to. Too often the tech giants have simply refused to take responsibility for the influence and impact they have over children’s lives.That’s why I was so pleased to see the Government bring forward plans in 2017 to make the online world a safer place for children. In 2019, the Government published a White Paper which proposed a ground-breaking statutory duty of care on online platforms – making them truly responsible, for the first time, for what happens to children on their sites.But progress seems to have ground to a halt. It is now over 12 months since that White Paper was published, and a full Government response is promised only by the end of this year. It could be 2024 before any measures are finally put into place – seven years after the Government first promised to tackle these problems. While the coronavirus crisis has inevitably meant the Government’s attention has been focused elsewhere over the last few months, it is hard not to feel that the Government is now dragging its feet.There cannot be more indecision and delay. As we move out of the immediate aftermath of lockdown and into a ‘new normal’, the introduction of a duty of care should be back as one of the Government’s key priorities.It must be backed up by strong sanctions for companies who fail to uphold their duty– not just fines, which these multi-billion pound companies can easily absorb, but the power for their sites to be blocked in the UK by the regulator. There also needs to be a new requirement that platforms actually age verify their users, so that children do not gain access to sites they should not be on.Finally, the new duty of care needs to extend to end-to-end encrypted messaging services. Unlike TikTok, some platforms are simply unable to access private messages between users on their sites. How can children be protected if not even the platforms themselves, let alone the police, can see who they are talking to?The coronavirus lockdown has been a reminder that the online world is an integral part of children’s lives. Now, more than ever before, it is time to make it safer for children.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"weight loss surgery drive tackle obesity","story":"Ministers are set to dramatically increase the NHS’s capacity to conduct weight-loss surgery in a radical bid to tackle Britain’s obesity crisis.The plans, which are said to be part of a broader comprehensive obesity strategy to be announced later this summer, could see obesity formally defined as a chronic disease and NHS trusts and GPs financially incentivised to encourage those most at risk to have bariatric surgery.The initiative has the backing of the Royal College of Physicians, The Obesity Society, the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Obesity and other specialist bodies.It is clear that surgery works but we are not doing enough of it, largely because of the way NHS incentives work, said a Downing Street source.“We have got to move to payment by results where outcomes – actual weight loss – trigger payments.”The evidence shows surgery is the most cost effective way of achieving weight loss and improved long-term health outcomes for people with obesity, defined as having a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or more. Yet less than one per cent of patients who could benefit from metabolic surgery actually receive it in the UK. This is despite guidance from National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) recommending it and the procedure resulting in remission of type 2 diabetes in more than 75 per cent of obese patients who receive it.A BMJ paper published in May 2016 estimated that there were 2.6 million people in the UK who would meet Nice criteria for surgery. The same paper estimated that nearly 10 per cent of all UK adults would have weight-driven type 2 diabetes by 2030 on current trends.Other elements are said to include: population-level interventions to reduce the amount of sugar in processed foods point of sale regulations which will bear down on the marketing of junk foods and a behaviour-change campaign and toolkit to encourage better eating and more physical movement across Britain.There is also said to be a recognition that people struggling with weight gain and obesity face “considerable stigma” which can lead to “denial” or prevent them from seeking medical advice and help.This is said to apply to middle-aged men as well as women and policymakers are keen to make clear that weight gain is an “issue to which no one is immune”. Boris himself has made no secret of his struggle with weight and there are several others in the cabinet who have had either problems of their own or in their families, said one insider. “There is an acceptance that obesity is a national crisis and that radical changes should be made. There is no libertarian resistance. Everyone accepts the need for action.”Covid-19 is said to have concentrated minds and reinforced the need for urgent action among ministers. The UK’s high death figures are at least partially explained by the high incidence of obesity and diabetes in Britain. Mr Johnson is said to have emerged from his stint in hospital with coronavirus more determined than ever to reduce not only his own weight but the nations. “He’d accost people and say: ‘You’re all right, you’re a skinny. It’s fatties like me who it’s going to get”, reported The Sunday Times yesterday. “Don’t be a fatty in your 50s. It’s pretty bloody horrible.’”From a political perspective, the crisis is also seen as providing a rare window of opportunity.“People have seen not only the impact obesity has had but the power of public health measures to change things for the better”, said a source. “There is a loud but small group of deniers – the anti-vaxxers and those who see a conspiracy in everything – but the vast majority now expect the government to act where public health is concerned.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"woke culture isnt laughing matter must stopped late","story":"“Woke” culture is often seen as a joke, but it is changing our country for the worse. We need to stop complaining, and start taking action against it.There are three main things we should do. First, fighting the forces of identity politics – a mentality which refuses to treat people as iniduals and promotes new forms of sectarianism. Take Pran Patel, the founder of “decolonise the curriculum,” who claimed: “Priti Patel is the perfect example of whiteness inhabiting a different coloured vessel”.The public sector cannot – wittingly or unwittingly – promote such ideas, as it does by lumping together non-white minorities under the umbrella term “Black and Minority Ethnic” in official publications. Woke warriors like this isive framing because it creates a sense of “them and us” white people versus everyone else.It’s also unhelpful, concealing important variations we need to understand to improve things. The employment rate among Indian men is higher than among white British, while for Pakistani and Bangladeshi men it’s a little lower. Asian pupils are more likely to get five good GCSEs than white, black pupils less likely. An average for “BAME” conceals these things. And people feel connections to real places, not a sociologist’s acronym. I have constituents who’d say they’re British-Punjabi or Gujarati. They wouldn’t say they’re BAME.Though numerous bestsellers promote this isive new politics, public sector bodies should not be regurgitating their messages. One Sheffield headmaster recently wrote to parents: “Our society is built upon white supremacy.” Apartheid South Africa was such a society. Britain is not. Schools have no business pushing this rubbish – and the Government must issue guidance to that effect. Mandatory “unconscious bias training” is also widespread in the public sector, despite the poor scientific evidence for its effectiveness: it may even be counterproductive.A second aspect of the woke revolution we must resist is its assault on free speech. We are importing American “cancel culture”, in which people may be harassed or sacked for tiny deviations from new orthodoxies. The author JK Rowling writes thoughtfully on transgender issues, recently critiquing the use of the term “people who menstruate,” rather than “women.” Immediately, this triggered accusations of “transphobia”, numerous authors quit her agency, and staff at her publisher refused to work on her new book. One author was sacked from her contract simply for tweeting “I stand with JK Rowling.”Fuelled by social media, cancel culture is accelerating. Last week a bureaucrat at the Environment Agency cancelled an event with the independent mayor of Middlesbrough who had said: “Don’t listen to careless talk in the media about white privilege … Deprivation here appears to be colour blind.”To fight back, employment law may need to change to protect free speech. Of course, firms should be able to fire people who do racist or sexist things. But firms and public sector bodies must respect employment law and free expression. We particularly need to defend free speech in our universities, where cancel culture is most powerful.Third, we need to counter the excessively negative view of British history that is being pushed on young people.

He doesn’t care. He doesn’t listen to others.”A French source said accounts of the outburst were “a little caricatured” but said Mr Macron had “taken a hard line on their inconsistencies.”The Dutch prime minister, whose conservative VVD party faces a strong challenge from far-right eurosceptic parties in elections next March, said on Monday morning that “on the whole” progress was being made at the near record length summit. We\u0027re not here to be invited to each other\u0027s birthdays for the rest of our lives, he said.   His ally Sebastian Kurz appeared to claim victory for their frugals. “Hard negotiations have just come to an end, we can be very satisfied with today\u0027s result,” the Austrian Chancellor tweeted, “We\u0027ll continue in the afternoon.”Charles Michel, the president of the European Council, addressed the exhausted leaders briefly at about 5.45am on Monday morning before talks broke up until 4pm.He said earlier that more than 600,000 people had died as a result of the coronavirus and called on the ided heads of state and government to unite to accomplish “mission impossible”.That is my heartfelt wish,” he said at their third dinner in a row, which, rather than the ostentatious fare  usually served, was a cold plate.The summit of the 27 EU leaders began Friday and was scheduled to end Saturday. Angela Merkel and Mr Macron, the bloc’s two most influential leaders, walked out of heated talks before dawn Sunday with the frugals, bemoaning their lack of commitment to a common cause. They ran off in a bad mood, Mr Rutte saidLeaders are under pressure to respond to the devastating economic impact of the coronavirus lockdowns at their first face to face summit since the pandemic hit in March. While they could call another summit to agree the rescue plan, they fear a second wave could force further talks back online after previous virtual summits also failed. The  recovery fund would be raised by the European Commission against the Budget on behalf of the member states, which would bust a long-standing taboo against raising common debt and  be a historic step towards greater integration.Germany and France, with the backing of most of the bloc, are insistent that at least €400 billion of the package must be handouts rather than loans in order to shield the fragile economies of southern Europe from the worst effects of the coronavirus pandemic.Mr Rutte and his fiscally conservative group say that figure must be substantially less and more money should be disbursed in the form of loans. The frugals see €350 billion euros as the maximum. Discussions over grants have narrowed with Mr Michel saying they €390 billion euros combined with smaller rebates on EU Budgets. Countries that receive rebates to their Budgets, which include the Netherlands, have insisted they are preserved, despite the UK rebate falling away after Brexit. Mr Rutte wants member states to retain an effective veto over EU funding  for recovery plans for the likes of hard-hit Spain and Italy. This would oblige them to reform their labour markets to be more resilient for future crises, he claimed. “The recovery plan cannot become a tool to carry on an ideological battle,” Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, who supports the massive fund to kickstart the economy, “He can\u0027t ask us to do specific reforms,”Mr Conte accused the frugal states of blackmailing Europe and warned their resistance risked ultimately destroying the Single Market and the futures of the young. “Grants are needed for a swift recovery and to strengthen the resilience of countries which face greater difficulties in having economic growth,” he said last night. Hungary, backed by Poland, threatened to veto the package if its disbursement was made dependent on meeting conditions on upholding the rule of law, which is an idea Mr Rutte supports. I don\u0027t like blame games but the Dutchman is the real responsible man for the whole mess, Hungary’s Viktor Orban told reporters on Sunday, “The Dutch prime minister, he is the fighter.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"monday morning news briefing true toll lockdown","story":"If you want to receive twice-daily briefings like this by email, sign up to the Front Page newsletter here.

But a government report shows that more than 200,000 people could die from the impact of the lockdown and protecting the NHS. As national restrictions were imposed, the collateral damage from delays to healthcare and the effects of a recession were forecast by a range of experts. They estimated that in a reasonable worst-case scenario, around 50,000 people would die from coronavirus in the first six months, with mitigation measures in place. But they calculated up to 25,000 could die from delays to treatment in the same period and a further 185,000 in the medium to long term.

Two days later, the PM said I must wear one if I want to go into a shop. Now I’m in a pickle. I hate masks but I also hate online shopping, so if I want to support my local shops I’ll have to cover my face.The moral lesson is: don’t say you won’t do something if you’ll almost certainly chicken out and end up doing it. Cue photos of Tim Stanley in a Co-op in a balaclava. I shall, of course, deny that it’s me.I call 2020 the Year of Thinking Dangerously, when a joke, a slip or an unorthodox opinion can land you in trouble, even if your actual behaviour is entirely conventional. Some readers of last week’s column complained that my message was mixed: I acknowledged the rationale for masks and said I’d always defer to the law, so my real crime was daring to say that I don’t like them and that the state shouldn’t be quick to impose them, let alone a Tory government that claims to love freedom.While I’ve recognised the need throughout the pandemic to pull together and think of others, what I’ve fought for throughout is the liberty to ask questions and the right to dissent. What we’ve got instead is an atmosphere in which we are told that merely obeying the rules isn’t enough: you must believe them in your heart, spy on your neighbours, clap for the NHS and be a one-man propaganda team for whatever science we happen to be following this week. When Facebook launched a campaign against “harmful misinformation” about the virus, on the assumption we were too thick to sort fact from fiction, a friend sighed: “Oh great. So not only must we stop going out but we’ve got to suspend critical thinking, too.”All this is completely unnecessary. Polls show overwhelming support for masks and making them compulsory people put themselves into lockdown before the state told them to. The campaign against free thought - policed voluntarily by your friends and family - is wildly popular and, I suspect, a subconscious reaction to Trump, Brexit, riots, climate change, refugees and the whiff of anarchy that has been in the air for half a decade.The lockdown is an exercise in taking back control. It has been from the very start a reassertion of deference to experts and doing as you’re told. Compliance has been near-universal. Even the so-called “mask sceptics” - a phrase chosen to make those of us unsure about covering our faces sound far-Right and mad - will now dutifully slip them on and, as the Japanese have been doing since the epidemics of the early 20th century, will still be wearing them for years to come, because it’s astonishing how long “temporary measures” can last.As for me, I am not a lunatic or particularly selfish I know this is for my benefit and, more important, that of the vulnerable. Nor do I see a grand conspiracy afoot. On the contrary, in all the clapping, queueing, fear and loathing, I see a return to a very old normal - the dictatorship of consensus.The United States lost two civil rights heroes over the weekend, John Lewis and Rev CT Vivian. Both marched with Martin Luther King Jnr, both joined the Freedom Riders movement, which, in the early Sixties, defied segregation by riding in mixed racial groups on public buses throughout the south. Freedom riders were beaten and arrested.It’s striking how respect for the Civil Rights Movement has become universal, an article of faith on Left and Right, considering that it was so controversial in its day. Many Americans at the time disagreed with its aims or its strategy, no doubt due to racism: “go slower” was the refrain.A Gallup poll in 1961 found that 61 per cent of Americans thought the Riders were wrong 57 per cent thought their tactics would “hurt” their cause. Even King’s popularity yo-yoed by 1966, two years before his murder, two-thirds disapproved of him, probably because he spoke out against the Vietnam War (the reputation of which has also dramatically changed). Today, King’s birthday is a federal holiday. His radical views on poverty have been forgotten conservatives have reimagined him as a spokesman for a colourblind American dream that poses no threat to their wealth and power.The past is our moral theatre in which we always cast ourselves in the best roles: we would’ve been with the good guys from the start. The reality is that most people weren’t, so logic dictates that most of us wouldn’t have been either - and the consensus of “now”, which seems so self-evident, might in time be exposed as wrong and our support for it cowardly. What are the causes of today that, in 50 years, will seem “just” and inevitable? Will trans-rights be celebrated or regarded as a craze with terrible consequences? Will there be a statue of Nigel Farage in Parliament Square, or Anna Soubry? We cannot tell, so we follow our own moral compass - although it’s more likely that we’ll be on the “right side” if we at least take part posterity gives no medals to those who kept their head down. As Lewis said, we’ve got to make “good trouble”.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"tearful kanye west launches presidential campaign rambling rally","story":"In his first rally for his last-minute presidential campaign, rapper Kanye West ranted against abortion and pornography, argued policy with attendees and at one point broke down in tears.West, 43, a former supporter of President Donald Trump who has left voters befuddled over whether his campaign is genuine or a publicity stunt to help sell albums or merchandise, delivered rambling remarks during the event at a Charleston, South Carolina, wedding venue and convention center.In remarks that lasted just over an hour, he denounced abortion, swore, called on random members to speak, appeared to be putting forward policy proposals on the fly, and made comments that left even those in attendance muttering in disbelief.Harriet Tubman never actually freed the slaves. She just had the slaves work for other white people, he said at one point when discussing economic inequality.The event, which was livestreamed on YouTube and carried on local television stations, did little to clarify whether West is genuinely attempting to win the presidency. The campaign he launched with a July 4 tweet has already missed several deadlines to appear on key state ballots.At times, he even seemed to suggest he was more interested in disseminating a message than winning the presidency.Freedom does not come from an election. The freedom comes from you not loading up the pornography. The freedom comes from you not taking the Percoset, he said at one point.West appeared on stage with 2020 shaved into the back of his head and wearing what appeared to be a military-style vest. He argued that abortion should be legal but heavily discouraged, suggesting he would promote a policy as president that anyone who gives birth to a child be given $1 million (£796,175) or something in that family.West referred to the Bible and Christian teachings multiple times, and broke down in tears at one point while describing how he was nearly aborted by his parents.The only thing that can free us is by obeying the rules that were given to us for a promised land, he said. Abortion should be legal because guess what? The law is not by God anyway, so what is legality?The event carried few similarities with typical polished candidate events. The venue appeared to lack audience microphones, so West repeatedly told the crowd to be silent so audience members he called on could be heard.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/06/04/12/coronavirus-deaths-uk.jpg","title":"coronavirus scotland england cases charts latest lockdown strategy","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Figures suggest Holyrood’s ‘elimination’ strategy has been far more effective than ‘drift’ approach south of the borderThe Independent employs reporters around the world to bring you truly independent journalism.

It currently stands at around 5.5-times greater.The disparity between England and Scotland\u0027s infection rates was highlighted in a recent report by the Independent Sage group, which attributed it to the differing containment strategies of each nation.In Scotland we\u0027ve seen such a clear strategy, clearly articulated, elimination is the aim and all objectives are geared towards driving things as low as possible, Professor Stephen Reicher told a briefing last week.In England, the UK government hasn\u0027t been clear about the strategy, we don\u0027t see any particular strategy, some people talk about herd immunity by default, but nothing has been articulated at all.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Take a walk at Virginia WaterSharing the full story, not just the headlinesThis spectacular destination is only part of a vast, aristocratic pleasure ground of woodlands, parks and meadows that would take weeks to fully explore on foot.The 4.5-mile circuit of the lake takes you past an eclectic mix of attractions, including an ornamental cascade waterfall, Roman ruins brought from Libya and an authentic 100ft-high totem pole gifted by British Columbia.With so much space, there is plenty of room for a secluded picnic too.See windsorgreatpark for more information.2. Cycle the New ForestWhether you discovered a love of cycling thanks to the lockdown or have been a convert for many years, the traffic-free and waymarked trails of the New Forest make it an enticing spot for all levels of rider.If you want to leave your wheels at home, there are plenty of local bike-hire options, which can also provide advice on the best routes for your party – from easy family jaunts to long-distance challenges.See thenewforest for information on cycling routes.3. Hike through the Chilterns Stay safe and have fun with this important travel guidance:Only travel in a car with members of your household andor support bubbleAlways wear a face covering or mask on public transportWash your hands before putting on your face covering and after you’ve taken it offWash your face covering dailyWhere possible, leave the car behind and reach your destination by walking or cyclingChef Tom Kerridge on reopening his Michelin-starred pub safelyAn area of outstanding natural beauty with rolling hills (such as Coombe Hill, above, the highest vantage point in the area), the sparkling chalk streams and ancient woodlands right on London’s doorstep sounds too good to be true, but the Chilterns offer precisely that.With over 300 square miles of scenery and attractions to absorb the crowds, a quiet route is also a walker\u0027s goal. The Chilterns Conservation Board and Chiltern Society have developed a series of 23 walks across the Chilterns which are social-distance-friendly, taking in hill climbs and gentle ambles.Visit chilternsaonb.org for more details about their social-distance-friendly walks.4. Kitesurf at Camber SandsCamber Sands has over two miles of beach to absorb the post-lockdown crowds. The eastern end, marked with black and white flags, is reserved for activities such as kitesurfing, and there is plenty of space for novices to learn how to handle a power kite on land or water.An introduction from The Kitesurf Centre covers the fundamentals and can be booked as one-to-one coaching, as a single group from the same household, or in groups of up to three people from separate households.The nearest train station is in Rye, four miles away. A six-hour introduction to kitesurfing course starts at £99, minimum age 12. See thekitesurfcentre for details.With the pools closed and the seaside crowded, many swimmers are looking elsewhere to take a dip. Far from the chlorinated confines of the local swimming bath, a fresh water reservoir, lake or river can be an exhilarating alternative, but there are many safety issues to consider before getting wet in the wild, so make sure you read up on the hazards first.​See outdoorswimmingsociety for advice and a directory of open-water swimming lakes to explore.6. Learn to jet skiThe beaches could be busy, but you can leave the crowds in your wake after completing a Royal Yachting Association (RYA) personal watercraft course that, in just one day, provides you with all you need to safely helm a jet ski inland or on the coast.There are plenty of places in the UK that can teach you – such as Jetski Safaris in Poole – and no experience is necessary.Visit jetskiandpowerboattraining for more information. Single-person RYA proficiency course for jet skis from £180.7. Ride on an Olympic bike trackThe Hadleigh mountain bike track hosted the London 2012 Olympics and has evolved since then into one of the premier cross-country destinations in the UK.Hadleigh Country Park also provides one of the largest green spaces in Essex, with plenty of opportunities to explore the coast from Southend-on-Sea to Benfleet. The nearby castle ruins offer panoramic views of the River Thames and Kent on the opposite shore.Leigh-on-Sea or Benfleet stations are the closest to the country park. It’s a 10 to 20-minute ride from there to the track. See explore-essex for details.Meet the kayaking instructor...Having been cooped up during lockdown, it’s safe to say that large numbers are wanting to experience the great outdoors like never before now businesses are reopening.“We\u0027ve been ridiculously busy,” says Adrian Fall, below, owner of Brighton-based The Kayak Coach. “People have been so excited about being on the water.”Fall\u0027s passion is teaching people how to kayak, canoe and paddleboard – then leading them on trips up Sussex\u0027s beautiful estuaries and rivers.He set up The Kayak Coach almost 12 years ago and has just taken on two extra staff to add to the three he already employs teaching and guiding on the water: “I love being outside and now\u0027s the time to meet people again and introduce them to the sport I love,” he says.Reopening the business required important changes, as per Government guidelines. Group sizes have been reduced from eight to five to comply with social distancing – “It\u0027s actually a nicer experience for everybody,” Fall adds – and all equipment (boat, buoyancy aid, helmet) is cleaned and sterilised after each use.A one-way system has also been added to its training centre at Ashurst. “We\u0027ve made changes to what we do. But we\u0027re almost back to normal in terms of what we can offer,” Fall explains. Additionally, barrels of water are provided for sailors to wash their hands before and after each session. Fall admits that the past three months of enforced closure have been tough for the business and lovers of the outdoor life, but that people are “having to look locally because they\u0027re not going to France or America”. He adds: “They didn\u0027t know we were here, but they\u0027re excited about accessing the river on our doorstep.”See thekayakcoach for more detailsTo help plan your trip visit Know Before You Go Please keep in mind that England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland currently have different guidelines, advice and timelines for reopening tourism. So do please make sure you check the respective official sources for information before you travel.Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

All money raised from the auction will go to The Independent’s appeal partner, The Felix Project, London’s largest food surplus distribution charity. Our campaign has so far raised £7.5m towards our £10m goal which includes a pledge to open London’s largest community kitchen to tackle food poverty.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHighlights from the Sotheby’s Help the Hungry auction include a drawing from Tracey Emin, a series of three etchings by Anish Kapoor, Mark Wallinger’s “Ghost”, and Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s “We Have Only Got Each Other” placard.British-Nigerian artist Yinka Shonibare also joins the catalogue with his “Unstructured Icons - Aristocrat I” alongside a pair of polished steel reliefs by Michael Craig-Martin and a floral plate by Chinese artist Ai Weiwei.   How to support our campaignSotheby’s senior director Oliver Barker said: “We are grateful to the artists who have generously contributed their works and we’re looking forward to channelling part of the excitement of our major sales in London this month into a cause which will provide food and comfort to the capital’s most vulnerable.”  Evgeny Lebedev, proprietor of The Independent, said: “We are delighted to be raising money with Sotheby’s and some of the world’s leading contemporary artists to help build London’s biggest community kitchen that will continue to feed those in need for years to come.”The Felix Project distributes nutritious food that would otherwise go to waste to 350 frontline charities, schools and holiday programmes in London.Founder Justin Byam Shaw said: “Although our food is surplus and donated to us and we have over 1,500 volunteers, our costs are still spiralling. “The coming unemployment crisis means we are in this for the long term. This new community kitchen will provide a high-quality meal for homeless Londoners, cooked by great chefs using surplus food.” Turner Prize-winning artist Mark Wallinger said: “I am delighted to contribute to help raise funds for The Felix Project, a fantastic charity that does such vital work in providing food for vulnerable people throughout London, work that is ever more necessary in our current crisis.”Sotheby’s Help The Hungry Auction will go live on 20 July and will run until 30 July.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Leicester may have been the first, but it was never going to be the last. After a recent spike in Covid-19 infections, Blackburn with Darwen has become the second local authority to have taken preventative action and tighten certain restrictions as the country continues to grapple with the coronavirus pandemic. The Lancashire council has not gone as far as its East Midlands counterpart in imposing a lockdown – residents have instead been told to limit the number of people they accept into their homes, and to wear face coverings in all enclosed public spaces – but the leaders and people of this northwestern region know what is waiting around the corner.“We do not want to end up like Leicester,” councillor Paul Marrow tells The Independent. “It’s all about being proactive, which is the approach we’ve taken.” Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFor now, the resurgence of the virus in these parts appears small by comparison. Whereas Leicester recorded roughly 155 cases per 100,000 people prior to its lockdown, Blackburn with Darwen has, to date, reported a peak rate of 47 infections per 100,000. But all fires start from a single spark – and authorities here are doing what they can to put out the growing flames.Focus has turned to the danger of household transmission across Blackburn and its neighbouring towns. Unlike in Leicester – where officials have struggled to pinpoint the source of the city’s outbreak – local health authorities for Blackburn with Darwen have managed to develop a clear picture of the way in which the disease has spread within the region.“It seems to be household clusters where a person who has been infected may not know it, they may be asymptotic they return home and then pass it on to four or five family members,” Denise Park, chief executive of the local council, said.“We do have a higher than average number of large households – five or more people – so we’ve been looking at that. The most recent data testing shows that the majority of cases are from our south Asian heritage communities.”What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safelyAround a third of Blackburn with Darwen’s 148,000 population are from ethnic backgrounds, with a large Pakistani and Indian heritage population, and according to Professor Dominic Harrison, the council’s director of public health, 97 of the 114 cases recorded across the past two weeks derive from these minority groups. To help protect these communities, and prevent the situation from escalating across the region, authorities have tailored their measures accordingly, telling people they can now only accept two visitors into their homes beyond their immediate families.“With it being household transmission, we didn’t think a Leicester-styled lockdown was the right answer,” explains Ms Park. “It’s about being targeted with the action we take.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe response of Prof Harrison and his team has so far been met with positivity and optimism, on account of its specified and proactive nature. “Dominic Harrison has been absolutely on the ball with Covid-19 and he’s doing his job very well, keeping a good eye on the local community,” Gabriel Scally, a member of the Independent Sage board and professor of public health at the University of Bristol, said.“I think the council is handling it extremely well. This is the sort of approach that will work well nationally, because it’s generated by the local community, their representatives and the director of public health – trusted figures that the people can be sure they’re acting in the interest of the towns and the population.”It’s rare praise in these troubling and ided times, when the overwhelming narrative of the Covid-19 pandemic has been one of chaos and confusion. And there’s certainly hope to believe that the strategy adopted by Blackburn with Darwen proves effective.Leaning on the side of caution, authorities have announced that the current measures – which also recommend against hugs and handshakes – will be in place for four weeks before the council considers easing them. In the meantime the region’s caseload is expected to rise due to increased testing, says Ms Park, but after that it’s hoped the numbers will drop again.The story of Leicester’s lockdown – and the lessons to be learntAnd thankfully, access to data has not proved an issue, as was the case with Leicester. Ms Park said that the information provided by the local government to Prof Harrison has contained details on ethnicity, postcodes and ages, ensuring authorities have the means to develop a more comprehensive understanding of what’s going on in and around Blackburn.Additional testing units have been deployed in the local community, allowing more people who are carrying the disease but not displaying symptoms to get easily tested. “Let’s not wait till people have got symptoms,” says Ms Park. “Let’s do asymptomatic testing, do some case finding and then say to people they need to isolate.”Equally, the council has said that footways in the centre of Blackburn will be widened, to further promote social distancing, while some parking bays will be removed to help separate people queueing for takeaways and pubs. Council workers have meanwhile been visiting local religious and community centres to spread the message, and providing advice to smaller shops as to how they can protect their customers.Still, for all the encouraging work of the council, and the sense of “stoicism” that it has drawn from the local population, as Mr Marrow put its, the situation in Blackburn and Darwen has not passed by without the dangerous, racist rhetoric which marked many conversations concerning Leicester and its outbreak.“The danger is people see the data and say it’s one section of society to blame, and that is absolutely not what we’re saying,” councillor Saima Afzal said. “There are are a cocktail of factors at play here.“We are aware there are problems in the south Asian wards but I want to make it clear that they are not less or more likely to follow the rules. That’s not what my experience shows. From what I’ve seen and images I’ve been sent, there are groups gathering from a whole range of backgrounds.” She warned against analysing the statistics inaccurately as “they can be twisted any way you want to portray them”.Against this backdrop of tension, Blackburn with Darwen holds its breath as it takes another step into the unknown. Lessons have clearly been learnt from the Leicester episode, with the Lancashire council well poised to fight the virus, but there’s still a long way to go for the region.Blackburn with Darwen\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.For a town already caught in a slow and painful state of decline, the coronavirus pandemic has brought Blackburn to its knees. Decades of de-industrialisation and growing economic deprivation have left the area struggling to find its purpose – while larger, more prosperous neighbours have reinvented themselves – but the economic damage wrought by Covid-19 could prove to be the final straw.“We’ve been here for 32 long years,” said Maria Elder, the owner of Sudell Sandwiches, a small cafe in the town centre. “Lots of loyal customers over the years. We’d serve students from the college too. We even had a contract with the police to feed the officers when the football was on. That’s all gone, for now at least. We’re barely coping.”The worry for Ms Elder and other independent businesses is what a second lockdown would mean for the town. After a recent surge in cases, Blackburn finds itself walking a dangerous line. The region’s seven-day rate currently stands at 47 infections per 100,000 people and is expected to rise in the coming days.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAuthorities have already tightened restrictions this week, urging residents to limit the number of visitors to their homes and to wear face coverings in enclosed public settings, but the plunge back into full lockdown would likely drive many companies to the point of no return.“I think it’d shut us down,” said Ms Elder. “People are extremely scared and worried, because there’s a lot of places that only opened on Monday – beauticians, hairdressers. And it’s still very quiet.What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safely“We’ve been here a long time, we’re an established business, but it has seriously impacted us, it really has. I’ve had to lay off one girl as a result.”Asad Jalil, who has run a dry cleaning shop in the town centre since 1989, said a second lockdown would push his business “over the edge”.“If there’s another lockdown for two or three weeks, it’s going to make it worse. People are already scared. There’s not enough money for going out, buying new stuff, people are making do with what they’ve got. “I can’t see my business returning. I doubt I’ll be here next year. Many of my usual customers are at home, working in their pyjamas. They don’t need to go into the office anymore. They don’t need to get their suits cleaned. I only came back yesterday but I don’t think it’s going to pick up again.” No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailSome businesses never made it to the end of lockdown, laid low by the sudden arrest in economic activity across the country. Although trade has been good for Anna Green and Emily Yates since they reopened their salon earlier this month, they are one of the few to have come through this period of turbulence.“In this building alone, there’s one room empty next door and upstairs there’s six empty,” Ms Green said. “They’ve had to fold. It’s not the most affluent of areas. A lot of people have packed up and gone.”The pandemic has only added to Blackburn’s problems. The local council has seen its spending power decline by nearly one-third since 2010, losing out on tens of millions of pounds, while the region has one of the lowest life-expectancy rates in the country.Some buildings in the town centre have stood empty for 10 years or more. Unwilling to take a risk on Blackburn and its struggling economy, business has been turning elsewhere in the northwest.“Blackburn was a booming town,” said Mr Jalil, the dry cleaner owner. “People used to flock here from all around, but now they don’t even bother. They either go into Bolton or Preston. There’s no footfall in Blackburn anymore.”Deprivation is also a serious and growing issue. Last year, the charity End Child Poverty revealed that half of all children in Blackburn lived in poverty, with this rate up to two-thirds in the ward of Bastwell.Nonetheless, stoicism runs deep in these parts. Residents are aware that everyone has a role to play in getting through the pandemic.Blackburn holds its breath after recent spike in Covid-19 cases“Everyone is putting on face masks, all our customers are taking it on board,” said Marcus Gannon, director of Hobkirk Sewing Machines, which can trace its history in the town back to 1903. “No one has got anything against it. They all appreciate it. And in a way, it gives customers who want to come in here the confidence to do so. People are just getting on with it.”Ms Elder, the cafe owner, echoed these sentiments, saying that “the majority of people are now wearing masks” and abiding by the rules – at least in public. “Everyone is taking it seriously,” she said. “I think the new restrictions are a good thing but we’ll have to see how it goes.”The council has also been working hard with small businesses to ensure they can operate under the current system. “I know some of our officers have been out and helped put the new guidance in place,” said Saima Afzal, a councillor. “Everyone has been really proactive. I think we’ve got a really resilient community in Blackburn so they are carrying on.”“My company has been here for 100 odd years,” said Mr Gannon. “I want it to be here another 100 years. We can’t give in.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Couples fared little better, with 18 per cent reporting their relationship with their partner had suffered since March.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesRelations between co-workers deteriorated the most as many UK workplaces adjusted to remote working and video conference calls. One-quarter of people surveyed for the non-peer reviewed observational study said they were getting on worse with colleagues since the start of lockdown.“Our study shows that lockdown measures are having a significant toll on people’s relationships, both with people locked down together and those who have been unable to see each other over the lockdown period, said Dr Daisy Fancourt, a professor of psychobiology and epidemiology at UCL.What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safelyShe added: “This is especially true of people with diagnosed mental health issues and younger adults, as well as those with lower household incomes, key workers, those living along and those living with children, all of whom may be facing greater financial or mental pressures which have been exacerbated during the lockdown period.”Worsening relationships were most common among younger adults. Of the 12 per cent of people who reported the breakdown of a relationship, most were aged under 30 and the fewest were over 60.However, researchers found relationships between neighbours had improved since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, particularly among people aged between 30 and 59.  Cheryl Lloyd, head of education at the Nuffield Foundation, which is funding the ongoing study, said the finding “suggests a resurgence in community spirit” during the pandemic.But she added it was “cause for concern that the survey also show that people who are more vulnerable - those on lower household incomes and those with diagnosed mental health issues - are more likely to report worsening friendships and relationships during lockdown”.Launched the week before the UK entered lockdown on 23 March, the UCL study is the largest into the UK public’s attitudes, health and wellbeing during the coronavirus pandemic.Researchers found complete compliance with lockdown measures continued to fall over the past fortnight, particularly among young adults. But 90 per cent of all adults and 80 per cent of under-30s said they were still complying with most rules.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Several areas in England are experiencing a surge in new coronavirus cases, with places in the North West appearing most at risk to a second wave of infections similar to the one seen in Leicester.The latest figures from Public Health England reveal Bradford and neighbouring Kirklees in West Yorkshire have seen high numbers of daily confirmed cases in recent days.Higher infection rates in Leicester prompted the government to introduce a local lockdown just weeks after nationwide containment measures first began to ease.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFollowing Leicester’s lockdown last week, epidemiologist Professor Neil Ferguson warned that more localised lockdowns in the UK are “inevitable”.The former government adviser said that an estimated 8 per cent of the UK population has so far been infected, and that the pandemic is still in its “early stages”.Leicester remains the worst affected area in England in terms of cumulative case rate, with more than 1,000 people per 100,000 residents having been infected by Covid-19.Other areas to have experienced similarly high case rates include Ashford in Kent and Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria, however both places have seen new cases fall substantially since May.The rate of new coronavirus infections in Ashford began to flatten off in early June, according to data collected by PHE. By contrast, daily cases in Leicester appeared to accelerate at around the same time.A similar surge occurred in Kirklees, despite the curve initially appearing to flatten one month ago. The number of new daily cases consistently fell below 20 in the first week of June, before spiking to more than 40 on 11 June.In Bradford, the number of new cases fell significantly in late May, before rising again throughout June. Unlike Kirklees, however, the rate of new infections appears to be once again slowing.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.A teenager has donated more than 3,000 face coverings to The Independent’s Help The Hungry campaign to protect volunteers delivering food to the most vulnerable people.Business student James Eid, 19, has given thousands of protective coverings to our appeal partner The Felix Project, which is delivering up to 30 tonnes of food every day to those hit hardest by the pandemic.Mr Eid, who lives in Radlett, was inspired to make face coverings because his grandmother, Anna Ross, 68, has Behcet’s disease.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe condition, which causes blood vessel inflammation and has various side effects, also lowers the immune system meaning she is more vulnerable to Covid-19.Mr Eid struggled to obtain low-cost face coverings to protect his grandmother and so, spotting a gap in the market, decided to import specialist production machines and make them himself.How to support our campaignFamilies face ‘summer of hardship’, food charities warnWhat it’s like to volunteer on the frontline during a pandemicUsing money donated by his father, who is joint CEO of food company Signature Flatbreads, the Lancaster University student imported a production line of four machines, naming his new company Signature Masks.The entrepreneur has since opened a factory in Dunstable, Bedfordshire, with production beginning in earnest at the end of the month. To start with, he will make 36,000 face coverings a week, but the size and scope of the factory means he will be able to scale up production and make up to 500 million coverings annually.The coverings are disposable and made up of three-ply non-woven plastic material – meaning they are water resistant and can be worn for up to 24 hours. He will sell the coverings from his website – they will cost £3.79 for 10, or £2.99 if consumers subscribe for weekly deliveries.On donating thousands to The Felix Project, the teenager said: “I want to support those who are helping others in this crisis.” Mark Curtin, of The Felix Project, said: “These Signature Masks will help protect volunteers and staff in our food redistribution warehouses.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Our Help The Hungry appeal today passed the £7m mark, enabling our appeal partner, The Felix Project, to deliver the equivalent of 4.3 million meals to hungry schoolchildren and vulnerable Londoners in the 12 weeks since lockdown began.The milestone was reached thanks to more significant corporate donations, including an additional £100,000 from online grocer Ocado, taking its total donation to £390,000, and a further £90,000 from banking group Citi boosting their aggregate give to £250,000.It comes as the charity Feeding Britain warns that 3 million children face the prospect of hunger during the upcoming school holidays. Of these, it cautions, only 1 million are eligible for the government’s free school meal summer holiday voucher of £15 a week, with the remaining 2 million living with parents who narrowly do not qualify but cannot always afford food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHelen Barnard, of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, confirmed that the summer voucher scheme – agreed by the prime minister after being forced into a U-turn by footballer Marcus Rashford – only covers a minority of children in poverty. She said: “Soaring numbers of families are being pulled under and having to rely on food banks to get through the current crisis, even with the voucher scheme in place.”The harsh reality is that an astounding 66 per cent of food-insecure families – amounting to almost 200,000 children in London – cannot access government help and are forced to rely on food parcels from charities such as The Felix Project.Food and 10,000 face coverings donated to charities and vulnerableWhich star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day At the start of lockdown, The Felix Project faced an existential crisis with a total collapse of its fundraising.

Our pledge is given added urgency by the release of worrying economic data, including that the number of people out of work and claiming benefits jumped 23 per cent to 2.8 million last month.”Jo West, of Ocado Retail, said most of its donation had been raised from Ocado and their customers via their “you give, we give” scheme. She added: “We’re extremely grateful to our customers for their generosity which enables groups like The Felix Project to bring food to people in desperate need.” James Murray, chair of the Bridgepoint Charitable Trust, which donated £50,000, said: “We are delighted to contribute to the work of The Felix Project in feeding vulnerable communities.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

As well as two Michelin-starred pubs – The Hand \u0026amp Flowers and The Coach – he also opened a traditional butcher and founded Pub in the Park, the biggest food and music festival tour in the UK.During lockdown, staff from Kerridge’s businesses were volunteering to help a new charity called Meals from Marlow which delivers free food to NHS staff, key workers and people in need. This started small in early April and with support from over 1,000 donors, it recently ended up serving its 75,000th meal.From 4 July, both The Hand \u0026amp Flowers and The Coach have reopened fully in Marlow to welcome back hungry diners.7 great summer days out for the familyThe team have prepared a comprehensive Covid-19 policy document with a number of measures to protect the health and safety of guests and staff. Measures include daily staff temperature checks, hands-free antibacterial gel dispensers, one-way systems, private sole-use of bathrooms, cleaning touchpoints and toilets every 20 minutes, and even sanitising deliveries.Kerridge is also working with a company that provides protection against a wide range of pathogens, including Covid-19, using a sanitising treatment applied through fogging machines to provide an even coat on all surfaces, followed by manual application to hot spots, such as door handles.Form a bubble with a one-adult householdVisit your local salon, restaurant or bar, following UK Government guidelinesMeet in private gardens with up to six peopleTravel on public transport without a face covering or maskShare a car with people outside of your householdFor more information, visit gov.ukcoronavirus“Welcoming, safeguarding and taking care of others is at the very heart of what we do, says Kerridge. The last few months have been such a challenging time and we have been eagerly waiting to establish a little normality back into everyone’s lives, and get back to what we do best – providing great hospitality and food.”Kerridge\u0027s pubs have also been altered to make sure that spacing is as per UK Government guidelines. Partitions have been placed to ensure people have privacy and are able to enjoy their experience in the same way as before.Following the success of Meals from Marlow, it has now become a permanent charity and is set to provide 30,000+ meals a year to local people. “I know the people of Marlow are a very generous group but I’m astonished by the speed and the level of kindness, says Kerridge. Thank you, Marlow, I’m proud of you.”Colin Steele and Jade Windsor, pub landlords of the Falcon InnColin Steele and Jade Windsor, pictured below, took over the Falcon Inn five months before lockdown, restoring the pub as a community hub at the heart of the village of Fawley, Hampshire. After coronavirus threw a ner in the works, they were eager to reopen last weekend. “We have social distancing, hand sanitisers and a booking system, so our locals get a guaranteed spot,” says Windsor.The couple made the most of the lockdown by revamping the pub, painting the interiors and outside fencing, and putting up a pergola in the garden for some weather protection. “Because of lockdown we had the time to give the garden the love and attention it really needed,” says Steele. “Painting the fence outside has meant that we\u0027ve been able to interact with the village as they walk past. We\u0027ve been trying to bring that community spirit back.” To keep business going, they opened their car park for plant sales and teamed up with local company HMS Spirits to serve takeaway cocktails on Friday nights, which they will continue on weekends throughout the summer. “It kept us doing what we love, says Windsor, and keeping in contact with our customers.” They also recruited a chef with the goal of making back some of the lost income from closure and the now-reduced capacity that allows for distancing. Where they once accommodated 150 inside, now they can host 40. The team have ramped up hygiene measures: doors are wiped every half hour screens at the bar and face shields protect staff. Additional outdoor seating means that everyone is seated, and a new app will enable customers to order food from their tables. “We\u0027re a family-run business and everyone just wants us to succeed,” says Steele.Windsor adds: “I\u0027m sure we will come across a few issues, it’s something that no one\u0027s ever had to deal with before. I want my pub back the way it was more than anyone, but we\u0027ve all got to deal with it together.”Sarah Bentley, owner of The Cutting Room unisex salon As a small village salon that’s been open for 16 years, it’s little wonder that The Cutting Room’s loyal clientele had been keenly anticipating its reopening after temporarily closing back in March.A tight-knit team with great customer relationships, Bentley and her employees were excited to get back to a sense of normality. After a meeting last week, they felt reassured about the safety precautions put in place for their return. “It was a bit of relief coming back from staff training and just seeing everybody’s face light up and looking forward to being back,” she says. “We’ve had Zoom meetings discussing all the guidelines.”The salon may have been closed, but plenty was going on in the background to ensure that the premises and the team were as prepared as possible for a safe reopening.For example, they worked hard to keep customers informed about changes to their haircutting experience: as well as the salon now being appointment-only, clients have been informed that they are not able to enter the premises before their appointment, as well being asked to wear a face covering.“Because we are such a small salon, we have screens up between all our sections,” Bentley explains, adding that their booking and payment system has been made completely contactless.Though refreshments or magazines can no longer be provided, The Cutting Room has set up its outdoor space for clients to sit in a socially-distanced manner.The Cutting Room\u0027s kit used has also changed: “We’ve got disposable gowns, towels – everybody’s got all their completely own equipment it’s all labelled in their name – their own trollies, Bentley adds.Ultimately, safety is The Cutting Room’s number-one priority. “It’s there to keep us and the clients and my staff safe – and if I felt that they weren’t safe, I would shut the salon tomorrow,” Bentley says. “Everybody’s health comes first.Keeping you safe: a selection of guidelines for UK businesses All businesses are required to be Covid-19-secure in order to help protect their staff and customers.

But when coronavirus hit in March, Ireland’s biggest sportswear brand had to break the habit of a lifetime and sack its entire 750-strong workforce at its Strabane factory due to the lockdown.With sports events cancelled or postponed, orders from teams and retailers vanished.However, the company was thrown a surprise lifeline when, a day after announcing the layoffs, the Western Health and Social Care Trust approached O’Neills on a Friday about fulfilling a shortage of scrubs to safeguard frontline NHS workers.Factory staff spent that weekend making sample scrubs. By the Monday, O’Neills had secured an order for 10,000 sets of maroon tops and trousers for GPs at a coronavirus testing centre at Altnagelvin Area Hospital, Londonderry.As a result, the company rehired 150 workers immediately. It has since brought back more than 400 staff overall as orders from other health trusts across Northern Ireland grew, with the remaining 350 employees being furloughed.The company now produces some 10,000 sets of scrubs a week. Managing director Kieran Kennedy, a veteran of 41 years at the business, says employees have been supportive of the switch from making sporting goods.“We are a close-knit community in Strabane. Many employees know people who work in the NHS and they want to give back,” he explains. “We could either feel sorry for ourselves or be productive and take a bite at the cherry. Without the NHS orders, we would have had no sales and no cash flow. The scrubs kept the show on the road.”Kennedy says the move outside the company’s traditional business area has been relatively easy. For instance, O’Neills had stockpiled a six-month supply of yarn – the raw material for the scrubs and other clothing – from China to hedge against Brexit uncertainty. The company knits the scrubs at its Strabane factory, then dyes and coats them with anti-viral substances at its production plant in Dublin.Workers on the factory floors are social distancing, as well as wearing face masks, sanitising their hands and having their temperature checked.Kennedy is upbeat on the company’s future prospects, noting that big sporting fixtures are returning, which should boost sales and enable him to rehire more workers. But for the foreseeable future, Kennedy plans to continue producing protective gear – an unexpected new revenue stream.   The gift shop owner donating Happy Bags to localsWhen Sarah Lloyd Williams, pictured above, had to temporarily close her quirky little gift shop in Frome on 22 March, she had no idea what she was going to do with the time ahead.At first, Lloyd Williams relished the opportunity to spend every day with her dog, Chester, taking him with other dogs out for walks. However, by nature, she is a hands-on person and soon realised she needed to find something to fill her time other than dog walking and cleaning.She had found out that someone local to her had been having a hard time. “I knew this lady slightly and wondered if there was anything I could do to help, Lloyd Williams explains. I didn’t feel that I knew her enough to contact her offering assistance, so instead I decided to leave a little gift on her doorstep.” She called it a Happy Bag, containing a copy of The Happy Newspaper (a quarterly newspaper by Emily Coxhead containing nothing but good news), a chocolate bar, bath bomb and a little note.This good deed went down very well: the recipient messaged Lloyd Williams to ask if she could buy a Happy Bag for her friend. “I didn’t want any money, Lloyd Williams explains. This was something small that I could do with items that I already sell in Figgins, so I delivered a Happy Bag to her friend and it went from there.”She ended up delivering a number of bags in the local area and it led to doing a few other little things for people, such as picking up medicines, shopping and more dog walking.For Lloyd Williams, this became a lovely way to connect with people that she barely knew, or had never met before, and it made lockdown much easier to navigate: “Giving away some Happy Bags certainly made me feel much happier. It’s a tiny thing, but sometimes that’s all it takes to make someone’s day,” she says.Figgins has now reopened, with Lloyd Williams taking steps to make sure her shop is safer with a screen, hand sanitising stations, floor stickers and limiting the number of people in the shop at any one time. Lloyd Williams is also donating a Happy Bag every week to someone in the local community.At the start of lockdown, Andy Hibbert, above, transformed his car-sharing business.Launched in 2017, Car \u0026amp Away had enabled holidaymakers to rent out their cars from Gatwick and Bristol Airports while they were away, but when the coronavirus forced airports to close, business plummeted.The CEO from south west London quickly decided to use the business\u0027 existing assets to help key workers and launched a new service: Karshare.“We had this burgeoning desire for people to rent their car from home because it was sat there doing nothing,” Hibbert explains. “But then Covid came along. As a business we were stranded. We thought: this is ridiculous. We have all the systems in place to enable us to share cars. Why don\u0027t we launch the car-sharing concept where owners donate their cars to critical-care workers and people who are supporting the most vulnerable in our community?”At the peak of the pandemic, travelling by car minimised viral spread on public transport and limited key workers’ exposure, while making their journeys easier at a stressful time. Karshare encouraged members of the public in Bristol, Brighton, London, Manchester and Leeds to donate their cars for a week to NHS staff and volunteer organisations. The cars were then deep cleaned and matched to local key workers in need of transport.Insurance and road coverage were provided for free, and the owner received a full tank of petrol as a thank you.Impressively, 700 cars have since been donated – including to 31 London NHS trusts – with a total 19,000 days of use. Leasing company ALD donated 30 new cars in Bristol. “We were overwhelmed initially about the donations,” says Hibbert.One key worker who benefited was Michaela Morris, deputy chief operating officer at the NHS Nightingale Hospital London in Docklands. “She was put into a hotel and told she needs to be on call 247, so we quickly found her a car,” says Hibbert. “It’s remarkable that she has been able to continue that work because of the generosity of the public.”Karshare also helped a care worker who had only been able to reach a couple of vulnerable patients a day on his bicycle. When he was loaned a car he could reach up to 11 – and save more lives.While Karshare is now focusing efforts on making the business profitable again, it is also inviting donations to critical workers and will ask for contributions to cover the insurance. Karshare is also being extended to the wider community, allowing people to rent their cars from home.“There are financial pressures for people,” adds Hibbert, “yet they\u0027ve got an asset on their driveway that could really help.”The distillery that swapped gin for hand sanitiserIn the midst of a global pandemic, constrained by lockdown, a fledging gin brand was surrounded by alcohol with no bars open to supply. But reports of hand sanitiser shortages hit the headlines and gave the team an idea.Sean Roche launched Aintree Gin in December 2019. An organic, craft spirit, it takes its name from its home in Merseyside – a village renowned for its famous racecourse which hosts the historic Grand National.By spring, Roche and the team had introduced the gin to over 30 establishments around Liverpool. They were gearing up for the steeplechase, but lockdown put paid to their plans. “As soon as everything started to shut … all of our income went down to zero,” Roche says.Realising online sales would be key, the team started building a website – then they had a brainwave. “News reports started to regularly mention how shortages of… alcohol-based sanitiser were putting NHS and care workers at risk,” says Roche. “We knew that because we were already using pure alcohol to make our gin, we could change our production line to make sanitiser.”Their first batch was ready within weeks. Word got out and, soon after, they were inundated with requests from care homes, hospitals and more, Roche recalls.Volunteers were recruited and more than 600 litres were donated in six weeks. But as supplies ran low, and with no money coming in, the enterprise became financially unviable. “We had two choices,” says Roche. “Stop – or start selling something.”Opting for the latter, new containers were ordered and labels designed so the sanitiser could be sold online. They started offering a range of PPE products too, from face shields to masks. “This created a revenue stream that allowed us to continue,” adds Roche.A PPE pop-up and free hand sanitiser stations at an Asda store followed. “We donated more than we made in profit over the period,” Roche admits.Today, sales are going strong. As businesses look to reopen, many are turning to Aintree Gin for their sanitisation requirements – and also the brand’s primary product. They now aim to supply as many bars and restaurants as possible, and get into supermarkets as well.To read about more inspiring GREAT stories, visit greatbritaincampaigninspirationsWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Help is desperately needed to support wildlife rangers, local communities and law enforcement personnel to prevent wildlife crime. Donate to help Stop the Illegal Wildlife Trade\u0026nbspHEREThe Independent employs reporters around the world to bring you truly independent journalism. To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Boosting businesses that protect nature but also bring benefits to people and governments is the best way to prove the value of conservation in Africa, two of the continent’s leading economic thinkers have said.  The economic value of every acre of land in countries with some of the world’s fastest growing human populations needs to be proven, they say. Quick wins like logging or farming have so far won out over conserving wildlife habitats.  But nature-based businesses can compete against extractive industries if governments and people grasp their economic as well as ecological benefits, according to Fred Swaniker, a Ghanaian entrepreneur and education pioneer, and Clare Akamanzi, the head of the Rwanda Development Board. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThat will help protect wildlife species, conserve habitats that provide clean air and water, and keep human development distant from animal species that carry deadly diseases, they said.The pair took part in the second in a series of webinars hosted by The Independent as part of its Stop The Illegal Wildlife Trade campaign, in partnership with international conservation organisation Space for Giants. “Poverty in Africa is often so high we can’t do conservation for conservation’s sake,” Mr Swaniker said. “We need to show people how nature benefits them and how it’s the pathway to the prosperity that they need.” Conservationists warn of poaching pandemic due to coronavirus crisisHis African Leadership University’s campus in Kigali, Rwanda, was dedicated to mentoring a new generation of young Africans aiming to transform conservation into a growth sector. “As an economic sector this is one that has tremendous unfulfilled potential,” Mr Swaniker said. “As we look at developing Africa we can’t just copy the rest of the world, we have to look at what we as Africans have that is unique to the continent. One of the things that we have that is a true competitive advantage is nature, some of the unique bioersity in the world that can therefore really be leveraged for growth.” Rwanda has transformed itself into one of Africa’s fastest-growing and modernising economies. That growth has in huge part been driven by wildlife tourism, Ms Akamanzi said. Tourism and conservation contribute 7 per cent of Rwanda’s GDP and bring in more foreign business than any other sector, she said. Tourism investors had opened the way for other enterprises to follow. Key to that success was strong leadership, transparent laws, and making it easy to do business, Ms Akamanzi added.Stop the Illegal Wildlife Trade\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

More than 60 per cent of the world’s children are still out of school, with closures having peaked at 91 per cent in April.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesDespite these grim forecasts, the Multidimensional Poverty Index 2020‘s authors write that “the firm hope is that this will not happen”, and that instead “progress is possible”.Professor Sabina Alkire, co-creator of the index – which is used by countries and experts across the world as a measure to gauge and help reduce poverty levels – told The Independent in May that she believed the pandemic could bring about a “historic reduction” in global poverty, if authorities are “strategically pro-poor” with emergency funding and recovery measures.What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safelyProf Alkire, director of the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative, pointed to economist Amartya Sen’s observations that life expectancy in the UK rose far more quickly during the Second World War than in the previous decade – which he attributed largely to emergency food-rationing systems.Published this week, the 2020 index also shows that of the 75 countries studied, Sierra Leone saw the fastest reduction in multidimensional poverty, at a time when the country was grappling with the Ebola crisis.In the four years from 2013, multidimensional poverty – a measure of whether people experience multiple deprivations in health, education and standards of living – fell sharply from 74 per cent to 58 per cent, with the provision of electricity and clean cooking fuel bringing about the largest changes.“As terrible as the tragedy was, it did not create a widespread slide into poverty,” the report states. “Public health emergencies require fast responses, and human error as well as tragedy seem inevitable.“Despite this, Sierra Leone shows that it is possible to reduce the interlinked deprivations of multidimensional poverty during an epidemic.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe report, which looks back on the progress made in the decade since the index was created, also found that 65 of the 75 countries studied has “significantly” reduced levels of multidimensional poverty.In India, which saw the largest reduction, some 273 million people moved out of multidimensional poverty during the past decade, according to the report.Some 70 million people in China left multidimensional poverty between 2010 and 2014. In Bangladesh, numbers declined by 19 million between 2014 and 2019.Before the pandemic, 47 countries were on track to halve poverty between 2015 and 2030, if observed trends continued. But 18 countries, including some of the poorest, were off track.Of the 1.3 billion people living in multidimensional poverty, more than 80 per cent are deprived in at least five of the ten indicators used, the report states.Keir Starmer accuses Boris Johnson of giving \u0027dodgy answers\u0027 on child poverty claimHalf of the world’s multidimensionally poor – around 644 million – have not yet turned 18 years old.At least 40 per cent live in south Asia, and an even greater proportion live in sub-Saharan Africa. However, in addition to Sierra Leone, six other sub-Saharan African countries are counted among the top 10 fastest-improving countries, alongside Côte D’Ivoire, Guinea, Liberia, Mauritania, Rwanda, Sao Tome and Principe.Some 107 million suffering multiple vulnerabilities are over the age of 60, which researchers flagged as “a particularly importantly figure during the Covid-19 pandemic”.“Covid-19 is the latest crisis to hit the globe, and climate change all but guarantees more will follow soon. Each will affect the poor in multiple ways,” Pedro Conceicao, director of the UNDP’s Human Development Report Office, said in a statement. “More than ever, we need to work on tackling poverty – and vulnerability to poverty – in all its forms.” Prof Alkire said: “The MPI – with its information on both the level and composition of poverty – provides the data needed to pinpoint where and how poverty manifests itself. Otherwise policymakers are flying blind, unable to know how – or where – to target resources and interventions.”She added: “Covid-19 is having a profound impact on the development landscape. But this data – from before the pandemic – is a message of hope.“Past success stories on how to tackle the many ways people experience poverty in their daily lives, can show how to build back better and improve the lives of millions.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

China and the United States each plan to send another this year.The Emirates Mars Mission has cost $200m (£155.8m), according to minister for advanced sciences Sarah Amiri. It aims to provide a complete picture of the Martian atmosphere for the first time, studying daily and seasonal changes.The UAE first announced plans for the mission in 2014 and launched a National Space Programme in 2017 to develop local expertise. Its population of 9.4 million, most of whom are foreign workers, lacks the scientific and industrial base of the big spacefaring nations.Emirates Mars Mission postponed indefinitely due to bad weatherAfter a decade at NASA, I can tell you the ‘Mars bros’ have it wrongAstronauts should visit Venus on their way to Mars, scientists suggestNasa delays trip to Mars after rocket problemIt has an ambitious plan for a Mars settlement by 2117.

Customers will face a £ fine but cut to £they pay within a fortnight.According to the official Government guidance, the following groups are not required to wear a face-covering while using public transport or in a shop:There are also a series of factors which the Government describes as a “reasonable excuse”, which also means you don’t have to wear a mask:If you dont come under the exempt categories then travellers will be refused boardingthey are not wearing a mask, or told to get off.Mr Shapps said: I can announce that as of Monday  June, face coverings will become mandatory on public transport.The evidence suggests that wearing a face masks offers some, limited protection.You can be refused travelyou dont comply and you could be fined.It’s a condition of travel. You cannot travelyou are not wearing a face covering.On July , Matt Hancock confirmed that from July  it would be mandatory for people in England to wear face masks in shopsAnyone spotted flouting the new rules could be hit with a £ fine.Shopkeepers have been asked to implement the new rules in their storesBut ultimately, the new rules on wearing masks in shops will be enforced by the police, not shop workers.Doctors have insisted masks are crucial to slow the spread of coronavirus and make le safer for the most vulnerable.Chair of the British Medical Association’s Medical Academic Staff Committee and Exeter University lecturer Dr David Strain said: “We need masks to slow the spread and make le safer for the most vulnerable to go about essential activities.“Yesterday more than  people tested positive for the virus, which the ONS figures suggest is only about a third of the true number of new cases in the UK.“The remaining two thirds of the population with the virus are the ‘silent spreaders’, people who carry and can potentially spread the virus despite having no symptoms themselves.“The mandatory use of face coverings will reduce the risk to the population at large from these iniduals.”Those who are exempted from wearing a face mask will be asked to get a face-covering exemption card.The card is available to download for free on the TfL website.Those exempt will be required to carry the card on their person while using public transport.TfL will also recognise similar cards that may have been issued by other transport operators. The card can also be displayed on a smartphone.If you do not have a printer or a smartphone, you can contact TfL and they will print and post a card to you.

They share a year-old chihuahua called Luna, which Anne-Sophie is believed to have kept in the split.A source close to the DJ said: “Roman loved Soph and things had been going really well for them. But being in lockdown is tough for any couple and they just weren’t able to make things work, which has been upsetting and tough for them both.“His pals have encouraged him to move on and have got him on Raya, which is packed with attractive and creative women. He’s set up a profile with his best photos and has set the music on his page to the song Gold, by his dad’s band. He’s having fun with it.”Roman’s career has gone from strength to strength in the past year, having finished third in the TV jungle, landed an ITV talk show with his pop star dad and become a regular on Celebrity Gogglebox.But in December he was hoping to start a family and thought Anne-Sophie was the girl he would do it with.He said at the time: “Every time I see a child, I get broody.”Plenty more fish in the sea, Roman.DESPITE not ­seeing each other for four months, The Pussycat Dolls are now closer than ever, according to Carmit Bachar.The singer, who posed in a patterned bikini and floral blue shirt for the cover of Lapalme magazine, said of bandmates Nicole Scherzinger, Kimberly Wyatt, Ashley Roberts and Jessica Sutta that absence really has made the heart grow fonder.Carmit explained: “We’ve been going through similar things. It’s more important than ever now to show that women can support each other and hold each other up.”But there is one person for whom Gemma will always open her purse – her mum Joan.The reality star, left, said: “I like to treat her. I am massively independent and I do like to pay my own way.” Thinking out loud on her BBC Radio  podcast, Gemma mused: “Could we ever get rid of money “I don’t think we could. What would we replace it with “I quite like chocolate buttons, so I’d be happy to replace it.”Might get a bit messy in the summer, Gem.THEY say birds of a feather stick together and it seems models do too – as Cara Delevingne and Kaia Gerber look inseparable at a Black Lives Matter rally.Kaia wrapped her arms around Cara, and strolled with her, as they listened to motivational speakers at the event in Calornia, which was attended by thousands.Despite the nine-year age gap, the pair palled up after meeting on the fashion circuit. Cara, who spent lockdown in the US, joined American Kaia, her model mum Cindy Crawford and dad Randy Gerber in a social bubble when restrictions relaxed last month.This included joining the family for dinner at swanky Malibu restaurant Nobu in June, with Cara having split from her long-term girlfriend, Pretty Little Liars actress Ashley Benson, the previous month.With Kaia quickly becoming the model of the moment, I couldn’t think of a better pal than Cara – named the UK’s highest-earning catwalk queen last year – to help her navigate the industry.I can reveal she is dating rapper Jonathan Kabamba, who she posted this photo of on Instagram yesterday.She captioned it: “My Love, my King. Thank you for all the light, strength and joy you have brought into my le. I feel capable of anything with you by my side.”The pair are believed to have been dating since last year.Jonathan, who hails from the Congo, is the first man she has publicly dated after splitting from rapper HYPO in .Before that she was married to scientist Adam Gouraguine but they split after ten years, just a year after tying the knot.Jonathan headed up a community centre with recording studio in Chad-well Heath, North London, to give kids skills to stay out of gangs. It shut in February after two years.Hopefully he and Emeli last far longer than that.BOYZONE split up for good before the release of their  album and the subsequent tour last year . . . or so they said. But they might already be having second thoughts.Keith Duffy has teamed up with ex-Westle star Brian McFadden to release an album as Boyz-Le, and Brian reckons it’s only a matter of time before Boyzone are back too. He said: “It’s  years since I left Westle so, for me, rejoining won’t happen. But for Boyzone . . . the boys have been together for  years.“Though Keith and I are doing this and Ronan Keating is doing his solo thing,the opportunity comes up for the boys to get together – there is going to be a -year anniversary in a few years – you can never say never.”With  No singles between the two bands, Keith and Brian had plenty of options when picking songs for their Strings Attached album, recorded with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, which is out today.Keith said: “It made it very easy, the fact we had so many No singles to choose from. You Needed Mewas always our first choice, the song we were both excited about.” And they are already writing new material.Keith said: “With lockdown, we’re miles ahead where we were hoping to be for the new album.“Boyz-le has gone from strength to strength. We’ve moved mountains.“We’re pinching ourselves to be given this opportunity again in our ­forties to get on stage.”POP fans would have been in for a shockthey had bumped into this trio in the park.THE Saturdays members Frankie Bridge, Una Healy and Mollie King shared the photo on their catch-up, six years on from their split.I guess their absent bandmates Vanessa White and Rochelle Humes were taking their social- distancing really seriously.MEGAN THEE STALLION is “grateful to be alive” after being shot in the foot at a party at the weekend. The rapper, who collaborated with Beyonce on a remix of her song Savage, said she was taken to hospital by police, where she had an op to remove the bullets after the “traumatic” incident.CONGRATS to Radio  DJ Chris Stark, who has become a dad for a second time. Announcing the news on air yesterday, he said: “I am so happy, I’m so proud and I’m so pleased. Our little baby boy was born and it’s just mad. It’s the best. My we is just phenomenal.”GIGI HADID is trying to “document” every step of her pregnancy. The model, who is expecting her first child with Zayn Malik, said: “I’m just taking my time with sharing my pregnancy . . . I’m trying to document it well. Right now, I just want to experience it and don’t want to worry about having to look cute or post.”CLEAN BANDIT have racked up a billion Spoty streams of their  Christmas No Rockabye.

Two million of us, gainfully employed in February, face winter on the dole.We applaud the PM though for racing to restrict the damage, in defiance of the hyper-cautious scientists advising him.Naturally, the Left and the Brexit­hating broadcasters are aghast that Boris would do something apparently so reckless.But his science and health advisers, to their credit, admitted ­yesterday they do not have to factor in millions of lost jobs and an economy on the brink of an abyss.

So from August onwards we will take a few more giant leaps to freedom: More work done from the office, theof weddings, the reopening of stadiums, theatres, bowling alleys and ice rinks.By Christmas maybe even the end of social distancing.The scientists’ gloom over the coming winter is a stark contrast to Boris’s optimism.But given their shocking complacency in February over our pandemic preparations, it is unsurprising they have lurched to the opposite extreme.The problem is, their continuing ­misjudgments do serious damage to national confidence.It has been astonishing to discover Public Health England counting the deaths of recovered Covid sufferers for ANY reason as Covid deaths. That is absurd . . . no wonder their tolls remain so worryingly high.Boris’s assessment strikes us as more realistic.

But most accept we have to leave our homes and get back to the workplace to save the economy.About one in five —  per cent — think it is unsafe toto work and want to continue working from home. A similar number,  per cent, argue it is probably safe to go back.But crucially, a massive  per cent accept it is worth the risk of travelling back to their office to protect their jobs and livelihood.The boost for BoJo’s attempt to reawaken our towns and cities comes in our YouGov poll to mark the first anniversary of his Premiership.It also reveals:Last night senior Tories said Mr Johnson should continue hammering home his back-to-work message to ease the nation’s deep-seated virus fears.Tory ex-minister Sir Mike Penning said: “This poll shows that the penny is beginning to drop about the wider impact of coronavirus.“It’s understandable that people are still concerned about becoming infected, but as we come out of lockdown many are starting to contemplate the economic backlash that is about to hit us.“If we want to keep people in work and protect our vibrant towns and cities, we’ve got to go back to work and get the country moving again.”However, most people think a second wave of coronavirus infections is inevitable, with eight out of ten predicting a sharp rise this autumn.And some MPs fear the Government’s success in persuading Brits to stay at home has made the task of getting them to go back to work even tougher.Half of adults say they will not visit a restaurant next month to take advantage of the Chancellor’s half-price meal deal. And one in four admits that even now they still try to avoid going out shopping.The nation is split over the safety of it, with nearly half saying they will try to avoid going to the shops with or without face coverings.Some  per cent say compulsory masks will make it more likely they will visit a shop — but  per cent say it will make it less likely.Elsewhere, there is also huge support for students to get a refund on their university tuition feesthey have missed lectures or been taught mostly online during lockdown.Nearly half of people —  per cent — think they should get some or all of their money back, compared with  per cent who think not.Tory MP Esther McVey has been campaigning on behalf of students who feel let down.She said: “Where universities have not been able to provide a full teaching experience for students then, of course, they should offer partial refunds. I hope this poll will help to ensure students get the refunds they deserve.”Meanwhile, a growing number fear the long-term impact an extended lockdown will have on their family’s future prospects and long-term health.While most still worry about catching the virus,  per cent now say they are more anxious about the financial consequences that may follow.Alarmingly, three in ten people reveal they have missed medical treatment or diagnostic tests during the -week lockdown.Our poll also reveals that the PM’s personal rating has taken a battering as he fights on two fronts to control the spread of the virus and save jobs.Overall, voters say Mr Johnson has done well to steer the economy through dficult times.He is five points ahead of Labour boss Sir Keir when it comes to who is most trusted with the nation’s finances.But the PM is marked down for his handling of the pandemic, his efforts to bring the country together and, surprisingly, Brexit.More than half the population think preparing for a second wave of coronavirus should be the PM’s top priority in the year ahead.Conservative MP Bob Seely said: “The Prime Minister has done pretty well considering these are incredibly trying and dficult times. To lead a nation when you have nearly died yourself is an astonishing achievement in itself.“It’s been tough, but give him credit. He has bounced back and I think Britain will bounce back, too.”Most people think BoJo should lead his party into the next general election, with  per cent of Tories still believing he is the best bet.But Mr Sunak’s star is rising fast, after only five months in the Cabinet. An overwhelming  per cent of people believe he has done a good job of handling the impact of the pandemic with his furlough and business support schemes.And he is leading the race to succeed Boris by a country mile with  per cent of voters saying he would be their first choice —  points ahead of his nearest rival Dominic Raab.Mr Sunak is even more popular among Tory voters, with  per cent saying he would make the best PM out of all potential runners.While Mr Johnson marks his first anniversary on Friday, millionaire Sir Keir has just chalked up his first  days as Labour chief.Most people think he has done well, shown himself to be a strong leader and looks like a potential PM.But they are almost equally split when askedhe is either interesting or boring — orhe has been clear about what he stands for.The YouGov poll of , adults also found widespread support for the Government’s decision to remove Huawei from Britain’s G network, with  per cent in favour.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Under no circumstance will policing accept this particularly after we had appealed for such events not to take place.“We have seen an increase in unlicensed music events which, as well as being very disruptive to communities and irresponsible in terms of posing an increased risk of COVID- transmission, they have in some cases led to violence which affects both those attending and the officers who have to shut them down as well as causing fear and anxiousness in local communities who we help and protect.“We are already reviewing CCTV footage and officers’ body worn footage to bring those who committed offences to justice.“Officers will continue to patrol this weekend in increased numbers to keep communities safe. They will be engaging with local communities but will also be using tactics such as stop and search.

They sanctioned Chinese officials, we sanctioned their senators, their officials.“I do not want to see this tit for tat between China and the US happen in China and UK relations.“I think the UK should have its own independent foreign policy rather than to dance to the tune of Americans like what happened to Huawei.”Britain’s relationship with Beijing has come under increasing strain after telecoms company Huawei were banned from the UK G network and the UK government announced it would suspend an extradition treaty with Hong Kong.The same interview saw the ambassador praise the “beauty” of Xinjinang after being shown a video of blindfolded and shackled Muslim prisoners being forced onto a train.Mr Liu repeatedly denied human rights violations against Uighur Muslims in the region despite being presented with shocking footage of detainees.The year-old footage appears to show hundreds of Uighur Muslims waiting to be pushed onto trains in the Xinjiang province.Responding, he said: “I cannot see, this is not the first time you show me.“But let me tell you this, Xinjiang is regarded as the most beautul place in Xinjiang.”The Chinese official then refused to accept the footage showed Muslims being loaded onto trains.He said: “I don’t know where you get this tape.“Sometimes there are transfers of prisoners.”There is no such concentration camp in Xinjiang.The BBC host stated that the tape had been veried by western intelligence agencies after going viral around the world.Mr Liu responded: The so-called western intelligence keep making these  accusations against China. People say we have ethnic cleansing but the population of Xinjiang has doubled in  years.He also bashed Amnesty International, saying the human rights group were not respected in China because they never say a nice word.Today the Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab confirmed there was proof China was breaking international rules.He said: “It is clear that there are gross, egregious human rights abuses going on, which is why in Geneva at the UN we raised this with  partners ... to call out the government of China for its human rights abuses of the Uighurs, also of Hong Kong.Twenty-two nations have signed a letter to the UN Human Rights Council criticising Beijing’s treatment of Uighurs and calling on the Chinese government to “end its mass arbitrary detentions and related violations against Muslims in the Xinjiang region”.The Chinese Communist Party has previously compared Islam to an “infectious disease”.It also said in an official recording obtained by Radio Free Asia that “members of the public who have been chosen for re-education have been infected by an ideological illness.“Being infected by religious extremism and violent terrorist ideology and not seeking treatment is like being infected by a disease that has not been treated in time, or like taking toxic drugs,” the recording said.“There is no guarantee that it will not trigger and affect you in the future.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The UK’s official Covid- death toll rose yesterday by  to ,, although the real figure is believed to be higher. Our probe revealed Mr Hancock has benefitted from more than £, in political donations from wealthy figures in horse racing. It includes £, from racehorse owner Bill Gredley’s Unex property business, and £, from horse auctioneer Tattersalls. Mr Hancock was twice wined and dined for free at the festival during his time at the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. The £, monthly rent for his ex-constituency home, a Grade II-listed property on the Thurlow Estate near Newmarket in his constituency of West Suffolk, was reimbursed by tax­­­payers via expenses.

Mr Hancock was asked in Aprilthe festival should have taken place. He said: “We followed the scientic advice.

The Health Secretary has serious questions to answer. “We need full transparency and assurance that, in March, he and the Government were making decisions based only on the science.” Asked about his firm’s donations to Mr Hancock and his local Conservatives, Mr Gredley said: “I support the Tories and I support the community.

The Government looks likely to follow the example of the US, Canada and Australia and suspend the UKaposs extradition treaty with the territory - a move that would infuriate China. In a strong signal that he is ready to go down the same route, Mr Raab confirmed at the weekend that he had completed a review of Britainaposs extradition arrangements as part of the next steps. China was already smarting over the Governmentaposs decision last week to exclude the tech giant Huawei from the UKaposs G network - reversing a decision in January allowing it a limited role. Mr Raab threatened to pour further fuel on flames, accusing the communist regime of committing gross, egregious human rights abuses against the countryaposs Uighur population in the north-western Xinjiang province. The criticism was furthered by the chair of the defence select committee, Tobias Ellwood, who said Britain has been duped over the last couple of decades by China. The Chinese ambassador to the UK, Liu Xiaoming, said Beijing was still evaluating its response to the Huawei ruling.  There were reports at the weekend that the the Chinese social media company TikTok had broken off talks to open a global headquarters in Britain. Communist Party officials were also reported to have warned UK companies operating in China, including Jaguar Land Rover, BP and GlaxoSmithKline, that they could now face retaliation. Mr Liu warned Britain not to get drawn into a tit-for-tat confrontation in the way the US had, imposing sanctions on Chinese officials over alleged abuses in Xinjiang, prompting Beijing to sanction a number of US senators and officials. Mr Raab played down suggestions any such measures were imminent under the UKaposs new independent sanctions regime, saying that it took a long time to build a case against any alleged abusers. He insisted also that Britain wanted a positive relationship with China, working with it on issues such as climate change as well as trade and investment.

Anti-poverty campaigners have long called for the Department for Work and Pensionsto scrap the rule, which means claimants must wait five weeks for their first payment – or take an advance which must be repaid. The Government today said thousands of claimants moving onto UC – the Conservativesapos flagship welfare overhaul – will receive up to two weeksapos worth of additional cash during the five-week gap. But the announcement does not cover the millions of people who come on to UC as new benefit claimants. Instead, it will only help those who move onto UC from legacy benefits which they were already claiming. Dame Gillian Guy, Chief Executive of Citizens Advice, said: “Run-on payments are a welcome step that will lighten the burden for many legacy benefits claimants moving to Universal Credit. “But millions of people who have lost their jobs as result of this crisis remain subject to the five-week wait.  While advances are available, they have to be repaid, which can leave people with a choice of struggling now or struggling later. “Turning advance payments into a grant would strengthen the safety net and make sure more people don’t face hardship or debtthey need support from Universal Credit.” From Wednesday,someone’s existing claim of income-based jobseeker’s allowance, income-related employment and support allowance or income support ends due to them applying for Universal Credit, they will receive a payment worth up to two weeks of their “legacy award” – the benefit they were on previously.The one-off payment is designed to help people during their first assessment period and, crucially, does not have to be paid back. It will be paid automatically to eligible claimants when they claim UC for the first time and will not affect the amount of UC they receive. Welfare Minister Will Quince said: “This one-off payment will provide additional support as claimants move from legacy benefits to Universal Credit. “It doesn’t have to be paid back and won’t affect their UC award, so is welcome extra cash in pockets.” UC rolls six welfare benefits – child tax credit, working tax credit, jobseeker’s allowance, income support, employment support allowance and housing benefit – into a single payment. It has been blighted by delays and cost overruns. In February it emerged the full rollout had been delayed again, adding £million to its overall cost.

Ms Gorman, from Clitheroe, Lancs, claimed she had to work the hours set by the salon, who kept % of her takings. She worked for six years at a Terence Paul salon in Manchester city centre until it closed in . Her lawyers claim the judgment in her favour, following an Employment Tribunal hearing in Manchester, furthers recent legal decisions on worker status in the case of Pimlico Plumbers at the Supreme Court and Uber drivers, currently on appeal from the Court of Appeal. Judith Fiddler, of Direct Law  Personnel, said the preliminary judgment could affect thousands of hairdressers nationwide and other people such as dentists, hygienists, delivery drivers and bookkeepers. Ms Fiddler added: The whole hairdressing industry and many others will be affected by this decision. The signicance is huge, as many people who think they are self-employed are actually not. The influence of the Pimlico Plumbers and Uber driversapos cases has changed the climate. Our case was that Meghan was treated as an employee and was not genuinely self-employed, and therefore should benefit from employment law rights. At all times she was treated as an employee and her bosses exercised tight control over all aspects of her work. Around , people work in the beauty industry in the UK, more than % of them women, according to industry figures. Employment Tribunal Judge Marion Batten ruled in Ms Gormanaposs favour in March, with the reasons for the ruling released this week. Ms Gorman is now to pursue other claims against Terence Paul including unfair and wrongful dismissal, sexual discrimination and a failure to provide a written contract of employment, as well as claiming for holiday pay, her lawyers said. She joined Terence Paul, which at the time operated six luxury salons, as a -year-old trainee in  and later began work on a contract headed Independent Contract for Services as a self-employed hairdresser. Terence Paul claimed the companyaposs self-employed hairdressers had control over the hours and days they worked, their starting and finishing times, treatments they could give and their holidays. Ms Gorman disputed this, saying she had to work from am-pm from Monday to Saturday, had no control over pricing or offering discounts, had to use the companyaposs products, conform to Terence Paulaposs standards of dress, and had to tell the salonshe wanted time off. Ms Gorman said: They clearly had the power and control. I did not believe it could be considered I was in business on my own account.

Inspector Patrick Bailey told a court it was the worst state he had seen a dog in during his ten years in the job. He found the emaciated animal lying motionless on the floor when he was called to the familyaposs home in Poole, Dorset, on October  last year. Honey, a -year-old tan and white dog, was rushed to the vets but had to be put down. Clare Hawkins, , and her mother Christine, , admitted causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal over a three-month period at Poole Magistrates Court on Wednesday. Prosecuting Matthew Knight told the court Mr Bailey described Honey as the skinniest living dog he had seen, with every bone in its body clearly visible. Graphic images were shown in court which showed Honeyaposs jutting out ribs and pelvis bones. Mr Knight said the records showed the dog had not been taken to the vet since . When the RSPCA inspector took her to the vet they identied kidney disease, as well as dental, claw and conjunctivitis issues.  Mr Knight said: It was obvious this dog needed help. The family had got the dog as a puppy when Clare Hawkins was about seven. Defending for Clare Hawkins, Mark Price said she had tried to get help for the dog and it was her that contacted the RSPCA. He said she broke down in tears when being interviewed. She got home from work one day and discovered the dog could not stand and spent the night by its side.  She then spoke to a friend who is a vet and they advised her to call the RSPCA. She did the best she could for the dog but in an incompetent way. Ben Schofield, on behalf of Christine Hawkins, said she had been struggling to accept that she allowed Honey to suffer. He said: It was an incompetence by Ms Hawkins to not properly care for the animal.

But Professor Dominic Harrison, public health director in the town, now says only about % of people are being successfully tracked down by contact tracers. Last week he warned that Blackburn could yet face a local lockdown like that in Leicester unless people rigidly adhered to the new guidelines, which included limits on gathering sizes and encouraging people to elbow bump rather than hug. He warned of exponential growth of new infectionsthe system did not become more efficient.  The government said the NHS scheme had helped identy thousands of cases and it is not clear why the contacts provided were not able to be reached. Government figures reveal that of the people in England who tested positive for Covid- between - July, .% could not be reached and a further .% did not provide their phone number. It said .% of the contacts provided were reached, but .% of those who originally tested positive said they had not been in close contact with anyone during the required time frame. A leaked report suggested that fewer than half of contacts were reached in Oldham, St Helens, Manchester and Rochdale. Speaking to BBC Radio aposs Broadcasting House programme, Prof Harrison said that Blackburn with Darwen in Lancashire, which he oversees, faces a rising tide of infections. The key issue here is that % of people who are infected by someone with Covid- who goes for tests because they have symptoms, will be infected by them before they have those symptoms, said Prof Harrison. So, thereaposs a -hour window which is critical to get the contacts of the first case contacted, andwe donapost get them contacted, andthey donapost then get tested and self-isolated, and they then have symptoms, we do risk the spread progressing.The Jamia Ghosia mosque in Blackburn said it is  being investigated by the police and public health officials after holding a funeral on  July,  attended by  people.The Imam has since tested positive for coronavirus and is recovering. The mosque has emailed its congregation advising everybody to self-isolate and said it made a mistake in allowing more than the officially-permitted  mourners to attend.

The -year-old convicted rapist is said to have carried out the indecent act at a childrenapos playground in Sao Bartolomeu de Messines, Portugal, before the dad of the girl grabbed him. According to the Portuguese dad, who cannot be named, his daughter was among four children aged between  and  in the playground when Brueckner stopped at the bottom of the slide and exposed himself. The dad told The Sun he had never seen Brueckner before and he never saw him again after police arrived and took him away. But he recognised him when he was named as prime suspect in the disappearance of the three-year-old in Praia da Luz, Portugal, on May , . The dad said: “I grabbed him around the neck and held him down. “I had no idea who he was but was not going to let him get away with it. “I held on to him while the police were called. The alleged incident never made it to trial and was archived.  It happened  miles from where Madeleine was last seen. Yesterday police mugshots exclusively obtained by the Sunday Mirror show ­Portuguese cops knew about Brueckner’s paedophile past. A series of images of the German were taken in Faro in July  – eight years before Madeleine was abducted in Praia da Luz,  miles away. The pictures – never made public before – were in court file and show Brueckner at the age .  He was being extradited to his native Germany over a playground assault on a girl of six in .He served two years in jail before ing to his old stomping ground in Portugal. Brueckner raped a woman of  in  and is suspected of a string of burglaries at holiday properties like the one Madeleine was staying in.

He was also given a seven-year sentence for the  rape but is appealing against that conviction on a technicality. Brueckner was named last month as a suspect in Madeleine’s disappearance.

But she was shocked into action two years ago by a photo revealing her ballooning size, posted on her work Instagram account, which left her feeling mortied. Noticing that a colleague had shed lb in two weeks using a virtual gastric band, Stacey, who was then a size , weighing st lb, said: “He had been visibly losing weight and had managed to sht about half a stone in two weeks. “I asked him how he did it and he told me about this app by  Weeks to Wow called ‘Virtual Gastric Band Hypnosis – Lose Weight Fast.’ I downloaded it myself as soon as I went on my lunch break that same day.” To her amazement, ft in Stacey - whose body mass index, which is used to gauge a healthy weight, was ., compared to the NHS recommended range of . to ., making her obese - shed a whopping lb in five weeks after playing it every night as she fell asleep. Now weighing just st lb, wearing a size  and having lost an incredible . inches from all over her body, Stacey said: “I’ve always struggled with my weight in one way or another. “But now I have completely transformed my mindset around food. I feel happy with myself and that need to stress eat has gone. I’m stronger than ever, these days. “I still have my down days, but listening to the app calms me down. For me, it’s about so much more than just the physical weight loss.” Stacey, who is a single mum to McDonald’s worker Andrew, , and college student Ryan, , first began to struggle with food aged . For years, she suffered with bulimia – an eating disorder which sees people binge eating, before either making themselves sick, using laxatives or excessively exercising in a bid to stop gaining weight - making her so ill that, at her worst, she was on the brink of being hospitalised. But when she fell pregnant with Andrew, she forced herself to deal with her demons, saying: Something like bulimia never fully goes away, but you learn to get it under control. “For me, the turning point was getting pregnant. I had this little le inside me that I needed to protect. I had to change my ways and stop damaging my body for the sake of my unborn baby.” For a while after Andrew arrived, new mum Stacey felt content and happy with her size. She added: “I wasn’t worried about my weight in the slightest. As I was breastfeeding, I made sure I ate really healthily, too.” When, just under two years later, she split with her ex-husband while she was pregnant with Ryan, sadly, everything changed. Dealing with a orce and a newborn baby took its toll on Stacey, although the stress saw her losing weight. “It just fell away. I was so stressed I could barely eat,” she said. But, despite her love for her children, as the years passed, depression kicked in and Stacey started comfort eating takeaways and junk food, as she tried to boost her mood. When ious slimming plans failed, she simply accepted her hefty frame, saying: “I was actually quite okay with the way I was – or at least, I thought I was. “Food stopped being a comfort blanket and became something I ate as a treat to make me happy. I know now that’s still emotional eating, though.” Her turning point came in early  when she spotted an unflattering photo on Instagram. She continued: “As I work in beauty, we take a lot of photos of makeup and that sort of thing to share on Instagram. “I noticed one of myself, and it didn’t sit well with me. I’d felt comfortable with who I was, but seeing that picture felt, to me, like I was letting myself go. Thankfully, the hypnosis app was her saviour and the morning after she first used it, the results were already plain to see. She said: “I went to a work coffee morning, where they were giving out cakes and biscuits. Usually I’d have loved it, but something in my mind had switched and I just didn’t want to eat them.” Since then, Stacey has continued to lose weight and is now a svelte size . Her diet has completely transformed and she has ditched takeaways, snacks and junk food in favour of healthy, home-cooked options. Starting the day with granola and berries, she will now make protein-packed lunches and dinners, like chicken and rice with vegetables, or prawn linguine. She said: “I don’t even keep junk in the house anymore and I’m not one for a takeaway these days. “I can’t quite explain the app as I’m often asleep before it gets to the hypnosis part, but it helped me to re-examine my eating habits entirely. “Listening to it, I would envisage my thinner self, looking at my reflection in the mirror, and imagine all the unhealthy stuff I put in my body being laid out on a table, pushed away, and replaced by healthy options. “I’ve learnt to eat what I want, not what I can. I don’t keep shovelling food in until I’m past full and uncomfortable, anymore. “The way I eat is much more instinctive now. I’ll listen to when I’m actually hungry rather than eating because I think I should. “I even use a smaller plate to eat off, so I’m not tempted to pile my portions high like I used to.” "},{"url":null,"title":"oap couple married 60 years","story":"NewsOAP couple married for  years beat coronavirus and leave hospital on same dayGillian England, , and her -year-old husband Michael were in the same hospital ward for three weeks while they battled Covid-ShareCommentsByCiaran Fagan:,  JUL NewsThey battled coronavirus in hospital for three weeks\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

To celebrate Saturday’s momentous milestone, we look back at  highlights from her reign and discover some hidden gems courtesy of Ingrid Seward, editor of Majesty magazine and royal biographer. . Becoming Queen  Young Princess Elizabeth was in Kenya at Treetops Hotel on February , , when she became Queen on the death of her father, George VI. Ingrid says: “Within two hours of hearing the news they were ready to leave for the airport. “There was a lot of working press waiting there and they stood in attention, with box cameras at their feet, as a mark of respect for the young Queen’s grief.” . The Coronation The crown was offocially placed on the new Queen’s hed on June, ,  in Westminster Abbey, becoming the th Sovereign to be crowned there and the th Queen. A whopping million people in the UK watched it. Ingrid says Prince Philip “kissed her on the cheek and was a little clumsy and slightly shted the crown - apparently she had to slightly adjust it. It was a really intimate touch on the most formal of occasions.” .   World Tour  The Queen set off on a seven month tour of the Commonwealth - her longest ever - in November  and visited  countries in the West Indies, Australasia, Asia, and Africa, covering more than , miles. Charles and Anne stayed at home. Ingrid says: “The children were being looked after by their grandparents and the Queen and Philip used to send diplomatic bags with recordings in them so the children could hear their voices.” . Charles’ investiture The Queen crowned Prince Charles on July ,  at Caernarfon Castle in Wales. One of the stars of the show was the Queen’s hat of yellow silk, with a crown entirely embroidered with pearls and bugle beads. “After some problems with putting his coronet together the designers had to improvise - using a gold-plated ping-pong ball to complete the work” Ingrid says. . Birth of Andrew  Andrew was the first of Elizabeth’s children to be born while she was reigning. He appeared on February ,  at .pm, weighing lb oz. Like Charles, Andrew was born at Buckingham Palace, but this time the Queen had her baby in the Belgian suite. “A few days before his birth a decree was issued saying that from henceforth the Queen’s children would use the surname Mountbatten-Windsor,” Ingrid says. . US visit  Aged , the Queen was greeted at the White House by President Dwight Eisenhower, above - the first serving president she met during her reign. During the tour, the royal party watched an American football game where the Maryland Terrapins defeat the North Carolina Tar Heels -. On their way back to the White House, they stopped in at the supermarket at the queen’s request. Ingrid says: “They became close - so close she sent the President her recipe for scones.” . Moon landing message  During the Apollo  moon landing in , astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, above, carried — and left behind on its surface — a silicon disk containing messages of peace and goodwill from many world leaders. The Queen’s message to the Moon read: “On behalf of the British people I salute the skill and courage which have brought man to the moon. May this endeavour increase the knowledge and well-being of mankind.” “The Queen has always loved the excitement of space travel. She and Prince Philip are fascinated by it” Ingrid says. . First Tweet  In , while opening the Information Age exhibit at London’s Science Museum, the Queen, referring to herself as Elizabeth R., tapped out her first tweet from the official Twitter account of Buckingham Palace.“The Queen was slow with technology to start with and it was Andrew who used to set the video for her” says Ingrid. “But by  she was Tweeting and now she’s doing Zoom calls…” .  First filmed Christmas message  The Queen’s  Christmas Broadcast was an historic event, as it was the first to be televised. It was also the th anniversary of the first Christmas Broadcast on the radio. The broadcast was made live from the Long Library at Sandringham, Norfolk. Ingrid says: “She was so nervous that it took Philip to go and stand behind the camera where he told a few daft jokes and got her to relax.” .  Charles’ engangement Their engagement became official on February ,  - and the Queen was delighted. She believed Diana was ‘one of the family’ and was pleased Charles had found someone. “The Queen wrote to one of her friends saying she was delighted that Charles had become engaged to the Spencer girl, she’s one of us” Ingrid says. . Olympics   After her star turn at the opening ceremony - she took little persuading from Danny Boyle to appear in a short sequence alongside Daniel Craig’s James Bond - the Queen was awarded an honorary BAFTA. According to her dresser Angela Kelly, she agreed immediately to star in the sequence as long as she could say the iconic line Good Evening Mr Bond. “When they walked about taking the engagement photos at Buckingham Palace the Queen was watching out of the window.” . Golden Wedding On November ,  The Queen and Prince Philip celebrated their Golden Wedding anniversary, attending a lunch at Banqueting House in London. The Queen made a speech in which she looked back on ‘a remarkable  years’ and paid tribute to the man who was her “strength and stay.” Ingrid says: “It said everything about her relationship with her husband. It was very important to her because that was the year Diana died and the state of the monarchy had been rocky.” . Golden Jubilee  The Queen’s Golden Jubilee in  saw her tour the country, visiting  cities and towns in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland in  counties over  days. She also headed overseas - clocking up more than , miles including trips to Jamaica, New Zealand and Australia and drawing huge crowds wherever she went. “The Queen is always very moved when her subjects come out and see her and she really loved it” says Ingrid. “Nowadays she complains that she never sees their faces anymore because they’re all holding up cameraphones.” . First grandchild Princess Anne’s son Peter Phillips was born on November , , at St Mary’s Hospital in London. Royal insiders say Peter is still his grandma’s favourite - and he’s often talked about their close relationship. “She was just about to conduct an investiture when she got the news” says Ingrid. “Very out of character, she held up the investiture for  minutes then apologised for being late due to the birth of her first grandchild!” . Friendship with Reagan  In , celebrations for the th anniversary of the Allied landings in Normandyduring the Second World War took place.

Diamond Jubilee The year  marked the th anniversary of accession. The only Diamond Jubilee celebration for any of Elizabeth’s predecessors was in , for Queen Victoria.

Her Majesty leaves presents at the foot of his bed when he visits Buckingham Palace.

World Cup  The Queen opened the World Cup in England during the opening ceremony at Wembley Stadium.

After Le star Ricky Gervais, Gavin  Stacey’s Alison Steadman and Strictly’s Craig Revel Horwood are among the famous faces backing a campaign to commemorate the lives of those who have died during lockdown. Labour, the Lib Dems and the Tories have thrown their weight behind the bid launched by the charity Marie Curie UK and backed by the Sunday Mirror. Comedian Ricky, who plays a grief-stricken husband in After Le, said: “Everyone needs time to grieve and heal. “The pandemic has meant thousands of people haven’t been able to say goodbye to loved ones in the way they would have wanted. Many haven’t got to hold their nearest and dearest. To have a day that officially honours those people – in whatever form – would be a wonderful celebration of their lives.” More than , people died in the UK during lockdown – equating to one million people bereaved. From March to June, , were recorded as “excess deaths”, including more than , coronavirus victims. Grieving families were unable to comfort each other, with mourners limited to between  and  people at crematoriums and ­graveyards. Most funeral homes were unable to offer viewings. Marie Curie, which gives support to ­families living with terminal illness, wants the Government to mark the UK’s loss on the first anniversary of lockdown, March , . Chief executive Matthew Reed said it would be“an ­important reminder of our responsibility to our communities”. They have launched a petition to get people to support the idea with the hashtag #UniteInMemory, with almost , people adding their signatures so far. The charity is keen to look at ideas for an “inclusive” act of remembrance. This could range from a service such as the one observed for Remembrance Sunday, or a communal act such as the Thursday night clapping that rang out for NHS workers during lockdown. The charity’s ambassador Alison Steadman lost a relative to Covid-. Alison, , said: “The funeral was delayed and there could only be a small number of people. I worry there will be a tide of emotion from people bereaved and they will carry that throughout their lives.  “After going through the scariest period of our letime, a special day could be something nice to come out of the pandemic, just like the Thursday night NHS claps and all the kind deeds.” Actor Greg Wise, ­comedian Paul Chuckle and commentator Chris Kamara echo her call. Strictly judge Craig Revel Horwood suggested Britain could shut for a day to “pause and remember”.  He said: “When this pandemic passes there’s a risk people will forget about it quickly but it should be remembered and those we lost should also be remembered.” Presenter Paul O’Grady said: “Families saw loved ones get into an ambulance and, for many, that was the last time they saw them. There’s been no real closure for people, they’ve just been left dazed. A day like this would help ease the pain.” Loose Women star Coleen Nolan said it was “important we recognise the sense of grief suffered by so many”. She said: “It would give them some comfort to know the rest of Britain stands in solidarity.”  Ex-EastEnder Debbie Arnold and former Corrie star Sherrie Hewson, who present YouTube hit The ­Wonderbirds, also back it. Sherrie’s brother Brett Hutchinson died at the age of  in April from a brain tumour and she could not see him in his final hours. She said: “I’ll always look back at  as the most horrendous year of my le.  “There should be a big street party. The pain is hard but I’d like to remember him on a joyous occasion.” The campaign also had the backing of major political parties. Labour Deputy Leader Angela Rayner said: “Losing a loved one is always devastating, but losing someone without even being able to say goodbye must be unbearable.  “The Government should back a national day to reflect.” Lib Dem leadership hopeful Layla Moran said people had “experienced devastating losses” and urged the Government to introduce the day. Tory MP Andrew Bridgen said: “We should include all those who have passed and remember close friends and family whose funerals we were not able to attend.” Families are touched by the campaign. Jenny Wilson, , of Belfast, lost her mum Karen, , to throat cancer and her funeral was held on the first ­official day of lockdown. She said: “We’d no time to remember Mum and were left with a gaping hole of grief. I hope a national day will honour everyone who didn’t have the funeral they deserved.” "},{"url":null,"title":"uks oldest identical twins 96th","story":"NewsUKs oldest identical twins th birthday wish to get personal with Jason StathamEXCLUSIVE: Lilian Cox and Doris Hobday have already revealed the secret to their long lives to Piers Morgan - \"lots of sex\"ShareCommentsByLucy Thornton:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL NewsLilian Cox and Doris Hobday are celebrating their th birthday tomorrow\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"News, views and top stories .

With further easing of lockdown restrictions, people do not have to wear a mask while at the office, working out at the gym or socialising at a pub or restaurant. But face coverings are compulsory when travelling by public transport or visiting shops and supermarkets. Boris Johnson announced a string of measures to reduce the risk of spreading the virus when gyms, leisure centres and swimming pools reopen on July  but wearing face masks is not one of them. Fitness enthusiasts will not have to wear face coverings while working out at the gym when centres reopen after the coronavirus lockdown.UK guidelines for wearing face masks are looser than countries such as Spain where people are required to wear a mask on the beach and at swimming pools, except when eating or swimming. But the new rules seem to be conflict with Government demands to wear masks in enclosed public spaces and make them compulsory in shops from Friday leading to growing confusion. The latest UK government advice says face masks are strongly encouraged in enclosed public spaced when coming into contact with people you do not normally meet. It also states you must wear a face covering at all times on public transport or when attending a hospital as a visitor or outpatient. UKactive, representing Britainaposs gyms and leisure centres, told MailOnline it spent last week in talks with Ministers to set guidance for its , member firms. The industry body said it is ensuring the fitness sector is aligned to Government guidance in the lead up to its reopening. But a spokesperson said UKactive would not expect face coverings to become mandatory in our facilities including , leisure centres, swimming pools and gyms. It says this is according to World Health Organisation guidance that people should not wear masks while exercising indoors as they may be less able to breathe comfortably. A build up of sweat on face mask materials could also encourage the growth of microorganisms, it states. Fitness chains have been preparing to reopen with new safety measures to protect members against coronavirus including limited visitor numbers, regular deep cleaning, and staff temperature checks. Virgin Active members will not have to wear face masks when most of its  UK gyms open on Saturday. David Lloyd also confirmed face masks will not be compulsory in its  UK health clubs. A UKactive spokesperson said: We note the Government’s decision on face coverings on shops and public transport where it is harder to keep social distancing in place. However, we also support the Government’s consideration that there need to be practical requirements for each sector. As such, when it comes to gyms and leisure centres, the appropriate mitigation measures will be in place to make sure that social distancing remains. Therefore we would not expect face coverings to become mandatory in our facilities. Wearing a face mask does not protect you from coronavirus, according to Government advice.

Lisa Brookfield, , left the premises halfway through an appointment in tears after what she described as discrimination. She left Mark Jeffs Hair  Beauty Studios in Lincoln after revealing she had suffered three waves of Covid- before making a recovery in May. Concerns were raised that Lisa, who has suspected asthma, was refusing to wear a mask properly, and the appointment was ended at the hair washing stage.The salon offered to blow dry her hair and re-arrange an appointment, but Lisa stormed out with her hair dripping wet feeling humiliated and went to another salon, LincolnshireLive reports.Lisa, who wanted her hair to look nice for a dinner with a friend on Friday evening and her first date in a year, said: The salon refused to cut my hair because I mentioned I have previously had Covid - three waves of it with the last one being in May. I left the salon with my hair dripping wet and in tears. They askedI wanted it blow dried and said I will just do it myself when I go home. I think what happened to me is a form of discrimination. I had Covid months ago and itaposs not fairI cannot access services. I went to another salon in a village and they said they were all right to cut peopleaposs hairthey had had Covid. Lisa, a forensic psychologist from With St Hughs, said she had originally booked her appointment for .am but the salon contacted her to say her usual stylist was not available. A new appointment was arranged for .am the same day. Lisa admits that she was  minutes late because she mistakenly thought the cut was scheduled for .am. The salon was able to accommodate her later on. Lisa said: I went in to reception and askedthey wanted me to wear a mask and I was offered a mask.  When I went through I mentioned to the hair stylist who was going to cut my hair that I likely have asthma and a mask restricts my breathing. I askedit was all rightI pulled it down slightly and the stylist said that was ok. I said I had actually had Covid three times, meaning I had had three waves of it. As another person was washing my hair, a stylist came through and said Mark Jeffs had made a decision that because I had had Covid, the appointment could not continue. I had just been saying how good their protective procedures and equipment were. I got up with wet hair wrapped up in a towel and went to reception. Mark told me: aposYou wonapost wear a mask.apos. I said that was not accurate and that I would wear a mask but it restricts my breathing. Then he said I was  minutes late and I apologised and said it was human error. He said I was being threatening but I was not. The salon, in St Paulaposs Lane, issued the following statement:The safety of all our customers and staff is our first priority as we operate under the Covid- restrictions. The salon has a very strict risk assessment that applies to all our customers and staff. We have spent over £, on making the salon COVID- secure and our customers acknowledge that this is a safe environment. On this occasion, the customer was late for their original appointment and could not be seen then due to implemented time slots to adhere to social distancing and to provide the ability to clean each area between clients. Arriving on time is clearly stated under the client guidance on our website and clearly displayed at the salon entrance. However, we made arrangements to accommodate the client later in the day. Unfortunately, despite informing a staff member at the beginning of their treatment that they had suffered three Covid-related health episodes, they refused to wear a mask properly.

Miracle Boyd, , was at a protest to pull down a Christopher Columbus statue in Chicago when she was struck in the face. Video shared on social media shows the moment the -year-old was hit. In the video, a police officer is seen nearing the teen before swinging his fist at her and apparently making contact with her face. Other footage shows her aggressively confronting police officers at the protest. Boyd was recording an argument she had with a cop when he allegedly hit her, ABC reported. My tooth was knocked out, she told the outlet. I have lip abrasions in my mouth. My teeth hurt really bad. According to a GoFundMe organised to help cover her medical expenses, Boyd had just spoken to a crowd of protesters at Grant Park when the incident occurred.  The teenager is an activist of anti-violence group GoodKids MadCity and has advocated for an end to systemic police violence and a lack of neighborhood investment, according to the GoFundMe. Some demonstrators had planned to pull down a statue of Christopher Columbus and lassoed it, Injustice Watch reported, but failed when police intervened. Boyd tried to deescalate the situation as the unidentied officer neared her before he allegedly knocked her phone and hit her, according to the GoFundMe. Chicago police did not identy the officer to Injustice Watch.  Police officers said that items including fireworks, frozen water bottles and rocks were thrown at cops on Friday,  NBC Chicago  reported. As officers and demonstrators clashed, at least  cops were injured, and  people were arrested, NBC reported. The Civilian Office of Police Accountability said several complaints have been filed against cops. Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot released a statement in response to the incidents on Friday. Unfortunately, last night, a portion of the protesters turned violent, Lightfoot said.  She condemned people for throwing items at cops and the called the reported excessive force by police unacceptable. I have spoken to the director of the Civilian Office of Police Accountability, and she has assured me that @ChicagoCOPA stands ready to address these complaints and will ensure that each of these is dealt with and investigated, Lightfoot said. She added: It is my sincere hope that we can strike the right balance to ensure people can rightfully express themselves  their First Amendment rights, but do so in a way that does not put anyone’s physical safety at risk. That would be consistent with our long history of peaceful protest.

Quickly you find yourself convinced that your house is going to be burnt to the ground by the time youand youaposre kicking yourself for not triple checking all the plug sockets and appliances. You could message your housemate or partner to checkyou have been forgetful, or you might be tempted to turn around and head home for some peace of mind. But it seems thereaposs a much easier way to calm your worries without ruining your plans. Le hack experts over at lehacker have suggested a simple solution to stop you worrying about leaving things on.If youaposre someone who knows this feeling only too well, they recommend taking a photo of your appliances before you go out.In a post on their website, writer Nicole Dieker explained: Before leaving the house, take a photo of your stove and oven dials—or your thermostat, or your iron, or anything  you worry about accidentally leaving on. If your brain starts to play the aposDid I  really  turn it offapos game, you can simply tap your photo app and see for yourself.She went on to explain that this is something she does herself and says itaposs really made a dference.  I started taking pre-vacation photos after my landlord upgraded the heating system in my apartment building and gave us all new thermostats, she said. This was in winter, right before I left on my holiday travels, and since the thermostats were so new that I hadn’t yet become accustomed to them I spent the whole first day of the trip worrying that I had forgotten to turn the thermostat down. She added that she now takes photos showing her oven dials are all in the right place and her thermostat is off before she goes on a long trip - but claims she never actually looks at the photos.

I’ve spent the lockdown on my own.“Of course, I hope they can get here soon.“We are waiting for the rulers of Venezuela to say when they will re-open the international flights to get them here.”For the first three months of lockdown Aberdeen players had to train alone due to social distancing restrictions.They were finally given the go-ahead toto socially- distanced training in mid-June and are now in full contact training.Hernandez said: “Funsowas the closest team-mate to me because we live a five-minute walk away from each other.“It is good to have him in the locker room because he can teach us a lot through his experiences.“I am still young and need to learn some stuff. He is a very nice guy, everyone can see that.“I kept in touch with the other guys as well, which was good for me as it helped me settle into the team faster.”The Red Army and Aberdeen’s Venezuelan community have also helped Hernandez during lockdown in the Granite City.He said: “Many fans have been really great with me.“There is a small Venezuelan community in Aberdeen, which is good for me.“It is a small city and I like it.“There are small towns in Aberdeenshire, which are quiet, and I like them.“I try to keep my mind peaceful because sometimes it gets tough as I miss my family a lot.“We have Venezuelan food in Aberdeen. There is a local restaurant on Union Street, Latin Way, and there is Cognito on the Corner. Some of the cooks there are from Venezuela.“Sometimes they bring me food to my home which has been great for me. To have my own food is nice.”When arriving on transfer deadline day Hernandez had not played competitive football for two months as the Norwegian season ended on December .He made just one start and one appearance off the bench before football in Scotland was shut down on March .Hernandez featured as a substitute in the - home defeat of Hibs on March , the last match before football ended.He wants to make an immediate impact in the new campaign and said: “I am very excited for the new season.

It shows contempt for those in the NHS who have risked their lives to save others. It shows contempt for those who have died without their loved ones by their side. It shows contempt for all of us who have stuck by the rules to protect our lives and the lives of others.Boris Johnson has asked us to #move on# but this issue will not go away. This is a wound that will continue to fester.Dominic Cummings continues to be a major player in government decisions and rules, those rules he so shamelessly flaunted without even an apology.

Once again, the separatists# numbers simply don#t add up.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands wardSir,Exactly two years ago I was diagnosed with stage three, oestrogen positive breast cancer.I’d just come back from a week#s holiday in Spain with Isabel and Margaret. Days before I went on holiday I’d had a biopsy following referral from my GP. Although there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, my holiday was definitely clouded by impending results#I had chosen to wait until after my holiday to get them.The journey that Monday to go to Gartnavel is one I’ll never forget. My partner Frank didn’t shut up the whole way there, obviously he was nervous. I couldn’t be bothered with the small talk and just wanted him to shut up. Obviously I was nervous and he was just trying to keep my mind off it, but I was too busy silently praying. The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place.

The noise is constant and intrusive for  –  hours in a day, the decibel level in excess of  dB where sounds above  dB are harmful to hearing.This is a serious issue for residents who cannot open their doors and windows, cannot use their gardens, pets are terried, it is often impossible to have a conversation, or a phone call. The noise from hundreds of bikes is explosive and destructive.The speeds are terrying, they travel in intimidating packs, the noise is threatening and the bikers have no respect for the communities they are speeding through. They pass multiple residential entrances with limited sight lines with no care for risk. The offensive noise seems to come from two actions modying motorbike exhausts and extreme acceleration in legal bikes.If a car made a similar noise, spewed out the same polluting omissions, or did the same ridiculous speeds they would be pulled over by the police, but bikers appear above the law.As technology reduces the noise pollution of cars, planes and other forms of transport, it seems motorbikes are exempt.

Perhaps for the first time in their lives they have heard the bark of deer or spotted something in nature that is totally new to them.

But what we do not want to do is fall back into the same old traps that were so detrimental to the wildle, nature and ecosystems of our planet. Finding a way forward and a new balance is not just crucial for other species but for that of our own children and future generations too.Many will have been shocked at the sudden increase in fly tipping during lockdown plus the thoughtless parking and abandonment of picnic rubbish, disposable barbecues and indiscriminate toileting as lockdown eased.

Guidelines remain to avoid touching surfaces or opening gates where possible, to follow signs and avoid coming into contact with farm workers where applicable, and to keep dogs on leads and avoid areas known to be busy. Pubs and restaurants without door space have also been allowed to reopen. Glasgow’s The Cranside Kitchen, near the Rotunda, has claimed to be the country’s largest beer garden, with a free-to-enter area seating more than  guests with social distancing measures in place.The beer garden offers a range of drinks alongside food from five popular Glasgow restaurants, Rioja, Halloumi, Pickled Ginger, Kilmurry  Co and La Rotunda.

Each oyster can filtrate and clean up to  litres of water a day, and the native oyster reefs enhance bioersity by becoming fish spawning grounds and nurseries.Back in March Seawilding secured a National Lottery Heritage Fund grant to grow young native oysters over a five-year period in floating baskets on the loch. When they are semi-mature, the oysters will be moved to trial seabed sites around Loch Craignish, where it is hoped they will become a self-sustaining population.Project co-ordinator Danny Renton told the Advertiser: #This is a pioneering project, driven by the Craignish community. Loch Craignish was once a rich environment for native oysters and scallops in particular, but bottom trawling since the s has destroyed much of the seabed. Our community wants to reverse that. We hear a lot about rewilding, but there’s little action been taken so far with restoration of marine habitats – so what we are doing at Loch Craignish is an exciting opportunity to show that marine rewilding and reintroduction of priority marine species is possible.#The project is teaming up with Scottish Association of Marine Scienceand the Department of Aquaculture from Stirling University to enable  marine science students to monitor, survey and research the restoration efforts over the next five years.To kick off the project, the charity along with local partner Heart of Argyll Wildle Organisation and the Ardfern Yacht Centre, has been introducing native oysters in suspended cages under the pontoons of the yacht centre.Each Oyster Hoister houses  mature oysters which will help clean up the marina water as well as releasing spat, adding to the wider restoration effort in the loch. The hoisters are sponsored by members of the community and boat owners, and the plan is to suspend around  cages by the end of the year.When schools open in August, Heart of Argyll Wildle Organisation will be working with pupils to monitor the oysters in the cages, measuring their growth and recording bioersity.Oly Hemmings and Pete Creech, the organisation’s rangers, initially want pupils from five local primary schools to get involved in this exciting project. This is an opportunity for pupils to actively take part in valuable research that will be added to data already being collected from other oyster reintroductions throughout the UK.Oly said: #We’ve been interacting with oysters in Argyll for around , years and it is fantastic to be able to get future generations involved in ensuring this relationship continues.#Any schools interested can email Oly and Pete at info@heartofargyllwildle.org for further information. A teacher’s resource pack that can be used in conjunction with school visits or as a standalone resource is available. The educational objectives are fully funded by the project’s funders, the National Lottery, and this includes travel to and from the project venue at Ardfern Yacht Centre. Oly and Pete also intend to engage with older schoolchildren and community groups as the project progresses.For further information about the Loch Craignish Native Oyster Restoration Project, please visit www.seawilding.org or email info@seawilding.org"},{"url":null,"title":"support local call as argyll eases out of lockdown","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsPubs and restaurants have opened, tourist attractions can now be visited # and those wild and woolly lockdown locks can finally be tamed by a visit to the hairdresser.As the easing out of coronavirus lockdown continues in Scotland, this week has seen the most signicant relaxation of restrictions imposed as the coronavirus pandemic arrived in March.Among other steps, places of worship and childcare providers can now all reopen.There is also a partial relaxation of  restrictions on attendance at funerals and marriage ceremonies, while closer working may now be permitted in the building trade.All of the above, of course, comes with strict safety requirements which must be adhered to # but they are steps in the right direction.And with many Argyll business ready to re-open, residents are being encouraged to support Argyll and Bute by buying local.#Post COVID-, we should support our local businesses as they have supported us during the pandemic,# said Councillor Alastair Redman, Argyll and Bute Council#s policy lead for economic growth.#With lockdown in place,# continued Councillor Redman, #our food and drink producers had to change the way they did business – often in imaginative ways.

It is now one of the most beautul drives in the place, and as a drive it would be destroyed.#The line from Glasgow to Oban took  years to build and finally opened in , proving extremely popular with holidaymakers for many years. The proposed branch line from Dalmally to Inveraray was never built, despite plans to #hide# the railway from the duke’s view. A plan from  shows a proposed tunnel to carry the line through the duke’s policies near to the castle. This proposal, like many others, was defeated in the House of Lords.Instead, provision was made at Dalmally for a waiting room, the #Duke’s Room#, at Dalmally Station where visitors arriving by train could await the arrival of a carriage in comfort.This is just one of innumerable fascinating stories stored within the Argyll Papers, the family and estate archive of the Campbell family, dukes of Argyll.The Friends of the Argyll Papers was established to support the development of the archive and to promote its use and enjoyment by a wide audience.It has been described as one of the most important private archives in Britain, offering a rich resource for Scottish and British history from the th to the st centuries.

Without action and proper investment from central government vital public services will be at risk.This news of huge strain on local authority budgets comes as the SNP is delaying in opening up Scotland’s hospitality and tourism industry. Instead of following other parts of the UK and opening the sector on July , the separatists are forcing businesses to wait until July .This delay will cost businesses millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line.The SNP is risking people#s livelihoods. It needs to accept responsibility for that and take action now.Councillor Alastair Redman,Sir,People occasionally ignore the elephant in the room to support their point of view, but in his latest letter, Councillor Alastair Redman has ignored an entire herd in his living room.In his latest rant he states that the SNP is failing councils as the cost of coronavirus could hit more than £ million, but surely these costs would be the same no matter who was in power He also suggests that #essential local services have been underfunded for years# yet fails to mention the years of needless austerity cuts, actioned by his party and their collaborators, to bail out the greedy and risky practices of the banks, which reduced funding to a devastatingly low level in general. It is worth noting that the Scottish Government has put a greater percentage of their curtailed income into NHS Scotland than any part part of the UK. This has helped NHS Scotland to outperform all of the others, in the UK, for the past five years. This is paying idends now.He s to his familiar attempt to insult by referring to citizens who want to take responsibility for making and managing decisions and working to make their country prosper within the priorities set by its citizens as #separatists#. I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover.

However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry.

Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures july 17 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWe#re at West Loch Tarbert for our featured image this week.

He would arrive for a few months in the summer, then vanish until the following year.He was always mysterious as to where he came from and where he was going. He had an accent that some said was Irish, but it was mixed with a most definite local Scots dialect. He was an old man with an unkempt beard. He always wore a bonnet a certain way, and wild strands of white hair grew from the sides of it. While he still had most of his teeth, there was one visibly missing, which was revealed when he smiled. When people asked him his name he would be reluctant to say. People called him the Porridge Maker.His most treasured possession was his cooking pot. It was large and heavy and he would carry it on his back with the help of straps he had made. He tied the lid tightly and all his other possessions would be stored in the pot. It became a kind of rucksack as he travelled.He would walk for miles, humming to himself, singing and sometimes playing his penny whistle. Then he would choose a place to settle for the night, and unpack his pot, and start cooking. He would make an evening broth from whatever he had managed to acquire during his dayrsquos travel. Then under the canopy of the stars, or under the boughs of a treeit was raining, he would wrap himself up in the thick blanket that he used during the day as a kind of jacket.Every morning he would make porridge, and always a larger amount than he would need himself. This was the time when people would enquire as to his purpose and origins. Often it was the small children of the village whose curiosity would make them assemble round him and ask questions. Sometimes they would be shooed away by their parents, but often the older members of the community who had more time would engage him in conversation, and then sit with him.The Porridge Maker had tales and riddles, news from far-flung lands and memories of past deeds and events which made his company fascinating for old and young alike. Soon it became apparent why he would make more porridge than he needed: it was to share. He would share it from his one bowl, which he called his Porridge Quaich. It would be passed round in an almost religious ceremony.But to have a taste of his delicious porridge, a price had to be paid. A story or riddle must be told, a memory shared or some wisdom imparted. The Porridge Maker would listen carefully to everything said. This was one way he gained his vast knowledge of the world and of its stories.The other was, of course, in his travels. As he walked he would observe everything: the way the clouds formed, the song of the birds, the landscape and its curiosities, the way people behaved everything. Then he would just be, and allow his thoughts and observations to mingle. This was how new tales and riddles formed in his imagination.And so as he cooked his evening meal, he would tell stories to himself and whisper his riddles, and he would look forward to sharing them with whoever might come his way and sit by his fire.Then one day, someone recognised him.The Porridge Maker had settled himself away from the road by the River Tyne, downstream from Haddington. He had made a small fire and was cooking a trout he had secretly caught when an old man of similar age walked by, stopped, stared at him, and then made his way towards him.The Porridge Maker thought he was now in trouble. But the old man wasnrsquot interested in the fish. He studied the Porridge Makerrsquos features carefully, then he nodded with a grin.ldquoAye, sae it is ye! said the man with an accusing tone.ldquoAye, fir sure I am maist certainly me! replied the Porridge Maker.ldquoYe cannae bamboozle me, said the stranger with a triumphant mocking laughter, ldquoI thocht I kent ye by the way ye wear yer bonnet and by yer stooped shudder, but noo that Irsquove seen yer face I ken fir sure!ldquoAnd  asked the Porridge Maker, seemingly unfazed by this sudden attempt to unmask his identity.The stranger sat himself down and looked the Porridge Maker in the eye.ldquoI cannae mind yer exact name, he said, ldquobut I ken ye were a Jacobite.ldquoThose days are lang past noo, said the Porridge Maker, still keeping his calm.ldquoAye, they are, thankfully. And they hanged many orsquo the likes orsquo ye.ldquoThat they did, replied the Porridge Maker.ldquoYer a MacGregor, said the old man, ldquoI mind that, and ye hud blood oan yer haunds ater Prestonpans.The Porridge Maker said nothing. He just stared into his fire.ldquoYe sliced a manrsquos heid in twa by the wall.Suddenly the Porridge Maker looked up. ldquoHowrsquod ye ken that  he asked, now startled.ldquoBecause I wis there!The Porridge Maker now looked the man in the eye.The old man continued: ldquoYe were goanie dae the same tae me. I hud nae weapon sae I punched ye.ldquoAye, said the Porridge Maker, ldquoI remember that weel enough, revealing the gap in his teeth that was the result.The old man laughed.ldquoThat punch saved ma le, said the old man, ldquofir it gied me time tae run as ye stood like a stunned rabbit. But I saw ye ater, greetin like a bairn.The Porridge Maker was silent but pursed his lips and nodded.ldquoYe cudnae thole it cud ye  said the man accusingly.ldquoI wis a lad, and arsquo fired up with rage, said the Porridge Maker. ldquoHe wisnae the only one that day I killt. But I vowed he wud be the last Irsquod kill tae decorate anotherrsquos pride. He hud cried fir mercy sayin he had bairns, but I didnae understand his words till after Irsquod cut him.The old man laughed. ldquoSae much fir the great warrior race! Ye deserted after the battle, didnrsquot ye  Ye ran awa like a coward and cudnae gang hame. If the Redcoats hadnae caught ye, yer ain family wud huv disowned ye fir the coward that ye are!ldquoI did go hame after, but I found ma hoose burnt and ma we and bairns slain. Sae I hud nae family left after that time, said the Porridge Maker with a breaking voice.The old man bowed his head. ldquoAye, it wis a sair time richt enough. But the wages orsquo rebellion are unforgiving.ldquoDae ye ken the name orsquo the lad that I killt by ye  asked the Porridge Maker hopefully.The man was surprised by the question, and looked at the ground as he thought.ldquoWull I think, aye, it wis Wull. I mind he wis really feart, poor lad, he carsquod fir his mither as he died.The Porridge Maker lowered his head, reliving that moment he had tried so often to forget.Neither men had yet exchanged their names.ldquoYou hungry  asked the Porridge Maker, ldquofor ye can share whit I have ye huv earned it by sharing yer memory wi me.And so two men, who once had tried to kill each other, now shared a meal.ldquoWull, the Porridge Maker whispered as he ate.He finally had a name for the young lad hersquod slain all those years ago in  at Prestonpans.The deepest wounds of war are often those unseen, and the stories left out by military historians are the stories of lives traumatised and changed forever.Sadly, whatrsquos left of the Prestonpans battlefield site is now under threat by proposed new developments."},{"url":null,"title":"community-resilience-efforts-cockenzie-port-seton-dunbar-gullane-haddington-musselburgh-north-berwick-prestonpans","story":"From collecting shopping and vital prescriptions to dog walking and simply being there for people, the volunteers are there for residents throughout the coronavirus crisis.Here, we look at six of the groups who are giving up their own time to help out.Cockenzie and Port Seton.

Consequently, you can no longer reserve specic seats in advance, so itrsquos down to luck whether you end up with good seats or not.

Irsquom also ready to accept some fundamental political realities.Letrsquos face it, wersquore all just guinea pigs now, part of a radical public health experiment the likes of which has never been attempted before. This experiment is reaching its most dficult phase yet, the bit where the Government has to somehow let people start doing normal things ndash like going back to work and spending money to keep the economy going ndash while simultaneously reminding us that we wersquore not out of the woods yet. They have to encourage people to go out, while keeping them scared.Many ndash including me ndash have criticised politicians for their missteps and mixed messages over the last few months. But I also recognise a number of basic truths that itrsquos better to get onersquos head around sooner rather than later, regardless of party politics.The first is that until coronavirus has been completely eradicated around the world, risk is going to play a part in our lives for the foreseeable future. The second is closely related: the state cannot tell us exactly how to manage this risk in every single circumstance. We may get health advice and government guidance, but ultimately we have to navigate this new, more precarious world on our own.How we do this, and, crucially, how we feel about doing it, depends on many dferent things, of course, not least our age and underlying health, our financial situation and, to a signicant extent, our personality.I know there are some who believe that through lting lockdown restrictions politicians in Westminster and Holyrood are very deliberately handing over responsibility ndash and thus blame ndash to the public for what comes next. And there may be some truth to this. But come on, letrsquos get real.Accusations of ldquomaking it up as they go along are thrown around asthis was an insult rather than simply a fact describing the predicament governments everywhere find themselves in. How could it be otherwise given the extraordinary events of the last six months  And whatrsquos the alternative to us being public health guinea pigs  Staying at home forever Community levels of the virus in Scotland are now low and falling. Our hospitals lie empty. We have a test and trace system in place to ndash hopefully ndash crack down on infections. Meanwhile, wellbeing continues to suffer under the restrictions and hundreds of thousands of jobs hang in the balance. All of these things mean we can and should lt the lockdown. And lting restrictions means the vast majority of folkmust decide for themselves what level of risk they are comfortable contending with, taking into consideration how it might affect their family and community as well as their own personal circumstances.We can help ourselves along the way. Firstly by staying up to date ndash through trusted, legitimate scientic and public information sources ndash about how the virus is transmitted and the best ways to stay safe.We can also resist the temptation to judge others for their decisions. Frankly, Irsquom sick of the army of armchair virologists spouting their culture war vitriol on social media. On one side you have those who seem to relish the lockdown, the class swots who shout too loudly about how they follow every part of the guidanceand seem to revel in the idea of a second wave. On the other side, you have the virus deniers. Both groups peddle fear and misinformation, whether that is their intention or not.At the end of the day none of us, not even the scientists, know whether and when there will be another wave of the virus.

Despite that countryrsquos reputation for fine Arabicas, the coffee in our hotel was dreadful. Irsquod drink water instead. For three days I experienced strange aches in my lower back and legs. I put it down to the physical confinement on the plane, but in retrospect I think I was experiencing caffeine withdrawal symptoms.Home again, I was back on coffee, although not enjoying it. A few sips seemed to make my heart beat faster it made me feel slightly nauseous.So for around eight years, I stopped drinking coffee totally, and felt all the better for it. I became a tea enthusiast, and underwent a tea education. But only drinking tea was a pain really, because good black tea is hard to find. Despite Britainrsquos reputation as a nation of tea drinkers, most of the stuff we drink is rubbish.And then I was in Rome, visiting the wondrous Pantheon, a stonersquos throw away from Caffegrave SantrsquoEustachio, renowned since  for its espresso.

Irsquod be served, politely, a tepid brew made from some fusty box of tea bags, but this is place where anyone cultivating lsquola bella figurarsquo knows not to ask for a latte, or any other wimpy touristrsquos coffee, let alone tea. So I drank the potent espresso. Three sips, it was gone. My pulse didnrsquot race. I slept well that night on a hard hotel mattress. So, my coffee exclusion regime stopped there and then.Reading up on my strange lack of adverse reaction I reviewed ious theories as to why espresso, though stronger tasting than filter or cafegravetiere coffee, wasnrsquot having that lsquowiredrsquo effect on me. One idea is that the steaming process removes more of the caffeine another is that the steam is irrelevant, you just drink less caffeine overall with a small espresso. All I know is that a single shot of well-made espresso causes me no problems.Stealthily, I resumed occasional espresso drinking, always in indie coffee shops, perhaps two or three times weekly. Here was another revelation. Many places in the UK make great espresso, which for me means unapologetically strong, smooth and nutty. In others, itrsquos unpleasant, usually thin and acidic. The worst espresso Irsquove encountered was in a major coffee chain. There was a downpour, I dashed in to be dry. It was undrinkable. Never again. Pick your coffee shop carefully.And then came lockdown. No coffee shops  My lingering taste for espresso, call it addictionyou like, kicked in big time.

It should be on your wish-list because the whole area of Crinan and Knapdale is fascinating ndash geologically unusual and littered with ancient artefacts, standing stones, forts and duns. Castle Dounie, the focus of this walk, is an Iron Age fort that straddles a high ridge with sumptuous sea views across to Jura and Scarba, two islands separated by the notorious Corryvreckan and its whirlpool.Crinan Harbour lies just west of the tiny village of Crinan where the eponymous canal empties out into Loch Crinan. There is a sizeable car park here, just beyond the first few houses as the road turns right into Crinan Harbour. From the car parkalong the road, past the junction to a white cottage. In front of it a signposted waymarker points out the route, along a shingly foreshore for a short distance.Another sign indicates where the path leaves the shore and runs parallel to it for a while through a lovely grove of oak trees. Shortly after a wooden bench the path veers slightly left and begins to climb what appears to be a firebreak through the woods. There is another bench halfway up the hill which may offer a bit of relief.Enjoy your break, and the views that are now opening up, because you wonrsquot see many more views for a while, and therersquos more climbing to be done. At the top of the steep path turn right onto a forestry track and enjoy easier walking to another junction and bench. Turn left here and climb a little more gently now to another, narrower, path that runs off to the right.I got quite excited at this point for at last we were away from broad forestry tracks and among native trees with views beginning to open out across Loch Crinan towards the sea. A narrow pass took us to another rest stop. Not a wooden bench this time but a full-blown picnic table. It seemed a little churlish not to use it.After lunch we carried on over a rise, along a slight descent before reaching another junction. Our descent route went to the right but before that we wanted to climb to the castle viewpoint and were delighted to actually reach the viewpoint by climbing through the ancient dunrsquos entrance.There are enough fortications still in existence at Castle Dounie to give you a pretty good idea of what it must have been like. It was a great spot to linger awhile in the sunshine. I took my boots off, lay back against one of the retaining walls and simply gazed across the vast area of sea towards the island of Scarba. Away to the north the peaks of Cruachan stood proud, but the best of the view was to the north-west towards the high hills of Mull. What a spot.It took a lot of effort to put my boots back on and begin the descent, back to the last path junction where we simply walked on straight ahead, steeply downhill to another junction with a forest track. We turned right onto the track and what do you know  It began climbing again, a long haul up to another viewpoint and wooden bench. I was beginning to grow quite fond of these benches.Back on the path we still hadnrsquot finished climbing . We ed to one of the benches we passed earlier and then we were homeward bound.

Portugal has been one of the most successful countries in Europe at controlling the virus, partly because of its cautious approach in imposing lockdown much sooner in the diseases trajectory than neighbouring Spain . Another reason has been its record on testing ndash it has consistently tested a much higher proportion of its population than most other European countries, having decided early on that Portugal would produce its own tests, rather than relying on imports, and state and private laboratories collaborated with the government from the start. This could give an appearance of higher incidence of the virus than in some countries where there has been less testing. Moreover, the opposition parties supported the government, avoiding making the crisis a political football as has happened where. And the tourism sector has gone to great s to make everywhere that tourists might go as safe as possible. No Bournemouth beach scenes there.I have started to wonder whether Westminster has made this decision for political reasons. Portugal has a successful socialist government which managed to reverse austerity measures while still reducing its debt, and which was re-elected in September. I realise this may feel like a conspiracy theory, but would it be so surprisingBoris Johnsons government wanted to damage the economy of a socialist country  And given the extent to which Portuguese tourism depends on UK tourists, it certainly would cause damage.Portugal is a beautul country with wonderful people, and deserves to be treated better. . Moreover, Portugal is a friend of Scotland, Portuguese people seem very aware of the position that Scotland is currently in when I went back to visit last September, friends and strangers alike would say things like \"We know you in Scotland didnt vote to leave the EU, were really sorry this is happening\". Therefore,Scotland could show friendship to Portugal by unilaterally lting the UK ban, I am sure it would be appreciated enormously,Cathy Benson, Edinburgh.LET THE PEOPLE VOTE FOR HONOURSIT was while watching old footage about the ennoblement of Lynton Crosby for his services to the Tory Party that I got round to thinking about our countrys honours system.Over and above, my view was reinforced by the recent newspaper stories about Damehoods being bought for as much as pound,.If honours are to have genuine relevance today, they should be focused on those who have benefited the wellbeing and prosperity of the community in general.Both the examples above do not meet the criteria laid out in my previous sentence.Crosby was awarded his knighthood for his position as a paid partisan propagandist for a particular political party while the money offered to purchase a Damehood was for the selfish purpose of enhancing the purchasers social standing.Those two examples make a mockery of the intent behind such honours.Eligibility for such awards should not be confined to the decisions of a secretive small committee but should be thrown open to the public at large to nominate suitable people from the following categories ndash entertainers, sportspersons, politicians, public servants, charity workers and entrepreneurs.Such a procedure would give the public the pleasure and privilege of proposing those they consider worthy of such awards and would eliminate the sleaze which operates behind closed doors under the camouflage of a so-called impartial committee.Denis Bruce, Bishopbriggs.PSYCHIATRY HAS SERIOUS FORM FOR LIESMUCH more concerning, I suggest, than lies which are gullibly believed by society are the truths which it dismisses without any consideration . Few would dispute Ron McKays suggestion that the current US President is a serial misspeaker but is Donald Trump pathologically unstable, as many other commentators insist he is  Here, we find ourselves in the realm of mental illness and, whenever I want my own biases to be confirmed, I always turn to the visionary psychiatrist Thomas Szasz . In his book The Myth Of Mental Illness, Szasz rounded on two mental illnesses which could scarcely be more topical: Drapetomania, and Hysteria.Drapetomania was a psychiatric diagnosis given to enslaved Africans who wished to flee their captivity. The condition was said to be brought on by masters who treated their toiling property too well, giving them a taste for better living conditions.Similarly, Hysteria was a diagnosis frequently ascribed to women who, for whatever reason, refused to bend to a mans will . Quite simply, it was an early form of gaslighting.According to Szasz, what both conditions had in common was not the fact that they were mental illnesses: it was the fact that both labels supplied a pretext to correct behaviour which was socially disapproved of at the time. This was the case with mental illnesses overwhelmingly, which he saw as being largely metaphorical in nature.Psychiatry has serious form where lies are concerned and yet critics of Mr Trump are happy to deploy it against him as a weapon. Szasz has warned us that doing so is a big mistake because, like the cons Ron listed in his amusing article, the pseudoscience of psychiatry is just another one of them.We could learn somethingwe stopped to entertain ideas such as those of Szasz. We could even solve some seriously chronic problems in our society.But, why would we Archie Beaton, Inverness.BBCrsquoS FAT CAT FACTORYSOME years ago my modest bank balance was marginally improved when I joined those of advanced years and was no longer required to pay a television licence. Now this amnesty is over and I find myself again being required to help fund what I think is a fat cat factory where few employees,any, receive less than pound, per year, but from whose premises emerge monotonous miaows of financial misery and hardship.A look down the excessively y list of the higher-profile BBC employees quickly suggests thatthis excessively financed organisation experiences any financial glitches, this has to be because of the pay level at its places of work. Even that other cosseted closet of employment, the House of Lords, cannot be, I am convinced, doling out such beneficence as the BBC.

Laying hens became impossible to source, seed sales went up six-fold and we learned new recipes that we might never have considered before.During lockdown I decided I wanted to make a dference, so I started a Facebook page, RuralKitchen. My goal was to show the benefits of getting your food from local places, be that locally supporting grocers or at the farm gate, or even betterhellipgrowing your own, either indoors oryou are lucky enough to have space for a plot. On top of this, I felt it important to show the good side of the farming industry, as it has at times received a lot of bad press.The UK prides itself on one of,not the highest animal welfare standard on the globe. There is as yet no chlorinated chicken or hormone-infused beef here, thankfully. With that comes an obligation on our farmers to care not only for their animals but also the environment around them. That includes limiting pollution of nearby watercourses, the atmosphere and the sequestration of carbon.The power of local is unparalleled and for the most part unknown. This is the case with food consumption as well of course. The food that sits on your plate may well have travelled further in the last day than you have in a letime. The energy expenditure of transport and handling is higher than that gained in food consumption. Let that sink in. The main problem in that system is the reliance on foreign goods. The UK is around - per cent self-sufficient and all of the food we produce is subsidised to keep prices down for you and me, the consumer. The production in the UK comes with the strictest animal welfare regulations, one of the highest-rated required environmental compliance systems on earth as well as creating jobs for four million people.Take pride in what we as a nation have in Scotland. Population-wise we are small, in a world where  countries have more than  million people and  cities have a higher population than us, we are somewhat dwarfed to the point of insignicance. However, we have one undeniable trait, community spirit with an interest in looking out for those around us. We can translate that to looking after our own country, and furthermore our planet by the use of local and reducing the carbon footprint on our most fundamental requirement, food.So, from now on, I implore you all to check what you buy, for the good of the planet, the animals involved in food production as well as yourself.

There must be a determined effort by government to turn, with the same co-operation with those in the best position to advise, to wider health issues, including the needs of those with long-standing conditions, or in care homes.There is an urgent need for focus, too, on the restoration of the economy to health, something that will require attention to the advice of business leaders, and support in those areas that they identy as priorities, rather than the things bureaucrats or politicians think easy or desirable.:Nicola Sturgeon opens up about grieving process at Alex Salmond relationship breakdownJust as matters began to improve only when the government concentrated its efforts on the points that scientic experts thought the most important, the process of economic recovery will depend on the expertise of those who actually create jobs and know best the recipes for stimulating productivity and growth.

The results come as high streets are facing a battle to survive amid declining footfall and store closures.Latest figures from the Office for National Statistics saw Scottish shop numbers fall from , in  to , in  with vacancy rates sitting at .% for the first quarter of  ndash before lockdown.Local retailers were not only competing with out-of-town shopping malls and discount supermarkets, but there was also the combined effect of many high street banks giving up their sites as more services moved online.However, as retailers emerge from lockdown, the poll will give the sector a boost and comes on the eve of a national campaign to revive town centres post-Covid.The campaign is designed to urge Scots to think local first when it comes to shopping and hospitality, while ensuring they continue to adhere to the Scottish Governmentrsquos public health guidance.It will be run by Scotlandrsquos Towns Partnership, a national organisation for town centres, in partnership with the Scottish Government.Writing about the poll in The Herald on Sunday today, Leigh Sparks, professor of retail studies and a deputy principal at the University of Stirling, said: ldquoThe polling figures reported here today show the strong support in Scotland for local high streets and towns and the businesses trading there.There is a sense of place and desire to see local stores, businesses and towns succeed, and a recognition that this depends in part on local residents supporting local places.ldquoThe poll suggests that almost two-thirds of respondents will positively sht their spending to this end in the future. We need to ensure we capitalise on this positive sentiment by making it simpler to get to towns and high streets, make them more attractive and interesting, and make them easier places in which to set up local and community businesses and enterprises.Phil Prentice, chief officer of Scotlandrsquos Towns Partnership, pictured below, said: ldquoThese are hugely encouraging findings after a challenging time for town centres, high streets and the local businesses that occupy them. Sometimes we forget that our high streets arenrsquot just a collection of pavements, buildings and streets, they are the very fabric of our communities. The impact of coronavirus on our high streets isnrsquot just financial, itrsquos human.:The  best independent shops in Scotland for Christmas gtsHe said one of the positives of this experience has been how communities have come together and shown compassion and solidarity with one another. Prentice added: ldquoBuilding on this sense of loyalty and community is what is needed to bring about a town centre rival and, while these polling results are encouraging, we need to turn this goodwill and intention into action that is sustainable in the long term.ldquoFor a few months now, we have been working with the Scottish Government and others to develop a campaign, launching tomorrow, which we hope will appeal to this sense of shared identity. But it is still vital that we remind people the virus is still out there and we still need to be careful and adhere to the public health advice.Ewan MacDonald-Russell, the Scottish Retail Consortiumrsquos head of policy, said: ldquoRetailers will be hoping shoppers help support local shops because the alternative may be those shops disappearing forever. The reality is retail was under immense pressure before this crisis and the combination of lockdown and economic uncertainty means shops are currently trading signicantly lower than a year ago.ldquoWhen combined with the necessary, but onerous, public health and physical distancing measures, many businesses are struggling to make ends meet.ldquoBy getting out to the high street shoppers can help support their favourite brands, but also help those other proximate businesses who rely on stores to bring footfall to town and city centres.ldquoWith the pressure on shops as great as at any time this century, it really is a case of use it or lose it for local businesses right now.Colin Borland, director of devolved nations at the Federation of Small Businesses, said: ldquoNews that two-thirds of Scots are going to make shopping local their priority in our newly-reopened high streets and town centres will be music to the ears of independent traders. Theyrsquove had a long, tough lockdown and public support is going to be more important than ever. Itrsquos great to see that the general public really appreciate the importance of their role in getting us back to business.ldquoThings will be dferent, but itrsquoll just take one trip back to your hairdresser, favourite cafeacute or your local to remind you why you love going there, to remind you of the personal, expert service you can only get from a local small business.Borland added that that customers and employees must be given the confidence they need to get back out there, generate some footfall, and get money moving around again.He added: ldquoThe message has to be clear: by going out for that first pint or haircut in four months, yoursquore doing your bit to get the country back on its feet.ldquoYou canrsquot have strong local communities without strong local economies. And any successful local economy needs a broad range of local small businesses.Borland hopes there is a way to bridge the -point gap between the % who say that itrsquos vital that the general public support their local high street and the % who say they will personally prioritise shopping there.He added: ldquoWe now need to work on those who accept that itrsquos vital that the general public support their local high street, but wonrsquot necessarily do so themselves. They need to feel that itrsquos safe and convenient.ldquoThe future of the high street lies in meeting and surpassing the needs and expectations of todayrsquos consumers ndash just as it did before coronavirus hit."},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeon-calls-snp-unite-ahead-holyrood-election","story":"The First Minster argued that support for an independent Scotland has grown during lockdown as people have watched the Scottish Governments decision making with the powers it has.In an interview withScotland on Sunday to mark her th birthday, Ms Sturgeon said devoting all her attention to dealing with the coronavirus has been \"liberating\" without the usual focus devoted to party politics.:Latest poll finds support for Scottish independence at %\"I have tried - in a way that I have never had to do with other issues - to strip the traditional rules of politics out of my decision-making,\" she said.\"I have not weighed up decisions over coronavirus in terms of: What does this mean for my party  What does it mean for opinion poll ratings  What does it mean for the next election  What does it mean for what the opposition are going to say about me tomorrow or next month  I have tried to do everything with a very straight bat to listen to the expert advice and apply best judgment.\"Ms Sturgeon added: \"I havent at any point during the coronavirus weighed up decisions on the basis of: Does this make independence more or less likely :Clap for Nicola Sturgeon: What is it, when is it and what time are people taking part \"But the Yes movement possibly has something to learn about the fact that - as we have stopped shouting about independence, and shouting to ourselves about how we go about getting independence, and just focused on [dealing with the crisis] - it has allowed people to take a step back and say: Well, actually thats the benefit of autonomous decision-making and also perhaps things would be betterwe had a bit more autonomous decision-making, and to come to their own conclusions.\"Her comments came before the launch of a new party was announced by former SNP MSP Dave Thompson in an attempt to woo pro-independence voters for Holyroods regional \"list\" seats at next years election, arguing that votes for the SNP are wasted under the Scottish Parliaments electoral system.:Former SNP MSP Dave Thompson to quit party to form new party, Alliance for IndependenceHe tweeted that the new Alliance for Independence party would \"ask all small indy parties to stand under our umbrella and unite to achieve Indy\", adding that it would be a \"formidable force\".Ms Sturgeon insisted that she wants the SNP \"united\" ahead of the  election and said: \"History is littered with examples of political parties that start talking to each other as opposed to the public.

He explained: ldquoGeology, geophysics and allied subjects are normally thought to be the pathway into a career in geology and quite a substantial subset of that would go into industry including oil and gas.ldquoGeoscience plays into a much larger, very relevant area too in terms of low-carbon energy transition, and the challenge of meeting the very ambitious net zero emissions targets that are there.ldquoUnfortunately for some people, geology is seen as a sort of old-fashioned subject, and very closely associated with extractive or fossil fuel industries in terms of employment.ldquoThat has definitely created a negative perception, as opposed to thinking about it in terms of understanding the landscape, the skill sets one needs to describe a subsurface, and then to use those skills to best effect for the energy transition plans and to help tackle climate change.Since , the number of people studying geosciences in the UK has fallen by %, and those doing so at Scottish universities has also declined.The number of Scots studying the subject has also likely fallen, according to Underhill, due to the removal of Higher geology from the Scottish curriculum in .He explained: ldquoBack in  there were  students at school doing Higher geology. If we fast-forward to about  there were , then  in ,  in , and then Higher geology stopped in . Itrsquos not part of the national curriculum anymore here in Scotland. ldquoThere are the consequences of that, quite apart from the negative perception around some geosciences being linked to fossil fuels, extraction. The knock-on effect is that in , we had  students come to do geoscience in Scotland.ldquoThat declined to in .The academic also cited figures relating to one leading university, where just  UK students had applied to study masters degrees in petroleum geosciences in , compared to around  UK students four years earlier.He explained: ldquoSome of these courses really need to be repurposed to make themselves relevant to the particular challenge of climate change and net zero emissions. ldquoIf we were to able to do so, but also promote the message across schools and undergraduate degrees as well, wersquoll see more students come through to do those topics.ldquoI think itrsquos essential to teach younger people that the skill set that one learns in doing geoscience and understanding the subsurface is absolutely essentialwersquore going to store carbon safely, or hydrogen, do geothermal, place windfarms in the right place in the North Sea ... It all comes into that mix. ldquoThe same skills and expertise are needed, and it needs to be repurposed towards low carbon. That will be the only way I think we can redress what seems to be an exponential decline in numbers. We have to show that the subject is relevant, and in fact essential.ldquoIf yoursquore going to make something so important to the Scottish economy, in terms of the energy transition, to have that on the curriculum is really important.ldquoUnless you come from the northeast, for example Aberdeen, and have more of a knowledge of the subject, then you might not go in that direction anyway. But even then you may not be able to do so because therersquos no Higher in geology in Scotland. Does that mean that they have to do A-levels where Along with the falling in interest in geology in general, the rise in climate change awareness and activism has also contributed further to the malaise for the subject.In , Greta Thunberg famously began protesting outside the Swedish parliament ndash a move which snowballed into the fight against climate change familiar across the globe.The issue has become particularly relevant for school-age children who have joined protests on school days and taken part in marches all over the country.While the rise in awareness of climate change has been welcomed, the misconceptions about how oil and gas fit into a climate-friendly future have done little to help the sector.Underhill explained: ldquoWersquove got to go out there, be proactive and explain what the career pathway is, and how relevant it is to those young folk today who are concerned, and rightly so, about the environment and climate change.ldquoWe should perhaps also produce more of an educational program so that folk understand where energy comes from, and some of the challenges that are ahead.ldquoThe fact that we were self-sufficient in oil and gas, but that has declined and wersquore reliant on one gas field in Norway, on Russian imports etc.According to a Committee on Climate Change report on Scottish oil and gas in , there could still be a role for the sector by  and beyond.

These MSPs are elected by first past the postsystem, the same voting system which is used in Westminster. Simply put, the MSP with the most votes is elected. in exactly the same way as MPs are elected to Westminster. The constituency vote is sometimes referred to as the electors first vote. However, due to the nature of FPTP not being proportional , a counterbalance is created in the voting system with a more proportional outcome.The Additional Member System , based on the German mixed-member proportionalsystem, is used in Scotland and is signicantly more proportional than FPTP. Such an election system is known as a hybrid electoral system. AMS means that the overall number of MSPs elected for each party is roughly proportional to their electoral support.:Nicola Sturgeon calls on SNP to unite ahead of Holyrood electionWhat is a list vote and how does it work Under the system used in Scotland, voters have two votes. The constituency MSP is elected under the First Past the Post system. The second vote is used to elect  additional members that will complete the political landscape of Holyrood. Scotland is ided into  parliamentary regions and each region elects  regional MSPs. In the second vote the voter votes for a party rather than a candidate. The parties are then allocated a number of additional members to make the overall result more proportional. The regional MSPs are selected from lists compiled by the parties. These MSPs are sometimes referred to as List MSPs.Is AMS proportional AMS is not entirely proportional but doesmore accurate results than a system such as FPTP. In  for example the SNP polled around % of the vote over both ballots but ed % of the MSPs. However, the system was introduced in an attempt to make it more dficult for parties to have an overall majority and to encourage parties working together in coalition or lsquoking-makerrsquo governments.Why is there such interest in the use of the regional vote In , the SNP won  FPTP seats and ed just four list seats, with some arguing that the list vote hindered the party obtaining more seats as they had won the majority of FPTP votes. However, the real catalyst for the discussion around the list vote in the build-up to the  election is due to the creation of pro-independence parties. Many are discussing the idea of voting for the SNP but using their list vote to provide a lsquopro-independence majorityrsquo at Holyrood.While some argue that this would put independence at the heart of Scottish politics, others believe that it could hinder the independence campaigning message. However, in reality, it is not an entirely new idea to try and use the list system to promote a message. At the start of the Scottish Parliament, Labour considered running Co-operative Party candidates on the list to be able to win seats that it did not due to its FPTP success.:Scrap election system demand as .m Scots votes are \"wasted\"What has been said about lsquosplitting votesrsquo The idea of voting for one party at the constituency stage and another party at the additional member stage is sometimes referred to as splitting your voteOn the subject of the breakout of independence parties, the First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in an interview lsquoVote SNP with your first vote, and vote SNP with your regional vote as well,rsquo and I will be pointing to the fact that the one time we did win a majority was when we maximised the constituency and the regional vote.Professor John Curtice said on the prospect of vote splitting: ldquoLook,the polls are right at the moment, you donrsquot need a clever wheeze, yoursquore going to get a whopping majority anyway, so why risk it Dr Thomas Lundberg also said on the matter: ldquoIrsquove read about the interest in lsquogamingrsquo the system, with a new pro-independence party standing only on a regional basis.

The word ldquonationalist correctly describes some of the independence movement and the word ldquounionist does the same for people who want to stay in the UK. The terms are accurate to an extent ndash just not accurate enough.The precise problem with the words was identied by a reader who emailed me last week. ldquoNationalism has negative connotations, he said, ldquofor example xenophobia, and can be, and is often, used as a term of abuse. To want self-government does not necessarily make you a nationalist in this or any other sense hellip equally, it you want to retain the status quo then that is fine ndash but lsquounionismrsquo can now easily be tarred with Union Jack waving sectarian thuggery.I agree with the gist of what he says there. I also agree with his view that the continuing use of the terms unionist and nationalist could contribute to increasing hysteria and prevent people on all sides coming to terms with whatever political changes are in our future. Until , it would never have crossed my mind to call myself a unionist, but one by one we were ided into unionist and nationalist, yes and no, and the problem, as you know, is that once yoursquove stuck labels on to things, theyrsquore pretty hard to peel off.To make matters worse, the word ldquonationalist also applies to some on the No side and has been used that way by some supporters of independence, as in ldquoBritish nationalist or ldquoBrit Nat. The problem with that approach, though, is the same as the problem with ldquoScottish nationalist: there are some on the No side who love the Union Jack as much as some on the Yes side love the saltire, and Northern Irish unionism, football, and religion also play their part, but itrsquos only a part. To label someone who wants to remain in the UK a ldquoBrit Nat is in most cases a grotesque distortion.The fact that ldquoBrit Nathas gained some traction anyway is itself a reflection of the central problem: British nationalism is a slur because ldquonational, ldquonationalism or ldquonat have negative connotations. Nicola Sturgeon herself acknowledged this in  when she said that,she could turn back the clock and choose her partyrsquos name again, she wouldnrsquot choose the name it has now: she knows the N of ldquonational is reductive and negative, but there it is anyway, nestling between the S and the P.The question is: are there any realistic alternatives and,so, could they catch on  The reader I spoke to last week suggested the phrases ldquothose who want self-government and ldquothose who want to retain the union, or ldquoself-government supporters and ldquounion supporters. He said using such phrases instead of nationalist and unionist would moderate the debate and stop us becoming further polarised.But would they really  As a colleague pointed out to me, the first problem with ldquothose who want self-government and ldquothose who want to retain the union is that they are really hard to fit into a headline. Secondly, therersquos a dodgy implication in the words ldquothose who want self-government that those on the No side do not want self-government in fact, they want self-government in a dferent form. And thirdly, ldquoretain the union suggests unionists want to keep things as they are, whereas, in fact, unionism covers everything from unitarists to federalists who want further reform and change.You can see the problem, canrsquot you  Wersquove got to the point now where all the words that have been used in the debate ndash union, independence, nationalism, even Yes and No ndash have been wielded as an insult at some point which means that trying a new, less controversial combination runs into trouble pretty quickly. The words and phrases we favour also reflect, possibly unconsciously, a desire to make our side look good and the other side less good our words are loaded with our preferences and prejudices.Having said that, I would still like to propose a couple of alternatives. For example, instead of ldquonationalist, how about ldquosecessionist  I did wonder about ldquoseparatist for a while, but I guess the argument there is that the SNP wants self-government whereas separatist suggests something more drastic. Secessionist is also not entirely free of baggage ndash some will think of the American Civil War ndash but as an option, itrsquos not at all bad is it As for ldquounionist, I agree with the former Scottish secretary Michael Moore who said the word serves no purpose other than for those who wish to see no further devolutionand those who favour independence and use it in the pejorative. So how about ldquodevolutionist instead  That was the preferred option of the former Welsh first minister Rhodri Morgan, who said he was neither nationalist nor unionist but a passionate devolutionist who believed the constitution was healthier for having devolution since .I realise both terms ndash secessionist and devolutionist ndash are not perfect devolutionist, in particular, doesnrsquot reflect the fact there are some on the No side, as Michael Moore pointed out, who donrsquot like devolution at all. Irsquom also unsure how Yes supporters feel about the word secessionist. Theyrsquoll probably tell me.And anyway, maybe your response to all of this is: why not stick to ldquoYes supporter and ldquoNo supporter  But even ldquoyes and ldquono are problematic ndash indeed, the SNPrsquos use of ldquoyes probably gave it an unfair advantage in  and still does. Itrsquos also a demonstration of how tricky and touchy this area of politics has become. Ordinary words have become enemies, and weapons, and yet here we are, still using them because we donrsquot have much choice. We need something . We need alternatives.

These arrangements include the use of screens, distance markers and signage, the provision of hand sanitizer instore and capacity limits.It comes at a time when the need to safely and responsibly support town centres has never been greater following the disruption caused by the Covid- pandemic.Read more: Scotlands museums are reopening so whats on whereCommunities Secretary Aileen Campbell MSP said: ldquoIt is now more vitally important than ever to consider shopping, eating and drinking locally as we all have a role to play in Scotlandrsquos economic recovery.

Cardinal Health, the mask manufacturers, confirmed that they had not distributed the masks since  and a subsidiary, Medline, had taken over their handling thereafter.Anas Sarwar, Labour MSP for Glasgow, previously questioned the expired masks with Jeane Freeman at Holyrood.He said: ldquoDoctors have been sent in to battle with unsafe equipment and itrsquos scandalous that health workers were put at risk like that. Ministers must urgently step in, stop the spin, and get our hero workers the resources they need.ldquoThe Scottish Government needs to start listening to the evidence nures and other from health workers. I have raised this twice, and was assured the situation had been resolved. That clearly wasnrsquot the case and doctors were right to raise concerns.Miles Briggs MSP, Scottish Conservatives health spokesman said the incident was ldquoshambolic and added: ldquoDespite a number of assurances given to me and other MSPs by Nicola Sturgeon and Jeane Freeman that these masks were safe ,we now find out that they are disintegrating and are a health hazard.ldquoItrsquos time for full transparency. I have been calling for a proper investigation into SNP ministersrsquo handling of the pandemic and this latest scandal must be fully investigated. Our NHS professionals have gone above and beyond during this pandemic. The very least they should have expected is for ministers to protect them and make sure PPE was safe.Health Secretary Jeane Freeman was asked about the masks originally in March, and told MSPs: ldquoThe supplies that have been issued to GPs have been issued according to Health Protection Scotland guidance in terms of the nature of those supplies the masks, the goggles, aprons and so on.When asked specically about the out of date masks on March , Ms Freeman said: ldquoWe are aware of the particular circumstance... We are taking steps with the health boards to ensure resupply and that the situation is not repeated.ldquoGPs have been contacted so that they know that that is under way and so that they can be reassured.ldquoAs I said, my requirement is that all our general practices receive the supplies that they need, and that those supplies are fit for purpose.It is understood medics were advised the masks were fit for purpose at the time, and only discovered the advice had changed when they received an email on June  telling them to ldquoquarantine and dispose of the masks.In one email sent to GPs in one Scottish health board, it said: ldquoWe have been informed that masks were issued from UK stock in January , through to early April ...and were included in some deliveries to GP practices.ldquoCan all GP practices quarantine and dispose of these locallythey have any remaining stock.An alert issued by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency on June  stated: ldquoThere is a risk to staff wearing the maskthe foam strip on the mask flakes and enters their airway or mouth.

There are plenty of places to go and things to do to suit every budget. Here is our guide to the numerous great days out in across our region.WITH BEER gardens entering their second week of opening in Scotland and the five-mile restriction on non-essential travel lted, the country has begun to look forward to a summer of fun.While social distancing measures are still in place and it is important not to take undue risks, there are plenty of things to do safely.Zoos and animal parks around Scotland re-opened on June , and now that the five-mile restriction has eased they canwelcome visitors from near and far. Edinburgh Zoo, Five Sisters Zoo in West Lothian, Blair Drummond Safari Park in Stirling and the Highland Wildle Park in the Cairngorms National Park have all reopened, with customers asked to book in advance. Fe Zoo suffered a devastating fire just days after reopening after the Covid- lockdown, but no animals were harmed and owners have said they hope toto normality as soon as possible thanks to support and fundraising from the local community.Stately homes and gardens have also reopened, with several National Trust for Scotland properties now open to visitors.These include Culzean Castle and Country Park in Ayrshire, Threave Garden in Dumfries and Galloway, Brodie Castle’s garden and grounds, Arduaine Garden in Argyll and Crathes Castle’s garden and estate in Aberdeenshire. Historic Environment Scotland has said that it will monitor the situation and reopen properties in due course.Unstaffed outdoor sites are already open, so visitors can enjoy walks around Edinburgh’s Holyrood Park and West Lothian’s Linlithgow Peel among others.Walkers and climbers are now welcome to visit the country’s national parks to enjoy some outdoor exercise. Guidelines remain to avoid touching surfaces or opening gates where possible, to follow signs and avoid coming into contact with farm workers where applicable, and to keep dogs on leads and avoid areas known to be busy. Pubs and restaurants without door space have also been allowed to reopen. Glasgow’s The Cranside Kitchen, near the Rotunda, has claimed to be the country’s largest beer garden, with a free-to-enter area seating more than  guests with social distancing measures in place.The beer garden offers a range of drinks alongside food from five popular Glasgow restaurants, Rioja, Halloumi, Pickled Ginger, Kilmurry  Co and La Rotunda. In Edinburgh the Corn Exchange has billed itself as the largest beer garden in the city, having transformed the car park into a space where people can enjoy drinks as well as play darts, ping-pong, swing ball and watch sport, all while observing the necessary hygiene routines. With hundreds of smaller beer gardens open around the country – including Dundee’s The Kilted Kangaroo and Aberdeen’s Siberia Bar and Hotel – there is no shortage of options for enjoying this summer safely and enjoying good times in Scotland.Five Sisters Zoo in West Lothian opened up to the public on June , with a number of new measures in place to help prevent the spread of the virus. These include mandatory advance booking to avoid crowding and queues, a oneway system around the zoo, hand-washing stations and the cancellation of any activities which involve the public touching or feeding the animals. The soft play area and restaurant are also closed, but food kiosks are still open.Keeper talks have been cancelled, but several videos of the talks have been made available online.The zoo is currently opening at about one third of capacity to ensure space for social distancing, and owners say they will monitor the situation and review measures in place after the first couple of weeks. “It’s been good so far, the feedback we’ve had has been really positive,” said assistant manager Gary Curran. “The past few months have been quite dficult financially, so it was a relief to be able to open safely.” He added: “We’re looking forward to the rest of the summer and hopefully some more good weather! “People really enjoy it here and they’re having a good time so far.”Summer is here and our colourful countryside, breathtaking beaches and glorious gardens beckon. Many attractions are reopening, but have restricted visitor numbers and prebooked time slots, so the UK Government recommends looking at the official websites for attractions and organisations you plan to visit before you travel, so that you’re in the know before you go. To make your days out as enjoyable as possible, we encourage you to plan your trip in advance and to check all of the important facilities and attractions, while looking after our great outdoors.To ensure we’re all doing our bit to travel responsibly, here are a few simple steps to help make planning easy. When planning your trip, check that important facilities – like toilets and car parks – are open before you travel so you’re not caught short. If you have an attraction in mind, please check online to seeyou need to pre-book a time slot.Some places may be extremely popular, so get off the beaten track and discover a hidden gem that you can brag to friends about. Keep two metres apart from anyone outside your household where you can. This applies to walking, running, cycling, sitting and sunbathing too. Wear a face covering at all times when on public transport like buses, trains, taxis and minicabs.Make sure you have a bank card because many outlets are currently only accepting cashless payments and you don’t want to miss out on that ice cream.And take hand sanitiser with you – you don’t know where will be open for you to wash your hands.Leave the car behind where possible and visit attractions by walking or cycling.Please remember that England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have dferent guidelines, advice and timescales for re opening tourism.To help you enjoy summer safely, please check the respective official sources for information prior to travelling by using the website visitbritain gb en knowbefore-you-goWith many of our favourite attractions now beginning to reopen their doors, Scottish tourism bosses have teamed up with Tourism Northern Ireland, VisitEngland and VisitWales to come up with a way for people to check whether they are “good to go”. The We’re Good To Go initiative was developed jointly by the four UK Visitor agencies. The UK-wide industry standard and consumer mark will provide a “ring of confidence” for visitors as the tourism sector works towards reopening.The We’re Good To Go mark means businesses can demonstrate that they are adhering to the respective Government and public health guidance, have carried out a COVID- risk assessment and checked that they have the required processes in place, ensuring they can welcome visitors back with confidence. The scheme is free to join.UK Government tourism minister Nigel Huddleston said: “I want to encourage the public to experience a great holiday this summer and be confident that they can do so safely.“This new industry standard will show people that tourism businesses, destinations and attractions are adhering to the guidance. “It puts safety first and is an important move in getting this industry back up and running.”VisitScotland chief executive Malcolm Roughead, said: “We are pleased that after a very dficult few months Scotland’s tourism industry are starting to welcome visitors.“However, it’s important to remember that things may be a little dferent now, there may be reduced facilities available orbusy, a greater need to follow physical distancing restrictions to protect yourself and others. “Planning and researching will also become an important part of the holiday experience and we really want visitors to ‘know before they go’ when it comes to travel checking what is open and pre-bookingrequired.”To obtain the mark businesses must complete a self-assessment through the online  https:goodtogo.visitbritain your-business-good-to-go-scotland including a check-list confirming they have put the necessary processes in place, before receiving certication and the We’re Good To Go mark for display in their premises and online.

Mr W. C. Howard, manager of Argo’s, suggested it at the first meeting of the Stromness and West Mainland Chamber of Commerce, in late June .The best time for it was the third week in July, to coincide with the Kirkwall monthly holiday and the Stromness Regatta, so it was opened by Provost George Robertson on July .Other than during the war, Stromness has always had to work hard to attract business. Provost Robertson said in his opening speech that the aim was “to keep Stromness very definitely on the shopping map” and he told an old Stromness story: “Said a business man to his neighbour, ‘How’s business the day, William ’ ‘Oh,’ replied he, ‘canna compleen, canna compleen – selt a Christian Herald, changed a penny and shawn a man whar the auld kirk is.#”The week was a resounding success. All the shops decorated their windows and offered prizes and discounts. About  flags filled the street, as everyone hung out what they could find. Merriman’s electrical shop, then half-way up Porteous Brae, hooked up loudspeakers to provide music for the passers-by.Even at such short notice, Stromness managed to get the “showies” to ert to the town. There was an amusement arcade in the Transit Shed, at the top of the North Pier, and the side-shows at the Market Green even included chairoplanes.The mystery bus tour was on Tuesday. Provost Robertson had suggested that the tour might take its passengers to “parts of the mainland you have never seen since you were last carted there to a Sunday School picnic ,  or  years ago”. He urged his audience to book but, of course, this didn’t happen and only one bus was laid on. Another five had to be hurriedly brought from Wishart’s Garage.On Wednesday there were sporting competitions at Ness, which culminated in a five-a-side hockey tournament. The men’s final, won by Dounby, was described in the Orkney Herald as being played “with a speed reminiscent of ice-hockey and an enthusiasm to win that might have been more appropriate on the battlefield”.The week also held the Stromness Regatta, a Swimming Gala, a Football Tournament, the County Sheepdog Trials and a Bring and Buy Sale in the North Kirk that raised £.The week ended, as it always has, with a fancy-dress parade. The -yard long procession was led by the Kirkwall City Pipe Band and followed by hundreds of excited spectators.  spectators lined the Market Green for the judging and presentation of prizes.In , the main attraction was the Wick Girls Pipe Band but there was plenty of home- grown entertainment. Nannie Gowans organised a concert by the youth of the town in the Town Hall. When her brother Johnnie was appointed Shopping Week organiser a few years later she ably assisted him. They are still remembered in Stromness for developing a bigger programme of events and bringing in big attractions, such as tightrope walkers, motorcycle display teams and the Globe of Death.There had not been enough time to organise the suggested art exhibition for the first Shopping Week but it was there in , organised by Stanley Cursiter, in the building now occupied by the Ell  Co Café.The Swimming Gala in the harbour included a water-polo match, “…in which it was dficult to know who was playing who” and a display of water-skiing but the big event was the March of Time cavalcade organised by the Young Farmers at the Market Green, showing how farming had developed over the centuries.“First of all came cultivation, beginning with the man with the spade and pick… We saw the genuine old wooden plough of our great-grandfathers…. The lovely and lovable Clydesdales drawing the long-boarded plough and the  tractor carrying its two-furrow at the tail and jogging along with a jaunty air.Sowing, harvesting, threshing and the farmhouse kitchen went through similar progressions, all with a commentary by JGS Flett from Harray. The final scene was the farmer in his feather bed “where he rests amid all possible blessings of State and personal luxury and indulgence.”The week ended with the parade, open air dancing and the first Shopping Week fireworks: a -minute display from the Inner Holm.Patricia Long is a tourist guide based in Stenness with a particular interest in social history.

The public are being encouraged to protect public health and our precious environment.The new Scottish Outdoor Access Code advice includes reminders to:Francesca Osowska, chief executive of Scottish Natural Heritage, said: “We very much want this love affair with Scotland’s great outdoors and nature to continue. But let’s not spoil it for others. We need be kind to nature and respectful to each other by clearing up after ourselves and taking all of our litter home with us. The scenes of abandoned campsites, burned out trees, human waste, as well as litter, are totally unacceptable and a blight on Scotland’s reputation.”Around half of the people surveyed said that they expect to take more visits to the outdoors after lockdown than before the crisis. It is also expected that many will replace cancelled trips abroad with holidays in Scotland this year, so you may arrive somewhere to find it busier than expected. The advice from Scottish Government is to have a back-up plan, andthis happens to you, move on and find somewhere quieter and safer.All of the latest COVID- guidance can be found on the Scottish Outdoor Access Code website. The website includes information about our rights and responsibilities when outdoors, as well as specic guides for a range of activities, from air and water sports, to hillwalking and wild camping.Francesca added: “If we all follow Scottish Government advice and the Scottish Outdoor Access code, we will be doing our bit to ensure that Scotland’s outdoors remains beautul and that COVID- restrictions can continue to be relaxed.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The next census had been due to take place in .Scottish secretary for economy, fair Work and culture, Fiona Hyslop, said: #COVID- is the biggest single public health challenge facing us in more than  years and as in many other areas of le, the ongoing disruption is impacting on the vital preparations for the census.“Following careful consideration and on recommendation of National Records of Scotland , ministers have informed the Scottish Parliament of their intention to move Scotland’s Census date to March . This reflects the unprecedented impact which COVID- is having across a wide range of sectors.“We recognise Scotland’s Census remains more relevant than ever in the current climate, as it allows important planning decisions to be made informed by the make-up of Scotland’s population.“This decision was not taken lightly. However the quality of the census data must remain robust, and by moving to  National Records of Scotland can continue to deliver a census which ensures the highest possible response rate from people across Scotland, to allow government, local authorities and key services plan for every element of public le, from building homes to NHS support.“NRS will continue to work closely with stakeholders and partners to ensure that appropriate data is available to support work that was expecting to make use of Census  data, particularly for key funding allocations and policy decisions.”Paul Lowe, registrar general and chief executive of NRS, added: “The priority and responsibility of NRS is to put in place a census that enables everyone across Scotland to participate, so that information collected can be used to produce the analyses and deliver the benefits required by the people of Scotland.“The census is a unique count of every household in Scotland and in the next census, for the first time, the majority of people will be encouraged to complete their questionnaire online. This will require a signicant field force and face-to-face engagement in an effort to support digital participation, engage with the public and raise awareness of census across the population.“The census is a major logistical operation and the twelve months running up to a census are vital in planning and testing the effectiveness and security of systems and processes. COVID- restrictions have delayed or prevented many of these key activities, including engagement with key organisations, from taking place over recent months.“This is the right decision for Scotland which will allow us to undertake a high quality and safe census in  that will produce the rich data we need for many years to come.

If they do not apply for a registration or stop activities, SEPA will take enforcement action which could see them subjected to fines or criminal prosecution.There is also an important role for the public, with a warning that the use of unlicensed waste collectors could result in waste contributing to fly-tipping and other illegal activity.“Don’t engage the services of people who are not authorised,” Ms Shearer explained.“Remember, services that sound too good to be true often are, and could lead to your waste being illegally fly-tipped or disposed of by other illegitimate means.“Anyone offering to take your waste away should be able to provide a waste carrier registration number and tell you the named facility they will take the waste to –they can’t provide this information, don’t allow them to take your waste.“Now more than ever, Scots are recognising the importance of local services like recycling and the part we all play in correctly managing our waste. You have the responsibility to take care of your waste andwe trace it back to you we can take enforcement action against you too. We don’t want people to be put in that situation so make sure that anyone who takes your waste for disposal is properly accredited.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

But it is a start, and for many youngsters stuck at home for months it will represent another big step towards normality.The lack of social interaction has been one of the big psychological burdens enforced by Covid-.As we continue to move through the lockdown route map, let#s hope that when sports like shinty do eventuallythey are embraced with gusto by players – and their communities – as never before.Research, commissioned by Skye Connect and carried out by Glasgow Caledonian University, revealed that in the year before Covid- visitors to Skye brought £ million to the economy, and helped support , jobs.But Professor John Lennon, Director of the Moffat Centre for Travel and Tourism and the lead author of the report, also had a warning.“Skye is highly vulnerable to the downturn in international visitors that will continue for much of  and beyond,” he said.“Restrictions on access and reduction in air connectivity will impact on visitation.“The island does benefit from direct road access which will hopefully help catalyse greater domestic visitation – which is likely to characterise visitation for the remainder of the year.”In short Skye, and by extension the wider west Highlands, needs tourists and the region’s economy would collapse without them.But as many former industrialised parts of the country would confirm – over-reliance on a single sector can also carry signicant risk.In future years this area will need alternatives.We might also need to question the type of tourism which has come to characterise the region, and ask whether all the benefits are being as widely shared as they could be.To use one obvious example, many of those heading north and west in the weeks ahead will be coming to stay in houses – perhaps rented at upwards of £ a week – that are owned by people who live hundreds of miles away.Meanwhile, small hotels, guest houses and BBs – which provide local employment – are considering closing their doors as they find the burden of Covid-related regulations simply too onerous to make their business viable for the year ahead.If, as seems likely, Covid- accelerates an existing trend for visitors to seek self catering, rather than serviced accommodation, then the question of who benefits is worth scrutiny.A chalet on the bottom of the croft, put in to supplement modest family income, means money flows into the local economy.Houses hoovered up by letting companies, or let for  weeks of the year by someone who might visit for the other two, results in money flowing out, while the availablity and affordability of housing is limited further.In the most dficult of years all those involved in the local tourist trade deserve good wishes for the weeks and months ahead.But let’s hope there are lessons to be heeded for the future.As SkyeConnect’s project manager, Alistair Danter said this week: “We need to reset and reshape tourism for the new world and encourage a more sustainable approach that provides visitors with an immersive experience while ensuring that the island and its communities see the benefits of a tourism economy.”The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until th July .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/EARIE-QUIRAING-5.jpg","title":"litir do luchd ionnsachaidh","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine publishes the text for Ruairidh‘s “Letter to Gaelic Learners” on BBC Radio nan Gàidheal .

Bha athair, air an robh Raibeart mar ainm cuideachd, na mhaighstir-sgoile anns a’ Cheannmhor aig ceann an ear Loch Tatha. An dèidh dha sgoil athar fhàgail, chaidh Raibeart don oilthigh, an toiseach ann an Dùn Èideann, agus an uair sin ann an Cill Rìmhinn. Thàinig e a-mach mar sgoilear air leth de Sheann Ghreugais agus Laidinn.Bha Armstrong a-nise deiseil airson a bhith na mhinistear, agus chaidh e cho fada ʼs gun do dh’fhoillsich e dà shearmon. Ge-tà, an àite a bhith a’ cur a-staigh airson a bhith na mhinistear paraiste, dh’fhalbh e a Lunnainn. Bha e airson sgoil a chur air dòigh, anns am biodh e ag oideachadh mic dhaoin-uaisle.Fhad ʼs a bha Raibeart ann an Lunnainn, chuala e gun robh Comunn Gàidhealach na h-Alba – The Highland Society of Scotland – am beachd faclair Gàidhlig a chur ri chèile. Bha iad air triùir sgoilearan fhastadh airson na h-obrach. Uill, bha ar laoch, Raibeart, dhen bheachd gun dèanadh esan faclair a cheart cho math, agus a cheart cho luath, riutha.Bha e trang leis an obair làitheil aige, agus cha robh cus ùine aige airson faclair a chur ri chèile. Ach, a dh’aindeoin sin, rinn e adhartas math. Ge-tà, nuair a bha e air a dhol cho fada ris an litir ‘M’, chaidh togalach an fhoillsicheir a losgadh gu làr. B’ fheudar do Raibeart an obair aige a thòiseachadh às ùr.Bha e gu math dìcheallach, agus chaidh am faclair aige fhoillseachadh ann an ochd ceud deug, fichead ʼs a còig . Agus ciamar a bha dol don triùir sgoilearan aig Comunn Gàidhealach na h-Alba  Obh obh … bha trì bliadhna eile gu bhith ann mus nochdadh am faclair acasan!Bha fèill air faclair Armstrong, a rèir choltais. Bha e gu math mòr. Bha còrr is mìle duilleag ann. Bha caibideil ann mu ghràmar na Gàidhlig. Agus b’ e a’ chiad fhaclair Gàidhlig a thug sùil air bunachas fhaclan.Sgrìobh an Literary Gazette gum bu chòir don a h-uile cànanaiche anns an Roinn Eòrpa lethbhreac fhaighinn, oir bha Armstrong air a shùil a thoirt air seachdad cànan, agus mar sin gun robh an obair aige airidh air moladh mòr. Sgrìobh an Athenaeum gun robh e na b’ fheàrr na faclair sam bith eile a bhuineadh do na cànanan Ceilteach.

The Eco-Schools Programme is the world’s largest Environmental Education programme and aims to make environmental awareness and action an intrinsic part of the le and ethos of a school. Its participatory approach and combination of learning and action makes it an ideal way for schools to begin improving the environments of schools and their local communities. Eco-Schools work through a simple seven-step process resulting in the programme becoming central to the schools ethos. Schools can choose from ten eco-topics ranging from litter and waste to energy, bioersity and transport to name a few. Eco-Schools work towards achieving awards - bronze, silver and the prestigious Green Flag.The internationally recognised Green Flag is this highest award given to Eco-Schools and symbolises excellence in the field of environmental activity. Over the past two years, pupils of Buick Memorial have been working hard on many initiatives in order to address their chosen topics of Waste, Litter and Bioersity. Together with Eco Coordinators Mrs Carleton and Miss Stirling, they have produced policies on printing, recycling and litter for staff and pupils within the school to follow. Their continued commitment to regular Cash for Clobber collections enabled the school to purchase a number of new bins for the playground. Thanks to Catherine Hunter, Mid and East Antrim Education Officer, the children were able to give each class a bin for food waste, allowing the Eco Club to produce compost for their many planting activities. A highlight of the Eco-School endeavours is the annual litter-pick with Cullybackey Community Partnership and thanks must be given in particular to Margaret Murphy who is always keen to help the children in any way she can. The school is extremely grateful to Cranswick Country Foods for providing a superb wooden structure for the ‘plastic bottle greenhouse’ project and to Barry Tapster, Mid and East Antrim Recycling Officer, for his guidance. This year has been exceptionally busy, with the introduction of a termly ‘Walking Week’ which the pupils and parents have strongly supported. The Eco Club have spent a lot of time tending to the school pond area building mini-beast and frog hotels, making bird feeders and planting flowers for pollinators amongst many other tasks. None of these opportunities would have run as smoothly were it not for the unwavering input from Mr Fleckand the dedication of Ms Harkin . The positive attitude and increased awareness of environmental issues is evident within the school from Nursery through to P and this Green Flag is a welcome acknowledgement of the children’s efforts.The International Eco-Schools Programme is operated in Northern Ireland by Keep Northern Ireland Beautul and is a free to enter programme.

The gradual easing of restrictions will hopefully ensure that our ious activities can continue to take place.“As District Chair, I have chosen Special Olympics as my Charity for this year and I look forward to engaging with all of our Clubs in supporting this particular group – as well, of course, as the myriad of local charities which our members support over the years. I look forward to working closely with our friends across the Rotary family. I am also indebted to the members of my local Club for all of their encouragement and support.” Patricia took up her new role on  July and will continue for  months.

This, along with other key public health measures, such as social distancing and ensuring good hand and respiratory hygiene, will help us to reduce community transmission of Covid-.“For Test, Trace and Protect to work, everyone in Northern Ireland must prepare for the possibility of having to self-isolate and be tested to help protect ourselves, our families and our communities.”The Minister added: “This is likely to become part of everyday le for the foreseeable future until an effective vaccine for Covid- is developed and a vaccination programme delivered.”Olive MacLeod, Interim Chief Executive of the Public Health Agency, said: “The initial pilot phase of Covid- contact tracing began in Northern Ireland on  April and as of  May we have been tracing all positive cases. Northern Ireland was the first part of the UK to have this service established and operational. “Our contact tracing team is made up of trained staff who contact the person who has tested positive identy those people with whom they have had close contact and could be at risk of developing Covid- and in turn contact them to advise them on the appropriate next steps.”Mrs MacLeod concluded: “By this stage most people will be aware of Covid- symptoms which are a high temperature a new, continuous cough or a new loss of or change in sense of smell or taste.

This is precisely why hymns have been banned at church services.And so, the number of diagnosed cases is now beginning to rise again - as of Friday, there were  more confirmed cases in Northern Ireland, with  people testing positive for the virus in the Causeway Coast and Glens area over the past seven days.It is clear that Limavady and the surrounding areas are now at the centre of Covid- spike, the full effects of which cannot yet be predicted.It#s certainly a matter of consternation for people living in the area who are regarded as extremely vulnerable to the virus, coming just weeks before shielding is paused.Experts have conceded that it isn#t always possible to track everyone down and so we must be prepared for the possibility that the number of positive cases may continue to rise in the coming days - even beyond Limavady itselfIt is also fair to surmise that the virus may have travelled over the mountain towards Coleraine, Portrush and potentially beyond. This will, of course, have implications given the fact the North Coast is a popular day trip destination for people from all over.Health officials are currently undertaking a trace, test and isolate programme to try and halt the spread of Covid-, but the system itself has limitations.Experts have conceded that it isn#t always possible to track everyone down and so we must be prepared for the possibility that the number of positive cases may continue to rise in the coming days - even beyond Limavady itself.And with an increase in cases, there is a growing likelihood that more people will require hospital treatment.Of course, we don#t know the ages and medical history of all of those who have been infected, but it isn#t too far a leap to say that someone may even lose their le.It is a sobering thought, but it is the tragic reality now that Covid- is endemic in the community.Looking back, the Health Minister and Chief Medical Officer have warned that complacency cannot be allowed to set in and commenting on the Limavady cluster on Thursday, Robin Swann said he was not surprised by the outbreak.Health officials have said repeatedly that this would happen as social distancing measures were relaxed and on Friday, Dr Tom Black, chair of the British Medical Association#s NI Council, said we will continue to see similar outbreaks in the coming months.However, the future is very much in our hands it is our responsibility to keep each other safe.There are so many measures we can adopt to stop the spread of the virus.Frequent handwashing, maintaining an appropriate distance from others, and wearing a face covering in an enclosed space - they will all go some way to slow the spread of Covid-.No one wants toto the full lockdown that was put in place in March butwe can#t bring clusters like these under control, then that is what we are heading forThe cluster in Limavady is a warning shot and it is welcome that some local organisations are taking it seriously, with  Derry GAA clubs suspending activity as a precautionary measure.There has even been talk of a local lockdown, and it is a very real possibilitythe number of cases diagnosed in the area continues on the same trajectory.No one wants toto the full lockdown that was put in place in March butwe can#t bring clusters like these under control, then that is what we are heading for.Doctors and scientists have warned that this is a potentially more dangerous period than during the original outbreak.There is no doubt that complacency has set in, there is a certain fatigue with social distancing.The fact that we haven#t experienced the predicted thousands of fatalities has to some extent contributed to this.However, the cluster in Limavady should act as a reminder that Covid- is as dangerous and as insidious as ever.

On that occasion,  out of  constituencies voted to remain in the European Union and the only way that can happen now is through an all-Ireland structure.I am one of the people who was involved in the Good Friday Agreement and I#m totally committed to it but at the moment, there is a failure by both governments to ensure that it has been fully implemented.There is a sense of frustration from a republican and nationalist point of view that they put faith put in the Good Friday Agreement  years ago and it still hasn#t been delivered.It#s very clear that Northern Ireland is being left behind by Fianna Fail who claim to be a republican party.However, the DUP#s Gordon Lyons has rejected the suggestion that it is the correct time for a referendum on a united Ireland.The East Antrim MLA said a border boll would be isive and would take Northern Ireland backwards.He continued: Our focus needs to be on moving forward, getting out of the pandemic and protecting lives and livelihoods rather than spending time chasing a border poll that would be detrimental to stability and recovery.Being part of the UK is hugely beneficial to everyone in Northern Ireland and that has been especially apparent during this pandemic.Whether it was our NHS saving lives or the job retention scheme or other economic measures saving livelihoods, being part of the UK was critical for Northern Ireland.During his visit to Belfast, Mr Martin met the First and Deputy First Ministers, Arlene Foster and Michelle O#Neill, and Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis.January#s #New Decade, New Approach# deal pledged to turbo-charge connections between Dublin and Belfast and Mr Martin said he would work towards getting the over the line.

But that doesn#t suit some people.I don#t know whether it#s because they see you on the TV, or see you in a newspaper and think you#re getting paid for it.Butthey saw the car I drive, the house that I live in, and the lestyle I lead, they#d know I#m not rolling in millions!Mrs Ervine, sister-in-law of the late PUP leader David Ervine, said there are a tiny amount of people who make it their business to shout out untruths and lies - but I just wanted to call them out on it. I haven#t anything to hide. So I#ve no reason to ignore it.One time someone accused me of doing a line with someone in Sinn Fein. My husband said, #Where would you get the time #The abuse is just a way of dismissing your work. It#s a way of dismissing you.And because they don#t have anything real to attack me on, they have to make up lies.But she said: I#m not going to let any of that put me off. I#m going to keep doing what I#m doing.According to Linda, the ugly trolling has had positive outcomes that her detractors could never have imagined.From I started in this job, the lovely thing I#ve found is that for the one nasty thing that happens a hundred good things will happen, she said. And that#s what strengthens you and keeps you going. Friends phone me. I get private messages of support, and online there are thousands of well-wishers.Among them is Ann Travers, whose sister Mary was murdered by the IRA as she left Mass.Linda Ervine is lovely, she tweeted. The abuse she receives because she is an advocate for learning the Irish language is ridiculous. Knowing Irish doesn#t mean you are any less a unionist andyou are, so what  Linda is gentle and kind. She isn#t forcing anybody to do anything.Askedshe had a message for the trolls, Linda replied: What you meant for evil, the Lord turns for good.Ruth Dudley Edwards, Page Belfast Most ReadBloody legacy of ruthless INLA hitman Frankie #Studs# LaniganCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Further nine cases of Covid- Barrister admits child sex abuse photo and video charges#Bookmaker Niall Sheerin#s DNA found on Lyra McKee gun##Mum#s cancer battle spurred me into action# - How Co Down super slimmer Phil Kayes lost st and found true love,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It will continue feeling warm in the sun with highs of C.Wednesday looks to be the disappointment of the week, with Met Office meteorologist Alex Burkhill explaining that things are set to go downhill before ato the sunshine.It is the associated fronts of the low-pressure system that will bring the rain as we go through the middle of the week, he said.

Parish priest Fr Eamon Graham was delighted to see the community coming together. “Weve just come to end of a very extraordinary week in our parish and community,” he said. “Ive certainly been overwhelmed - I think we all have - by the level of generosity, but I think something even more important was that so many aspects of our community pulled together. googletag.cmd.push “You know, we enjoyed it, enjoyed it very much.

Termoneeny Cycling Club members each cycled km, while the Erin’s Own camogie players each clocked up at least km. -year-old Harry Boyle’s remarkable contribution saw him cycling around all the townlands in the parish, while Fr Graham and his parochial team got involved by running in their Lavey gear. The challenge was not just limited to Lavey, though, and their diaspora throughout the world got involved via social media, sharing photos of them completing their contribution. The club have raised almost pound, to date and donations can still be made via the Lavey Parish Just Giving page.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Artists and the entertainment industry as a whole have come under immense pressure since the crisis forced the closure of business and mass cancellation of events in . Derry is a city with a deep-rooted musical heritage and over recent years a superfluity of talent has emerged, each of them dferent, but making their own mark in the industry. Amongst the current crop, you’ve got young established singer-songwriter SOAK, alternative pop artist ROE, the ambient soundscapes of Elma Orkestra, three-piece punk rockers TOUTS, indie folksters Reevah and PORTS, fuzzed up alt-rockers Waldorf  Canon and all female pop-rock courtesy of CHERYM. googletag.cmd.push Then there’s the masterful Our Krypton Son, rockers Wood Burning Savages and resurgent local legends Red Organ Serpent Sound - whose gigs were once described by Eamonn McCann as ‘low instinct, high art and so sexy’ they are ‘reserved sins in certain dioceses’. Unfortunately, those musicians have been unable to entertain audiences since March, except via Zoom, which is no substitute for the interactive and much more personal live experience. For musicians, performing is their leblood, it is not only what they love to do but live shows are the most dependable source of income. Leading artists in the country recently wrote a letter to the Department for Communitiesin a plea to provide urgent financial support to save the local music industry. googletag.cmd.push It is not only the musicians but the likes of producers, sound engineers, stage crew, management, live venue staff, photographers and freelance workers in the industry who are struggling. ‘STALLED’ Speaking to the Derry News, PORTS bass player and vocalist, Steven McCool, shared the dficulties experienced during lockdown but also about the welcome prospect of festivals and gigs on the horizon as restrictions have eased. He said: “At the start of the year we had begun working on a release schedule for our first new release in four years. “This includes, making music videos, touring etc. We had been finishing the last few songs of our next album. Then came the pandemic. “All our plans were stalled. We couldnt releasewe couldnt tour. We couldnt get together to finish the album or music videos. “We play live to build up the finances to release new music so that was another wall for us. “As things have started to open up, we have been able to roll out a bit of a schedule again and with Stendhal Festival going ahead, we can use that to coincide with a release. “Hopefully now as things start to open up we can get back on-board and out playing again.”  Hannah Richardson vocalist and guitarist in CHERYMechoed Steven’s view saying it’s ‘definitely been a dficult’ time for musicians. “With no furlough, no other source of income and a lot of uncertainty surrounding when it’s safe for us to get back to work,” she explained. A grant from Help Musicians NI at the start of lockdown her going for a while, Hannah said. “Spoty and the Arts Council have also been trying to issue grants to musicians which is extremely helpful but nothing compared to what we would be bringing inwe were allowed to work, especially now around festival season. “I just hope the live music scene is able to sustain itself once we see the other side of this and hope people continue to support local musicians and music venues so we can get back as quickly and safely to doing the thing we love most,” she added. Aoe Boyle, known by her stage name Reevah , had been planning to embark on her first headline tour to accompany the release of her EP A Dferent Light in April  May, followed by a busy summer of gigs and festivals. All of these plans have now been put on the back burner. As things stand the future for the arts is very uncertain, she explained. As anindependentartist the financial impact has been quitedevastatingand has affected not only our plans for the immediate future but for the next year. However, were so aware of the vast number of artists who are in a similar or even worse positions so are trying to remain as positive as possible about the future.  SOCIAL DISTANCING Stendhal Festival captured the attention of a worldwide audience after announcing the first socially distanced festival in Northern Ireland on August - aptly named ‘UNLOCKED’. It will take place at Ballymully Cottage Farm in Limavady where numbers will be limited but the audience will be treated to the very best talent on the island as well as beer gardens, delicious food and ‘perhaps best of all, over  acres of socially distant outdoor scenic countryside to enjoy’. Most festivals have however cancelled and are already trying to regroup for next year. Bars have also begun to reopen but in an effort to maintain social distancing live music has been actively discouraged. Theatres will open their doors at the end of the month but with large gatherings prohibited and social distancing mandatory for the foreseeable future there are uncertain times ahead. Strength N.I.A and Red Organ Serpent Sound frontman, Rory Moore, said it came as a ‘hefty blow’ to find out that all of their shows were cancelled for . “Live shows go hand in hand with releasing new music and sustaining oneself as a musician both financially, spiritually and emotionally. “It has been a pretty hefty blow. But working alone and self-isolation is something I have been used to for many years, the abnormality of the situation is something that comes with the turf of being a songwriter and performer,” he reflected. “Radio and social media are very important at this time for sustaining a career in music. “We hope that our fan base will pre order our album that is set for early release in  and fingers crossed we will be out playing again towards the middle of next year.” GOVERNMENT RESPONSE The Department for Communities said it is aware of the ‘immensely challenging’ situation currently facing the local music industry. The department has been in consultation with local industry representatives and further discussions are planned in the near future. In advance of the reopening of theatres and seated venues, the DfC is working in partnership with the Arts Council NI and key stakeholders, with officials having established a Consultative Arts and Culture Recovery Forum to help them in assessing the priorities for funding the sector in its entirety. A spokesperson said: “We are currently working at pace to develop our plans to ensure the future viability and resilience of the sector. These will be published as soon as possible. “The Arts Council NI currently have open funding programmes for both inidual artists and organisations. “Theatres have been provided with an indicative date for opening of  July. It is, however, recognised that it will be some time before venues such as theatres can operate as normal.” “There are a number of reasons for this. A number of venues have indicated that it will not be economically viable to open while social distancing remains in place. “We also need to consider the additional requirements for live performances including social distancing back stage and on stage, singing and wind instruments etc. “The Arts Council also are working with the sector to develop specic guidance for reopening theatres. This should be released shortly.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In a statement, they said: Testing and contact tracing is being conducted to identy people who may be potentially affected to help prevent any further spread. With lockdown restrictions being eased this type of occurrence is to be expected, which is why the Test, Trace and Protect programme is in place. At present anyone who tests positive for COVID- in Northern Ireland will be contacted by the contact tracing team to be given advice on what to do about managing symptoms and of the need to self-isolate to prevent any wider spread of the virus. googletag.cmd.push They will also be asked who they have been in contact with so that we can follow up with those iniduals to give them advice to help prevent the further spread of infection. Contact tracing is an established method to help prevent the further spread of infections such as COVID-, and we are using this approach to target potential clusters which could spark new outbreaks. Limavady councillor, James McCorkell, appealed for people not to panic, and to co-operate with the contact tracing teamthey are contacted. This highlights the fact that we are by no means over this troubling time and people must take this serious when out and about, he said. googletag.cmd.push I would ask that people dont panic - the Test Trace  Protect system is there to help identy these pockets that will inevitably flare up whilst we continue to go through this pandemic. I would appeal for people to cooperate with the Contact Tracing Team, should they be contacted, as this will help get any clusters under control on the area. Please also ensure you know the symptoms of covid- and take every precaution when out and about to social distance and follow at the guidance the Government has asked us to follow. If the team identies a potential cluster or outbreak this will be reported through the PHA’s normal outbreak management channels and the appropriate infection control advice actions carried out. PHA will continue to monitor all cases of COVID-, look for trends and linked cases and where we need to advise or inform the public of any increased risk to public health we will do so in a timely manner. We will not comment on inidual cases as this could lead to people being identied and deter others with symptoms coming forward to be tested. We would ask everyone to be mindful of this risk. This virus has the potential to make its presence felt in any district. Everyone should act on the basis that it might potentially be in their neighbourhood right now. That’s why following the public health advice on regular hand washing and maintaining a social distance of two metres remains vitally important. We must be aware that COVID- is still a threat and we need everyone to play their part in helping to stop the virus spreading.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Many businesses had to close for over three months as a result of coronavirus lockdown measures and are on the slow road to recovery. It is essential that they have the publicrsquos backing and support at this critical time, he said.ldquoIt is more important than ever that we support our local shops, cafes, bars and restaurants who collectively provide signicant employment, supporting many families.Cllr Andrews said local businesses and ious retail outlets ldquohave all gone the extra mile, working to implement guidelines and regulations designed to keep staff and customers safe at all times.He added: ldquoCrossgar is one particular part of the district where businesses have worked hard to ensure that people are safe, whether shopping or out for something to eat.ldquoThe village is home to a number of businesses, many of them family-owned, and it is important that we support them at this time, alongside other businesses across the district. The business community needs our support more than ever..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th July 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Ardglass artist makes model of shipwrecked WW2 vessel  ","story":"ARDGLASS artist William Mulhall recently completed work on a stunning model replica of a ship which ran aground on the Lecale coast more than  years ago.The Georgetown Victory ran aground at Killard Point, near Ballyhornan in , while on its way from Australia to Glasgow.All of the , servicemen aboard, who were due to be demobbed following the end of the Second World War, were rescued.Local farmers responded to the emergency and helped transport the troops to RAF coaches to take them to nearby Bishopscourt where they were served breakfast.A military convoy subsequently ferried the troops to an army barracks in Belfast where several hundred boarded a passenger steamer en route to Glasgow, their original destination.William has described the time he spent on making the new model as a ldquolabour of love and is keen to garner as much information as he can about the ship.While aware of what happened to the Georgetown Victory, he would like to broaden his knowledge of the disaster which occurred just a short distance from his home.William says he is keen for anyone who can help to either contact him by telephone or pop into his shop in his home village where they will also be able to see his model.ldquoI am pleased to have completed the model and it was special to work on a project that I remember my father talking to me about, he said.ldquoThe Georgetown Victory is an important part of the history of Lecale and I know there are many people out there who have more knowledge about then disaster than me. I would like them to get in touch.William said he has heard many reports about the disaster, including one relating to men from Portaferry who allegedly took a piano off the ship.The Georgetown Victory was a lsquoVictory Shiprsquo and was built in  at the Fortfield Shipyard at Bethlehem, Maryland, in the United States. She weighed in at , tons and was powered by two steam turbine enginesSays William: ldquoThe vessel was registered at Baltimore and when it left Fremantle for Glasgow with , Royal Navy men and marines due for demob. The crew mistook Strangford Lough for the River Clyde and the ship ran aground  yards off Killard Point, with her back breaking just forward of the bridge within a few hours of stranding.The Georgetown Victory had been converted from a cargo ship to a troopship able to transport up to , troops, with her cargo holds converted to bunk beds and hammocks stacked three high for hot bunking. In the cargo hold, mess halls and exercise areas were also added.Entering service near the end of the war, the Georgetown Victory and  other Victory troopships were given the task of transporting the troops home as part of Operation Magic Carpet. The vessel was operated by the American Export Lines.The ship departed Sydney with , troops steaming to Glasgow, stopping for water and fuel at Fremantle in Australia, Colombo in Sri Lanka and Aden in Yemen via the Suez Canal.On April , , just before midnight, the ship ran aground hard, at near top speed,  yards south of Killard Point.All of the servicemen aboard were rescued by leboats and breeches buoy to a tug started at about am.William said local people can remember some men wading ashore through heavy fuel oil from the stricken vessel to be cared for in nearby homes.

We had the most beautul Art Deco Vaudeville theatre for celebrities, actors and directors to view their work. So I always loved it and knew I wanted to create something like that when it came todesigning the cinema, explained Jacqueline.Jacqueline reeled in her professional interior design skills, repurposing household items and getting inspiration from the dance showrsquos judgesrsquo table for her home cinema.She said: ldquoTony and I moved back home from London and built our home where we had a basement constructed. But it became a storage area and the kids were sitting more or less in the middle of it.ldquoWe drove up to Belfast and got wadding to line the walls. When we ran out of wadding, we just used old duvets. We covered the wadding with red velvet. That made the room soundproof.ldquoWe are cocooned watching a movie and a massive thunder storm would pass without us even hearing it. Tony did the building work by and the kids helped. We called them the film crew.ldquoI also got gold paint and mixed that with glitter to give the old-style feel of the movie room. We made a bar thatrsquos inspired by the judgesrsquo  table on Strictly Come Dancing. I was watching the show one night and thought Irsquod like to make something like that.The Art Deco-style columns were Billy bookcases from Ikea that we painted. I had a mirror bought for me that needed a place to hang it and we put that in the bar where it really suits. A relative bought us a popcorn machine for added authenticity.She said that from creating the mood board for the project to when it was completed took four weeks, but it really was not used until lockdown.ldquoBefore the Covid- restrictions, the cinema was something we had started and used a bit. When lockdown came and the cinemas closed, the kids were never out of our cinema, she said.ldquoThe kids can go in there and watch their Netflix and Disney Plus mdash we have Sky, Netflix and every other movie and plus channel going now during lockdown so we can get the newly released movies as they are streamed.ldquoNow therersquos so much satisfaction with it. Itrsquos something special we designed and built as a family and now use as a family. Itrsquos a special place because we all have invested our time, love and effort into it.However, there are no plans to rule out trips to the cinema after they are allowed to reopen.Jacqueline added: ldquoWe will continue to support our local cinema. Our home cinema is great but therersquos nothing like the real thingThe movie theatre, whether it be modern or old-style, is a magical place and I hope we all continue going to the movies and supporting our cinemas for many years to come..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th July 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Tributes paid to former council chairman  ","story":"GLOWING tributes have been paid to former SDLP councillor Patsy Toman who sadly passed away last week. He was .Mr Toman, who is survived by his we, Anne, daughter Bronagh, sons Patrick and Niall, and the wider family circle, represented the Ballynahinch area on the former Down Council.He fought six successful local government election campaigns and was a distinguished former chairman of the council after his appointment in .Tributes to Mr Toman mdash who was interred last Friday following a service at St Macartanrsquos Church in Loughinisland mdash have been led by Baroness Margaret Ritchie, the former South Down MP, South Down MLA Colin McGrath and local councillors Dermot Curran, Terry Andrews and Billy Walker.Committed to his family and the wider community, Mr Toman was held in high regard by many, including his former council colleagues. He was a principled man who helped everyone, regardless of their politics and always stood up for what he believed to be right.A passionate defender of the Ballynahinch electoral area, he lobbied hard to secure investment and was a key player in the drive to secure a new bypass around the market town.Mr Toman made a signicant contribution to the district and a number of organisations, including Loughinisland GAC. He was the clubrsquos former cultural officer and treasurer.Leading the tributes to her friend and former council colleague, Lady Ritchie said the community of Loughinisland and further afield had lost a man of ldquoimmeasurable integrity and the epitome of hard work and resilience. She also said that she had lost a ldquotrue friend.Lady Ritchie revealed that she had known Mr Toman since she was six years old, explaining that in his early le, he worked as a shop assistant in McKeatingrsquos general provisions store in Downpatrickrsquos Scotch Street.ldquoMy mother ordered her groceries in the shop every week and they were delivered on a Saturday. I can recall Patsy working in that shop and sometimes he delivered our groceries, she recalled.ldquoIn our many conversations, he recalled those visits and how I was only ever interested in the lemonade bottles that were in the grocery box. At that early stage of his le, Patsy was in a hurry and, above all, he was super efficient to get the job done. His attention to detail was legendary.Lady Ritchie said that she next met Mr Toman at a meeting of the SDLPrsquos Down District Executive in Dundrum in June .ldquoPatsy obviously knew who I was because he asked meI was still in Belfast. I indicated that I had ed home and he told me that he looked forward to working with me in the party.ldquoOnce again I noted a man who wanted to get the work done on behalf of the people. Patsyrsquos career in the grocery business continued when he had his own vegetable van, travelling theand breadth of parts of East Down.Describing Mr Toman as an ldquoindustrious inidual, Lady Ritchie said he was a ldquochampion of the underdog and a man of integrity, who fought relentlessly for the rights of farmers, social housing tenants and rural residents on a wide range of issues including planning applications.She continued: ldquoPatsy was a man of the community. He was a member of Ballynahinch Credit Union, Magherlegan Pipe Band, the Monday Club in Drumaness and Loughinisland GAC, as well as numerous organisations associated with the former Down Council. Patsy was a true Gael and was involved in the cultural and Scor activities of his home club.ldquoWhen I worked with the late Eddie McGrady MP, Patsy used to call into the Downpatrick constituency office every Monday and would have met up with the late Cllr Peter Craig.ldquoThere was fierce rivalry between the Saul and Loughinisland GAA teams and those matches were fought out again in the Scotch Street office and latterly in Saul Street, with Patsy and Peter also glorying in the fortunes of the Down GAA team in the early s.Lady Ritchie said Mr Toman always put the needs of people first, with this clearly reflected in the background work he did on behalf of the Loughinisland families following the  massacre at The Heights Bar in the village.ldquoPatsy was shaken with emotion and grief about the killing of six innocent men and the images of that night on June  lasted with him until he was overtaken by his illness and his untimely death. He always stood solidly with the families in their fight for justice and truth, she continued.Lady Ritchie said Mr Toman was involved in the politics of the SDLP for a long time and was a founder member and chairman of the partyrsquos Drumaness branch.He was elected to Down Council in  and subsequently re-elected in , , ,  and  and while he retired from elected politics in , he remained active in the community.ldquoPatsy was a stalwart on the East Border Region Committee and the Ards Down Rural Partnership, continued Lady Ritchie.ldquoI fought many elections with him and he kept driving everyone to go the extra mile to achieve better representation. AndPatsy had an issue that required a resolution, he pursued you until he got an answer, applying that same approach for all of his constituents.Lady Ritchie said Mr Toman had been a ldquotrue, loyal friend for many years and was delighted and honoured to attend his th birthday celebrations in April of last year.ldquoPatsy always confronted you with his political problems which were not major at all. Such was the loyalty and bond between Patsy and myself that whenever I was ill with breast cancer, both he and his we Anne arranged a special Mass for me the day before my surgery. I will never forget that and I am eternally grateful to Patsy and Anne for their personal support to me during my political and personal le, she added.She added: ldquoPatsy was an extremely loyal inidual a family man who cherished his we, children and grandchildren. He was a man of deep Christian faith, a person of immense integrity and an extremely hard worker and defender of the rights of the underdog..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th July 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Unease over A%26E reopening plans  ","story":"BARONESS Margaret Ritchie has urged health chiefs to ldquoend the uncertainty over theof the Downe Hospitalrsquos emergency department.Her call comes after the South Eastern Trust confirmed that it plans to reopen the Downpatrick hospitalrsquos minor injuries unit from August as part of staged restoration of all emergency services.A number of services mdash including accident and emergency and minor injuries mdash were removed by the health trust at the end of March as part of its response to the coronavirus pandemic.Baroness Ritchie says these services need to be restored as soon as possible, given the continuing reduction in Covid- cases.When the health trust closed the Downpatrick hospitalrsquos emergency department, its critical care staff and some equipment were relocated to the Ulster Hospital in Dundonald as the organisation prepared for what it described as ldquothe biggest challenge it has ever faced.Health chiefs said they needed to reshape hospitals and other services on a temporary basis to maximise its ability to ldquomanage the surge in demand for services due to Covid-.While the endoscopy service and other day case surgical work has recommenced at the Downe, Baroness Ritchie said the local community was eager for theof the emergency department and that senior health chiefs must provide clarity on this issue.ldquoOn Monday of last week, the South Eastern Trust confirmed that it would provide a date at the end of July when the Downersquos emergency department would reopen, with the re-opening of the minor injuries unit at the beginning of August ,marking ldquohe stepped progress to the opening the ED, she said.ldquoHowever, last Friday, the publication of the joint Department of Health South Eastern Trust plan for rebuilding services within their respective areas between July and September stated that Trust officials will lsquoexplorersquo the feasibility of reopening the ED service.Lady Ritchie warned that this represents a ldquomarked dference of emphasis and that the Trust needs to claryit is deviating from its commitment to provide a date at the end of July for the reopening of the Downersquos ED.She continued: ldquoThe South Eastern Trust needs to provide a date for the re-opening of emergency services in Downpatrick and I have urged it to do so as soon as possible. I hope it is not obeying the tune of centralising services in Belfast. The local population deserves better.The former South Down MP said that as Northern Ireland was being reopened for business following a reduction in the number of Covid cases, ldquonormal services at the Downe hospital should resume.Lady Ritchie said anything which falls short of what was previously in the hospital would ldquorepresent a lack of faith and trust.She added: ldquoIt is important to remember that the real ing of the Downe Hospital with its suite of services and consultant physicians is directly linked to the AE provision.ldquoI have told both the health trustrsquos chief executive and health minister Robin Swann that anything that falls short of that requirement will be unacceptable and present our community with an intolerable position.Last week, health officials insisted that emergency services removed from the Downe as part of sweeping changes to help tackle the coronavirus pandemic will be reinstated. In addition, officials branded claims that the service will notand be replaced with a daily minor injuries service as ldquoinaccurate and misleading.The health trust says that it hopes to be in a position to confirm a date for theof AE services to the Downpatrick hospital by the end of July and that it remains totally committed to the Downe and its staff..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/11591685.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

balances.\"Itrsquos ironic in some ways as when we were setting the budget for this financial year, some of our members wanted to use them and reduce the council tax levels.\"If we had done that, we would not have the buffer we have now.\"Itrsquos fortuitous that at that time I resisted, because I didnrsquot want to be in a position where we would not have finances available to respond to an emergency.\"I didnrsquot know that the coronavirus was going to hit us, but clearly it is having an effect.\"Wersquore not collecting business rates because wersquove given lots of businesses a payment holiday and wersquove also issued a considerable number of grants to businesses.\"We have paid out more than pound million in grants to businesses, which we will get back from Welsh Government, but therersquos no guarantee that all businesses will survive this.\"Wersquove also granted some rent relief for businesses who operate in council-owned premises for the first three months of this year, but who knows how long this pandemic will last \"Whilst Welsh Government has been able to provide some additional funding to local authorities, they have not got a bottomless pit of money either.\"Wersquore also paying out grants to charities and amateur sports clubs.\"\"Covid- is also having an effect on the council tax relief scheme,\" Cllr Moore said. \"The Government currently provides money to help people on low incomes claim a discount.\"The level of funding was set prior to this pandemic and the call on this funding is already increasing.\"This may not be sustainable and we may have to fund it ourselves.\"Applications for that fund have gone up immensely since the covid- situation.\"The Welsh Local Government Association believe there could be a spending increase of around pound million across Wales.\"For us that would equate to around pound,.\"At the moment, we can code spending against the pandemic and make claims to Welsh Government, as is every other local authority in Wales.\"But I emphasise, therersquos no guarantee that it is going to go on forever.\"The virus has also seen internal costs increase in certain areas.\"We needed to upgrade our IT facilities and expenditure on waste and recycling is also rising.\"Wersquove had to increase our investment in IT because a considerable number of staff are now working from home.\"Originally, we thought we were going to get all of that back, but now wersquove been told wersquore only going to get  per cent.\"Thatrsquos an expense we didnrsquot anticipate and itrsquos an expense we will have to absorb.\"The other added expenditure is due to people being out of work or furloughed.\"We have seen increases in applications for universal credit and thatrsquos going to have an impact on us in terms of the ability to collect rents and council tax.\"Exactly what that impact will be is unclear.ldquoDespite that, we are continuing to run services, as far as possible and we have seen a massive increase in areas such as recycling and waste.The other area of increased spending is in social services, which normally spends around  per cent of our budget.\"That is going to go up dramatically because people are getting frailer and succumbing to covid- and we are also supporting people in care homes and providing PPE for our staff and the care homes.Overall the virus is having a massive impact on the council and the community.\"The exact extent of this impact is very dficult to estimate, but we will continue to support the community until it is defeated.\"He added:

In this way we hope to support local businesses while encouraging shoppers towith confidence to town centres.Mr Lush says to add salt to the wound, since parking restrictions have been put in place, he has seen a noticeable decrease in sales, and this Saturday was one of the quietest he has seen.       ,params: .pushldquoWersquove tried our best through lockdown to remain open and serve the town as well as we can, and I find it very sad that this is how wersquove been repaid by the council, he added., compared to now\" alt\"Penarth Times: Glebe Street two weeks ago , compared to now\" class\"editor-image\"Glebe Street two weeks ago , compared to nowEmily Hillier, a resident who regularly drives into the town centre to shop, said she was ldquostunned by the bollards when she arrived to do some shopping on Wednesday.ldquoI wasnrsquot the only one either, she said. ldquoSo many people were saying the same thing ndash stood around just bemused by these plans.ldquoI try to use local shops as much as I can, but Irsquove never felt so discouraged to support local shops as a consumer.ldquoItrsquos so sad that we are being discouraged at a time when these local shops need all the help they can get.Ms Hillier said she believes the council should be using the money to fund parking in the town instead, and should allow Penarthrsquos residents to ldquouse their common sense to socially distance.She added that her friends have driven to the town centre this week, and have gone to the supermarket instead because they couldnrsquot find a parking space.The restrictions have garnered some support in the town too, however, and earlier this week members of Penarth Civic Society and Gwyrddio Penarth Greeningsaid they backed a partial pedestrianisation of some of the major pinch points in the town, to allow eateries to operate outdoors.The topic was on the agenda at a town council meeting two weeks ago, and a survey has been rolled out on the council website asking for residentsrsquo views.Gideon Calder of GPG said: ldquoOur town centre needs our support, and whats vital is that people feel safe to visit, spend more time in our town centre, and make the most of our local shops and cafeacutes.Anne Evans of Penarth Civic Society added: ldquoThese proposals would provide safe pedestrian zones to help increase footfall in the town centre, ensure that there is vital outdoor space for cafeacutes and restaurants, and increase the amount of town centre parking. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Commenting proprietor Brian Jardine said: “It’s been a pleasure to welcome our customers back to the Pot Belly and to hear their positive feedback on our distancing and sanitising measures.“Part of our measures to keep everyone safe includes our two Gel-Gem sanitising units which are front of house and at the entry to our separate upstairs restaurant and a new external covered space, our Terraced Bar.”Gel-Gem came about at the beginning of lockdown when most businesses were closed said Raymond Fegan of construction and property maintenance company d Property Services. “The amount of enquiries we received from business of all sizes led us to develop a solution to help the fight against Covid-. “One of the early issues we identied and worked to overcome was the fragile nature of some sanitising systems being installed into entrances which took up considerable space and required regular monitoring and replacement. “We wanted to design a hands-free unit which was locally produced, high capacity and which was built to last.Studying the market we believe that in offering a sturdy, solid and safe stainless steel construction which includes a gel level monitoring window, we’ve done just that.“Gel-Gem comes in three dferent sanitising gel capacities - ,  and a mammoth  litre version for higher footfall areas.They can be used outside and we are also producing bespoke ‘all ability’ models and models which include provision to store contact tracing details, order to meet the specic needs of our clients. “Working to provide solutions for our clients across the local area, from small shops to the Bouled Outlet and from churches to sports clubs we have been delighted with the feedback we have been receiving not only for our Gel-Gem’s but also for our new hand-friendly sanitising gel which we can supply wholesale. “We are also delighted that every sale of a Gel-Gem unit supports the work of charity Kidney Care UK as they support local kidney patients which highlights the need to sanitise not only for ourselves but for those who are clinically vulnerable and at higher risk of infection.”Concluding Brian Jardine said: “At The Pot Belly we are very proud of our historic roots and excited about once again welcoming our customers back to enjoy our locally sourced menu’s while at the same time taking the steps to keep everyone safe.”If you want to find out more about the Gel-Gem units visit www.d-ps gel-gem or contact Raymond at gel-gem@d-ps\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-gxMtzJ sc-dfVpRl dLpuYr\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyNews you can trust since News\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisCoronavirusSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us    "},{"url":null,"title":"these are  most desirable dogs breeds do you have one them ","story":"These are the  most desirable dogs breeds -
