In November, Bookshop, a socially conscious alternative to Amazon, launched in the UK, while British company Hive offers a similar service, allowing shoppers to support a local bookshop at checkout. The indie music industry launched Love Records Stores in March to help out traders. Other websites are less conventional – every small business listed on Not On The West End is run by someone who usually makes their living in UK theatre.The cavalry may also be arriving for small traders, albeit belatedly, in the form of a proposed nationwide local shop site run by the British Independent Retailers Association (Bira). It would be run “to enable retailers to effectively sell online to their local markets, not for huge amounts of profit”, says the Bira CEO, Andrew Goodacre.“We’re never going to beat Amazon, we’re never going to be as big as Amazon but perhaps we can compete on a local basis,” he adds.Big stores are expensive to runDepartment stores were once celebrated as temples of consumerism. But mid-market chains like Debenhams and House of Fraser are saddled with large high street stores in town centres where shopper numbers are dwindling but costs, such as rent and wages, are rising.The internet is killing the high streetBy\u0026nbspthe end of 2018 Britons had splurged nearly £70bn via their phones and tablets. That spree is expected to continue, with online sales predicted to hit almost £100bn by 2021, according to consultants at Retail\u0026nbspEconomics. Department stores are in the firing line as fewer Britons now bother to physically visit the high street, with clothing and household gadget sales having moved online fastest.Many indies pivoted immediately, says Goodacre, working hard on social media, installing online payments and click and collect services, but thousands face closure. Research in April suggested almost a fifth of the UK’s small businesses could go bust within a month.But the desire to keep independent shops open is robust, recent research suggests. Working from home has kept people – and their spending – local. A survey carried out by Visa for Bira found that while three in five shoppers were worried independent businesses would not survive, four in five said they were shopping local as much as or more than before the pandemic.Other decentralised, hyper-local sites created on a shoestring are already popping up across the country.In the North of England, towns are queuing up to use the free Totally Locally open source marketing kit. In September, Hebden Bridge became Totally Locally’s first local site to give shoppers the chance to buy from multiple local shops with one online checkout and 30 towns are on a waiting list, says founder Chris Sands.“You can’t just put a sticker on the window, say shop local, and expect everyone to change their mind and do it,” he says. Instead, Totally Locally’s in-depth kit helps local traders create brands and change habits it’s free, all they ask is if you have an idea that works you share it. “We call it the economics of being nice,” he says.The site has made a big difference, says Jim Leach, the co-founder of bespoke plywood kitchen maker Wood \u0026amp Wire based in the Yorkshire town. “A lot of people are putting a lot of effort into getting these things up and running,” he says. “But ultimately people have just got to use it so the ecosystem becomes sustainable.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e7f91de641144e43d8e9949cb193333bf9eb1ab/56_538_4104_2463/master/4104.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=1d3e69f1bf47981585a4f8ab5d624ee9","title":"our attitudes to race are complex our response to racism should be complex too","story":"Encouraging new research suggests effective ways of challenging prejudiceIs a mass-produced jerk chicken burger a symbol of cultural appropriation or a celebration of British multiculturalism? This is an old debate that periodically resurfaces and so it was a couple of weeks ago when McDonald’s launched its latest festive offering.In this case, a story that got echoed across much of the tabloid press was constructed out of a few random comments criticising McDonald’s on social media it was journalists who built and amplified this narrative. But occasionally, others who should know better get drawn in, such as the MP who picked a fight with Jamie Oliver over his jerk rice.I have long thought that reducing debates about racism to flippant questions about fast-food burgers and supermarket curry kits is damaging to the antiracist cause. But new research on public attitudes to racism by the Runnymede Trust and Voice4Change England helps us understand why.The study is all the better for shunning mass polling as the primary way of understanding how the public thinks about race. Instead, researchers undertook two one-hour conversations with 60 people from a range of backgrounds. What emerges is both good and bad news for those of us who care deeply about ending racism. The good news is that the weight of public thinking is that racism matters, that it is something that is learned and education has an important role to play also, that racism is part of our national history.The less good news is that some people buy into the idea that racism is “natural”, that we all have an affinity with people who look more like us. There is a lack of understanding about the nature of structural racism public thinking gravitates towards the idea that racism is about inidual actions and responsibilities. There is a strong sense that there is no going backwards and that things will inevitably get better over time.Yet in the 20 years since the Macpherson report, black people have gone from being five to nine times more likely to be stopped and searched by police than white people. And there is a strand of zero-sum thinking: the worry that tackling racial discrimination will inevitably mean majority groups giving things up.Importantly, researchers found people hold beliefs that would be considered both warm and hostile to antiracism campaigns: it is possible for someone to believe both that racism is ingrained in human nature and will never change, but that we are making progress as a society, or that it is important we all do something about racism while at the same time worrying about the consequences for themselves.The populist right is very good at activating the more hostile strands of thinking by stoking this idea that if a minority benefits, the majority must lose. When Conservative MP Ben Bradley calls the education of white, working-class boys a “taboo” subject, he implies that white, working-class children have been unfairly overlooked by people more interested in promoting the interests of minority children if it were Asian or black children, “heads would roll”, he says (the lack of accountability for institutional racism in the Met suggests they wouldn’t).By confecting this into a conflict between white and non-white children, he conveniently obscures the role of class. Far from being taboo, the class attainment gap for poor children, the vast majority of whom are white, was one of the key drivers of Labour education policy, which on any objective measure was far better than what followed, including Conservative chancellors slashing thousands of pounds a year in tax credits from parents in low-paid work and Tory education reforms that have done little to address the fact that working-class children remain far less likely to attend a good quality school.The intellectual underpinnings of this zero-sum thinking lie in notions of “white identity” from academics such as Eric Kaufmann. Kaufmann argues that the rise of right populism is primarily the product of white communities’ opposition to increasing racial ersity. He attacks the notion that structural racism exists at all and encourages politicians to promote the need to maintain “white culture”.But this is to take far too simplistic and patronising a view of the way white, working-class communities think about race. It cannot account for all the historical examples where a predominantly white labour movement built solidarity and common cause with campaigns for equality.The Runnymede research shows that there are strands of public thinking that the right can activate to achieve its ends of sowing ision. But there are also positive ways of thinking about race that antiracist campaigners can connect with and build on, sometimes in the same person and certainly within the same community. In particular, antiracism campaigners need to find ways to explain the often counterintuitive idea that racism is not just about iniduals but systems. “We need to communicate to people that racism is something that’s designed into our system, which means we can design something better,” says Sanjiv Lingayah, the lead author of the research.But there are also traps. Certain ideas risk playing into the damaging idea that majority white and minority interests are directly in conflict, which antiracism campaigners need to challenge. Cultural appropriation often fits into that category, as do terms such as “white privilege” and “white fragility”. Yes, there is an overall structural advantage to being white compared with being non-white, but, no, it does not build solidarity to imply that if you are white, you are automatically “privileged”. Yes, men who went to Eton may have to loosen their grip on the levers of power, but that would, frankly, be good for all the rest of us.This research gets us away from reductivist, static accounts of public attitudes to race. It shows that, while there are aspects of public thinking that antiracists need to challenge, there is also a lot of positive stuff to work with. But to get lured into giving the impression that this is a fight between “them” and “us” is only to serve the agenda of the populist right.• Sonia Sodha is the Observer’s chief leader writer and a columnist"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f87db1a7b025f1175c6286d9b391f8beb3b746c0/0_13_5231_3139/master/5231.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=182aa66a86f53401a1408d6a4162e2fd","title":"have you experienced racism at a uk university","story":"We would like to hear from black and minority ethnic students and lecturers about their experiencesA new report has concluded that UK universities perpetuate institutional racism.

They’re wrong. Through careful coaxing and iron patience, I have drilled my cats to stop taking bites out of my mashed potato. They no longer wake me up at the crack of dawn by leaping on to my face. And thanks to my persistence, they are regular, enthusiastic users of the cat flap. Particularly at night when it’s locked and they bash their paws against it like amateur feline bongoists.But this is where my cat-training prowess plateaued – I couldn’t manage to take things to the next level. I did buy a tedious 700-page book that promised feats such as teaching your moggy to sit. I tried random websites’ impressive-sounding tutorials on high-fiving, vaulting and convincing cats to happily don a harness and be walked like a dog. But, invariably, my cats would stray from the plan and I’d be left scouring 800 words of text for a solution. What did my efforts actually teach them? That there’s no better time to steal snacks than when your confuddled owner is staring at his or her phone or into a book. So I gave up.Until today. Now, I am armed with the teachings of School for Cats – a series of TikTok videos, each one around 20 seconds long, making it easy to refer to while training my two beloved feline companions. There’s Mochi, a three-year-old tabby and highly strung madam. Also Poirot, an elaborately moustachioed and insanely rambunctious five-month-old kitten. They’ll be taught separately, though, because – to put it mildly – they are not the best of friends, and it’s difficult to conjure up an informative educational atmosphere in the middle of a fist fight.Day one of training starts well as a super-keen Poirot turns up wearing an elegant tuxedo (which, admittedly, he always does thanks to his black and white fur pattern). But I quickly learn that some of these skills might well be beyond my cats. I’d thought that “lay down” would be the ideal trick to teach a pair of cats that border on narcoleptic. However, when I try gently pushing Mochi into a lying position, she stares balefully at me – her sad, wide eyes dripping with betrayal. Poirot thinks we’re roughhousing, so uses my hand as a scratching post.Another trick, known as “paw” or “shake”, involves getting your cat to give you a high-five by offering them a treat. However, Poirot just ends up biting my fingers until I drop the treat in pain. I move on to the tutorial “over”, in which a compliant cat jumps over an owner’s foot. Mochi, being the contrary moggy that she is, instead learns how to slide under my leg.However, when I find the right trick, I am genuinely astonished by the results. The 360-degree turn that is “spin” is a hit with both of my cats. Not only do they quickly comprehend that they’re meant to follow a treat around in a circle but, after a couple of sessions, they even start following my empty hand in the hope of being rewarded afterwards. Which is the first time I have ever managed to get my cats to do anything without food-based bribery. I mean, if I’m honest, it’s also one of the few times I’ve managed to make them respond to instructions with anything other than a sarcastic narrowing of the eyes. So it’s a double win.What’s more, the training for a trick called “sit pretty” genuinely becomes one of Poirot’s favourite things in the world. Apparently, standing up on his hind legs to reach for a treat is the absolute pinnacle of exciting playtime for a kitten. Hours after one training session, my wife inadvertently points at Poirot during conversation, causing him to leap four feet into the air on to her finger. So successful it is, I’m tempted to rename the trick “fly, my pretty”, or “rocket launch”, or “TAKE COVER! INCOMING CAT!”I’m chuffed. Initially, because the training exercises are a lot of fun. They’re simple to follow, easy to refer to during training and perfect for a creature that has a five-second attention . Plus, they suit the cats.But, eventually, I come to appreciate them for something I hadn’t anticipated. They’ve had lovely consequences for my relationship with my pets. It was fairly predictable that Poirot would take to it, given that he’s an excitable, pliable kitten. But Mochi’s response has been a revelation. She has spent the past two hours sitting next to me on the sofa, just watching me operate a Word document. She’s even begun hopping on to my lap for a snooze – something unheard of since the honeymoon period of her moving in with us. If I’d known that teaching her to spin in circles would make her this content, I’d have done it months ago.Frankly, there’s only one small disappointment in this whole process. No matter how much I scroll, there is one thing I can’t find. Seemingly, School for Cats has no lessons on how to stop your pets playing your cat flap like a bongo."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/74bc9cfd344ef14f902f863df2c81f4fcabb7856/1425_908_2315_1389/master/2315.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4448c44920eda0df46b69b9db1f6210c","title":"pause and breathe how i learned to meditate with tiktok","story":"Are you finding it hard to switch off and relax? Short and snappy mindfulness videos were just the thing to help me refocusThings I’m good at: multitasking, overcommitting, starting things and not finishing them. Watching Netflix while listening to a podcast while cooking dinner while messaging a friend, while skim-reading an important article.Things I’m not good at: silence, boredom, focusing on the present, being alone with my thoughts. And so, by extension, meditation.I’ve tried to meditate several times over the years, encouraged by stories from friends and experts about how beneficial it is for our mental health, motivation, confidence and clarity. So far, I’ve never managed to make it more than several minutes into a session without: a) falling asleep b) remembering something very urgent that needs to be done right now or c) allowing my thoughts to wander in such catastrophic directions that it leaves me more stressed than when I started. But if I’m ever going to change that, 2020 seems a good time to try.This year, like so many people, I’ve felt my anxiety skyrocket while my productivity and creativity have plummeted. My silence-aversion and phone addiction have reached new lows (I’m talking watching TV on the toilet), and it often feels as if the only way to coax myself through another working day is offering my brain episodes of Gilmore Girls like dog treats to a wayward puppy.So can I finally learn to be mindful? And could I do so by using the zeitgeist social media platform TikTok? The irony of using social media as a tool to refocus my attention isn’t lost on me. But the truth is that beyond the dance challenges and celebrity lip-syncs, TikTok is fast becoming a hub for short and snappy instructional videos about a variety of subjects and skills.Videos tagged #meditation clock up a cool 643m views. And after the number of adult users multiplied more than six times between October 2017 and March 2019, it is little wonder that lockdown saw an influx of professionals and experts using the platform as a teaching tool.But where to begin? While I’m open to a certain amount of omm and woo (a walk that consists of crossing one foot over the other while hopping), it’s fair to say my tolerance for wind chimes is low. One of the first videos I land on is “meditation tips for witches”, which worries me. If witches are struggling, what hope do us muggles have?Still, TikTok’s pick and mix buffet of content suits my natural impatience. There are as many different ways to meditate as there are users to teach me – I just have to find the one that resonates. So I learn about third eye activation. I experience my first sound bath. I watch absurdly beautiful yogis demonstrating their perfect lotus pose and feel burdened by an extra thought: “How can I get my skin to look like that?” I hope the answer is “by aligning my chakras” and not a serum that costs £300.Then I land on Headspace, and things begin to click into place. An extension of the wildly popular mindfulness app, Headspace’s TikTok is filled with videos delivered in the brand’s signature fluff-free style. Here, instead of a woman walking dreamily through a cornfield or a dandelion clock blowing in the breeze, I can breathe in time to soothing images of fresh linguine falling languidly from a pasta maker. My kind of therapy.Having picked up some beginners’ tips, naturally my first impulse is to multitask. Can I meditate in the shower? While running? At Sainsbury’s? But deep down I know that looking for shortcuts only leads me into a mental cul-de-sac. So I commit to 15 minutes of pure meditation every morning. I sit in an armchair I never normally sit in, and feel slightly more enlightened just by seeing the room from a different angle. Deciding it’s probably best not to start off too ambitious, I begin with the easiest possible exercise: breathing.One myth every instructor I watch seems determined to debunk is the idea that meditation means emptying one’s mind in fact, the goal is to let thoughts pass through without panic or judgment. During my second session, I can’t stop thinking about what I’m going to eat for lunch. But as @lovecolbyjanine reassures me, “distractions can be messages”.Next I discover the Miami-based spiritual coach Estefanía, who posts as @alignwithmee. From her Meditation Hack Tuesdays, I’m thrilled to learn about whistle breathing. Whistling is something I am good at. I’ve often lamented the lack of opportunities for talented whistlers to monetise our skills or harness them for good now I can whistle my way to a higher plane! My downstairs neighbours are thrilled.The next morning I move on to fire meditation, as guided by “spiritual seeker” and author @vishuddhadass. Staring at a candle flame for 15 minutes feels more comfortable than keeping my eyes closed, and with the flickering light to focus on I find that it’s easier to gently bring my mind back each time it wanders. For the first time, I’m disappointed when my meditation ends. For all digital tools, there’s a fine line between companion and crutch. I’ve saved more than 20 videos for future reference, but @whitneycatalano advises that when we find ourselves scrolling the internet in a desperate hunt for more information, that’s when we should turn to meditation instead. “You’re craving connection,” she says. “And information is not the same thing as connection.” Like all good teachers, TikTok can only take me so far before I need to put my phone down and go it alone.After a week of morning sessions, I may not have unlocked bountiful secret reserves of creative energy, but I do notice I’m sitting down to work with less weary apprehension than before. I’ve stopped taking my phone to the loo. And I’ve realised something: successful meditation isn’t like conjuring up the image in a Magic Eye picture. It’s not a knack you grasp, or a hypnotic trance you slip into – at least, not at my amateur level.Rather, it’s a practice, in every sense of the word. The most important thing is being prepared to pause, breathe, and see what happens. Sit with my feelings, as the kids say.It turns out, I wasn’t “failing” to meditate all those times before. I was just giving up before it got good."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/208c4c7316bbcefac43001292d41c149503dee45/1435_723_2316_1390/master/2316.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0da95454495fe8554b679e6415dd0d7a","title":"fast and fun learning how tiktok became my fount of scientific knowledge","story":"Are you fascinated by the universe but find in-depth online tutorials on existence a bit long-winded? For one writer, short and snappy videos opened his eyes to a different worldThe worst thing about living in a 3D spacetime continuum is how boring the explanations are for it. Having taken almost a year to finish Stephen Hawking’s A Brief History of Time: From the Big Bang to Black Holes – an experience that felt longer than the creation of the universe – I’ve always been on the lookout for scientists and cosmic experts who can give me an insight into what this thing we call “reality” actually is.I hoped the internet would allow knowledge to travel at warp-speed, enabling my brain to consume information as easily as black holes do galaxies, but found myself confronting the snore-inducing perorations of science geeks who managed to extend their insights on string theory into infinity. Most video platforms allow their experts too much time to show off their intelligence, but that approach quickly drains my enthusiasm. Luckily if, like me, you like your science fast and fun, the video-sharing network TikTok can be an unexpected starburst of scientific know-how.Using simple hashtags to search for the most useful user-generated videos, my learning began. “Everything is connected!” enthused @kerwinrae over stellar visuals, stating that quantum theory dictates that everything breaks down into “nothing but strings” that are laid down like a web over the entire universe. “Pluck a string on Mars,” he says, “and it’s going to vibrate on earth.” In less than a minute, I realised that God is simply a great guitarist, like an ethereal Jimi Hendrix ecstatically playing everything into being.Over a slow Richard Rodgers jazz song, @physicsdude gave me a quick but very comforting chalkboard introduction to the four basic principles of physical reality – these four being the only reactions that cannot be broken down into simpler reactions. Now I know electromagnetism is the reason everything has a solid structure, while the strong force keeps those crazy quarks in order in the nucleus of an atom the weak force, however, is responsible for all nuclear decay. Gravity, I came to understand, is simply “the curvature of spacetime” – but it could be a particle, though that hasn’t been observed yet.The best thing about TikTok is how it captures the “gee-whizz!” enthusiasm that should accompany the understanding of the universe. Given that it’s the greatest creation of all time, you’d think people would discuss it with more excitement than the wearied waffling that is the usual online lecture. Giving users of Tiktok only 60 seconds to get their messages across really helps the material to be easily digested.Another TikTok user, @weirdpioneer – who describes herself as a wife, mother and psychologist – conveys her awestruck fascination with the universe with a special-effects video of the epigeneticist Bruce H Lipton jiving on the structure of existence. Matter, he enthuses, “is just an illusion of energy and light … there is nothing physical”. Physicists, he argues, have broken down the atom to find that, at its fundamental core, “there is nothing material at all – it’s an energy vortex”. The existential implications of this were mind-blowing. “According to quantum physics,” Lipton says, we’re not physical but merely “energy vortices” – just a flicker of the cosmic light-switch, basically.I was saved from the depression that might have accompanied this recognition of my irrelevance by science communicator Athena Brensberger. She makes sure she is easily comprehensible with short, joyous flashes of insight, such as into the “super position” taken by quarks – those particles that make up the particles that make up atoms.While anything bigger than a quark has to have a fixed location in time and space, quarks can occupy two places at once – until, that is, you observe them, when, like naughty children on being discovered, they stop dead in one place. The fundamental cheekiness of reality – hedging its bets until forced to decide what it is by a grownup – is a bit like my romantic history, and made me relate to the universe a lot more. My commitment issues, I can explain to my next girlfriend, are just the underlying fickle nature of the cosmos playing out through human experience.The universe is a big and complex place, and I’m just a small speck in one tiny corner of it.

Whose verdict do you trust? Taste the Difference Buck’s Fizz Marmalade340g, £1.60, sainsburysRavinder My late dad was fond of marmalade - like gammon and pineapple it was a relic of his student years in England. I can almost see him scraping out the remnants of this jar onto his toast now – a dense set with chunks of peel, a cheeky whiff of booze and as bittersweet as my memories of him. ★★★★Jay Buck’s fizz is champagne with orange juice. As a traditional marmalade is made with oranges, to justify the product name it would have to offer a boozy kick. There is none. ★★Asda Reindeer Crumpets6, £1, asdaRavinder No cutesy Rudolph shaped pastry cutter can save this dream of good bread gone awry - a flabby texture with zero tang, like chewing on a flat tyre. 0 starsJay It’s a well-made crumpet. In the shape of a reindeer’s head. For Christmas. What’s not to like? ★★★★Marks \u0026amp Spencer Triple Chocolate Panettone750g, £10, marksandspencerRavinder A middle finger up to years of Italian baking tradition –raisins and candied fruit are ludicrously replaced with a saccharine chocolate glaze and white chocolate chips. ★ Jay I have a sweet tooth so I wouldn’t say no to this, but it’s not a panettone. The hard, dark chocolate icing, the white chocolate nibs and the liquid chocolate centre instead of the peel mean it’s a cake. You couldn’t toast it. ★★★Taste the Difference Sticky Toffee Pudding Shortbread Rounds500g, £10, sainsburysRavinder Dunkable enough with a good amount of dates, but proper shortbread leaves a smattering of buttery crumbs to gather up with the padded tip of your index finger – these didn’t leave a speck. Smells like 10 pumps of caramel syrup at a well-known coffee chain. Injurious to tooth enamel. ★★★ Jay A nice enough biscuit, but a few pieces of date and a little toffee does not a sticky toffee pudding make, however nice the box. ★★Heston From Waitrose The Night Before Christmas Mince Pies6, £3.50, waitroseRavinder An attractive little puck of pastry that fits nicely in the palm of your hand. Boozy, fruity, aniseed spicy with delicious pastry – reminded me of a fig roll. Tastes like a toasty night in by the fire. ★★★★★Jay Great, short pastry and a punchy filling, but there’s too much of the former and not enough of the latter. The spiced sugar for dusting is a nice touch. ★★★Specially Selected All Butter Sloe Gin Mince Tarts Topped With Flaked Almonds6, £2.49, aldiRavinder Attractive, golden, buttery pastry. Generous toasty almonds. Can’t taste the sloe gin or much booze at all – more like a bakewell tart in flavour but lovely to eat all the same. ★★★★Jay Bright, almost sherbet flavour. Great pastry. A really enjoyable mince tart, even if it has nothing especially to do with sloe gin. ★★★★Co-op Irresistible Roast Potato Hand Cooked Crisps150g, £1.70, coopRavinder A big hit of rosemary and the crispy bits on roasties that every domestic goddess aspires to. A tad salty, but reader, I scoffed these by the handful. ★★★★Jay Crisps made of potato that are meant to taste of roast potatoes? Well, no. They mostly taste of rosemary, which is fine as far as it goes, but not what’s promised. ★★Co-op Irresistible Garlic \u0026amp Parsley Sharing Bread with Camembert290g, £4, coop Ravinder Once cooked it was more camembert soup than seductive ooze – thin, austere and mean – none of the things I want for Christmas. The bread was plainly inoffensive. ★★Jay I looked suspiciously at this but in truth, it works and disappeared quickly. A fun and useful addition to the table. ★★★★Co-op Irresistible Cranberry \u0026amp Port Flooded Pork Pie440g, £4, coopRavinder My pie expectations are sky-high (thanks to Calum Franklin’s insta feed) but this one is pretty good. Great colour on the jelly, smugly self-congratulatory gold star decoration, artisanal feel to the sturdy savoury pastry and sage-rich pork stuffing that’s generous and as dense as a shotput. If you are big on pig – this is one to oink over. ★★★★Jay A serious bit of pork pie, with a cracking hot water pastry crust and a terrific balance of sweet jelly to well-spiced meat. This has been made by someone who knows exactly what they’re doing. ★★★★★Asda Extra Special 6 Double Chilli Pigs in Blankets216g, £2.75, asdaRavinder Pigs in blankets are my favourite part of Christmas dinner – porcine nuggets of Yuletide cheer that distract from an unsuccesful turkey. These spicy ones aren’t terrible when you lose the strange half jalapeño jacket which still remains undercooked after 20 minutes in the oven. ★★★ Jay Of course, you could buy spicy sausages, bacon and fresh jalapeños yourself and put these together, but they’ve done it for you. If these were going round at a party, I’d scoff the lot. ★★★★Waitrose Breaded Baking Vegan Melts With Redcurrant Relish£4, 200g, waitroseRavinder A neat serving of passive-aggressive on a plate for the vegan guest who’s being a nuisance by not tucking into the Copas bronze turkey like everybody else. Coagulated interior and rancid relish, but a star for the nice even pané of crisp golden breadcrumbs.★Jay All my experiences of vegan “cheese” leave me muttering one word: why? The score is because I understand some people might appreciate this. I am not one of them. ★★Waitrose No.1 Seafood And Lobster Thermidor Pâté150g, £6, waitroseRavinder Rich, delicious and creamy with good-sized chunks of seafood – it was love at first bite. Needs little more than thin slices of toast, a squeeze of lemon and a glass of something uplifting. ★★★★★ Jay It’s not a pâté. It’s a dribbly, insipid liquid, and an insult to the words “lobster” and “thermidor”. File this under “when new product development goes wrong”. 0 starsMarks \u0026amp Spencer Scottish Salmon ‘Pastrami’100g, £5.50, marksandspencerRavinder Lovely, generously thick slices of fatty salmon, but what tastes like truckloads of table salt overwhelms anything else. I had to chug pints of water straight after eating this. ★★Jay I was suspicious of this but as pastrami is smoked and spiced beef, it made sense that salmon could be treated in the same way. Terrific texture and nice cure. It could have been slightly more spiced, but still good. ★★★★Sainsbury’s Pigs in Blankets Mayo280ml, 95p, sainsburysRavinder A condiment fit for the Grinch. Coming to a bargain binlandfill near you. 0 starsJay A bog-standard mayo which hasn’t even been waved at a pig. It’s just pumped up with artificial smoke flavour. ★Waitrose Truffle Coastal Cheddar200g, £3, waitroseRavinder Awful oily texture and tasted more like fusty mushrooms and sour milk than a good time in Alba. Not even a whiff of truffle. Like losing a tenner and finding a pound - disappointing. 0 starsJay A great cheddar but there’s only a hint of truffle if you suck it, and who wants to suck cheese? ★★★Tesco Finest Port Infused Aged Blue Stilton250g, £3, tescoRavinder I confess I am a stilton dodger so this was never going to be a winner. No trace of the port but it’s a pungent, woolly and creamy number - great if that’s what floats your fromage boat. ★★Jay A quality stilton with a nice, sweet boozy kick. A solution for anyone who has no need of the size of stilton round you would normally require if you wanted to feed it with port. ★★★★Marks \u0026amp Spencer Cheese Grazing Box775g, £25, marksandspencerRavinder If this cheese board had a personality type it would be a people-pleaser. Sharp cheddar, red Leicester, Brie and a veiny blue plus some juicy dried fruits and sweet nuts mean that no one is left wanting. Minus one star for the packaging. ★★★Jay I was suspicious of this, but for a small household it’s a great way to have a range of quality cheeses. ★★★★Specially Selected Handmade Pink Gin Marshmallows100g, £1.79, aldiRavinder Smells like the rosy strawberry delight one from a box of Quality Street which makes me giddy with nostalgia – I could almost hear the rustle of the pink cellophane wrapper – but tasted like toilet freshener. The thin milk chocolate covering was the only saving grace. ★Jay There’s a simple test with many of these products: would you know what it was meant to be if you hadn’t read the label? In this case, the answer is no. A perfectly acceptable chocolate-covered and lightly fruity marshmallow. ★★M\u0026ampS Collection Milk, Dark \u0026amp White Chocolate Selection440g, £15, marksandspencerRavinder Presented like a beautiful chocolate paintbox – decent chocolate and good flavours apart from the weird white chocolate raspberry one that took me back to my mother medicating me with Calpol when I’d been bad. ★★★★ Jay A smart, beautifully presented collection, made with well-tempered chocolate which cracks at room temperature. Great fillings too. I’d be delighted to receive this and mourn its passing. ★★★★★Asda Extra Special Sour Cherry Nougat Bar100g, £2, asdaRavinder It looked bright and inviting enough but it was hideously sweet, chewy and sticky and left my teeth with a gummy residue that was impossible to remove. Well at least my jaw got a workout. ★Jay Nice nougat and a cherry flavour but if you use the word “sour” I want acidity, and there’s none. ★★Tesco Finest Sparkling Sloe \u0026amp Plum Pressé750ml, £2, tescoRavinder Repulsive flavour of parma violets mixed with acetone, like an old lady’s delicates drawer. This went straight down the sink. 0 starsJay A burst of sweetness and fruitiness at first, which is quickly replaced by the foul tongue-vibrating hit of artificial sweeteners. I know why they’re used that doesn’t make them nice. I had to drink water to get rid of the taste. 0 starsTesco Finest Prosecco Valdobbiadene DOCG75cl, £10, tescoRavinder Powdery, bitter and far too fizzy – reminds me of that time I got a bullet sized malaria pill lodged in my throat. ★Jay A serviceable, medium-dry prosecco. Not too teeth-janglingly sweet. ★★★Asda Extra Special Vintage Champagne Brut75cl, £26, asdaRavinder A fruity, genial, easy to quaff number that’s so charismatic it practically does jazz hands. ★★★★Jay If the word “vintage” really matters to you then this is a reasonably priced option, for an appealingly biscuity and crisp champagne. But there are many equally serviceable and better-priced champagne options. ★★★"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce85015e364363c15c7393c03a0f8b56d1247cdb/0_263_5244_3147/master/5244.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=2dc8a02654f51387d11faadd1073bc62","title":"restaurateur chef cook campaigner what 2020 taught us","story":"From Covid-19 to Black Lives Matter and the storm around food inequality, it’s been a tumultuous year. Three people in the hospitality industry reveal how it’s changed their livesOwner, Lunya restaurant and deli, Liverpool“It was strangely unemotional looking through the windows,” says Peter Kinsella, but within minutes tears begin to fill his eyes.We are in Manchester’s Barton Arcade, opposite the now closed branch of Lunya, Kinsella’s Spanish deli and restaurant. “Our sign put up in March saying we’ll be closed for a short period is still in the window,” notes the 56-year-old. He points out one wall and recalls how, in 2015, when opening Lunya Manchester, agreeing the right shade of staining took days. “It doesn’t matter at all, but at the time it was so significant.”Kinsella’s voice cracks, not for the last time, remembering how one June night this year, at 10pm, after repeatedly putting the Zoom call off, he had to tell more than 30 Manchester employees they had lost their jobs. “That was just really hard. Knowing they’re not going to find another quickly. I only know three who have. People were shocked.”The situation in Liverpool is still fragile. After a busy summer, tier 3 and single-household dining was “disastrous”. On one October Monday, Lunyalita Albert Dock, which opened in July 2018, took just £162. Its wage bill that day was £450. In that dire context, Kinsella describes the second full lockdown and its attendant financial support as a relief. But he is “profoundly angry” it did not happen sooner. Restaurants now face “closure or profound restrictions in the run-up to Christmas. It’s devastating for our industry.”Even with Lunya’s back rent (in October, about £180,000) and loan repayments deferred, money is tight. Strong online retail Christmas sales will hopefully sustain the business until spring, a lifeline other restaurants lack, but, says Kinsella: “We can still easily go under.”If Lunya does survive it may, to some extent, be down to a letter Kinsella wrote in March. Facing lockdown, on the morning of Wednesday 18 March a group of Liverpool restaurateurs met in the Baltic Triangle area of the city, ostensibly to discuss practicalities. “Things like flushing your water pipes with chlorine then turning the supply off. We had five minutes of that and two hours of everyone being really scared,” remembers Kinsella. “I walked back in the rain streaming with tears, thinking, ‘It’s gone.’ It was a combination of fear and absolute anger.”That anger stemmed from the fact that, at the time, the government was expecting restaurant owners to use personally guaranteed loans to cover bills, to risk their own homes to protect the banks and pay landlords.Back at Lunya, Kinsella bashed out a howl of outrage and posted it on Twitter. Retweeted almost 7,500 times since, his letter addressed not just business but the shame Kinsella felt that he was too busy saving Lunya to focus on his elderly parents or even his wife and Lunya co-founder, Elaine, then beginning treatment for thyroid cancer. “Normally, you’d stop everything and concentrate on that. But for us it was a bit part. We were terrified. But it was two battles of survival, for Elaine and the business.”That afternoon, the Labour MP for Wirral South, Alison McGovern, confronted the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, with Kinsella’s letter in the Treasury select committee. Shortly after, the government stepped in with support. Furlough was welcome, as was access to government-guaranteed bounce-back loans and the VAT cut, but as of October Lunya had received only £39,000 in direct funding. Without its online sales, Lunya would not have survived.Kinsella is proud of that pivot. Remodelling as a mail-order business has been difficult but what that new resilience means is moot: “I’m optimistic we can survive. But optimism’s different to confidence. Confidence is optimism with data and we don’t have that. It’s all projection.”A management consultant in adult social care for 24 years before he fell in love with Spanish food and launched Lunya, Kinsella has been living the foodie dream for the past decade: searching out suppliers across Spain (“I speak Spanish like Borat speaks English”), and flying back to Lunya with his bags stuffed with percebes or tomato rosa (“big, ugly pink-green things, but stunning”) from Barbastro to stick on that night’s specials. Will that ever be feasible again?The stress ebbs and flows. As does Kinsella’s handle on the fact that his plan of retiring in a few years is now “fantasy”. “It’s time to cut back. But at the moment I’m not arsed. We’ve really reassessed.” He is cycling more. He bought a puppy. Thankfully, Elaine is recovering.Processing all this will take years. For now, Kinsella is “energised” and adjusting. “I’m missing Spain,” he concedes. “But, right now, my favourite day would be doing nothing but carving ham and nattering to people.” Like many of us, Kinsella is trying to find peace where he can, one day at a time.Founder, Fowl Mouths food and recipe project, LondonIn the immediate aftermath of the killing of George Floyd, Melissa Thompson was crying all the time. “I was emotional and angry. I felt my head was going to explode. I wanted to scream. People were like, ‘This is really bad’, and I was like, we’ve been trying to tell you this for how long?“The Black Lives Matter movement is, basically, happening because white people are allowing it. Whereas before they just shut down to it. That pisses me off. We have to be ‘grateful’ to be given the space to discuss this. It should have happened ages ago.”That burning frustration explains why an incident of police brutality in the US has become a global examination of every facet of racism. Floyd’s death was like the point of impact on a shattered windscreen, a deep impression from which you could follow faultlines into every area of society: sport, education, fashion, music or, in Thompson’s case, food.On 30 May, the Evening Standard published the video Rhyme for London’s Restaurants. Created by a PR firm, this eight-minute celebration of the capital’s locked-down food scene, recited by its most famous faces, was released to raise money for two charity campaigns, the Standard’s Food For London Now and Hospitality Action’s Covid-19 emergency relief grant. As a London foodie, previously host of the supper club Fowl Mouths and now a development chef, Thompson clicked through expecting the video to, as she later wrote, “conjure up memories of a world that right now seems like a distant dream”.Instead, she was appalled. Of 64 featured talking heads, just one, the Standard food critic Jimi Famurewa, was black. In multicultural London, in a film supposedly hymning the “ersity” of the capital’s food scene, well over 50 of the featured faces were white. A journalist before she moved into food, Thompson called this out on Twitter, and after contact from the politically engaged food newsletter Vittles found herself writing the widely shared essay Black Erasure in the British Food Industry.In the era of Windrush and Grenfell, arguing about representation in a charity video could seem trivial. But by tracking the absence of black food and faces in the media (the lack of visible black chefs and recipe writers how few black-owned restaurants are reviewed by national critics patronising treatment of African and Caribbean dishes), Thompson sought to illustrate how “it’s all part of the same problem”.Part of that learning process is acknowledging why food is such a flashpoint. It is an intimate part of childhood, family and cultural history. Arguably, how we eat defines who we are.“To come in and obliterate that is disrespectful,” says Thompson. When Marco Pierre White makes risible rice and peas or Jamie Oliver his much-mocked “jerk rice”, it is not just laughably clumsy. Given how black communities are barred from celebrating their own food publicly, it is neo-colonial in its arrogance. It is hurtful. “It creates this whole false narrative,” says Thompson. “That’s why people get upset.”Thompson does not want chefs to feel they have to stop cooking cuisine X or Y unless they have roots in that food. Her supper club majored in Japanese karaage fried chicken, which she discovered via her Japanese sister-in-law. But, crucially, when approached to write a book on Japanese food, Thompson, raised in Dorset, declined. “In some cases, imposter syndrome is a valid alarm. I’d been to Japan, but a book? I’d want to spend months there, my knowledge to be tenfold. I don’t think everyone considers that. It’s about respect. Fuchsia Dunlop does it well. She’s heavily immersed in the food culture she profits from. But we don’t see that all the time.”The daughter of Maltese and Jamaican parents, Thompson, now 39, grew up in “really, really white” Weymouth. She “never spoke about being black”. Both personally and professionally “I never wanted my race to define me. But this year I learned that from the moment I was born I’ve never had a choice in that. It’s crystallised a lot.”Thompson describes herself as a “reluctant campaigner”. But as she sees fit, and despite some vile online abuse, she is embracing the opportunities that the Vittles essay has opened up to speak out. She is writing an outspoken column celebrating black talent for BBC Good Food magazine, speaking at public events on issues around black culture and food, and undertaking corporate educational work.These are “tentative steps in the right direction”. Discussion and action often take place online or mainly in London. Outside that “bubble”, Thompson is wary of complacency.“A lot of work is needed. I’m still seeing spaces where there just aren’t black voices – and it’s not about having one black voice it’s about having several. And not limiting people. I’m an optimist. And I’m often disappointed.”The active foregrounding of black chefs in professional kitchens, on TV and radio, which Thompson advocates – as a matter of justice but also to “enrich” food culture (“The food media can get so inward-looking and boring”) – will require white chefs to step back and let others lead. How many of them will willingly make that financial sacrifice?That change must go right down to street-food level, too. “I’ve got friends,” says Thompson, “who apply for food markets and get told, ‘Nah, someone’s already doing African food.’ Africa’s 54 countries. Can you imagine being denied the opportunity to cook pasta at a food market because they’re already doing paella? It’s ridiculous.” Chef-owner, the Pony \u0026amp Trap, Chew Magna, nr BristolOn Wednesday 25 March, chef Josh Eggleton received a call that defined his lockdown. That night, the charity Caring In Bristol (CIB) needed hot food to feed rough sleepers newly housed in hotels and hostels. “This is 2pm,” recalls Eggleton, a fundraising friend of the charity who, last Christmas, organised chefs including Romy Gill to cook for its service users. “We’d closed our chip shops so we went there and cooked all the fish. Bang. Done. What’s next? Turns out Pasta Loco was making loads of lasagne to sell, but had closed. Right, we’ll have that. Before you know it, we’ve set up three kitchens across the city.”Working with Pasta Loco’s Dominic Borel and the owner of Emmeline cafe, Shona Graham, the so-called Cheers Drive ran until October feeding 400 people three times a day, and still continues at a smaller scale. The owner of seven Bristol food businesses, including the Michelin-starred country pub the Pony \u0026amp Trap, 37-year-old Eggleton is a busy man – constantly racing around Somerset in his van, doing interviews in laybys, struggling for phone signal. He could have easily knocked back CIB. But he didn’t. “I just feel it,” he says, trying to articulate his motivation. “I want to help, to feed people. I enjoy problems like that.”In early November, as England entered a second lockdown, Eggleton again ramped up his food aid work. “I’ve been sucking up leftover stock from my restaurants and others,” he explained, so that his kitchens – at the same time as producing retail takeaway meals and veg boxes – could make a planned 700 meals a week for CIB and other community groups until December. He accepts lockdown, despite the disruption to his business: “We need to protect lives.”That attitude and energy explains why, this year, Eggleton has emerged as a key agitator-facilitator among those in Bristol who want the hospitality industry to use its skills and profits to address food inequality. “Covid has exposed a broken system,” says Eggleton. “I want to make food as accessible as possible, and it’s about me understanding how I make that work. The more I do, the more bloody hair-brained schemes I come up with.”Next year promises to be even more radical. In spring 2021, Eggleton will reopen the Pony \u0026amp Trap under a new name as a community interest company, offering baking, foraging and fermentation courses. People will be able to volunteer in its gardens in return for lunch and a veg box, and a set number of people interested in but unable to afford what Eggleton insists will be “some really refined gastronomy” will be invited to eat for free at one of three weekly communal dinners.“It’s a Robin Hood thing,” says Eggleton. “We’re going to charge the rich and give it back to people who need it. That’s the way the world should work: redistribution of wealth.“Dining won’t be a simple transaction of ‘pay us loads of money and we bend over backwards’,” he continues. “That’s the old way. I want my staff to enjoy it. It’ll be like coming to my house. The kitchen will be integrated into the restaurant and people can walk in and watch me. I’m not coming to the table to dress the plate. Pick your plate up and watch me take apart this turbot. Invest in me. I’ll invest in you.”This food foundation (complete with podcast and YouTube channel) was always a long-term plan, but lockdown finally gave Eggleton the time to formulate it. “Other chefs think I’m insane, tearing down a restaurant I spent 15 years building. But that excites me.” Far more so than potentially losing that Michelin star: “I’m not worried. If I can help heal and inspire people through food, that’s my objective now.” The Pony’s name will live on, incidentally, at an imminent “open-plan Pony bistro” in a warehouse next door to the brewery and tap room, Bristol Beer Factory.This former Gordon Ramsay Scholar (“essentially I won a cooking competition and did some stages”) insists he was never the typical, hyper-ambitious fine-dining chef. He loved cooking, the allure of the kitchen and, aged 19, was banging on restaurant doors in New York getting told to “fuck off”. But his time in high-end food was short.Eggleton took on the Pony \u0026amp Trap at 22, not because he thought he was a fantastic chef – he was knocking out lasagne and chips, pork chop with stilton sauce, a ploughman’s – but because he wanted to be his own boss. “Then we started experimenting, reading, refining. How do you make black pudding? How’s mustard made? What’s a lemon posset?”He relished the long hours. Always has done. In his teens, on Saturdays Eggleton would work from 6am to 11pm in chip shops, and sell match-day programmes at Bristol Rovers in between. That “almost addiction” to work and his inquisitive thirst for challenges perhaps explains his recent choices as much as any campaigning zeal.If Eggleton operates at 100mph, he is adamant it is not at the expense of business detail at his venues. He is in constant meetings, phone pinging with sales reports. He has strong senior staff around him, most of them Pony \u0026amp Trap graduates, who, he says (this being “boho Bristol”) embrace his ideas on food equality.But even in boho Bristol business is business. Eggleton’s 150 staff need protecting. In February, before the grand Pony reset, Eggleton will open a second pub, the Queen’s Arms, in Chew Magna, serving sharp pub grub and Sunday roasts. It too is crucial: “It’s always tight. The margins in this industry are screwed. But I have to make it work.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d0777721d3a81b74f831d3918f6ea32fe673068/0_264_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=87ed607c35db71a8157ed4cb2231c164","title":"tottenham arsenal premier league match report","story":"Harry Kane to Son Heung-min: goal. Son to Kane: game over. The most lethal double act in the Premier League were at it again, combining to give Tottenham a 2-0 lead by half-time and the platform for a comfortable return to the top of the table.The numbers alone are worth highlighting. Kane has now scored 14 goals and made 12 assists in all competitions this season, while for Son it is 13 goals and six assists. The pair have built an instinctive understanding and it was stamped all over the second goal in particular, Kane bending his run around Son on a rapid break before accepting the pass and blasting high past Bernd Leno.Son’s opener was more of an inidual effort – and a beautiful one, at that – although Kane did get him up and running and, after that, it was a question as to whether Arsenal’s misfiring attack could penetrate the meanest defence in the ision. Mikel Arteta’s team had a few sniffs and they played on the front foot throughout but most of those present, who included 2,000 home fans, could predict the answer.It was the latest triumph of José Mourinho’s counterattacking gameplan and Kane’s goal meant he became the highest all-time scorer in this derby with 12 – one clear of Emmanuel Adebayor and Bobby Smith.Arsenal’s woes go on. Mired in their worst start to a Premier League season, it is now five defeats in the past seven games in the competition and they cannot buy a break in front of goal. Only the bottom three clubs have scored fewer than their 10 and it felt as though they could have played all night and continued to work their patterns without reward.The atmosphere was a long way from that which is traditionally associated with this fixture but it had to be said that after all of these months of ghost games there was noise and feeling inside the stadium. There might have been only a small number of supporters allowed in but they made themselves heard. The designers of the venue had said the sound would be kept in. This was a good advertisement for the promise.Those present were soon hailing Son for the opening goal and what was a quite magnificent finish. Arsenal knew to be wary of the transitions from their rivals and they had been given a warning about the speed of them in the second minute. Rob Holding played a loose pass to Son and, within the blink of an eye, he had found Kane, who attacked the edge of the area. Kane was fouled by Granit Xhaka but Eric Dier wasted the free-kick.It was an Arsenal move that broke down on the edge of the Spurs area that provided the backdrop to Son’s goal. After Dier had cleared Héctor Bellerín’s cross, Serge Aurier helped the ball up to Kane, who held it up, as Gabriel stepped off him, before ushering Son up the inside-left channel.Everybody knew what Son was going to do but it is one thing knowing and another being able to do anything about it. The execution was breathtaking. Having cut inside and shaped the right-footed curler for the far side of the net, Son had Leno clutching at thin air. Bellerín sank to his knees in anguish.It is difficult to second guess Arteta’s tactical approach before a game. Here, he started with Alexandre Lacazette in a roving role behind Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, which set up a few early clashes between him and Spurs’ holding midfielder, Pierre-Emile Højbjerg. Is that really Lacazette’s position? Thomas Partey was back from injury but, frustratingly, he lasted only until the 45th minute.Arsenal pressed on to the front foot but they failed to work Hugo Lloris, who had been passed fit after a health scare, in the first half.Spurs’ second goal felt like a killer blow for Arsenal and it was shocking, from their point of view, how they left themselves with two defenders against four counterattackers after Aurier had intercepted another Bellerín cross and set Giovani Lo Celso away. He found Son and there was an inevitability about what happened after that. Kane’s overlapping run was well timed the finish from a tight angle was lashed in off the underside of the crossbar.Arteta pushed his full-backs high at the start of the second half and it added up to him going for broke in light of how threatening Spurs were on the break. The visitors needed the next goal before they were picked off again and they had a couple of openings straight away. Lacazette drew a save out of Lloris with a flicked header from a free-kick before Kieran Tierney picked out Aubameyang with a lovely cross. The Arsenal captain headed high – a bad miss.Arsenal had all of the possession and they camped inside the Spurs half after the interval but their only other real chance came on 68 minutes when Lloris fumbled a Lacazette header around his post. Arsenal kept going and they kept crossing but Spurs kept clearing. Mourinho has never lost a home game against Arsenal and he never looked like relinquishing the record. His celebrations upon the final whistle were heavy on emotion."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce0d59786f37a7d6443ce375fd385b81377d63bb/0_13_3465_2080/master/3465.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b44960343052cf06cdcf284b9ca43d3e","title":"liverpool v wolves premier league live","story":"62 min A Wolves change: the teenager Fabio Silva replaces Ruben Neves, which means a switch to 4-2-3-1. 61 min “I have no problem with the argument that Liverpool had with the officials on that penalty call,” says Mary Waltz. “But the outrage by any fan of any team about ing is out of bounds. There are multiple incidents of ing to draw a foul or penalty in virtually every fixture by every team. Some, Neymar for example, are more dramatic then others but the tactic is universal. I don’t like it but denying the reality that it happens every match is laughable.”59 min “We are awful Rob,” says Stephen Carr. “Bill Hicks said it best – ‘I’m tired of this back-slappin’ “isn’t humanity neat” bullshit. We’re a virus with shoes.’”Fairtrade shoes, though, right? If not, that might be problematic.Liverpool shredded Wolves on the counter-attack. Henderson lobbed a long pass forward to Wijnaldum, who ran at the backpedalling Coady and shaped a beautiful shot into the top corner from 20 yards. Rui Patricio had no chance.Gini Wijnaldum seals victory with a blistering goal!58 min: Great defending from Fabinho! The second corner was played short to Traore, who curled a dangerous ball behind the outrushing Liverpool defence. Coady took it down on the chest and was about to shoot when Fabinho (I think) appeared to boot the ball to safety.57 min Traore, who has switched to the left, wins a corner off Williams. It’s played short and driven to the far post, where Kelleher flaps it behind for another corner. He played it safe, and rightly so.55 min “As soothingly nostalgic as it is to hear Tyldesley and McCoist enjoying a good-natured chuckle in the commentary box, has their standard of chat devolved into a parody of itself?” asks Antony Sheffield.I’ve really enjoyed it personally. McCoist and Jon Champion are the gold standard, but he works well with Tyldesley too. There’s been plenty of insight in between the sideways glances the best of both worlds.54 min “Hi Rob,” says Mike MacKenzie. “Kevin Smith’s friends are right about Kelleher’s name, I think ... I thought the middle ‘e’ was missing in the first half but it appears to be there now! Shirt change at HT?”The wonders of 3D printing.53 min Robertson charges into the area and wins another corner. Even by his standards, he is having a barnstorming game.52 min Mane misses an excellent chance, sidefooting well wide from Robertson’s precise cross. Liverpool are well on top.50 min Semedo’s long cross is well held by the stretching Kelleher. He’s had a really good night, though Wolves haven’t tested him as much as they should have done.49 min “Evening Rob,” says Stephen Carr. “I thought I’d wade into the ing debate that’s underway. I’m always surprised how it’s perceived as being somehow worse than a foul. We seem to accept, for example, ‘taking a yellow for the team’ by stopping a counter-attack with a foul yet ing is deemed to be an appalling act of duplicity.”Whereas trying to break someone’s legs is just banter. It’s all a load of nonsense. We’re an awful species.48 min There’s a break in play because of a problem with the referee’s technology.47 min Henderson’s long pass to the edge of the Wolves area is pulled down brilliantly on the stretch by Mane. He waits for it to bounce and slaps a shot that is saved comfortably by Rui Patricio.46 min Peep peep! Liverpool begin the second half.“I’m not watching at the moment but friends are telling me that Kelleher’s name on the back of his kit is actually spelt ‘Kellher’,” says Kevin Smith. “Can you confirm this for myself and other MBM readers?”If he ever turns round, I’ll let you know.“Sorry, but there is nothing for Coady to argue here (e.g. that he anticipated contact, as you wrote),” says Oliver. “That’s a e as blatant as they come and it beats me how he was not booked. One imagines what would have happened, if a certain Egyptian (or players from Portugal, Spain etc) would have done this.”There’s no need to apologise you’re entitled to an opinion. The more I see it the more I think it was a e, but it was still based on the assumption of contact. Besides, all footballers e so I don’t really understand the disproportionate opprobrium towards Coady. Fabinho, in particular, was sneering at Coady as if he’d never seen a player e in his life.“Many football clubs do excellent work in the communities from which they draw their fans - Everton In The Community is often cited as an exemplar,” says Gary Naylor. “Perhaps clubs can draw on such groups’ advice and contacts to show that not only do Black Lives Matter, but Black Fans Matter too. Random ballots of season ticket holders are producing crowds that, predictably, lack ersity (visually at least) lending a whiff of hypocrisy to the pre-kick off gesture. Clubs need to be more imaginative and strategic in the allocation of scarce tickets.” This is an excellent point, and I’ve nothing much to add really. There is so much that needs to be done.“Why no caution for simulation to Coady?” asks Richard McGahey.I don’t think you can show yellow cards when an incident is checked by VAR. Also, I’m not sure it was a e so much as a reflex because he thought he was about to be kicked by Mane. Only Conor Coady will know for sure. Well, him and 40,000 people on Twitter.Peep peep! Liverpool lead through a ruthless finish from Mo Salah, who took advantage of a rare mistake from Conor Coady. It was a pretty miserable half for Coady against his old club: Wolves won a penalty when he went down after a challenge from Sadio Mane, but it was overturned by VAR.45+1 min Well that was fun. NO PENALTY! That’s the right decision, I think, though Coady will argue he fell because he anticipated contact. Coady anticipated the contact and went down. Liverpool got a penalty like at Sheffield United on the opening day of the 2006-07 season, but I think this will be reversed.This might be overturned. Mane pulled his foot away at the last minute and I’m not sure he made contact.Liverpool are utterly fuming about this. There was a game of head tennis in the area, until Coady nipped in front of Mane and went down. The Liverpool players accuse him of ing. It’s hard to see whether there was contact or not, and it’s being checked by VAR.42 min Neto is fouled just outside the area on the left by Matip...41 min Moutinho’s cross is headed away by Matip to Firmino, who waits for the ball to bounce and scissor-kicks a spectacular long pass out to Mane on the left. Nothing comes of it but it was the most brilliant pass.40 min Mane’s long-range shot smacks Boly in the face.

Thanks all for your company and comments, sorry I didn’t get to use them all. Ta-ra! Mourinho says it “a big game in every sense” and here we go. “I want to give big congratulations to Mikel, because he gave us a very difficult game”! Yes, he’s back. Ouch! He goes on to say that Arsenal have a good “tactical culture” and good players they’re a good team and Arteta is a good manager.He praises two brilliant goals, and they read the game and made the changes to win it, dropping into a low block, and praises Arsenal for forcing them to, but also makes clear that he didn’t want to take any risks given a 2-0 advantage. When it’s put to him that Kane and Son are world-class players, he adds “Working like animals, all the respect for animals, I love animals, don’t get me wrong.” Yeah, he back. He reckons the run of games, City, Chelsea, Spurs, might’ve been an excuse for his team to drop, but they’ve taken seven points from nine and are top of the leagiue. Here’s our match report!Spurs are 11 points ahead of Arsenal after 11 games. Goodness me.In fairness, some of these were good – it’s not Moyes’ Man United v Fulham territory.If I was a Spurs fan looking to be concerned, I’d be slightly concerned that in order to win today, they needed two incredible finishes, the quality of which you won’t see every week. But otherwise, it’s easy to see how and why the method will work: they’re brilliant on the counter, and have players to kill you if you invite them on. They have options. Elsewhere, the Sakhir Grand Prix is nearing its end...“Not a great watch,” says Graeme Souness of Spurs. I wonder if, now they’re settling, we’ll see them play a little more expansively in the easier games, because though Souness says Mourinho’s always that way, it’s not really true. His first Chelsea team did it both ways.Spurs have Palace next, then Liverpool. If they win both, we’ll know they’re title contenders. “Exactly what we set out for,” says Harry Kane. He thinks Spurs played well in the first half and ground it out in the second, and he’s pleased to be the leading scorer in Spurs-Arsenal derbies – “Yeah, no, it’s niiice.” He reckons he and Son are nearing their peaks in understanding the game and goes on to explain that the team are extremely together – “It’s one of them” – and says Arsenal played well in the second half, but didn’t create many clear-cut chances.“I’ve never known anyone agree with me Keane was the best Premier League player,” says PB. “Ferdinand though ... nooooo way. He had a mistake in him til the end. And that year off....”Keane won Keane won seven titles in nine seasons, and in one of the ones he didn’t, he did his cruciate in September. I’m not sure what to say about Ferdinand – he was extremely consistent, and for years. “I’m a bit late for the party,” confesses Alexandre Chesneau, “but I wanted to react on the debate about the best players. It always amazed me how football has this kind of disdain for its predecessors. Past scientists not knowing a thing about basic stuff like relativity, or past generals having no clue about how to use planes or tanks efficiently, is not a factor when speaking about them because we know they simply couldn’t know about that and can’t be judged with these factors.Yet with football, I often see arguments like ‘take 1960s Pelé and play him today, he wouldn’t hold a candle to modern day players because of tactical and physical considerations’ (and that’s not mentioning even older geniuses than Pelé who aren’t well known because of lack of media attention in their time). It’s nonsensical, isn’t it? It’s like having your descendant from 2200 appear in front of you and says you’re stupid because you don’t know how to time travel. How would you react ?So yeah we just have to admit that comparing players across eras is just going to be flawed. Nobody knows just how good Sindelar would be had he been born in this time, just like we don’t know how Messi would be seen today had he been born in 1960.”I agree with all of this but the last line: Messi would’ve been brilliant in the 60s. Otherwise, though, the best players in any era would be among the best players in any era, and I’ve found that in every era, there are some players who look like they’re playing in the future. Duncan Edwards, Pele, George Best and Ronaldo Nazario stand out in that aspect. Of course, Spurs will only stay top if Liverpool fail to beat Wolves by nine goals. Join Rob Smyth to see how they go, NOW. That’s one win in seven for Arsenal, who are 15th. Dearie me.There you go. Spurs are top of the league! 90+2 min “I think Jose is beginning to like this team,” says Gary Nev, and that’s a fair point. In his last job, it seemed like he was personally offended and disgusted by the players he had – the ones left him and the ones he bought – and that’s not so now. 90+1 min Rodon replaces Bergwijn. Spurs now have a back six. 90 min There’ll be three added minutes. 90 min “One of the intrigues of latter-period Wenger,” says Christopher Faherty, “is that there were little sparks here and there that he recognised a need for change in the mentality of the dressing room with various transfer targets (Suarez in 2013, Vardy four years later) without ever carrying it through. Letting the memory of summer 2011 (‘You cannot say you are a big club if you sell Fabregas and Nasri’ – sells Fabregas and Nasri) ghost him into giving Ozil that big contract because Sanchez left was unforgivable though.”I agree on the mentality point, but he seemed to buy a lot of touch players - Hleb, Rosicky, various others - and very few who could go on the outside. So if a team sat back against Arsenal, they could only go side to side.88 min Son departs, with Moura arriving. Bale remains sitting at the side. 88 min Tierney swings the ball in and Nketiah touches it back, but Ceballos can only drive wide. 86 min You’ve got to be impressed at the buy-in Mourinho has got from his players – they’re following his instructions to a tee, and it’s working. My guess is he got Kane on-side and everything else followed. 84 min Decent ball from Lacazette, which Aubameyang takes in stride, attacking Alderweireld. I’m sure he wants to shape outside and pop inside, but mindful that the defender knows that, he drives onto the his left foot and drills a shot which is blocked at source with a fine slide-tackle. 82 min For all their pressure, Arsenal have only created one proper chance – that Lacazette header. But here comes Gabriel, driving forward to find Willian, and his cross is a decent one ... but Reguilon does just about enough, forcing Saka to jump over the back of him which stops his man from making a decent contact.81 min Son curls in the free-kick and both Dier and Kane are well-placed to score Kane heads wide, but both went early in any case. 80 min Reguilon, now a wing-back, skates forward, so Lacazette yanks him down. He’s booked. 78 min The thing about Arteta is that when you appoint an inexperienced manager, you have to expect it to take time to learn. It worked for Dalglish when he got the Liverpool job because he took over a fully-formed team, and it worked for Guardiola at Barca because he had the greatest midfield ever and maybe the greatest player ever. But management is absolutely nails – Alex Ferguson got fired from St Mirren, his second job.76 min Arteta sends Nketiah on for Bellerin. I’m a little surprised at that, as Bellerin has been a decent outlet. 75 min Xhaka goes in the back of Son on a matter of principle. Well, I think that’s the reason because there was no other compelling case, and he’s booked - for his third tackle worthy of such. No style is morally dubious, I don’t think, but an injury to Son or Kane – who do their fair share of dynamic sprinting – will change everything. 72 min Yup, Davies replaces Lo Celso. Good luck finding space in amongst that. 71 min “Playing like what?” asks Mike. “I presume you mean lower-possession, counter-attacking, semi-bus parking? I might agree with you, except, if we go by what they’ve shown thus far (not a huge sample size, but reasonable), why not? They’ve beaten different teams with different proclivities. Notably City, also United, Southampton, Brighton, who play more attacking...but also your Burnleys, West Broms, etc.”It’s not about whether the system works now, and who against – players are fit, things are going well – but whether it will work over the course of 38 games. Leicester are the only team to win a title playing like that, and they were the only good team in the league that season. 69 min Mourinho is seeing it too. Ben Davies is getting ready - he’ll either replace Reguilon, or come on for an attacker to make a third centre-back. I think we can guess which it’ll be. 68 min Arsenal have kept at it and again they try to go around the sides, Bellerin clipping a cross for Lacazette on which he gets a decent head ... but Lloris is able to scramble it around the post. The corner comes to nowt, but we’re seeing how you take it to Spurs – either outside the full-backs, or in the space between full-backs and centre-backs. 65 min “Good afternoon Mr Harris,” says Chris Ross. “You could have walked it in about an hour.”That’s true, but it was caning it down with rain, my phone was dead so though I think I know the way it would’ve been a bold step, and once I got on the first bus I ended up not an hour away. 63 min “I had hoped for Xhaka once,” says Zach Neeley, “but, from many choices, for me his constant inclusion is the most damning sign of how bad we are.”Yes, I can see that. He’s not dreadful, and the reason he keeps getting picked isn’t because managers think he’s brilliant, it’s that the alternatives are worse. But I do wonder if Partey and Ceballos will be the two who start most games, along with a more attacking player. 63 min Arsenal try and go around Spurs, which Hojbjerg and Sissoko force you to do. Again, Tierney slings over a decent cross, but there’s no one in the box to attack it. 61 min I guess the other thing is you look at a game like this one, and Spurs have barely mustered an attack save the goals, both of which required unbelievable finishes. You don’t get those that often. 59 min Do we think it’s possible for Spurs to win the league playing like this? My inclination is not – there are games against teams who’ll sit back – but they have plenty of guile and loads of different options too. Assuming a fair run with injuries, it’ll be the defence that costs them – if anything. If I was Mourinho, I’d already be pestering for a right-back when the window opens.57 min “With the advent of The OvergroundTM, surely this is the Under-Over grudge match,” emails Dvid Hunter. “No direct route, naturally.”Trudat. It once took me three hours to get home from a game at White Hart Lane to Stroud Green, where I lived. My phone was dead so my wife was intrigued to know whether or not I was still alive. 56 min Ceballos has made a difference to the game I wonder if, when Partey is back, those will be Arteta’s two to start. But Arsenal need a goal because the flow won’t be like this for the next 35 minutes.55 min “Every time United and Arsenal play, one sees the familiar lament about fallen giants and so on,” says Digvijay Yadav. “The result at OT notwithstanding, the talent at United’s disposal is significantly superior to the one present at Arsenal. It’s never as bad as it seems etc etc. but Arsenal seem light years behind the rest of the top teams. If they don’t qualify for it this year, then next year will be their fifth consecutive outside the CL.”Yup, that’s Arsenal’s level now and it’s hard to see it changing in the short-term because they don’t have the money to chuck at it and because their young players, though good, aren’t necessarily world-beaters. 53 min “Interested to know who your top keeper would be,” returns Richard Hirst. “Given the difficulty of comparing across eras because of fitness, kit, pitches etc, I think you’d struggle to find someone better than Yashin, era-adjusted.”I don’t know how we adjust by the era, but the best I’ve seen is Schmeichel, who looked like he was keeping in the future. I’d also allow Buffon. 50 min Arsenal have started the half well and make good ground, this time down the right. But Bellerin’s low cross eludes is too good for Lacazette, who doesn’t slide for it, and Spurs counter my Sky cuts out so I don’t see what happens next, but they don’t score and Mourinho is laughing, so presumably there’s someone suffering something somewhere. 49 min Better from Arsenal, Tierney swinging over a terrific cross from way out on the left that picks out Aubameyang in the middle! It’s a free header too, he leaps well ... and can’t get over it so the ball goes over. That’s a bad miss – a terrible miss in the context.48 min Gary Nev is also struggling to find a way for Arsenal, saying that the dynamic here reminds him of losing to Rafael Bennitez’s sides: you dominate possession, think you’re better than them, and then lose the game because they defend deep and break well.47 min Arsenal win a free-kick down the right which Saka curls in, fast and flat ... and Lacazette gets the flick, but Lloris is down sharply to save. 47 min Ah, Arsenal have made a half-time change: Partey, who stepped off the pitch hurt – that doesn’t sound right, does it? – when Spurs were in the process of breaking to score the second, has been replaced by Ceballos.46 min I really don’t know what Arsenal do here. They’ll be petrified of committing to attack, but how are they going to score without serious numbers inside the box?46 min Off we go again. “I’m probably not the first and hopefully won’t be the last to credit Jose with adding a little extra to Harry’s game,” emails Shane O’Leary.They’ve done a lot for each other – to me, Kane’s done a lot to restore Mourinho’s Missing Mojo, which should be the third song on Abbey Road. “We may have no chance of top four,” says Louis Allen, “but I’d be more than happy with 10th and another FA Cup final. Let Spurs have their third place. As Arsenal fans were constantly reminded 2005-14, trophies are everything and we’ve had two victories over Chelsea in recent years I wouldn’t swap for much.”Yes, that’s fair. I wouldn’t say trophies are everything, but they absolutely contribute the memories and moments that stay with us. The thing is, qualifying for the Champions League gives a club revenue that allows it to build towards more of those moments.

Don’t feel guilty. Research shows a brief kip boosts productivity. But will it catch on in the office?Naps need to hire a publicist. Not in China, where desk-side snoozes are a constitutional right Japan, where inemuri (“sleeping while present”) is a sign you’ve been working hard or Spain, where siestas are woven into the social fabric. But in the UK, US, Australia and many other western countries – where capitalist rat races are fuelled by flat whites and billable hours – naps have a major image problem. They’re linked with laziness and lethargy with people who can’t be bothered to get through the day.Yet now is the perfect time to rebrand them as something we associate with a productive lifestyle. Go for a run! Guzzle a green juice! Take a nap! With a large proportion of people working from home (it is estimated that half the UK workforce will still be doing so at the end of 2020), lots of us have more control than ever over what our working day looks like. Our boss overlords have been forced to loosen the reins. Aside from those awkward Zoom team check-ins we’re pretty much free to do as we please as long as we get our work done. Should we so desire, we can take a 20-minute kip after lunch and emerge pin-sharp for a busy afternoon. After all, the sofa is right there, beckoning us over to enjoy a moment of shut-eye.Yet the numbers would surely be far bigger if naps had a better reputation. It wasn’t always like this. Salvador Dalí, Aristotle, Winston Churchill, Eleanor Roosevelt, Margaret Thatcher – all powerhouses from history, all great nappers. But somewhere in recent decades, naps disappeared from the zeitgeist. These days they feel less “power”, more “cat”. One London-based PR who’s been enjoying mid-afternoon snoozes lately said I could quote her provided I didn’t mention her name. “I’m conscious my work might not yet be on board with the idea of me napping,” she said conspiratorially, adding: “The stigma needs to lift.”That shift can start now. Presumably the more people embrace naps while working from home at home, the more likely it is that the habit will infiltrate office culture if and when we do return. Given that companies are revising their relationships with employees and rethinking office floorplans, it’s not so farfetched to imagine nap pods sprouting up in quiet corners.I’m prepared to put my hand up for the PR job and help spread the word, though I confess I have a vested interest: I’m already a serial napper. As a dopey Aussie forever on the verge of drifting into dreamland, I’ve always been sceptical of those who smash eight hours’ sleep at night and power through each day. Being awake for 16 hours straight has always seemed to me like an awfully long stretch of time.Am I an overgrown toddler still learning how to navigate the grown-up world, or are naps a legitimate tool to make our days more fruitful? As we prepare to enter what could be a golden age of kipping, let’s consider not just how to bump the stigma, but whether it’s worth doing so. Do naps deserve good press?Napping is at least as old as the Romans, who loved a sexta hora: a sleep in the sixth hour of the waking day, around noon (this became “siesta”). For a long time humans were biphasic, taking sleep over two sessions during a 24-hour period (one in the day, one at night), rather than monophasic, in one night-time chunk. This continued until the invention of the electric lightbulb in the 19th century, which enabled factories to keep employees at work for longer hours, meaning they only returned home at night to sleep.Naps, says Mednick – now associate professor of psychology at the University of California, Riverside, and author of 2006 book Take a Nap! Change Your Life – fit neatly into our circadian rhythm, the 24-hour cycle of our bodies. “When people get this dip in the middle of the day, your body temperature decreases and your cognitive processes are not as strong. It’s usually when people get a coffee, but it used to be when you would take a nap,” she says, speaking to me over Zoom, her pink hair complementing bright red spectacles. “We still have that rhythm inside us that would benefit from a short nap but we don’t live in a world where people feel at liberty to do that – until now.”I’m given tips aplenty. The best time to nap is between 1pm and 3pm and no later than 4pm, or it might affect your overnight sleep. (Also if you’re struggling to sleep at night, avoid napping.) Don’t stress about actually falling asleep you can reap benefits even if you don’t drift off. For shorter naps it’s best to sit slightly upright, or lie on top of the covers, rather than ing under the duvet, which will send you into a deeper state and result in grogginess. And set an alarm – unless you’re game to try what’s called a “danger” nap (who says there’s no room to be wild in 2020?).Given their lethargic reputation, it’s striking that naps are being embraced by certain agenda-setters who trade in optimising performance. Nick Littlehales, an elite-sports sleep coach and author, has worked with Manchester United, Real Madrid and the British cycling team. He wants us to get 7 ½ hours total sleep in each 24-hour cycle, split between night- and daytime slumber. The point is to be flexible, adapting each day depending on schedule and natural rhythms: you could sleep six hours at night and 90 minutes during the day then seven hours at night with a 30-minute nap. It’s intended to relieve stress. “All our natural recovery breaks have been ripped apart by technology and 247 globalisation. This is putting nocturnal sleep, trying to sleep for eight hours in one block at night, under real pressure,” he says, whose approach is applicable to mortals – especially those with flexible work set-ups – as well as footballers. “In today’s world, the multiphasic approach is key to success.”Littlehales’s language is important. He speaks about naps as proactive, productive tools to ensure we remain in peak shape. He says we need to think about them from “a performance aspect: daytime sleep is a controlled recovery period.”Such talk chimes with Silicon Valley’s tech titans, who in recent years have installed nap pods (Facebook) and “Shhh zones” (Google). Coming from multi-billion-dollar players obsessed with efficiency, it’s significant. “Think about that: 10 or 15 years ago, if you were caught napping on the job, you could be fired. Now, they’re building facilities to encourage it,” says Dr Matthew Walker, a professor of neuroscience at the University of California, Berkeley, whose bestselling 2017 book Why We Sleep catapulted slumber to the top of C-suite conversations. “I do think that’s exciting,” he continues, but “are we seeing that transition into the mainstream? No, not yet.”Why? “Partly it’s the whole ‘time is money’ thing, and revving, revving, revving – the idea that a highly caffeinated society is a working society,” says Mednick. “That’s a very western tradition the eastern tradition may actually be more holistic.” There’s also the fact that naps might not be for everyone. Much like coffee versus tea or smooth versus crunchy peanut butter, naps are a population ider. There’s no middle ground: people either do or don’t identify as a napper. But can anyone learn?Genetics dictate our chronotypes – whether we’re a morning “lark” or a night “owl” – and owls tend to get sleepier during the day so are more prone to zizzing. Beyond this, experts seem ided. Some, including Ramlakhan and Cara Moore, founder of UK consultancy ProNappers (who wants to “get the whole nation napping”), insist anyone can become a napper.Others disagree. Mednick cites a study she conducted that questioned whether people who identified as non-nappers got the same rewards from a nap as nappers. The results showed that non-nappers awoke feeling worse and didn’t get “any” cognitive benefits. She then put the non-nappers through a four-week training programme, but they showed no improvement. “From our study, it doesn’t look like napping is a trainable skill. You either have it or you don’t,” she says, adding that the underlying genetics are hazy but relate to different brains’ electrical impulses. Even so, this only accounts for those people who, genetically speaking, aren’t nappers – it doesn’t cover those who could be nappers, but don’t try due to stigma. Mednick estimates that about half the world’s population are genetically nap-compatible.A broad cultural shift might depend on what qualifies as a nap. Some aficionados argue that you don’t need to fall asleep, it’s more about closing your eyes, emptying your mind and removing yourself from the rat race – like meditating but with an emphasis on being vacant, not present.Ramlakhan, who is lobbying CEOs to speak openly about their napping habits and thus remove shame, imagines a future in which it’s acceptable to sit at your desk, “in an open-plan office, wearing your headphones, and close your eyes”. Again, it’s about more than sleep. “The overarching message is we don’t have to be ‘over-efforting’ to be productive. We don’t need to be burnt out and running on adrenaline to demonstrate we’re doing a good job,” she says.If our working-from-home habits do seep into workplaces, this could be a realistic vision. Here’s hoping. In an era obsessed with productivity, the most productive thing of all might be to shut off our brains and let ourselves drift off.

As you know, I didn’t follow government advice and … I apologise again, unreservedly.“While I realise the apologetic words of a pop star might not carry much weight, especially one who has broken the rules like I have, I do realise some might seek to follow my example. “My message to them is simple: please don’t. The guilt and shame I’ve carried this week for my mistake aren’t worth it. Instead, continue to listen to the government advice and the voices of the heroes of the NHS and take the required precautions.”She added she hoped “to one day make it up to the public who have given me so much support over the years and, in particular, make it up to the heroes of the NHS”.She also said she has taken a subsequent coronavirus test, which again was negative."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b69339dfb306c92b0100eeb883be58bb4d59ad6/388_1089_4881_2927/master/4881.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=a94bf15f231a3b6fe0ed4c5f40743b00","title":"south africa v england odi abandoned 30 minutes before start after covid positives","story":"England’s tour of South Africa lurched back into crisis on Sunday when the first one-day international was cancelled and two members of Eoin Morgan’s touring party tested positive for Covid-19.The match in Paarl had officially become the series-opener after a positive case in the South African camp on Friday – their third since England’s arrival on 17 November – led to the initial fixture at Newlands being called off and a fresh round of testing ordered for the home squad. But an hour before the start of play it became apparent this game was in doubt when neither team appeared at the ground.The announcement of a delayed start was then followed by the match’s full cancellation. Monday’s second ODI will not take place until Tuesday at the earliest, and the entire tour is in jeopardy. England still have an enlarged 18-man squad here – down from 23 during their 3-0 series win in the Twenty20s – and the new “best-case” scenario is described as two back-to-back 50-over matches at Newlands on Tuesday and Wednesday.Little is certain after England were told at 5pm on Saturday that two members of staff at the Vineyard hotel – the base for both teams – had tested positive for the virus, one of whom had been working in close contact with the tourists.The England camp was immediately tested again that evening and two positive results came back in the morning. All players and support staff were then forced to isolate in their rooms, although this was later relaxed to allow everyone bar the two positive cases some limited use of the outdoor areas.In the joint statement announcing the cancellation of the match, these were described as “unconfirmed positives” and it is understood that England’s medical lead on tour, Dr Moiz Moghal, has requested independent verification of the results.The two cases in question are reporting no symptoms and there is said to be a query over unusually high levels of viral load shown up in their respective PCR tests England’s suspicion here is that two false positives may have been returned.If the cases are confirmed following this new analysis, the two unnamed members of the touring party face a 10-day isolation period before being permitted to leave South Africa, pushing them beyond the team’s departure via charter flight on Thursday.Anyone deemed to be a close contact – at least 15 minutes face-to-face in the 48 hours before their latest round of tests – may also have to stay behind. The bulk of the squad are due a rare Christmas at home, although Lewis Gregory, Liam Livingstone, Tom Curran, Jason Roy and Sam Billings are meant to head to Australia for the Big Bash League.There remains an obvious will among the top-level administrators of both boards to get some more cricket played before the end of the tour. However the sense of unease at this prospect is growing.For Cricket South Africa, already struggling financially, a wiped out three-match series would see it lose an estimated £1.5m and threatens upcoming visits by Sri Lanka, Australia and Pakistan during this home season.The England and Wales Cricket Board, meanwhile, will be reluctant to abandon a tour early in response to a relatively small number of cases given the precedent this may set before a packed 2021 home summer that includes a lucrative visit by India.There is clear frustration, however, that after an English season which did not return a single positive test result during the visits of West Indies (men and women), Pakistan, Ireland and Australia, the biosecure set-up in South Africa has not worked. The first of the home side’s three positive cases was detected by initial screening on 18 November - before their players came together in Cape Town - with the second, two days after their arrival, believed to have been successfully isolated also.There was then a 10-day gap before a third player reported symptoms at the start of this apparent recent outbreak, leaving the hotel owners and CSA baffled as to how the integrity of the so-called bio-secure bubble had been compromised.The hotel staff have been staying on site throughout the tour, with the perimeter guarded by security and overseen by the Claremont police.The two squads cannot mix and there is a rota for common areas, which are cleaned in between usage.No one can enter or leave for matches or training unless in an assigned vehicle – the drivers also stay on site – and though golf has also been permitted at nearby Boschenmeer, players do not come into contact with outsiders and there are strict hygiene protocols in place.All hotel staff were retested on Saturday and returned a full set of negatives on Sunday. Further confusion comes from the fact that two positive staff members have been working in different designated zones throughout."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f762570cd22d7f7c5ab12a3db4ed72601289d7af/0_355_5320_3191/master/5320.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c47afa27dc88168d076b44928b7929ff","title":"sakhir grand prix formula one live","story":"Sergio Pérez won a grand prix for the first time in his career after an pulsating race in Bahrain Here is the report.Thanks for joining me for such a silly race. What a day for Sergio Perez and for my quick-typing fingers. Giles Richards’ report is to come very soon.The lads make it onto the podium. The contrast of pink and black suited teams celebrating is nice to see. Sergio Perez celebrates his first win at the 190th time of asking. Few could have expected to heat the Mexican national anthem at this stage.Hugh Molloy emails: “That went from potentially being my favourite race of all time, with Russell hitting Perez’s DRS window with a couple to go, to probably the most disappointing.”Ocon on his first podium: “I have no words, I cried on the line. It’s been a tough season, it hasn’t paid off all the time but we never stopped pushing.”Stroll: “A part of me is a little bit disappointed - I could have won the race.”Perez on his future: “What happens is not so much in my hands. If I don’t have a seat next year, I will be back in 2022.”Jack emails to praise my work. I feel as emotional as Sergio. Jack says: “Thanks for all your time today. 58 sec lap times are really quick for someone to respond to online.”Perez: “I am speechless. I hope I am not dreaming, as I have dreamt so many year of being in this moment. It’s incredible. I don’t know what to say.“It was all about not giving up, recovering and keep going. We won it today on merit.”Lapping at 57 seconds or so a time makes this ruddy difficult, I must admit. Manic stuff trying to work out what has happened.Will Red Bull now be picking up Perez for next season?Utterly disastrous stuff for Mercedes. I cannot wait to find out their explanation for the double parking in the pit lane.Plenty of joy in the Racing Point garage. What a cracking day for them. The crew and Perez are bouncing up and down. Perez is very emotional and lets out a few tears. What a day for him.What he said.Perez was in last place on the first lap but he has recovered to win the race. Incredible. What a day for Racing Point as Perez wins his first Grand Prix!Lap 8687: Perez has a 10 second lead and it really is a formality. Russell moves into the top 10 after going past Gasly. At least he will end the race with something.Lap 8587: Perez is in control and only a mistake will cost him now. Lap 8487: Racing Point looking to get two on the podium, which would be a fine result for them.Lap 8387: Russell is just outside the points in 12th. He is looking to work his way up the field.Lap 8287: Have Mercedes ever had a worse race where both drivers have finished? I cannot remember one. Bottas says his tyres are “terrible”, to make matters worse.Lap 8187: Perez is told to keep pushing and keep his tyre temperature up in order to secure his first F1 victory. Russell to be investigated over potentially fitting incorrect tyres.Lap 8087: Perez is miles ahead now, well almost nine seconds. Lap 7987: Mercedes will not remember this day fondly. What a disaster it has been since Aitken’s accident and the double pitting. Lap 7887: Russell is pitting again as he has a puncture. His race is run. What a shame. His podium place is out of the window. He comes out in 15th.Lap 7787: Bottas knackered tyres see him overtaken by Sainz, Ricciardo and Albon. Not a great day for the man who started on pole. Call it off mate. A puncture for Bottas, it would seem.Lap 7687: Russell is the fastest man on the track but it is still going to be tough.Michael Keane says: “We all knew that Hamilton had the best car on the grid, but are we learning that he had the better car in the team!? Russell playing an absolute blinder here!”Lap 7487: Are there enough laps here for Russell to get back into first? It is going to be hard work, that is for sure. Sainz is moaning about Bottas being very slow. Mate, he has rubbish tyres as his pit stop was rubbish.Lap 7387: There is a bit of time for Russel to make up: 3.3 seconds to be precise. Lap 7287: Russell does for Stroll on the first turn by undertaking him. The Brit is now in third. Lap 7187: Russell can still win this and has just shown his overtaking qualities. If he can repeat that move a couple more times, he could get beyond Perez still. Lap 7087: Russell with some superb driving overtakes Bottas and he can leave his teammate behind him. Lap 6987: Can Mercedes chase down Racing Point? Russell has the tyres to do so, Bottas probably does not. Will they let the younger driver take the lead?Lap 6887: Perez is looking to show people what he can do here as he is still looking for a seat next season. We are back racing again!Lap 6787: Russell is told “there should be a big tyre advantage”, to which the driver says “I f-ing hope so” or words to that effect.Lap 6687: The Mercedes double pit stop has cost Russell plenty of time there, too, leaving him in fifth. Perez is in the lead, Ocon second and Stroll third. The Mercedes post-mortem will be fun.Lap 6587: The Bottas pit stop took over 27 seconds and they sent him out with the same tyres on. Oooooooof that has gone atrociously. Lap 6487: The actual safety car involving a human driver has needed to go out. Mercedes are taking the chance to pit stop. Bottas’ pit stop was an utter farce with his brakes on fire. That took an age and he leaves the garage in fifth spot. That was useless. Lap 6387: Aitken has lost his front wing and left it on the track, meaning the VSC is back involved. Hopefully someone can retrieve it soon. Lap 6287: Russell might be feeling some pressure at the front. He has led from the beginning and it is a difficult role to be in.Lap 6187: Norris is currently in 11th and has been told to go flat out for the next 27 laps. Can he make a move up the field?Lap 6087: Russell has a five and a half second lead over his current teammate Bottas.Lap 5987: Perez is up to third! He is driving superbly and aggressively, which is a good combination.Lap 5887: Thomas Wright emails to say: “I bet every driver and mechanic in Bahrain are urging George Russell on.”You would hope so.Lap 5787: Perez goes past Stroll as the American locks up. Perez is in fourth now.Lap 5687: Hopefully Latifi’s car will be moved quickly. The other drivers are using the time to pit. We are back racing.Lap 5587: A yellow flag at turn eight as Latifi pulls off. His race is done. We might need the virtual safety car here.Lap 5487: Russell is losing a tenth of a second on Bottas. What could the issue be? One for the boffins to work out or is it just his lack of experience in the Mercedes? Lap 5287: Bottas was left out on the track for quite a while. Will he be left to rue it?Lap 5187: Alex Henderson has an idea: “A simple solution to resolve every season what’s the best car, who’s the best driver, and make the sport more exciting:20 drivers10 teams with two cars each20 races“Everyone drives each car once, then switches to another for the next race. That way, at the end of the season, we know who’s been the best driver, with everyone given an equal chance.”Lap 5087: Bottas gets the same tyres as Russell in his pit. Russell now has a very big lead on his new teammate.

It’s onwards and upwards to next week’s MASSIVE SEMI, which features TWO DANCES. Kick off is at 7pm next Saturday, so join me then! Have a great week, HxJJ has been a lovely contestant on this year’s Strictly, and has clearly had a ball. He and Amy say lovely things about each other, as is traditional. They both get a bit tearful and they seem to genuinely admire and adore each other. Bit dusty in here.They take to the floor for their final dance, to ‘Thank You For The Music’ by Abba. Judging time! Craig saves Jamie and Karen, but in an EXCITING TWIST Motsi saves JJ and Amy. So Shirley has the deciding vote, and she picks Jamie and Karen.Next up it’s deskography with Jamie and Karen. I didn’t love this Jive last night, but you can’t fault Jamie’s energy and commitment. I suspect he’ll go home next week, and should be incredibly proud of himself for that. Time for the dance off, and JJ and Amy are up first! He’s come a long way since the launch show, and this remains a fun and charming Charleston, but I think JJ has reached the end of his Strictly journey.I didn’t catch whole conversation as my Sainsbury’s delivery has just arrived (which of course I’m not allowed to go anywhere near), but I think Bill just said he’s doing a Tango to ‘Enter Sandman’ by Metallica next week. Incredible.Time to find out who is joining Jamie and Karen in the bottom two. Bill and Oti are safe, along with Maisie and Gorka! Which means JJ AND AMY are in the dance off. Well that’s the right decision, and I think it’s likely that JJ and Amy will leave. Does Shirley get some kind of bonus scheme every time she mentions JJ’s military background?Time for a musical interlude, courtesy of musical theatre megastar Marisha Wallace, who is singing ‘Climb Every Mountain’ from The Sound Of Music. Personally I question the wisdom of mountaineering whilst dressed as Dougal from The Magic Roundabout, but maybe I’m taking the whole business too literally.Marisha is accompanied by Anton and Dianne wafting in a romantic fashion. This is all rather lovely.Next week HRVY and JNTT are dancing the first Rumba of the series. I’m torn between ‘yay, classic latin!’ and ‘urgh, Rumba’.So who is safely through to next week’s massive semi, and who is in tonight’s bottom two? HRVY and JNTT are safe, along with Ranvir and Giovanni. All as it should be so far.First couple in the bottom two: JAMIE AND KAREN. Up against JJ, surely?Last night on Strictly – a musical mixed bag. The highlight was very much the Priscilla pro dance, can we see that again? Ranvir, HRVY and Maisie had a good night too, all three of them should absolutely be through to the semis. And we’re off. No opening pro dance, which is confusing me.TESS AND CLAUDIA DRESS WATCH: Claudia in stylish metallics, Tess in a black off-the-shoulder blouson with massive mutton sleeves. It makes no sense on any level. OK so no pro dance, but a performance from \u0026amp Juliet instead. I’ve heard this is very good. Tonight’s Countryfile Casual Weatherperson is hirsute weather hunk Tomasz Schafernaker, who is wearing a very snug navy jumper and some nice grey jeans. The temperature is definitely rising, and there’s movement in the jet stream. His lockdown hair has caused much debate on the socials, but I’m a big fan. Next stop Strictly please. Tomasz and Oti is the dream.Actually as Paperview in the comment box has just pointed out, Tomasz and Johannes is the dream. Now I will accept nothing less.There’s a lot of Countryfile sheep tupping going on right now, courtesy of an extremely active Blue-faced Leicester. Adam Henson saying ‘length’ and ‘milkiness’ is bringing on a fever, but that might be the Covid. Evening all, and welcome back to this week’s Strictly Results Show. Last night was Musicals Week, and it’s a tough call on who the bottom two might be. I’m reasonably confident that Ranvir won’t be troubling the dance-off, but otherwise your guess is as good as mine. On the basis that sanity might prevail I’m going for JJ and Jamie, with JJ to go. Kick-off is at 7.30pm, but we’ll have a gentle Countryfile ramble to get us warmed up. See you in a bit!That went quickly, my fingers are barely warmed up. Thank you for joining in and being brilliant, please come back for tomorrow’s Results Show at 7.30pm. Enjoy the rest of your Saturday, and I’ll see you then! And that’s it for the dancing! JJ and Jamie at the bottom of the leaderboard this evening, but it’s possible that Bill might be in danger of ending up in the dance-off. I loved Ranvir and Maisie this evening, although I’d also fling Bill a vote as I’d love to see him in the final. HRVY doesn’t need my imaginary support, he’s got the kids and the nans.

But its laws create walls of their ownby  Vivian Ho in Atherton, CaliforniaIf fences make good neighbors, then Atherton, California should be full of good neighbors.In America’s most expensive zip code, an abundance of wrought-iron fences, sturdy brick walls and towering hedgerows abound. Some gated mansions sit in gated neighborhoods that sit behind barricades of large oak trees – veritable fortresses fortified with everything but a moat.The exclusive town of 5.6 sq miles has been the priciest place to live in the country for four years running. But the residents of Atherton will be first to say that their little leafy community at the heart of Silicon Valley – home to tech billionaires, venture capitalists, the former Google chief executive Eric Schmidt, the former deputy British prime minister Nick Clegg and the Fox News populist Steve Hilton – does in fact have good neighbors. For all the wealth, they say – median home prices and home sales ranging between $7m and $8.65m and a median household income of $525,000 – the community doesn’t flaunt its money. Residents drive Teslas instead of Lamborghinis, take nice vacations instead of living ostentatiously. This is no Bel Air or Beverly Hills, they say, but a sleepy suburb like that out of The Andy Griffith Show.“Yes, the vast majority of people have worked very hard and been very successful,” said Steve Seabolt, vice-president of the Menlo Circus Club, a private social club in Atherton that includes an equestrian center, pool and tennis court. “People are friendly and warm. And compared to a lot of other communities, it’s remarkably understated. You don’t see a lot of Rolls-Royces or Bentleys. That’s just not how people live.”But there’s a reason why Atherton has remained pricey – and that’s by being a not-very-good neighbor to the rest of California. According to housing advocates, the town has set up legal boundaries to remain exclusive and put up obstacles against efforts to build affordable housing during a statewide housing crisis.“Atherton is the most expensive zip code in the country because they have designed themselves to be that way,” said Jordan Grimes, a housing advocate on the San Francisco peninsula. “There aren’t literal gates. They aren’t literally a gated city, but they are metaphorically a gated one and they have done that by zoning. Many, many cities in the country do zoning in this way, but Atherton is what you could say is the most successful in using zoning to keep out anyone who is not wealthy or white.”Historically, much of the San Francisco peninsula, where Silicon Valley giants have built their headquarters, served as country estates for the San Francisco monied class. Wealthy families would spend their summers on the peninsula, where the weather is typically warmer than the gray “Fogust” and “June gloom” of the city, and patriarchs would take the train down to join them on weekends.Thomas Selby, a San Francisco mayor, owned a 420-acre estate called Almendral on the land before Atherton was even a town, where he would serve 17-course dinners that would run from 6pm to midnight. James Flood, who made his fortune on a Nevada silver mine as one of the “Bonanza Kings”, had his extravagant getaway mansion of Linden Towers in a neighborhood now known as Lindenwood. The town’s namesake, the businessman Faxon Atherton, purchased his 640-acre estate, Valparaiso Park, for $10 an acre in 1860, and 63 years later, Atherton became incorporated as a town.“It’s different to an extent today,” Grimes said, “but that heritage has remained in places like Atherton. That mindset and history has remained.”California has a mandate called the regional housing needs allocation that requires all cities to create housing for people of all incomes, from very low to above-moderate income. In November, George Rodericks, Atherton’s city manager, drafted a letter to the Association of Bay Area Governments asking that the planning committee reassess its allocation methodology. His argument was that the methodology “relies heavily on proximity to jobs as a factor” and Atherton’s “long-standing character is as a residential community”.While he had a point – Atherton has no land zoned for commercial activity – the number of landscapers, contractors, plumbers, electricians, painters and cleaners who inundate the town limits to service the various mansions during the work week is a wonder of its own. On a recent Thursday, so many pickup trucks of landscapers and contractors lined Atherton Avenue that a taco truck and a pupusa truck parked along the stretch to feed the workers.And that doesn’t even touch on the bigger issue: that Atherton reaps the benefits of Silicon Valley without taking on the heavy lifting of providing necessary infrastructure like affordable housing.“They may have drawn their lines of incorporation to not include commerce, but Atherton derives value from being in the Silicon Valley jobs center,” Eckhouse said. “It rings false to me for them to say ‘we’re just a humble residential town’ when their residents are the titans of commerce and industry who are opening these offices in Palo Alto and Menlo Park and other neighboring areas.”In his letter regarding regional housing needs, Rodericks asked that “the final methodology take into consideration sustainability and impacts on community character”. To housing advocates, talk about “impacts on community character” is nothing more than a dog whistle for racism and classism – and also, they said, nothing new for the town of Atherton, where a former Google executive resigned from a local school board last month after his wife tweeted sexist and racist remarks about Kamala Harris, the vice-president-elect.Rick DeGolia, Atherton’s mayor, disputed that any reference to maintaining the town’s character had such undertones. “Atherton, like every town, has a whole variety of people already within it,” he said. “There are plenty of people in Atherton who are property-rich and cash-poor.”In November, the city council introduced a resolution essentially opposing state efforts to build more housing. In particular, the resolution called out a bill that failed by three votes that would have changed zoning laws to allow for more multifamily housing development in neighborhoods zoned for single-family homes. The current structure allows local jurisdictions to determine zoning, and now less than a quarter of developable land in much of the state is zoned for multifamily housing, which has played a large part in California’s housing crisis.An Atherton city council staff report on the resolution noted that the “development of high density andor high-rise residential structures or commercial uses of any kind would destroy the scenic, semi-rural and open space character of the Town”. Atherton’s general plan consists of mostly being “committed to maintaining its semi-rural environment” and that the “preservation of trees, particularly heritage oak trees, is a high priority”. “The Town is essentially fully developed and desires to retain its current character,” the report reads.The town was so concerned with retaining “its current character” that it endorsed the closure of its Caltrain commuter train station, in part becausethe bill – which its author, the state senator Scott Wiener, has committed to resurrecting in some form – would have eliminated zoning restrictions specifically on transportation to allow for more high-density housing.DeGolia said Atherton was not against building affordable housing. He noted the long commutes of the town’s police officers – some are forced to travel two hours round trip from the Central Valley because housing is unaffordable in the Bay Area – and wished they had better options closer by. But he said affordable housing couldn’t be a one-size-fits-all solution. The town’s issues with the state legislative efforts, as well as the regional housing allotment, had been that they wanted to override local authority and push for multifamily housing, the mayor said. In DeGolia’s view, that just can’t happen in Atherton. The town didn’t have the space for it, he said. Even though with zoning changes, high-density housing could be built on any one-acre parcel for sale in the town, he worried about the parking problems it would create if the residents had to park on the street. And then there was the aesthetic.“What are you going to do, you’re going to put a multi-unit building in between 10 other properties that are single-family homes?” he said. “It’s not going to feel like a neighborhood.”In Atherton, the city council passed an ordinance that allowed for homeowners to build accessory dwelling units on their properties. The town has issued more than 100 building permits for such units this year, DeGolia said. While these units could be anything from in-law units for extended family to detached guest houses for current residents, DeGolia hoped that they would become rental units for teachers and police officers.He acknowledged that it was not guaranteed that these units would become rentals – it would be up to the inidual homeowners to build them and rent them out. “But that’s always true,” DeGolia said. “It’s not guaranteed that housing is ever going to happen.”Some Atherton residents think their town gets unfairly judged. “You look at the statistics, and it’s easy to make a bunch of assumptions based on the statistics,” said Seabolt, of the Menlo Circus Club.But after living in town for 25 years, Seabolt has found that a sense of community and generosity also exists here. When his neighbors’ hens got loose, he and another neighbor went door to door to find out who they belonged to. Afterwards, as a thank you, that hens’ owner and her two children baked them chocolate chip cookies. “Last summer, our neighbor’s rabbits got loose, and we were all out there with flashlights, looking for them,” he said.During the pandemic, the circus club was quick to set up a socially distanced physical education camp for the kids to blow off some steam and offer some relief for working parents. They also asked all their members to voluntarily donate to an angel fund for their staff. “We were able to, on two different occasions, give money to our employees, recognizing that their families were maybe not as fully employed as they were beforehand,” he said.“Don’t get me wrong,” Seabolt said. “We’re blessed. The vast majority of people who live here have worked very, very hard. But they also wake up in the morning and walk down these tree-lined streets and think, like my wife and I do, ‘Aren’t we fortunate to live in this peaceful, beautiful place and don’t we wish this for everyone?’”But if the residents of Atherton do want this for everyone, their actions say otherwise, housing advocates said.“I’m glad you have a great community and I would encourage you to share it with more people,” Eckhouse, the California Yimby organizer, said. “If you’re good neighbors, then welcome more neighbors. There are a lot of people in the Bay Area who could use the opportunities and the community resources that are available in Atherton.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa1012ec8311abb0800902730dedc528f26b2a22/0_138_4953_2973/master/4953.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=337d5130fe1725d3d2f05a60ff894e2e","title":"joe biden progressives staff nominations democrats","story":"The Democratic left rallied around the party’s nominee but are now warily surveying his picks for top administration positionsJoe Biden has long had a rollercoaster relationship with progressive organizations and the left wing of the Democratic party and there are signs that the relationship is again starting to fray now that his electoral triumph over Donald Trump is receding into the rear-view mirror.When Biden entered the Democratic primary field progressive groups were quick to criticize the former vice-president for supporting the Iraq war and previously considering cuts to social security. The organizations cast Biden as an establishment Democrat who would fail to challenge a status quo that had created the conditions for the rise of Trump.That all changed in April, when Biden became the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee. Taking a cue from leading progressives like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, these same groups urged their supporters to back Biden, warning that another four years of Trump’s presidency would do lasting damage to the country and the planet.Now, with Trump defeated, the president-elect’s relationship with progressive organizations is entering a new phase, and the groups are closely scrutinizing the president-elect’s selections for cabinet and senior staff positions for clues about his agenda.So far, Biden has largely managed to avoid the least desirable picks in progressives’ eyes, but there are already some early warning signs of tension.That tension was on display late last month, when Biden was asked by NBC News’ Lester Holt whether prominent progressives like Sanders or Warren might be joining his administration. “We already have significant representation among progressives in our administration, but there’s nothing really off the table,” Biden replied.That answer rankled many progressives, who were quick to disagree with Biden’s assessment. Justice Democrats, the group that recruited Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to run for Congress, and the climate group Sunrise Movement responded in a joint statement, saying: “While we have been encouraged by some of Joe Biden’s appointments and are largely relieved by who he has not chosen, we do not agree that progressives already have significant representation in the administration as it stands.”Waleed Shahid, the communications director of Justice Democrats, said the group was pleased with some of Biden’s most recent staff announcements, namely the appointment of Jared Bernstein and Heather Boushey to the council of economic advisers.But Shahid added, “The personnel selection process is the beginning of a broader fight for the soul of the Biden presidency, and it won’t end here, but it’s a starting point.”Progressive climate groups have expressed specific concern about the appointment of senior staffers with ties to the oil and gas industry, such as congressman Cedric Richmond, who will serve as the director of the White House Office of Public Engagement. Climate activists held a demonstration outside the Democratic National Committee headquarters last month to protest against some of Biden’s early hires.“I am a little concerned that so far he’s selecting a lot of Obama-era holdovers,” said RL Miller, the president of Climate Hawks Vote and a newly elected DNC delegate.Miller argued that Biden’s selection of a number of former Obama administration officials was particularly worrying when it came to climate policy because the science around climate change has become much more alarming since 2009, when Obama took office.“I’m a Woolsey fire survivor,” Miller said, referring to the 2018 wildfire that killed three people and forced the evacuation of nearly 300,000 Californians. “This stuff is personal for me now.”Miller and Shahid said the nomination of congresswoman Deb Haaland as interior secretary would be a substantial step toward developing a positive relationship between progressive groups and the Biden administration.Adam Green, the co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, noted Haaland would be a “historic choice” as the first Native American to lead the interior department. “I can’t think of anyone more qualified for a job that both deals with public lands and climate change and also relations with tribal nations,” Green said. “Who else would possibly be better?”But Shahid emphasized that Haaland’s nomination alone would not be enough to assure progressives’ approval of Biden’s cabinet. “Having only one cabinet appointment go to a member of the progressive caucus would not be a great starting point, in my opinion,” Shahid said.Green added that he was encouraged by the selection of Ron Klain as Biden’s chief of staff and expressed hope there would be more progressives added to the administration as the president-elect continues to build his team.“There’s many more slots to fill and therefore many more points to put on the board from a progressive perspective,” Green said.Progressives’ greatest success of the Biden transition so far may be their ability to communicate who should not be selected for key positions. Although a number of progressives have said they are not necessarily thrilled with some of Biden’s hires, many of them acknowledge that the president-elect has largely managed to avoid the worst options in their view.When Neera Tanden was announced as Biden’s nominee to lead the Office of Management and Budget last week, some close allies of Sanders complained about her past comments about progressives. But Tanden’s nomination was generally met with a sigh of relief on the left, given the other candidates Biden was considering, such as Bruce Reed.While Reed has been criticized by progressives as a deficit hawk, Tanden has emphasized the need for a robust government response to help Americans who are suffering financially as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.Green said of Tanden, “If that represents the center of the party, progressives are winning because that is what we were saying eight, 10 years ago and felt like very lonely voices, and now apparently that’s the mainstream, so let’s take the win.”Pointing to Biden’s ambitious campaign platform, Green argued that it may be centrists, rather than progressives, who will cause issues in terms of party unity.“I expect that corporate Democrats will be the ones to breach Democratic unity by trying to undermine Biden’s agenda from within or slow-walk his agenda if they’re given the wrong positions of power,” Green said.“We want exactly what he campaigned on. If he passes a public option and trillions of dollars in new clean-energy jobs and cancels some student debt and passes new corporate accountability measures, we will be very happy. And we are all in for the fight.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4409770.1605434900!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"400 yes 400 irish retailers for all your online christmas shopping","story":"A number of Irish independent retailers describe how lockdowns and Covid restrictions have impacted their businesses - and what they’ve had to do to adapt. \t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIrish retailers are facing a tough Christmas with new Covid-19 restrictions closing non-essential outletsWe have been overwhelmed, in the best possible way, by the response to our original list, a few weeks ago, of 100 Irish websites where you can buy lovely, unique and good-value presents in the run-up to Christmas.Almost as soon as it appeared, business owners and many of their customers emailed us, tweeted us, sent us Instagram messages and contacted us on Facebook to champion more Irish companies doing the business online.That response matters, because we all know that the run-up to Christmas,\u0026nbspwith so many physical shops in lockdown,\u0026nbspis going to be incredibly hard for many businesses. It is also going to be a challenging time for shoppers, as they try to get organised for a Christmas like never before with more than 40 shopping days taken from them almost overnight.We know the problems all too well, but we know the solution, too, or at least part of it. The internet. But,\u0026nbspas we have said before and will say again,\u0026nbspshopping online comes with a caveat.

Photograph: Nick BradshawInoculating a nominated visitor for nursing home residents as a “vaccine buddy” in the first Covid-19 vaccinations would help their wellbeing, the nursing home sector has said.The idea of including a family member or friend in the first wave of vaccinations against the coronavirus disease was raised by Nursing Homes Ireland, the representative body for private nursing homes, in a letter to Minister for Health last month and in a follow-up meeting last week.“We felt that it was important for them to consider this idea of a nominated visitor and that would ultimately mean people could come and go a lot more freely than the current situation,” said Tadhg Daly, chief executive of the industry group. Mr Daly said that the vaccination programme could be “a complex challenge” and he was unsure how long it would take but inoculating a relative or friend of a nursing home resident could not just keep residents safe but could “address the challenge of resident wellbeing”.He felt that it would make sense, if there was a clinic set up to administer vaccines to residents and staff of a nursing home in a rural area, to have family members participating in it as well. “There is strong merit in it,” said Mr Daly. Vulnerable groupNursing home residents, one of the most vulnerable groups to the virus, and healthcare workers in hospitals and care facilities are expected to be among the first to be vaccinated. The vaccination programme is expected to begin soon with the first vaccine expected from pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and German biotech company BioNTech. The EU’s drug approval authority, the European Medicines Agency, could approve the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine at a meeting on December 29th with the vaccine distributed thereafter. The Health Service Executive has received nine ultra-low temperature freezers that can store between 175,000 and 200,000 doses of the jab, which would be a sufficient number to inoculate 30,000 residents and 30,000 staff in the country’s 568 nursing homes along with thousands more healthcare workers. Mr Daly said that the Minister was non-committal in his response to the idea, saying that the prioritisation process would be determined by the Government’s Covid-19 vaccine taskforce that is being led by Prof Brian MacCraith, the former president of Dublin City University. Priority of vaccinationA spokeswoman for the Department of Health said that the order in which people should be offered vaccination “was being developed as a priority in conjunction with the national experts on immunisation” and that it is expected this would be finalised shortly. She did not remark on the NHI’s “vaccine buddy” proposal.President Michael D Higgins, who turns 80 in April, will take the Covid-19 vaccine when it is recommended, his spokesman said. “The President has spoken passionately about the importance not only of vaccines for the global approach to combating the Covid-19 virus, but also of ensuring equitable access for all to the benefits of health technologies,” his spokesman said.

Pity for everyone they were such slow learners”.Mr Stanley later deleted the tweet and apologised, describing it as “inappropriate and insensitive”. He is expected to make a statement to the Dáil next week.The controversy continued after the 2017 tweet emerged in which the now-head of the Public Accounts Committee wrote: “yippee 4 d tory. it’s Leo. U can do what u like in bed but don’t look 4 a pay rise the next morning.”Ms O’Mahony tweeted about her decision to resign from the party and about how a party member came to her home about her criticisms.Mr Harris said “it was extremely concerning that a young woman who tweets something that a political party doesn’t like will get a knock on the door to be told that tweet is not liked and the Sinn Féin response would be that internal matters should be dealt with internally”.The Minister said his party would not send the “heavies” around for a tweet the party did not like.Mr O Broin rejected the “heavies” claim and said that “what the inidual did was wrong and nobody should have called to the activist’s door”. He added the party had a “clear independent process” and where complaints are made they are followed “vigorously”.On RTÉ’s The Week in Politics he was asked about the social media “pile on” when Sinn Féin supporters criticised and trolled Ms O’Mahony for tweeting about the incident and her resignation from the party.Presenter Áine Lawler also referred to an “online pile-on” against  correspondent Jennifer Bray who also reported Ms O’Mahony’s story, and asked if that was a Sinn Féin culture problem.Mr O Broin said in both of those cases those people who did that “did the wrong thing. They are not in any way assisting or aiding our party”.He said social media should be about engagement and the cut and thrust of political argument. Speaking about Mr Stanley he described him as a politician of “serious integrity who has worked hard for his constituents” including on the peace process.But he said “I was very surprised I have to say when I saw the first tweet and even more surprised and somewhat disappointed when I saw the second tweet.He said that “where people make mistakes they need to do the right thing and I think that’s what Brian is trying to do and I think people should give him the courtesy of listening to his statement in the Dáil”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4429100.1607279203!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit eu and uk hold intense talks in final push for trade deal","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritain’s chief negotiator David Frost   arrives in Brussels on Sunday  for Brexit talks with EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier. Photograph: Francisco SecoAP PhotoNegotiators are locked in intense discussions in Brussels in a final heave to reach agreement on trade relations between the European Union and its former member Britain that will determine the fate of the Irish economy in just a few weeks’ time. In what British officials describe as a “last throw of the dice”, the two sides led by the EU’s Michel Barnier and the UK’s David Frost are attempting to overcome deep differences over how to balance Britain’s desire to erge from EU standards with the bloc’s determination to protect its market.It follows a week of negotiations in London that ended with both sides admitting there was no prospect of a deal. European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen and British prime minister Boris Johnson spoke for almost an hour exchanging positions on Saturday, before announcing there would be one last bid for an agreement.“Significant differences remain on three critical issues: level playing field, governance and fisheries. Both sides underlined that no agreement is feasible if these issues are not resolved,” the two said in a statement. “Whilst recognising the seriousness of these differences, we agreed that a further effort should be undertaken by our negotiating teams to assess whether they can be resolved.”Economic damageAt stake is whether the economic damage of the coronavirus pandemic will be compounded by a “no deal” an outcome expected to cause significant disruption to supply chains and forecast by the Department of Finance to cost Ireland almost three percentage points of its GDP next year, with tariffs threatening to make many exports to Britain uncompetitive.The Irish Government also fears such an acrimonious outcome could damage relations with Britain and make future problems more difficult to resolve.In recent days, attention has focused on the issue of the so-called level playing field: how to ensure that British companies follow comparable rules to EU ones, in order to have fair competition between them.Outside of the negotiating room there are several obstacles in the path of an agreement, including hardened attitudes among EU member states and a plan by the British government to continue with contentious legislation.A group of member states including France and the Netherlands have warned they could veto a deal if they believe it cedes too much in economic advantages to Britain. French president Emmanuel Macron has raised concerns about the effect of relinquishing access to fishing stocks in UK waters on coastal communities, a politically sensitive point as he gears up for an election campaign against Marine Le Pen. For The Hague, the level playing field is the primary concern, due to fears Britain’s geographical proximity could make it a serious threat to Dutch industry if the London government could cut regulations and aid its companies while selling freely into the single market.FlexibilityBarnier has warned that an agreement may not be possible unless he is granted some flexibility on the negotiating mandate the EU member states agreed together in February and charged him with carrying out. The 27 countries have summoned Barnier to brief their ambassadors in Brussels on the “current state of play” of the talks on Monday morning.“Ambassadors will then review the situation based on the debrief by the EU chief negotiator,” a spokesman for the German presidency of the EU said.Meanwhile in London, legislation that would override aspects of the withdrawal agreement signed with the EU last year are due to be considered in parliament on Monday and Tuesday. The EU has long warned that if the British government perseveres with the contentious amendments – which relate to Northern Ireland and would unpick agreements designed to avoid a hard Border on the island – a deal cannot be signed.Any deal must be ratified by the European Parliament, and MEPs have grown increasingly frustrated there is already insufficient time to properly scrutinise an agreement, which would run to hundreds of pages and have complex implications for many areas of trade.Four weeksWith less than four weeks remaining until a deep shift in economic relations set to hit on January 1st whether a deal is signed or not, companies have heaped pressure on national governments for certainty, and several capitals have appealed to the European Commission to begin rolling out contingency plans for a no deal outcome.National leaders are due to gather in Brussels on Thursday and Friday at which they were due to discuss the Covid-19 pandemic, how to break a budget impasse, climate change and relations with the United States. But like many summits before it, the meeting may end up being hijacked by Britain’s exit from the EU.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Francisco SecoAP PhotoThe chances of European Union and United Kingdom negotiators reaching a post-Brexit trade deal is “50-50”, Taoiseach Micheál Martin has said.Speaking as the EU and UK attempt to salvage a trade deal in last-ditch talks, Mr Martin offered a downbeat assessment on the prospect of a deal being struck to avoid a costly no-deal exit at the end of the year.Negotiators are trying to hammer out an agreement on EU fishing rights in British waters, a “level playing field” for fair competition and governance rules on enforcing a trade deal.“My gut instinct is that it is 50-50 right now and I don’t think one can be overly optimistic about a resolution emerging,” Mr Martin told RTÉ.“My sense is having spoken to some of the key principles here that this is a very challenging issue to resolve particularly around the level playing field.”Earlier, British negotiators arrived in Brussels on Sunday for a last-ditch attempt to strike a deal and avert a chaotic parting of ways at the end of the year.British prime minister Boris Johnson and European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen spoke on Saturday and instructed their teams to resume talks after they were paused a day earlier due to an impasse over three key issues.In a joint statement after their call, Mr Johnson and Ms von der Leyen said that no agreement was feasible if significant differences on fishing, fair competition and ways to solve future disputes were not resolved.“This is the final throw of the dice,” said a British source close to the negotiations.Since Britain formally left the EU on January 31st negotiators have missed a series of deadlines to reach before a status quo transition period ends on December 31stBritain’s chief negotiator David Frost told reporters after arriving in Brussels on Sunday that his team would be working very hard to try to get a deal.EU negotiator Michel Barnier had been expected to brief member states’ ambassadors to Brussels on the state of play on Sunday but that meeting was postponed to Monday morning.Long-term disruptionExperts have warned that a no-deal scenario would cause huge long-term disruption to the British economy.As British and EU negotiators meet to try to hammer out a last-ditch deal, Mr Coveney said he wanted a deal this week to provide certainty but he raised concerns about the UK government’s plan to legislate with two bills that would breach the withdrawal agreement brokered in January.“I don’t see how, even if there is a compromise agreed this week, that that agreement would be ratified if the UK, in two pieces of domestic legislation, is breaching the withdrawal agreement, which isn’t even 12 months old,” Mr Coveney told RTÉ’s This Week radio programme.Mr Coveney said that a deal was “more likely than not” because the consequences of a no deal are “so significant” for the UK and Ireland, but also for other EU countries, “so everybody wants a deal.”“What we are at now is the very final attempts to close that out. Anybody who has been involved in these negotiations won’t have been surprised that it wasn’t possible for the two negotiating teams to finalise the deal in a way that was smooth and managed and predictable,” he saidA majority of Mr Johnson’s ministers would be willing to back him if he decides a deal is not in British interests, the Times newspaper reported, saying 13 cabinet ministers had confirmed they would do so.British farming minister George Eustice said the country had done a huge amount of preparation for a no-deal and was ready to go through with such a scenario.“We’ll continue to work on these negotiations until there’s no point in doing so any further,” he told Sky News.Contingency plansMinister for Further Education Simon Harris said there is a deal to be done on Brexit if there is a willingness on both sides.Speaking on RTÉ’s The Week in Politics he said it would be a crucial week in talks in Brussels.“Whilst I don’t think we can be in any way complacent I think there is a deal there to be done if there is a willingness on both sides to do a deal.”He said “this will be a very intense and very busy week on two key issues - fair competition and fisheries”.It was about the logical fair rationale that if Britain wants access to lots of EU markets it is entirely appropriate that the EU would have access to British fishing waters whilst respecting British sovereignty”.The Observer newspaper reported on Sunday that, under UK government contingency plans, tens of millions of Covid-19 vaccine doses could be flown to Britain from Belgium by military aircraft to avoid delays at ports caused by Brexit.The British government declined to comment on the report, but Mr Eustice said the end of the UK’s transition period would not disrupt vaccine supplies.“A huge amount of work has gone on to maintain the flow of goods at the border . . . and we’ve also got contingency plans in place, including a government-procured ferry that’s on standby and of course the option, should it be needed, to use air freight too,” he said. – Additional reporting ReutersDeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Mr Maduro may feel emboldened to detain the opposition leader or force him to flee the country. In an ominous sign of Mr Guaido\u0027s international support disintegrating, on Tuesday his envoy to the United Kingdom, Vanessa Neumann, announced her resignation from the post, appearing to jump ship before it sinks completely.  “My affection for, and ties to, the UK will always run deep,” Neumann told The Sunday . This is not an election anyone in the Western world would recognise, she added.Mr Guaido has promised that the current parliament’s term will continue, citing a vague legal theory of “constitutional continuity.” The claims are unlike to get him far.For Mr Maduro the election offers an opportunity to declare victory in a power struggle that has dragged on for too long. In the streets, Mr Maduro’s allies have launched an aggressive media and ground offensive that would suggest the vote is a competitive race. State TV broadcasts raucous government rallies held throughout the country.“Let’s go together to vote for Venezuela, all together we will rescue the National Assembly,” pop stars Chucho y Omar Acedo sing in the chorus of a catchy humber seemingly playing on loop on radio and TV and from loudspeakers on trucks driving through the streets.Giving the election some semblance of legitimacy, hundreds of candidates identifying as opposition to Mr Maduro have enrolled in defiance of Guaido’s boycott. The country’s pro-regime electoral board has banned prominent politicians from a handful of traditional opposition parties.Some polls show as little as 14 per cent of Venezuelans plan to vote.“This isn’t a democratic vote and no right in this country is guaranteed,” Lauren Caballero, one of the few opposition candidates standing told the Sunday . “If there are not fair conditions, we will conquer them, but not by standing idly by.” This week Mr Caballero campaigned in working class neighborhoods in his hometown La Guaira state on the country’s coast. A handful of young supporters beating drums drew neighbors to their doors where Caballero offered his pitch.“We don’t have water or electricity, but here they are asking for votes again,” Carmen Mile, an unemployed mother of four, said.The country’s economic crisis has only worsened in the two years since Guaido declared himself president. Three continuous years of hyperinflation have ravaged incomes. Currently a monthly minimum wage buys only a kilo of pasta. Over 5 million have fled the country since the crisis began in 2013. The country’s collapsing infrastructure means many spend months without running water.A recent study published by the country’s main universities found that in vulnerable communities, 100 per cent of residents live with food insecurity. “Whoever doesn’t vote, won’t eat, for whoever doesn’t vote, there won’t be food,” regime number two Diosdado Cabello said through laughter at a rally on Monday in central Venezuela. Tens of thousands have become dependent on the sporadic delivery of government food boxes to survive the crisis. Maduro has promised a “special prize” for the communities with the highest turnout. Mile, the woman visited by the dissident opposition candidate on the coast, said she plans to vote, but wouldn’t specify for whom. She survives on government handouts and money from odd jobs from her children.   “It’s an obligation, I’ll just say that,” she said. Additional reporting by Daniel Blanco Paz and Ivanna Laura in La Guaira, VenezuelaMore from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"mass trespass stonehengeover road tunnel proposals","story":"Protesters have said they are taking part in a mass trespass at Stonehenge against the Government\u0027s £27 billion roads programme and plans to dig a tunnel near the prehistoric monument.The group, who described themselves as an alliance of local residents, ecologists, activists, archaeologists and pagans, gathered at the Wiltshire site at about noon on Saturday.They are protesting against the Government\u0027s planned £27.4 billion investment in the strategic road network across the country, as well as a controversial £1.7 billion plan to dig a road tunnel near Stonehenge.Transport Secretary Grant Shapps gave the go-ahead to the scheme in November, against the recommendations of planning officials, who warned it will case harm to the World Heritage Site.Protesters said they also gathered in support of Save Stonehenge World Heritage Site, which has launched a legal challenge to Mr Shapps\u0027 decision.English Heritage closed the site to the public for the rest of the day after the arrival of the protesters.Environmental activist Dan Hooper, known as Swampy, said: This is the coming together of people who are saying we have had enough.The Stonehenge tunnel is just one scheme in a £27 billion roads programme.As road transport is the single largest source of carbon emissions in the UK, this is insane.He added: Building more roads simply leads to more traffic and carbon.The Government is ignoring the uncomfortable but very real truth that time is running short.

Sure, the University of Canterbury could treat itself to a lecturer whose expertise was “zombies” and the University of Southampton could employ an “expert” on video games. But this would simply constitute a tax on the gullible and stupid. Eventually applications would fall off, and such institutions would close. The elite institutions, meantime, would purr along like the well-oiled machines that they are. I was wrong.What I failed to take into account was that ancient institutions are expert at adapting to whatever era they are in. And ours is an era whose boundaries have been subtly, but significantly, mis-drawn. Like a post-war border-treaty, a single deviation of the pen stores up trouble generations down the line.In our age anything deemed “hostile” by a member of a “vulnerable group” is made impermissible. Not simply in polite society, but in law – even in policing. What is a “non-crime hate-incident” but a bogus concept written into law? It makes no judgment on whether the “hostility” was real or imagined, and it cannot adjudicate whether the claim is made sincerely or in order to win some other (often political) battle. To make such a claim is to win, leaving our society and its institutions permanently at the mercy of (among others) the deluded and malevolent. Of course institutions that survived the Reformation, the civil war and much more should know how to adapt to the guiding faith of the age. They have spent centuries practising.There has been much attention paid to the case of Will Knowland – the Eton teacher sacked after uploading to YouTube a talk to pupils in which he said that differences between men and women aren’t always attributable to environmental factors.What he said was true. It also runs against one of the prevailing lies of the age (that sex differences are not biological but environmental). So just as in a previous age an Eton master might have made himself vulnerable by doubting the eucharistic bread was the actual body of Christ, so Knowland became vulnerable. But it is the badly drawn laws of this country that did for him.The recognition that such lines must be drawn well is why a fight is going on at another of our ancient institutions. At Cambridge University, a free-speech row is ongoing thanks to its vice chancellor Stephen Toope. This Canadian lawyer heads an institution that has developed an apparent habit of punishing academics who step outside the orthodox lies of the age. Witness Cambridge’s treatment of Noah Carl and Jordan Peterson. Now Toope is trying to double-down by pushing through a new free speech policy. Recognising the drawing of a poorly-drawn line when he sees one, a much smarter man than Toope (senior philosophy lecturer Arif Ahmed) is leading a push-back.The Toope policy demands that differences of opinion be “respected”. Ahmed rightly says that, no, another person cannot simply demand or expect “respect” for their opinion. What we should have is “tolerance” for other people’s opinions.Quite so. The demand of our era that everybody and anything be “respected” has become one of the bully-words to shut down discussion of difficult issues and the bully’s way to bulldoze through their own, often erroneous, claims. Once the line is drawn where Toope wants to draw it, good people (including people telling the truth) are left permanently at risk of being stranded behind enemy lines.This may seem theoretical. But it is not. In defending the sacking of Mr Knowland, the headmaster of Eton said that a lawyer employed to give an opinion on the case warned that Knowland’s speech may have broken this country’s equality laws.And here is the thing. Perhaps it did. But that is because the equality laws of this country – like Toope’s “respect” rule at Cambridge – are an ass. Institutions like Eton hide behind their wretched lawyers only because the law can be interpreted as being on their side. It is no good complaining about cowards in high places if those cowards have (or even believe they have) the law on their side. What would be good would be for this country – and specifically this Conservative Government – to change the law: to undo the last Labour government’s deeply inexact tampering in the Equalities Act.Ancient institutions are designed to adapt to survive whatever era they are in. It is no surprise that they have adapted to our new woke state religion. For as long as they have the law on their side, it is not enough to demand the presence of braver or better people at the top of our institutions. It is necessary to change those laws. And the religion.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"rewilding wild swimming nature has hijacked modern day marie","story":"In the decade I defined recently in this column as the Troubled Teens, many words have changed their meaning. Now, it isn’t just old fogeys muttering darkly about verbal appropriation, as one lovely word after another falls to the monstrous regiments of the woke. I am, too.“Brave” – once meant rescuing orphans from burning buildings now means talking about one’s troubles in public. “Activist” – once meant getting out and about to help others now means staying indoors on the internet screaming at people who think differently. “Community” – once meant a cheery group of neighbours getting together for street parties now means a posse of peevish wallflowers going for gold in the Victimhood Olympics.And now “wild” – a word which, predictably, I have a weakness for. The Cambridge Dictionary defines it as “uncontrolled or extreme” with the slang “unusual, often in a way that is attractive or exciting”. This is the wildness that produced numerous cultural artefacts: songs like Wild Thing, films like Wild At Heart, books like Where The Wild Things Are.But in recent years there’s been a creeping encroachment of a version of the word which doesn’t mean life-affirming risk but rather self-denying caution – to quote Cambridge, “wild land is not used to grow crops and has few people living on it”. “Rewilding” predictably showed up in the woke Archers a while back when the rich old Archer matriarch Peggy awarded half a million pounds to a “rewilding” project. Though it seemed an unlikely alliance at first, it’s worth remembering that “conservative” and “conservation” have a common root – and probably a manky old root thieved from common land and made into a stew, if the two-legged hedge-hogs have anything to do with it.Lockdown, meanwhile, has exacerbated the craze for foraging as part and parcel of the wildness trend, along with wild swimming (swimming outside) and wild dining (dining outside) to the point where Epping Forest – once most notorious for dogging – has been rebooted as an Essex Eden, keen to share its opulent bounty with the furloughed.You can see how plague-laden supermarkets might make outdoor scavenging look like the healthy way to get your five a day, but I’m not convinced. As a big people fan, I’ve never been overkeen on nature when as a teenager I heard that there was a book called Against Nature, I became so thrilled I carried a copy around for a year, as though it was a trendy Etam handbag. This aversion stayed with me into adulthood, to the somewhat illogical point where, living in a house with fruit trees in the garden, I would leave them for the birds and buy apples from the supermarket, all nicely done up in plastic.In recent years, commercial mushroom foragers in Epping Forest have been fined thousands of pounds for removing the fungi that supports ancient trees and serves as food for wildlife such as deer. I’ve never trusted mushrooms since I saw some growing on the bathroom carpet of a friend (reader, I married him!) and the idea of breaking the law in order to get your greedy paws on some does strike me as somewhat surreal. And the only forager I ever knew fell in a stagnant pond while reaching for blackberries, having scratched her arms and legs soon after, she woke up with a brain infection and had to learn to walk all over again. Give me the concrete fields of the city any day, where you can see trouble coming.As a counter-jumping meritocrat, I’ve always thought Nature best left to the posh like them it doesn’t have a lot to say and clings blindly to an outdated “natural” order. Scratch a friend of the earth and find an enemy of earthlings look how ecology movements are so white and bourgeois they make a Monday Club meeting look like the Reggae Sunsplash festival. Because rewilding is an attempt to go back in time, before pesky people and their petty desires to have a decent standard of living caused human habitats to blight the landscape.“Gonna make it happenTake the world in a love embrace” sang Steppenwolf in one of my favourite songs Born To Be Wild. Let the modern Marie Antoinettes keep their fellow humans six feet away while they gorge themselves on buckshee fungi this fashion for “the wild” is an adventure only for the mild at heart.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"rita ora apologises second covid rules breach","story":"Rita Ora has been forced to apologise again after it emerged she had broken strict coronavirus rules by failing to self-isolate after recently travelling to Egypt.The 30-year-old singer reportedly travelled to Cairo on November 21 to perform at the five-star W hotel. She returned the next day and under Government quarantine rules should have self-isolated for 14 days, the Mail on Sunday reported.But less than a week later she held a birthday party at a restaurant in west London.Ms Ora was forced to apologise last week after she and around 30 guests, including model Cara Delevingne, were photographed at the event before the end of the second national lockdown on Wednesday.The singer had offered to pay a £10,000 fine for hosting the party.Ms Ora told the Mail on Sunday she would donate any profit from the performance to charity. In a statement, she told the newspaper: “I recently flew to Egypt to perform at a corporate event for a private company, where my travel party followed protocol and presented negative Covid tests upon entry, as required by Egyptian authorities. Upon my return to Britain, I should have followed Government advice and isolated myself for the required period.

This and the other vaccines are a huge step forward in the fight against coronavirus and could save tens of thousands of lives. So is the vaccine safe  Who’ll get it first  And will it mean ato normal le  Our  of medical experts - made up of Deputy chief medical officer Professor Jonathan Van-Tam, Chief Executive of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency Dr June Raine CBE and Head of Immunisations at Public Health England Dr Mary Ramsay - are here to answer all your questions...  Q. Vaccines usually take years to develop, so how can the Covid- vaccination be safeit’s ready in months  Professor Van-Tam: These vaccines have been through phase one, phase two and phase three, just like ordinary vaccines. With the Pfizer vaccine, I think the total clinical trial size is something like , the AstraZeneca results so far reported are based on just over , volunteers – there’s at least another , to follow, and the number size for Moderna is very similar. These are very, very big studies. The numbers involved were essentially the same as you’d expect for a normal peacetime vaccine, and on top of that the safety assessments and the assessments of effectiveness at the end are the same. Dr Raine: The public can be completely confident that Covid- vaccines will only be available once they have met robust standards of safety, quality and effectiveness. As Covid- is a public health emergency, scientic evaluation and approval is being done in the shortest time possible while complying with established and robust safety, quality and effectiveness standards. Extensive knowledge on vaccine development with existing vaccines is applied. Safety is our watchword. Everyone can be absolutely clear that the standards that need to be met, will be met. I am completely confident that there has been no pressure whatsoever on the agency and our expert staff to pass the vaccine. None at all. Q. How have you decided who gets the vaccine first  Dr Ramsay: We looked at a lot of data showing who was getting infection and who was dying from infection. The primary thing the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisationlooked at was death rates by age, by clinical factors, and by any other factors that GPs could measure, such as deprivation, geography or ethnicity. It’s very clear the death rate is much higher as you get older, particularly over . That’s why we’re prioritising people in older age groups, then coming down in age, picking up people who are clinically vulnerable and those who have underlying conditions along the way. Those working in health and social care will be high on the list as well – they are at risk because they’re getting exposed to infection every day and they may be spreading it to others. The same goes for care home workers – they’re a very high priority.  Q. Will the vaccine prevent disease or just reduce symptoms   Professor Van-Tam: If you’re going to prevent transmission you need a vaccine that is taking out the illness and also the asymptomatic infections. There are some signs from AstraZeneca that this might be the case. That does not mean the other vaccines where results have already been announced or that are or are still in development, don’t also reduce transmission it’s just we don’t know at this point in time. We hope they will because they’ll have a bigger effectthey can take out transmission. Q. Are there any side effects  Dr Ramsay: All the side effects are predictable – the kind of thing you get with other vaccines: a sore arm, bit of a temperature or feeling a bit fatigued, so we’re expecting it to have a similar safety profile to other vaccines. Professor Van-Tam: Every single vaccine authorised for use in the UK has been authorised by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency . The three components of authorisation are a safety assessment, an effectiveness assessment and a manufacturing quality assessment – all three need to be ticked before anything is authorised. But there is not a single medicine without side effects. Is it possible that rare side effects could come to light that you’d never pick up in a clinical trial of ,-, patients  Yes, it is – but that’s no dferent from any other medicine.  Q. How will the vaccine be rolled out  Dr Ramsay: The actual act of giving the injection isn’t particularly skillful – all nurses are trained and most vaccines are given by nurses, but with the flu jab we use health care assistants. The key thing is they work under the supervision of nurses. I think there’s going to be a lot of dferent models used because, for example, with elderly, frail people they’re clearly not going to drive to the nearest centre – you might have to take vaccine to them in their home. The hospitals will probably be doing their staff, then there will potentially be these vaccination sites which will probably be more important for the slightly younger population who can drive there. Q. Is there anyone who shouldn’t have it   Dr Ramsay: A reason to defer a vaccination is being pregnant – that’s just being precautionary. We don’t expect there to be a problem, but without having the vaccine tested on pregnant women we’ll probably recommend they wait until after they’ve had the baby. Similarly, it hasn’t been tested in children, although a teenager would probably respond similarly to a young adult so they could likely have the vaccine. Q. Will it be available privately  Professor Van-Tam: I don’t know, but I think it would be a bad thing for public healththe rich and privileged were able to pay their way to the front of the queue, leaving someone at very high risk and not wealthy low down the list – and they would be there’s going to be a global shortage of these vaccines. So I’m opposed to that. Q.

That could mean we crash out of EU rules without a trade pact - with tarfs and paperwork being slapped on much of the UK’s £bn a year in trade with the EU from January . Food could become more expensive in the supermarket and deliveries could be held up by bureaucracy at the border.  The Budget watchdog says it could cut GDP by % in  and delay our Covid recovery by almost a year. It’s a far cry from when Boris Johnson said in : “There is no plan for no deal because we are going to get a great deal.” And it’s hardly the “oven-ready” deal the Prime Minister promised the British people he had in last year’s election. So what are the three sticking points  Why hasn’t the so-called “oven-ready deal” been as tasty as we hoped  And when might the deadlock end  Here’s what you need to know.What is the deal we’re trying to agree  The UK is trying to agree a Free Trade Agreement with the EU for when the Brexit transition period ends on December . This would allow us to enjoy cheaper, easier trade with our nearest neighbours thanwe crashed out of the EU with no pact. While no deal will be as seamless as EU membership, Brexiteers say an FTA is a way of having our cake and eating it. We could make our own laws while also paying smaller tarfs and having less bureaucracy than a nation with no trade deal.  If we don’t get a deal, EU trading rules will end on New Year’s Eve and slap billions in tarfs overnight on essential goods. Britain is also negotiating trade deals with dozens of other countries like Japan but the EU is far, far more important. In  the EU accounted for almost half of UK trade - £bn. The second-placed US counted for £bn. Japan, £bn. And our economy has been used to tarf-free EU trade for decades, meaning any change on January  could be a big shock. How is this dferent from Boris Johnson’s ‘oven-ready deal’   You may remember Boris Johnson won the election by promising to ‘get Brexit done’. He said: “We’ve got a deal that’s oven-ready. We’ve just got to put it in at gas mark four, give it  minutes and Bob’s your uncle.” But his “oven-ready” deal was only the Withdrawal Agreement to leave the EU.That agreement didn’t actually guarantee how anytradewould work after .Call it clever wording, call it lies - however you look at it, the ‘oven-ready’ deal doesn’t help us much now. It’s like he put an empty pie casing in the oven to blind-bake, but hadn’t mixed any of the filling together yet. Why don’t we have an agreement yet   The EU and UK have been negotiating an agreement since Spring, but since about the summer talks have been deadlocked. They are stuck on three issues - fishing rights, the ‘level playing field’ and how any deal will be policed . Talks missed deadlines of mid-October and mid-November, before coming to what the UK claimed was almost a breakthrough. But the EU then “added a whole load of additional demands”, according to Environment Secretary George Eustice. UK officials believe French President Emmanuel Macron was behind the new harder position. Adding to this, there’s a row over Boris Johnson planning to break international law. The UK Internal Market Bill - due in the Commons on Monday - will give the UK ultimate power over the rules for goods travelling from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. This would breach the Withdrawal Agreementwhich the UK and EU signed last year. Back then, Boris Johnson promised to arbitrate those rules via a joint committee. When will the logjam end   Boris Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen are due to speak on Monday evening. Talks might continue beyond that point - andthey do, UK officials believe it will be a good sign. Thataposs becauseprogress is made thereaposll be no point giving up on it on Monday night. Butthere isnapost any progress by Monday night it could be curtains at that point, a UK source warned. Any deal ideally wants to be agreed by EU leaders at a summit this week before being signed off by the European Parliament before New Year. The three sticking points explainedFishing The UK and EU each want as much fish as possible from UK waters after December . But it’s not as simple as just barring all EU fishermen. There needs to be a negotiation - otherwise UK fleets would struggle to access EU waters, or sell their fish into EU markets. The first key point is quotas - whether UK boats will be allowed to catch more fish in their own waters than they do now. In -, % of the fish in UK waters was caught by EU boats and % by UK boats. Reports suggested the EU was prepared to% of its current quotas to UK fishermen, but Britain said this wasn’t enough. Before talks stalled last week, a deal taking back as much as % of EU quotas to the UK seemed possible, it is claimed. Environment Secretary George Eustice said: “The EU have suggested a very modest increase that they would tolerate the UK having of the fish in its own waters. But given we only have half the fish in our own waters now, that simply wouldn’t be possible.” Quotas cover many issues but not all of them - because fish move around the seas. The other key point is over access - both to the territorial waters within  miles of UK soil, and a -mile economic exclusion zone around its coastline. UK sources say the EU essentially wants the same access as it enjoys now under the Common Fisheries Policy. That is unacceptable to UK officials, who say they want to control access to UK waters - even , in reality, EU fleets will be let in anyway. Mr Eustice said the EU was trying to get access to UK waters “in perpetuity” rather than agreeing three years at a time. “Such a suggestion really is quite ludicrous and not consistent with international law,” he said. Itaposs thought the UK is looking at a three-year transition period to new access arrangements.The level playing field"},{"url":null,"title":"first pictures coronavirus jab doses","story":"NewsFirst pictures of coronavirus jab doses in UK hospitals ready in less than hrsThe UK is set to lead the world in rolling out a mass vaccination programme as Pfizer and BioNTechs Covid- jab arrives in hospitals with doses ready for the publicmirrorShareCommentsByOliver MilnePolitical Correspondent:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror incoming video covid-vaccine-arrives-hospitals-across-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : #

Hundreds of thousands of doses arrived in the UK on Friday on refrigerated trucks from Belgium. From there they were taken to specialist refrigerated storage facilities, at undisclosed locations, before finally being shipped to the  hospitals taking part in stage one of the rollout. And the first pictures of vaccine arriving in an NHS hospital, released today, show a pharmacy technician from Croydon Health Services taking delivery at Croydon University Hospital of the first batch to be delivered to the area. The UK has secured  million doses of the vaccine, enough to treat  million people in the coming months. The doses will be administered at dozens of hospital hubs from Tuesday – with people aged  and over, care home workers and NHS workers who are at higher risk the first to receive the jab. There are  hubs in the first wave of the vaccination programme in England, with more hospitals starting to vaccinate over the coming weeks and months as the programme ramps up. The distribution of the vaccine across the UK is being undertaken by Public Health England and the NHS in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland through systems specially adapted from those used for the national immunisation programmes.  It comes as Matt Hancock claimed that a second vaccine, made by Oxford University and AstraZeneca may be approved for use in the UK as soon as Christmas. The Health Secretary suggested that the UK made jab could quickly follow the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, and become the second to get the green light from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency . He said “It may come before Christmas, it may come early in the new year. On Sunday the UKaposs chief medicine regulator said there was no doubt that the Covid vaccine approved in the UK is safe.  Mr Hancock also claimed a successful rollout would mean lockdown restrictions could end before March. The Health Secretaryaposs optimistic prediction comes as hospitals are preparing to begin the first phase of the largest-scale vaccination campaign in the UKaposs history. GP surgeries in England have been told to start staffing COVID- vaccination centres by  December. Dr June Raine, chief executive of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency , which approved the Pfizer BioNTech jab, said there “should be no doubt whatever that this is a very safe and highly effective vaccine”.  Asked on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show about how important the public health message is to make sure that people actually take the vaccine, she said: “It’s vitally important. And I would really like to emphasise that the highest standards of scrutiny, of safety and of effectiveness and quality have been met, international standards. And so there should be real confidence in the rigour of our approval. The deputy chief executive of NHS Providers said the UK is expecting to receive up to four million doses of the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine by the end of December. But Saffron Cordery explained the dficulty of getting the virus into care homes and smaller community-based vaccination centres. She told Sky Newsaposs Sophy Ridge On Sunday that only hospitals had the infrastructure to store the vaccines because of the incredibly low temperature it is required to be stored at.  She said hospitals receiving the first batch of vaccines were calling people aged  and over in their areas to come into hospitals and setting up separate clinics on-site. Right now they can only be administered in hospitals but trusts up and down the country are working with the MHRA , who is overseeing this process, to seethey can get them distributed more closely to care homes so that they can go into care homes and sort the vaccines for those residents, she said. Professor Stephen Powis, NHS national medical director, said: Despite the huge complexities, hospitals will kickstart the first phase of the largest scale vaccination campaign in our countryaposs history from Tuesday.  Ben Osborn, the UK chief executive of Pfizer, told The Mail on Sunday that he is so confident about the safety of the jab that he is willing to take it today and wants his mother to have it as soon as possible.Mr Hancock has reportedly been referring to Tuesday as V-Day and told The Sundaythat he canapost wait to scrap the three-tier system of coronavirus restrictions before March and get back to living by mutual respect and personal responsibility, not laws set in parliament.When askedthe distribution of the vaccine beginning this week could mean restrictions end sooner, he said: Yes, it will. He added: Thereaposs no doubt that having the vaccine early... will bring forward the moment when we can get rid of these blasted restrictions but until then we have got to follow them. It came as plans emerged to see millions of doses of the Covid- vaccine manufactured in Belgium flown into this country by military aircraft to avoid delays at ports caused by Brexit, under contingency plans being developed by the government.Both the Department of Health and Social Care, and senior sources at the Ministry of Defence , confirmed that large consignments would be brought to the UK from  January by airroad, rail and sea routes were subject to widely expected delays after that date. On the threat of no-deal Brexit Dr Raine said we are ready”. “We’ve practised, we are ready, we are fully prepared for any possible outcome,” she told Andrew Marr. Elsewhere, the Queen and Prince Philip are both expected to have the coronavirus vaccine within weeks but palace sources insisted they “will not jump the queue” and instead have it at the appropriate time. The monarch,  and Duke of Edinburgh, , will both be eligible in the second round of vaccinations aftercare home residents.  Palace sources suggested the royal would be reluctant to go public with their decision to be vaccinated, despite figures in government feeling it would send a strong message to the public. Meanwhile, there is still no guaranteed date for when care home residents will be vaccinated despite them being at the top of the priority list, with Health Secretary Matt Hancock saying there are “signicant challenges” to overcome.  Logistical issues mean there are dficulties in getting the jab to residents, as the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine needs to be stored at minus C before being thawed out and can only be moved four times within that cold chain before being used. The vaccine boxes containing  doses will need to be split so that they can be brought to care homes. Dr Raine told Marr: “We have approved how the vaccine can be put into the small packs, but obviously what we’re doing is giving advice and guidance on how well that, carefully, that is done.

Figures from Britainaposs biggest foodbank network, the Trussell Trust, suggest it could hand out nearly two-and-a-half million meals in the first three weeks of December. Two fths are set to go to kids. Statistics seen by the Mirror show the charity gave away , parcels in the first three weeks of December . With each aid package containing enough ingredients for three meals a day for three meals, that equates to ,, meals.  Of the , parcels provided, , went to children – food for , meals.However, the charity is braced for record demand this festive season as the country battles the coronavirus pandemic and unemployment climbs.In the six months from April to September this year, demand for Trussell Trust help rocketed by % as the UK was gripped by the worst of the Covid- crisis. If the % year-on-year rise continues this month, the charity will provide , parcels to children between December  and  – the equivalent of ,, meals.  They would be among a total of , parcels containing enough food for ,, meals. Trussell Trust chief executive Emma Revie said: “This year communities across the country have stepped in to provide vital support to people left without enough money. “Volunteers in foodbanks have been working tirelessly under extremely dficult circumstances to make sure support is there for people struggling to afford essentials.  “Our volunteers are now bracing themselves for an extremely busy Christmas period - but it’s not right that any of us are forced to a charity for food, at any time of year.” Child Poverty Action Group chief executive Alison Garnham said: “It would sink any parent’s heart to have to go to a foodbank to feed their kids. “But as these figures show, for so many families now it’s aposeat from the foodbank or don’t eat at allapos that isn’t right.  “The pandemic has exposed just how many families are on precarious incomes, and it’s revealed that the safety net we have just isn’t adequate when times are tough.”She called for the Government to extend a temporary £-a-week rise in Universal Credit, which was a announced in March and is due to end in April.“That would be a big help to the millions of families struggling to stay afloat,” she added. Labour and the Liberal Democrats echoed the call.Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said: “Too many families are facing real stress about how they will get by this December.  “Our social security system is not fit for purpose when so many people need to turn to foodbanks to afford essentials this Christmas. “The Government must do more to support people and scrap its planned cut to Universal Credit, which will take £ a week from six million families.” Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey said: “Too many people had to rely on foodbanks even before the pandemic, but the jump in demand since April makes horribly clear the scale of the hardship caused by coronavirus.

Boris Johnson sent his chief negotiator to Brussels today for  hours of talks to break a deadlock on three key issues - fishing, following EU rules and who polices the terms of a deal.The PM will speak to the President of the European Commission on Monday night - and Cabinet minister George Eustice warned any breakthrough is needed in the “next few days”. If a trade deal is agreed, it would come to Parliament to be approved by MPs before Christmas. But while saying “we absolutely need to get a deal”, Labour ’s Nick Thomas-Symonds wouldn’t say how his party would vote.The Shadow Home Secretary told Sky News: “In terms of our position on any deal, clearly we need to see what has been agreed. “I think that’s a sensible, responsible position to take. “But we very much hope there is a deal because there seem to be two paths before us at the moment. “A path of leaving the transition without a deal and leaving with a deal. “And we do know how catastrophic the no-deal outcome would be.” Shadow Cabinet Office minister Rachel Reeves added: “We can’t say how we’re going to vote in a hypothetical situation without seeing the legislation.” Any decision to abstain in the vote could prompt a new wave of infighting in Labour, which was riven by Brexit splits throughout the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn.Unite general secretary and Corbyn ally Len McCluskey today warned abstaining would be “completely wrong”.Mr McCluskey told Times Radio Keir Starmer needs to win the trust of the red wall seats and those who voted leave in .He added: “Frankly, Labour need - on the most important issue of the day - not to be seen to be sitting on the fence. The idea of an abstention, to me, would be completely wrong. I hope theyaposve learnt the lesson back in December that any confusion over this will be damaging to them.

UK ministers are expecting to be able to announce a halfway-house deal on pet travel to the continent from January. Under the proposed scheme, Brits would need to visit the vet around a month before taking a dog, cat or ferret to the EU. That would be a big drop from a four-month process which was expected to take force from January .However, it’s still much more of a burden than the current pet passport scheme, which is ending in Britain due to Brexit.The compromise was hinted at today by Environment Secretary George Eustice. He told the BBC: “We’re likely to be listed in the EU’s Annex II, the second category. “[That] means whereas in the past you might have had a pet passport, in future you’d need a certicate from the vet instead of a passport. “It won’t be as easy as having the passport because you’d need to go to the vet prior to leaving, rather than have the passport that shows your rabies vaccines are up to date.” A Whitehall source said they were expecting a formal announcement in the coming days.  Until now, the UK government has been working on the basis that Britain will be an “unlisted” nation for pet travel. That would mean any pet owner taking a dog, cat or ferret to the EU from January  must go through a four-month process, including waiting three months after a blood sample. Mr Eustice, however, said it is “likely” the EU will agree for the UK to become a “listed” nation. It is understood he was referring to a process called ‘Part ’ listing, which applies to most listed nations outside the EU. Under this category, the rules for British pet owners would be less stringent than for an unlisted country.

June Raine, chief executive of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency , urged everyone who is eligible to get the jab when it becomes available to their group. “Itaposs as safe as any general vaccine, the kind you might haveyouaposre going on holiday, or the flu jab,” she told the BBC. Pregnant women and some immunocompromised people are being advised not to take the only approved jab so far, from Pfizer, because there is not yet full data about how it could affect them. But Dr Raine, who leads the regulator which approved the Pfizer jab, confirmed there are “no special precautions or advice” for people who’ve already had Covid-. That means,people who were previously sick are offered the jab, they should take it just as anyone . That is despite the fact they might have some immunity already. Evidence from government SAGE advisors, published on Friday, suggested a “high proportion” of people have some immunity after catching Covid- and it is “likely to persist for at least three months”. But it is uncertain how long this “natural” immunity lasts, and some people do not develop immunity at all. It is also possible that previous sufferers could still transmit Covid when they’re re-infected, eventhey don’t get sick.  The advice also comes despite the fact some people who were previously ill have crippling ‘Long Covid’ symptoms. Askedher general advice to take the vaccine still applied to people with ‘Long Covid’, Dr Raine said: “No special advice there either. “I think people can be really sure this has been looked at in a large number of people, ,, and looked at incredibly carefully. “Of course we want to follow up more in the long term - we have good data up to one month after the second dose, but we’ll be following up safety for at least two years. “So please be confident that as soon as we have more data, we will be sharing it.”  The first COVID- vaccines will arrive at hospitals by Monday ahead of the first jabs being given on Tuesday. GP surgeries in England have been told to start staffing COVID- vaccination centres by  December.Health Secretary Matt Hancock has reportedly been referring to Tuesday as V-Day and told The Sundaythat he canapost wait to scrap the three-tier system of coronavirus restrictions before March.

But evenwe do get a deal, things are going to look very dferent for Brits who go abroad from  January . When Brexit happened on January , we entered an -month transition period where EU rules continued as they are now. That means you’ve been able to go on holiday with pets, passports and free roaming and healthcare, asnothing had changed, and businesses can trade freely with the EU.At the stroke of pm on December , many of these protections will fall away. Some of the effects may be less severethe UK and EU agree a trade deal, but others will come into force regardless. So how will Brexit affect your day-to-day le and holidays after January  and what should you do to prepare  Here’s a basic guide. If we donapost get a trade deal with the EU If we get a trade deal with the EU, it will make importing and exporting goods easier and cheaper than it would otherwise be, with less paperwork and fewer tarfs. Itaposll be more similar to how things are now . Butwe donapost, there will be billions of pounds a year in extra costs for businesses. That is because we will default to more expensive World Trade Organisation trading terms. That could mean disruption at ports and passing on costs to consumers, with everyday goods getting more expensive in the supermarket. This will be more noticeable with the EU than other countries we donapost have a trade deal with, because the EU makes up almost half our trade. Food prices could go up  Tory George Eustice admitted that the UK crashing out could push food prices up. Askedfood prices would risethere’s no trade deal, the Environment Secretary told LBC Radio: “Yes we’ve looked at that. The impact of tarfs on consumer food prices is actually quite modest. Probably less than %.” In the event of no-deal tarfs averaging  per cent will be imposed on food and drink imported from the continent, with retailers likely to pass somenot all of this additional cost onto consumers. The UK imports around  per cent of its food, with  per cent coming from the EU, leaving UK’s supermarket shelves particularly exposed to any disruption on our relationship with the continent. Disruptions at the border could also cause delays in importing food into the country - potentially leading to shortages of certain imported favourites. Medicine could be disrupted  Experts have warned that failing to strike a post-Brexit trade agreement could disrupt the flow of some medicine into the UK. In September, trade bodies the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industryand European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associationsurged both sides to prioritise medicines in trade talks “to protect the supply of medicines for  million patients and safeguard the signicant opportunities that working together on medicines research and development brings to both economies”. The Government has also been working on contingency plans including creating buffer stocks of certain medical suppliers where possible and tendering for a £m freight contract to act as a back up to ensure that Category  goods, which would include vaccines, will be able to be imported to the UK. But with complex supply chains that stretch across the continent pharmacists and doctors are concerned about the consequences of no deal. Officials have been keen to stress that it will not disrupt the vaccine arriving in the UK - with officials having wargamed disruption and ministers ready to order to military flights to make sure that doses of the vaccine can arrive without interruptions. Cars become more expensive The UKaposs car industry risks losing £bn in manufacturing value within five years in the event of a no-deal Brexit, according to an industry analysis. British car production could drop below m cars a yearthere is no deal, compared with more than .m in , because tarfs would make large parts of the UK business unviable, said forecasts commissioned by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, the industry lobby group. No deal would result in % tarfs being applied overnight, adding £, to the average cost of a car imported from the EU. And a no-deal Brexit would jeopardise the future of UK plants. PSA Group has said it will only build its new Vauxhall Astra in the UKthere is a trade deal, while Nissan has said the business model of its Sunderland plant – the largest car factory in the UK – would be destroyed. Chaos at the borders  A No-Deal would likely create chaos at Britain’s borders with delays in getting goods into and out of Europe. Areas around Britain’s largest ports have spent months preparing but local authorities are still fearful of huge backlogs choking motorways in Kent. Companies exporting goods with also face tarfs on WTO terms and the added uncertainty of how to transport their goods to the EU. The licences that hauliers need for work in Europe would no longer be valid and they would be reliant on a limited number of permits from the European Conference of Ministers of Transport Even in the event of a deal government has quietly confirmed a list of  lorry parks to deal with the fallout from Brexit. The ‘inland sites’ will be built in Kent, Essex, Birmingham, Warrington and North Wales - with seven of them due to being ready by January. Violence in Northern Ireland  Spooks have warned that the UK failing to secure a deal could lead to increased violence in Northern Ireland. A report by Parliament’s intelligence and security committeewarned that changes on the island of Ireland could reignite dissident republican violence. MI devoted % of its resources to countering terrorism in Northern Ireland in the year to March . The failure would also create more immediate problems Without a trade deal, the ide between Britain and Northern Ireland would become more distinct. Brexit without a trade deal could allow Northern Ireland to become a back door into the EU’s single market, thus raising the spectre of a hard border on the island of Ireland for the first time since a  peace deal. The  Good Friday Agreement brought an end to three decades of sectarian violence between mainly Protestant Unionists who favour continued British rule and mainly Catholic Irish Nationalists who want a united Ireland. A big hit to the economy - and delayed Covid recovery The Office for Budget Responsibility said the failure to reach a free trade agreement with the EU will “compound” the massive impact of Covid and delay economic recovery by a year.  caused the biggest fall in economic output in  years with % of GDP being wiped out. But a failure to reach an agreement and defaulting to World Trade Organisation trms, including tarfs on trade with the EU, would cause even more damaging to the UKaposs faltering economy. This would “have the effect of delaying the point at which output regains its pre-virus peak by almost a year to the third quarter of ”. If you run a businessIn practical terms,you donapost run a business you might not see a direct impact on your family straight away. For business owners,we donapost a deal, the UK Global Tarf will apply to goods you import from the EU from  January .It applies to imports from all countries, unless you are importing from a country that the UK has a trade deal with, a country that is part of the Generalised Scheme of Preferences or where an exception applies.Use the tarf lookup tool to check the tarfs that may apply to goods you import from  January .Most traders with a good compliance record will be able to defer declarations on most goods for up to six months after  January .You can get more information here.Whether we get an EU trade deal or notWhatI run a business Whether thereaposs a trade deal or not, business owners will sill need to make customs declarations when they import goods from the EU.

Click here to get one. Should I renew my passport  You do not automatically need a new passport because of Brexit. Your old one remains valid evenit says ‘European Union’ on the cover. However, you must renew your passportit has less than six months before expiry on the day you travel. At the moment, British citizens can enter aposSchengen areaapos countries with a valid passport eventhey only have a day left. This changes from  January . After this date, your passport must have at least six months left. Your passport must also be no more than  years old, evenit has six months left before expiry. The following are members of the Schengen Agreement: Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland. Do I need a visa Tourists will not need a visa for short trips to EU countries, of up to  days. This exemption also includes Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. However, you will most like need a visayou are going to the EU to live, work or study.WhatI have a pet  EU ‘pet passports’ for dogs, cats and ferrets will no longer be valid from  January , prompting a huge surge in red tape. Current requirements say your pet should be vaccinated and microchipped three weeks before the first visit. But for any holidays after December , you must visit a vet at least four months before you travel. First you must get the animal vaccinated against rabies. Then you must wait at least  days before having a blood sample taken. Another three months after that , you can travel. The vet must give you a copy of the test results and an animal health certicate . But you need to time this move carefully, because once your vet produces the certicate, it’s only valid for  days to take your pet into the EU. This process may become easierthe UK joins the EU’s register of “listed” countries, but that’s not guaranteed yet.Do I need to change my travel insurance Quite possibly. Currently UK travellers to the EU don’t need private health insurance, because they’re covered by European Health Insurance Cards . But EHICs will no longer guarantee you free cover in EU nations from January . The government has still not published full details of health arrangements between dferent countries in the EU. But tourists are being urged to buy “comprehensive” travel insurance that covers “all needs” to fill any gaps.Will there be data roaming charges  Quite possibly. Mobile phone users currently get free data roaming across the whole of the EU. But after January , Brits will no longer get this privilege and phone firms will be free to hit you with roaming charges. You must check with your phone provider to seeyou will be affected. If you are hit with roaming charges, you can rack up a bill of £ before you are prompted and askedyou want to spend more.What will the duty-free rules be Duty-free shopping willafter January  for Brits who are going to the continent. This means people can buy duty-free goods in British ports, airports and international rail stations before leaving for the EU. It also means people can bring in goods they’ve bought duty-free in EU airports back to the UK. However, there will be a limit on how much booze or tobacco Brits can bring home from the EU. A ‘booze cruise’ will be able to bring  litres of beer, and  litres of still wine, and  litres of spirits or  litres of sparkling or fortied wine. You can also bring back either  cigarettes, or  cigarillos, or  cigars, or g tobacco - or a combination of the above.Can I drive my car in the EU Yes, but there will be more red tape. Currently a UK driving licence is the only thing visitors need to get behind the wheel on the continent. But from January  many countries will require you to get an International Driving Permit, which costs £. at the Post Office. The number issued each year is expected to soar from , to million. It’s not yet clear which type of IDP you’ll need for which countries. The government is yet to confirm. Meanwhile, you will also be forced to apply for a aposgreen cardapos to prove you have the right car insurance. The certicates are free of charge and available from insurance companies, though firms may increase admin fees to deal with red tape. Those who forget their green cards would be forced to buy expensive frontier insurance in the country they are visiting.Can I watch Netflix and Amazon Prime on holiday  Subscription services like Netflix and Amazon Prime will no longer be forced by law to let you watch your account in full in the EU.While the exact policy is up to inidual companies, in theory you could lose access to some contentyou’re watching overseas. It is because the UK will no longer be bound by the EU’s “portability regulation” from January .WhatI’ve booked a package holiday  Package holidaymakers could be left with no legal protectionthe firm they booked with goes bust. Currently Brits have insolvency protectionthey book with a package holiday provider thataposs based anywhere in the EU. But after January , that protection will only applythe firms are established in the UK or ”actively targeting the UK market. If you’re unsure, check the firm’s terms and conditions before you book to make sure you’ll be protected. Will I face queues at the border or ports It is possible, especially at the Channel ports like Dover. Businesses will face new red tape from January  , especiallythere is no trade deal between the UK and EU. In preparation, the government is ready to have thousands of lorries queuing down Kent motorways and a network of Brexit lorry parks. All this could cause disruption at the border, and it may not just be limited to freight ports. A confidential document seen by thealso predicted thousands of passengers could have to wait an additional two hours for Eurostar trains.Can I still use my credit or debit card abroad Check with your issuer, but essentially, yes. However, you may be charged more for using credit or debit cards to pay for things in euros when you buy from companies in the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein or Norway. Payments may also take longer.WhatI’m an EU national in the UK EU nationals living in the UK must register for “settled status”they want to stay after January , and millions have already done so. The deadline to apply is  June . To get settled status, you must have been living in the UK for at least five years continuously, without a break of more than six months. If you have not been in the UK for this long, you can get ‘pre-settled status’. You will then have to make a second application when you reach the five-year mark to upgrade it to settled status. There is no fee to apply for the scheme after the government agreed to demands to scrap it.WhatI’m an UK national in the EU You may need to apply for residency status in the country you’re living in before June . You may also need to buy health insurance or register for healthcare for the country you are living in. And you may need to exchange your drivers’ licence for a local one - among other things.

There’ll be no cards, no presents, no crackers or trimmings – not even a glass of fizz. In fact, on Christmas Day, itself, I’ll be waking up next to a stranger. As crazy as it may sound, I can’t wait.I had no idea what meditation was until I went to Thailand in . I’d separated from my husband after four years of marriage and went away to do some soul-searching.One day I went on a trip with a group of people to a beautul temple and we were askedwe would like to do meditation. I was the only volunteer.  The monk got me to sit in the lotus position, which was terribly painful, then asked me to close my eyes and to see a flame in front of me and focus on my breath.All I could think about was how sore my knees were and what I’d be having for dinner. I couldn’t wait for it to end. It went on for two hours, but when I walked out afterwards, I felt amazing. My senses were heightened, I felt so aware and alert and relaxed. It was incredible. I was training in psychology and interested in how the mind worked so, back in London, I found a meditation class and started going once a week. I bought meditation CDs and books and even a cushion so I could practise at home. I got so into it, my mother became concerned. She thought I was conversing with spirits, trying to become a medium or something.My parents are strong churchgoers and had no idea about meditation. They thought it could be dangerous and affect my mind. But the more I practised, the more I could feel myself benefiting. It helped me understand myself and my relationships better, it helped me come to terms with my orce.I can be quite self-critical and it helped me to be less harsh on myself and learn to manage those critical thoughts better. I felt calmer. I wanted to immerse myself in it more fully so, that year, I went on a Christmas retreat.I’d spent the previous Christmas partying with friends, so spending it in silence couldn’t be more dferent. I didn’t tell my parents or my friends or work colleagues. I thought they’d think I’d become some kind of crazy hippy and it was all a bit weird. I was almost ashamed of it. The retreat was at a Quaker school in Oxfordshire and fairly basic. I was told to bring comfy clothes and slippers. The dormitories were in outbuildings and quite cold. I was relieved to get a room to myself.  But the biggest challenge was the silence. It was a beginner’s retreat for  days so they introduced it gradually – a couple of hours a day, then half a day, then a full day. I still found it dficult. The fact it was Christmas made it harder.I was glad I’d taken a book and spent most of the time reading, then I found out you’re not supposed to read, you’re supposed to avoid all communication, including reading, eye contact and smiling. It’s all about “stilling the mind”. I was tempted to send a text, but I tried to respect the silence because you don’t have that in ordinary le – it’s rare. Everyone was allocated a task – chopping vegetables or washing up, sometimes cleaning the toilet. In between meditation , we got on with our tasks. Of course there is no speaking, so the tasks were listed for us to see on a notice board.Christmas Day was just like any other day. There were no decorations, carols or trimmings. We had a nut roast for dinner and sat in silence.I found it strange at first. It felt rude to be sitting down with no one talking – eating is such a social thing.But after a couple of days, my mind began to slow down and settle and I actually found it quite nice. It took the pressure off making conversation and I could enjoy the food more.It was the same routine every day – we got woken by the bell at am, we did meditation before breakfast, then got on with our tasks. Then, after sitting or walking meditation in the grounds, it was time for lunch. The food was vegetarian or vegan – simple, but good. Always freshly prepared and it smelled lovely. There was no alcohol. I enjoy a glass of wine, but I didn’t miss it.Katy Perry, Jenner Aniston, Madonna and Angelina Jolie have all spoken about the benefits of meditation. Silent retreats were among the top wellness trends for  and often attract people aged  to . Retreats offer the chance to rest, reflect and reconnect with nature, do yoga, swim, walk or simply nap.

Jo Scollen, , and her husband Jason, , suffered a baby loss nearly every year since they started trying for a child in , and at one point doctors even told them they might as well give up. Jo had no trouble conceiving, but the pregnancy never lasted longer than  weeks and initially doctors couldnapost work out why. They tried IVF, but it didnapost work, and with funds running out Jo had all but given up hope when she entered a competition for a free round of fertility treatment in Cyprus out of desperation. Against all the odds they won and the procedure worked, and the couple, from Wimbledon, south-west London, welcomed baby Jessica Rose into the family last year. Jo said: It was unbelievable. I was at the stage where I was on my knees and about to give up. “After having that many disappointments, you’re dicing with emotional death the whole way through the process. “We had literally run out of funds at that point- both financially and emotionally- and it came entirely out of the blue. “It was a miraculous bolt of positivity. Jessica has been a dream. You’ve never known a more determined baby, and you can tell where she gets it from.  “I don’t think there has ever been a baby that’s more wanted than her. “With Covid everything has been locked down so we’ve not been able to do many of those things I’ve waited  years to do, like seeing family or just going shopping, which is heartbreaking. “But she is here, full of le, and I am so grateful. Jo and Jason, both home renovators, met in a pub in Wimbledon in . They started dating and quickly moved in together, then began trying for a baby after just a year. “Neither of us had a typical lestyle growing up and it was our common bond that we wanted to have a family- and lots of animals. she said. Jo became pregnant for the first time in , and suffered her first loss the same year, when she was around seven weeks along. She said: That was horrendous - all our hopes for the future were there and then our world fell apart. I had to stay in hospital for a week after that. “But it is in both of our natures to not give up easily, we are survivors in our makeup, so we just tried to dust ourselves off and try again.  She said she was unable to get any answers from UK doctors about why she kept having miscarriages. Because she had no problem falling pregnant, she did not consider IVF at the time. In need of a break and a change, they sold everything and moved to Granada, Spain in . She said: It wasn’t working over the years and it was getting harder to deal with in the midst of London. There was so much around that we couldn’t get our heads together.  We came here to reduce stress and simply our le, thinking maybe that would help. She said she was able to get more tests in Spain to look into why she was having miscarriages. Medics discovered she had three types of blood clotting disorders and additional immune factors like chronic fatigue syndromethat could be affecting her pregnancies. Jo said they told her it would be so hard to remain pregnant she might as well give up, she said. She suffered  miscarriages in total before she turned to reproductive assistance in Spain in  which cost about £,. This, alongside all the costs involved in seeing specialists and undergoing tests, was racking up quite a bill for the couple.  A specialist miscarriage doctor from Epsom, Surrey, advised Jo that a precise timing of the medications involved in the procedure could give her a glimmer of hope. She said: We decided it was something that we hadnapost tried before and we should give it a go. Again she fell pregnant as a result, but had her th miscarriage in . “I was on the verge of giving up - each pregnancy and miscarriage was dferent and traumatic in a dferent way, she said. “A lot of clinics said IVF wouldn’t work because I wasn’t having any trouble getting pregnant, which is what the treatment is intended to help with, I just couldn’t hold on to the baby. “There were some clinics that dealt specically with recurrent miscarriages, but we still weren’t successful there.”  Sheaposd almost given up hope when she came across a competition by magazine ivfbabble on Facebook, with a prize of a free cycle of IVF, in November .The competition was to commemorate  years since the birth of the first IVF baby, Louisa Brown. “I just clicked in a desperate moment and then completely forgot about it, said Jo. “We proceeded to have our th loss and I thought there was no point carrying on, but then I got the email through saying I’d won. “I had to ring them up and check that it wasn’t an international scam. “When my husband and I realised it was true, he said ‘I’ve only ever won a bag of crisps’.” Jo and Jason were one of ten winners and believe their baby could have been the first one born from the prize procedure.  Their procedure was scheduled in the Dunya clinic in Cyprus, and the couple travelled for  hours from their home in Spain in November . “Whilst the IVF cycle was free, we had to fund our travel there which wasn’t easy as we live in the middle of nowhere and we ended up having to go via Istanbul, she said. “There were many flight delays, and we had to arrange for care for our many animals, but with IVF everything has a very strict timeline so we had to leave right away. “The benefit of IVF for me was that the medication was timed specically for my cycle and helped with some of the roadblocks. An error led to the failure of the first cycle of IVF before the implantation stage. “We were devastated as this was supposed to be our miracle moment, she said. The clinic offered them a second cycle, so the couple ed to Cyprus in February . Four weeks later, Jo and Jason went to Cartagena to find out the positive result via a blood test.  She said: I had to have IV intralipids immediately after the test came back positive and continued to have those throughout the pregnancy. I also had strong steroid injections and daily heparin injections- the approach was a lot more aggressive and wasnapost very nice, My fertility coach, who dealt with complicated pregnancies, meditation and hypnosis helped me find my centre and made me more mentally prepared than ever before, Even with the positive result, Jo was never complacent. “Our hearts were in our mouths the entire time, she said. We kept thinking that this was the miracle for us and everything must be falling into place. “Then it all started to happen, step-by-step. “With every scan and every week I was petried. Jason had me wrapped in bubble wrap - but I was treated as high-risk and I had appointments or scans more-or-less every fortnight.  “There was never a moment when we thought ‘Thank goodness for that it’s all going to be OK’. “Throughout the whole pregnancy, right up to delivery, we held our breath. She went into labour but  hours after her waters broke her baby still hadnapost arrived, so she had an emergency c-section on October . Jessica Rose, now  months old, was born healthy, weighing .lb. She said: In the end I had a caesarean and she was delivered in  minutes, but both my husband and my translator had to wait outside so I didn’t have much idea what was going on. “I was quickly whisked into recovery and had to stay in hospital for four or five days, but I just couldn’t wait to get back home. “Even when she was born I had to keep checking she was really there - I still can’t believe it happened for us. I still check now, but every week she becomes more real. “People see it as a selfish thing to continue after so many failures and this is why it’s a dficult subject - people just don’t understand why I would do it.

Gerard Bristow told the Liverpool Echo that crazed ex-cage fighter Andrew Wadsworth chased him down the street in an attempt to kill him. Wadsworth aposmade a beelineapos for him just moments after he stabbed beautician Melissa Belshaw to death in her upstairs bedroom. Alarming CCTV footage released earlier this week revealed how the cocaine-addled murderer pursued him along the street, viciously swiping at him with the long carving blade as he desperately backed away. Dressed in flip flops and shorts, he was ill-prepared for such a terrying and le-threatening confrontation. The dad described how he and another heroic passerby were bravely primed to go inside the Upholland Road house in Billinge after hearing terrible screams from inside, where the mum-of-one had just been fatally attacked. Van driver Kevin Moores bravely smashed into the locked house with a hammer. But within seconds, violent criminal Wadsworth came outside and set upon Mr Bristow, aiming savage blows at him with the kne. Many were focused at the neighbouraposs head, thankfully missing their target, but managing to slice the -year-oldaposs ear instead.  Mr Bristow said: I heard her [Melissaaposs teenage daughter] screaming saying aposmy mumaposs been killed.apos Me and this lad [Kevin Moores] were stood there, wondering what do we do next. He said, aposdo you wanna go in the house  I said, aposyeah,apos and before we knew it, there was Andrew Wadsworth trying to climb out of the smashed porch window. Mr Bristow said: We were stood behind the car.  But because I was asking the questions, aposis she okay in there apos several times, he said aposyeah, sheaposs fine... Iaposm just after the Scouser next doorapos. And within seconds he made a beeline for me, and I actually think it was because I was the one asking all the questions. He was suddenly on top of me, he pulled a kne out of his trousers, down to his left hand and side, and thataposs when he started coming at me with the kne. I believe he got my ear, going for my head obviously, but he managed to take part of my ear off, it was hanging on. Unfortunately I had flip flops on at the time, I wasnapost really prepared for this. Mr Moores raced over and kicked Wadsworth as he was on top of Mr Bristow as he pinned him down, which allowed the -year-old to stagger away.  He added: Itaposs bizarre, Iaposd finished a conference call two minutes before so I wasnapost exactly prepared for anything, working from home, going down in my flip flops and my shorts. It was very much a strange situation. Mr Bristow sustained serious stab wounds to the chest and collarbone area and a collapsed lung. On Thursday,  Wadsworth was jailed for le  and ordered to serve a minimum of  years for the May  murder and the attempt to murder Mr Bristow. He unsuccessfully tried to persuade a jury he should be convicted of manslaughter because of a sudden loss of control. The violent thug,  who once left a man with a brain injury  after striking him over the head with a hammer in a house robbery, will be in his s before he will be considered for release.

Talk about thinking out of the box. Who would have thought that sewage could provide answers to a medical problem  It turns out sewage could be a useful tool not only in the diagnosis of Covid- but also in providing data on locating virus hotspots. A report in the BMJ by medical writer Zosia Kmietowicz explains that sewage is known to be a great way to spot the ious kinds of infections and dferent strains of bacteria within communities. This applies to viruses too and in particular coronavirus, says Davey Jones, professor of soil and environmental science at Bangor University. Scientists have been collecting wastewater to check for RNA from SARS-CoV- in sewage since the start of the pandemic. Jones believes sewage reflects the public’s health. If you know how to examine it, it reveals secrets. It’s been used to track antimicrobial resistance in the community, drug use and microplastics, as well as other viruses such as norovirus and hepatitis. Sewage can act as an early warning system. By taking samples of wastewater in North Wales, Jones believes sewage helped spot the surge in cases among students in September, before they were tested. This knowledge put scientists on the front foot to control the virus. What’s more, further analysis will help to determinethe current lockdown measures are working. It will also reveal whether influenza viruses are circulating so that people can knowthey have Covid- or flu. We already have more than  wastewater treatment sites in the UK, and water sampling has been rolled out to cover around % of the population in England. There are plans to expand this project in the future. There’s a lot of interest in the contents of sewage and wastewater by government departments. The Joint Biosecurity Centre is conducting pilots to “test how this approach can generate targeted scientic intelligence to help health authorities make future decisions, including assessing how precisely wastewater can be used to identy coronavirus sources.” "},{"url":null,"title":"embroider who worked kate meghans","story":"NewsKate and Meghans wedding dress maker struggling to feed kids and may lose homeMum-of-two Chloe Savage, who embroidered parts of Kate Middleton and Meghan Markles wedding dresses, said she has received no financial help during the pandemicmirrorShareCommentsByDave Burke:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsEmbroider Chloe Savage, who helped create Meghan Markles wedding day veil, says she is on the brink of losing her home \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

A pioneering experiment immersed more than , participants in dferent natural environments and monitored their emotional responses. The volunteers had a number of psychometric tests before and after being exposed to scenes such as meadows, mountains, waterfalls and urban environments. Contributors also had to rate their stress and wellbeing levels before and after being immersed in the natural environment. The study, led by i media research at Goldsmiths University of London, on behalf of plant powered snack brand, ZENB Veggie Bites, found water was the most effective at increasing positive emotions, such as happiness and inspiration. In total,  per cent reported that they felt an increase in happiness and  per cent felt inspired after watching scenes of water environments. Waterfalls were the most effective at boosting creativity and determination, while meadows and fields were most likely to enhance energy and trigger excitement. Seas, lakes and rivers were associated with the highest percentage changeacross participants’ perceived abilities to perform cognitive tasks after being immersed in the environment. The study showed how nature can also provide a tonic for those working from home, helping ease feelings of burnout for  per cent of participants. More than a quarterfelt more productive, and a further  per cent said it gave them a sense of perspective they needed. Meanwhile, the research highlighted how woodlands can have the most restorative effects on people’s thoughts. Almost six in participants admitted the environment helped them forget their worries and  per cent said it helped give them clearer thoughts - more than any other environment. And fields and meadows increase feelings of excitement and can lead to a boost in energy levels. Anna Stewart, from the i media research lab at Goldsmiths University of London, said: “This research is a step towards understanding the link between nature and specic mood states. “The findings show that water environments are linked more frequently to signicant changes in mood when compared to urban settings, demonstrating the power of more awe-inspiring settings like waterfalls, seas and lakes for improving mood and decreasing negative emotions. “These settings were rated as more attractive and more novel by our sample, suggesting thatyou’re looking for a mood boost, it’s best to choose an environment that you like, but that you don’t get to see or visit very often as this should have the most positive effects on your mood.” The scientic research, created in conjunction with ZENB Veggie Bites, was backed up by a separate survey of , adults exploring attitudes towards the outdoors on emotional states. It found the average Brit deliberately goes into nature to de-stress, relax or unwind just five times-a-month. And three-quarters agree that getting out into nature has been ‘more important than ever’ for their physical and mental wellbeing in . Six in  said being in nature helps reduce their stress, while  per cent believe it helps them to stop overthinking. A fth of the UK adults, polled via OnePoll, even said getting out into nature can help reduce their anger levels. Inspired by the findings, ZENB has launched a new podcast series ‘Bites of Nature’ hosted by Jasmine Hemsley. The five-part series draws on Jasmine’s and her guest’s personal experiences of the great outdoors, featuring TV presenter AJ Odudu, botanist and TV star James Wong and more.

From this week the first doses of the Pfizer vaccine will start to be administered. It will be a le-changing moment for those living under the darkest clouds of Covid. It means people who have been shielding will finally be able to leave their homes. It means families can be reunited, care home visits can be made without fear, and frontline health workers can be protected. In the long run, it offers the opportunity for le toto normal so we can wave goodbye to the days of social distancing. But vaccinations only workthe majority of people take them. As deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam has warned, a low uptake of the jabs will almost certainly mean the restrictions will have to last longer. Some people have concerns about the safety of the new vaccines. This is partly because of the misleading information about inoculation that has been allowed to swirl unchecked across social media. But it is also because of a lack of faith in this government. That is why we should applaud celebrities who stepped forward to endorse the jab. By setting an example they will encourage more people to get vaccinated which, in turn, will help us contain the virus. The fact this paper has turned to A-listers for help in getting this message across is a damning reflection on the low standing of ministers.  It is a consequence of Boris Johnson lazily raising expectations and offering  hopes. He told us in July that le couldto normal by Christmas. It didn’t. He told us we could soonto offices and workplaces. We didn’t. He told us that a second lockdown in England was avoidable. It wasn’t. When public trust has never been more essential for the good of the country, the Prime Minister has squandered it. Cruellest cut Months of Covid restrictions have taken a terrible toll on people’s mental health across the whole nation. So it is inexplicable – not to say disgraceful – that the Government has decided to cut funding for the Time to Change charity.

Marcela Iglesias, , has shelled out for cosmetic procedures over the years and believes surgery is the right choice to make her son, Rodrigo, , happy. Rodrigo has already had less-invasive approaches such as botox injections into the tip of his nose, but now wants to go under the kne. His model mum, from Los Angeles, who is often mistaken for her sonaposs girlfriend or sister, fully supports his choice – despite Rodrigoaposs young age. He has manested that he doesnapost like the shape of his nose. “The procedure will help him to be more comfortable taking pictures. “He has tried some units of botox at the tip of his nose, which prevent his nostrils from looking aposwider’ – but it just lasted for a couple of months. “My worst fear ishe comes home with a nose job saying ‘well mom see I got it done, and you were not part of it!’. “I would feel be very disappointed and felt terrible not to support my son. “There are risks, of course, just like when he drives every day to the gym or work, but I can not control his decisions. “I know that when the surgery or procedure is done by a professional who knows exactly what heaposs doing, thereaposs % chance it will be successful. “Also his nose does not require a lot of work as I think the bone wonapost have to be broken – just the tip will be refined,” she said. Marcela further defends her choice by adding that Rodrigo was recently diagnosed with a mildly deviated septum, so the surgery could further his ability to breathe. The model said: “The deviated septum means he cannot breathe as well through one nostril – so he told me ‘ I do the surgery to correct that, maybe at the same time I will fix my nose aesthetically’. “He doesnapost like the tip of his nose – so he just wants to perfect something for himself, not to please anybody . Marcela insists she wouldn’t approve just any surgery. She added: “If he was overweight and told me that he wants liposuction, I would never accept it – because the first thing is to work out to burn the fat, not the easy route of sucking it out, which actually does not work and he can just use our Edgecross-X to build muscle like I do. “In order to achieve a chiselled look, you need to work out, period. “Nothing will get you in better shape than exercise and diet, no questions asked. “My son has an amazing bone structure and great hair. He follows a healthy diet and beauty regimens.  “He loves fashion and works out six days a week with me. “But when it comes to the face... well there is no such thing as fitness for noses. Marcela adds that her son’s situation is quite common where they live.

They had to be.Coming so soon after that horror show, the authorities had placed a huge amount of trust in Dundee to put on an event that would bring pride back to the national game.They were not disappointed.The senior police officer in charge of crowd control said: “I just can’t praise the supporters enough. In the park itself their behaviour was first-class.”An ambulance service spokesperson added: “We didn’t have to deal with any fighting before, during or after the match. The fans were excellent.”Dundonian blood wasn#t spilled but it flowed through this memorable occasion.A toss of the coin decided the match would be played at Dens, an outcome that would have been cheered more loudly by the United team than the “home” side because of their love of playing in their rivals’ backyard.Not only did the clubs both hail from the banks of the Tay but so did the referee, with local whistler Bob Valentine handed the honour in a gesture that deserves to be applauded even all these years later. It was a brave show of imagination from the blazers, not something you see too often.As well as bragging rights and silverware, a place in the next season’s Uefa Cup was on offer in this First Division v Premier League contest.Tom Lauchlen, then Scottish Football League president, went all-in on the award of the prestigious tie to the city.He said: “And so, on with the game, which is widely accepted as the most interesting confrontation in the history of the competition. No matter the outcome of today’s match, surely the citizens of Dundee in particular, and football in general, will benefit.”In a storyline that would have been at home in a Broons annual, a wedding was saved by the police just as kick-off approached.Margaret Etchells, of Sandeman Street, who lived just yards from Dens, was getting married at pm to Alexander Edwards in SS Peter and Paul Church. An area in front of her house was cleared for taxis and a police escort was laid on to get her to the church on time as masses of fans converged on the stadium.The scene for the match – the sporting one this time # was set in the programme by the stylish prose of that era’s football writers.The Courier’s long-serving reporter Tommy Gallacher touched on events in Glasgow earlier in the year, writing: “Dundee is being presented with a heaven-sent opportunity to prove to everyone that intense rivalry need not be associated with violence of any kind. If Dundee and Dundee United achieve this then, regardless of the outcome, there may be broken hearts but no real losers.”Locally-based journalist John Mann, working for the Daily Star at the time, declared: “On this unique day, Dundee is the capital of Scottish football.”The late, great Dick Donnelly provided a superb article on Tannadice boss Jim McLean that must have given United fans reading it goosebumps as they awaited kick-off.He wrote: “It was nine years ago last Wednesday that the Dens Park coach made the short trip across the road to Tannadice to succeed Jerry Kerr as manager. Long enough hidden away in the backwoods of our national sport, United have, during McLean’s reign, progressed almost beyond all recognition.”As usual, Dick was correct and United would go on to reach even greater heights under McLean both at home and abroad.A huge part of the club’s success was, of course, down to legendary captain Paul Hegarty.The central defender, even  years on, looks back on that day with enormous pride.Famously, he chose not to be first to lt the cup himself but instead gted the honour to long-serving keeper Hamish McAlpine, a generous gesture agreed upon by every other player without the goalie’s prior knowledge.By coincidence, the aforementioned match programme had a sketch of Hamish on its front page, holding the cup along with Dark Blues’ number one Bobby Geddes.Maybe someone knew something the rest of us didn’t…Recalling, four decades on, how he decided to make a skipper’s sacrice on one of his proudest days in tangerine, Hegarty said: “We had discussed it as a group before the game, without Hamish being involved.“We were conscious of tempting fate because anything can happen in finals but we wanted to have a plan in place just in case.“The decision was taken to let Hamish lt the trophywe won because of the service he had given United.“He had been through all the ups and downs over the years and we wanted to give him recognition.“I didn’t think twice about it.“It had happened in Spain a few times at the likes of Barcelona and Real Madrid soit was good enough for them it was good enough for us.“We had a magnicent club servant in Hamish and wanted to do what’s right by him.“When the time came I said to him to go ahead of me and, after some reluctance, Hamish enjoyed his moment.”The teams were:Dundee: Bobby Geddes, Les Barr, Erich Schaedler, Cammy Fraser, Bobby Glennie, George McGeachie, Peter Mackie, Ray Stephen, Eric Sinclair, Billy Williamson , Andy Geddes .Dundee United: Hamish McAlpine, Dave Narey, Iain Phillip, John Holt, Paul Hegarty, Frank Kopel, Eamonn Bannon, Willie Pettigrew, Davie Dodds, Paul Sturrock, Graeme Payne.Referee: Bob Valentine.Attendance: ,.Scorers: Dodds , Sturrock .Hegarty took us on a walk through the game asit had happened yesterday.After the Dark Blues had a Sinclair “goal” chalked off for a foul, Dodds put the Tangerines ahead right before half-time.Sturrock then pounced twice for United following two Hegarty headers, the first hitting the bar and the second parried by keeper Geddes.The United captain recalled: “Doddsie scored just before half-time with his header and I was behind him when he put it in – don’t ask why I was so high up the pitch.“They had the ball in our net before that but there was a foul on Hamish so that didn’t count.“It had been reasonably even until we took the lead so to score at such a vital time was brilliant for us.“I played a big part in our next two goals, with Luggyscoring after two of my headers.“For the first I got good contact on the corner but it smacked off the bar and came down for Luggy to nod into the net.“Because of how that goal had been scored, I was surprised when I got room inside the box again to put in another header, which was saved before Luggy made sure again.“I was just glad that he was in the right place at the right time, not once but twice.#Hegarty added: “I think it was a pretty comfortable victory in the end.“My main emotion at the final whistle was relief because you want the job done.“I was so happy for the United fans because it was a cup win against their rivals – a Dundee derby as well as being a final.“Can you imagineit hadn’t gone our way “We would be reading articles nowadays about how Dundee upset the odds. We couldn’t have put our supporters through that!”Hegarty pinpointed the previous season’s final against Aberdeen and that year’s semi-final second leg - success away to Celtic as the two performances that gave the Tangerines the edge for this one.He said: “It is hard to explain just how much confidence and momentum we took from having won the trophy the year before.“In the first final match at Hampden against Aberdeenwe actually carried a lot of luck and they were the better side on the day.“That all changed when we went to Dens for the replay, though, and we ran out deserved winners against an excellent Aberdeen team.“We were just a confident bunch back then and believed in our ability as a group of players.“What helped enormously for the Dundee final was having won our first bit of silverware just  months previously.“We were over that first hurdle and were feeling good about going back across the road, a pitch that suited our style of play.“Also, we had recorded an exceptional result in the semi-final by beating Celtic - at Parkhead after a draw at Tannadice in the first game. You always took heart from winning in Glasgow against one of the Old Firm.“On the day, there was some pressure on us because we were favourites but it wasn’t a problem because of that self-belief.”The late and much-missed Ron Scott, reporting from the Dens final under his Sunday Post byline Bill McFarlane, spoke to McLean after full-time.The victorious boss typically deflected praise away from himself.Instead, McLean picked out Graeme Payne for a special mention, having left him out of his line-up for the  success against Aberdeen.McLean told Ron: “I won the League Cup for my we, two sons and especially Graeme Payne.#Paul Sturrock was the man of the match but I’m delighted for Graeme. He typies the best of Scottish football.“I had to leave him out of last season’s final for tactical reasons…so I’m exceptionally pleased he had his moment of glory here.”He also caught up with Dundee manager Donald Mackay and got an answer to the question every Dark Blues’ fan was asking when their team was read out: “Where was winger Jimmy Murphy ”Ron reported Mackay as saying: “United treated the game like the cup-tie it was. We didn’t. It was as simple as that.”Asked about Murphy’s omission, Mackay added: “Jimmy was disciplined after Wednesday’s reserve game against Raith Rovers.#Players cannot be allowed to play for Dundee when they feel like it. They must produce the whole time.”Murphy’s absence was all the more extraordinary because of the starring role he had played in the games that got the Dens men to the final.He scored a penalty in the shootout at Rugby Park when they edged past Kilmarnock in the third round tormented Aberdeen at Pittodrie as Cammy Fraser’s goal sealed a superb quarter-final success and covered every blade of grass in the - semi-final, second leg thriller against Ayr United at Dens.For one Tannadice player, the success earned him a noteworthy city double.Just seven years previously, midfielder Iain Phillip was in the Dundee team that lted the League Cup at Hampden by beating Celtic thanks to Gordon Wallace’s goal.Now he was in the United side, collecting a medal at the expense of his former club.The last word on the Friendly Final goes to an unnamed but happy United fan, who called the Sunday Post office that night from the Vennel Bar on the city’s Hilltown.No doubt helped by a pint or two, he reported: “There are  Dundee and United supporters here and we’re all having a sing-song and enjoying ourselves. Put this on your front page. It’s the sort of thing that does the city proud.”~ First round, first leg East Fe  United .Scorers: Milne , Ward, Sturrock , Narey.Second leg United  East Fe .Scorers: Ward , Hegarty, Payne.United won - on aggregate.~ Second round, first leg United  Cowdenbeath .Scorers: Bannon , Sturrock, Hegarty.Second leg Cowdenbeath  United .Scorers: Hegarty, Ward , Sturrock.United won - on aggregate.~ Third round, first leg Motherwell  United .Scorer: Addison.Second leg United  Motherwell  .Scorers: Sturrock , Holt, Milne.United won - on aggregate.~ Quarter-final, first leg Clydebank  United .Scorer: Bannon.Second leg United  Clydebank .Scorers: Ward , Sturrock, Hegarty.United won - on aggregate.~ Semi-final, first leg United  Celtic .Scorer: Bannon.Second leg Celtic  United .Scorers: Pettigrew, Sturrock, Dodds.United won - on aggregate.~ Second round, first leg Dundee  Arbroath .Scorer: Fletcher .Second leg Arbroath  Dundee .Scorers: Sinclair, Fletcher, MacLaren.Dundee won - on aggregate.~ Third round, first leg Dundee  Kilmarnock .Second leg Kilmarnock  Dundee .Dundee won - on pens.

Saints, however, failed to harness the wind advantage and it was the home side who looked the more threatening in the early stages.Skipper Lewis Buchanan registered Saints first effort on goal in the th minute, cutting in from the right to send a well-struck shot just wide of the postage stamp corner.Saints manager Donald Black made early use of the agreed rolling substitutes policy, sending on Fraser MacFarlane in the th minute to replace Alan Buchanan in the centre forward#s role.It didn#t take MacFarlane long to make an impact and his neat turn on the edge of the D created the space for a right foot volley which arced away from the Red Star keeper#s right hand to nestle in the bottom corner and give Saints a st minute lead.Red Star cancelled out the Saints advantage on the stroke of half-time after good work on the right from Chris Hart took him all the way to the bye-line from where his cutback picked out Stuart MacLean on the six-yard line for an easy finish.With the wind gathering pace, a long second half was in prospect for Saints and it took the hosts just four minutes to capitalise on their controlled first half performance when central defender Ben Forbes poked home an Andy Weir right wing corner through a sea of legs.After Lewis Buchanan had headed a th minute Andy Weir left wing corner off the line, Weir#s follow up delivery from the opposite flank picked out right full back Coll McCallum eight yards out for the home side#s third goal.Red Star stretched their advantage still further on the hour mark when Ben Forbes whipped a wind assisted free-kick from the halfway line into the postage stamp corner giving Murdo MacKenzie no chance.After keeping the hosts at bay for  minutes, Saints conceded a fth goal with almost the last kick of the ball. Murdo MacKenzie did well to parry a dipping -yard Aaron Moore shot, but luck deserted the Saints keeper when the ball broke to Ewan Litster, who chipped over the stranded keeper into the unguarded net.With the rain coming horizontally, both sets of players were delighted to hear referee Jimmy Litster#s final whistle immediately after the restart signalling a stampede for the sanctuary of the ious cars and vans in the school car park."},{"url":null,"title":"online focus for feis an tairbeirt","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

We know that our early ancestors split from chimpanzees, our closest ape relative, around - million years ago , and that the first near-humans of our genusevolved in Africa at least . Myr.These forerunners eventually gave rise to us , but our knowledge of what happened between these dates is very limited, largely because fossilised remains are extremely rare.Common illustrations depicting how our upright posture, facial features and lack of body hair gradually evolved are based on few skeletons of ancient ancestors. Most notable is that of Lucy, a young female skeleton dating back to . Myr.Lucy was discovered in the Afar depression, Ethiopia, in , and was assigned to a species more primitive than ours , and named A. afarensis after her location. In the s a few teeth and bone fragments were found that proved to be similar to, but even older than, Lucy, dating from ^ Myr and called A. anamensis. it was assumed that Lucy was directly descended from this ancient primate.Not surprisingly, there was much excitement in the field when anthropologist Yohannes Haile-Selassie discovered a near-complete skull of A. anamensis dating from approximately . Myr. He found the skull, simply known as MRD for now, during his fieldworks at Woranso-Mille, Ethiopia, in . As the oldest and most-complete skull of A. anamensis, this find allowed detailed comparison with Lucy’s species.There was general agreement that, like the illustration, our ancient ancestors descended one from another in a linear fashion. So most experts assumed that A. anamensis evolved directly into Lucy’s species.Haile-Selassie’s detailed study of MRD suggests, however, that the two species co-existed in Africa for at least , years, presumably with the potential for interbreeding. This undoubtedly shakes up previous thoughts and reshapes our understanding of Homo evolution.But only time will tell Haile-Salassie says he hopes to find the rest of MRD’s skeleton # and even earlier members of our Homo genus # which should certainly help unravel our deep past."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast episode 17 congratulations and jubilations","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Some applicants do not have English as their first language and Citizens Advice Bureauoffices have experience in obtaining advice via interpreters.Outreach clinics, centred in local area job centres, are also a feature of the CAB service and enable job centre staff to refer clients directly to a CAB Advisor based there for a day.Any cuts will increase the workload on CAB offices exponentially as thousands more may be made redundant, find they have no income of any kind, and turn to CAB for advice. Cuts will undoubtedly affect the vulnerable in our society immediately, with theIn cities such as Glasgow, the closure of offices would mean that many claimants could find it impossible to travel to other parts of the city and, in any case, with an already growing list of applicants those offices would soon be overwhelmed,they are not already.Several members of CAB staff have already been made redundant. I believe that more may follow without additional funding.In Glasgow alone, five offices face closure, though it is estimated that in excess of , people in Glasgow sought advice from these offices in the last year. This is likely to be the case in major cities around Scotland.Our petition calls on the Scottish Parliament to urge the Scottish Government to provide urgent funding to Citizens Advice Scotland. It can be found on the Scottish Parliament website # petition number PE: Urgent funding for Citizens Advice Bureaux.Alistair S Stephen, by emailSir,The Covert Human Intelligence Sources Bill currently going through Westminster, dubbed the Spy Cop Bill, gives agencies including police, armed forces, HMRC, and even the Food Standards Agency permission to break the law with impunity.These agencies will be permitted to break international and domestic law in direct contravention of the Geneva Convention on human rights.Why is this legislation being brought in, and why are HMRC and the Food Standards Agency being given such powers  It is beyond belief that the majority of MPs actually voted for this bill.A clue may come from recent comments made by the home Secretary and endorsed by the prime minister about #leftie lawyers# and #do-gooders#, referring to human rights lawyers and refugee organisations.As for the Food Standards Agency, clues might come from the other very concerning bill in process at present which is the Internal Market Bill which contravenes the Good Friday Agreement and the devolution settlements for Scotland and Wales by undermining the authority of the devolved governments, as well as breaking an international treaty signed less than a year ago.This bill contains some deeply concerning clauses which would come under the remit of The Food Standards Agency which normally only has jurisdiction south of the border, but this bill would enable a UK trade minister to unilaterally overrule Scottish legislation on food safety standards to allow for a trade deal with the US, and the importation of sub-standard foods and food products.It is also the case that any UK minister or appointee would be able to overrule any Scottish legislation. This could affect all aspects of our lives.The Spy Cop Bill is a means of enforcing the Internal Market Bill by using the threat of underhand means. Thus piling illegality on illegality with regard to international law.We need to be very concerned on both counts.Amnesty International has already voiced its grave concerns, as have other international bodies and governments.Surely independence is now the best option for Scotland, where we can build a better, fairer nation for ourselves one that obeys international laws and respects the basic human rights of all its citizens, with a written constitution to ensure that no future Scottish government could ever impose such draconian legislation on the people of Scotland.Cecilia Rees , Lochgilphead.Sir,The Covid- pandemic continues to be exceptionally dficult for all of us, but has also led to crisis levels of #pet poverty# in the UK.PDSA is a charity that provides free and low cost vet care for those who struggle to pay treatment costs for their sick and injured pets.Since the first UK lockdown began, we’ve seen an overwhelming number of additional enquiries from pet owners who have hit hard times.

Martin Bonar replaced Scott Johnston for Saints while Chris Hart made way for Innes Meikle for the hosts.The deadlock was broken in the th minute from a quickly-taken free kick by Cammy Hill after Martin Bonar had been brought down in the centre circle by James McGuiness.Hill spotted Aaron McKay in space on the right and sent him scurrying forward. McKay cut into the box and picked out the run of Craig MacEwan who was foiled from six yards by Ally Lewis.The young keeper#s good work was undone when he couldn#t hold MacEwan#s shot allowing the ball to spin away from him.Ben Forbes was on hand with a sliding challenge to knock the loose ball away from MacEwan but only as far as Gavin Forgrieve, who gleefully tapped home from four yards.Lewis saved again from MacEwan three minutes later this time managing to hold onto the ball at the second attempt before a neat Matty Kelly turn on the corner of the Star -yard box wrong footed Ben Forbes creating the space for Kelly to curl a ball to the far post a matter of inches in front of the outstretched boot of Scott Maitland.Maitland got forward again in the st minute finding Gavin Forgrieve in front of goal. He took the ball down well only for Innes Meikle to get back with a vital challenge at the expense of a corner kick.Martin Bonar climbed well at the back post to meet Forgrieve#s delivery from the right but couldn#t direct his header on target.Despite being unable to hit the target himself Bonar was able to claim an st minute assist for the second and final goal.The big midfielder, a key member of Red Star#s  Scottish Amateur Football League Premier Division Two title winning side, won possession well in the centre circle and opened up his former team mates with a perfectly weighted pass for the forward run of skipper Craig MacEwan.Top marksman MacEwan comfortably beat stranded Red Star keeper Ally Lewis with a deft chip from  yards into the unguarded net.Referee Jimmy Litster, who ensured the two local rivals remained on friendly terms throughout, called time on proceedings after three added minutes with both sides satisfied to complete another  minutes while the majority of their respective league rivals remain side-lined."},{"url":null,"title":"in praise of john campbell factor mor","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The town on its present site would be taking shape by the time young Zachary began his schooling.His education, however, was said to be #rudimentary#, so young Zachary began teaching himself Latin and Greek as he absorbed English classic literature.Employed from the age of  in a merchant#s office in Glasgow, historical references describe him falling into #bad company# and indulging in excessive drinking.At the age of  in  he emigrated to Jamaica to take up a role as a book-keeper, effectively a slave overseer, on a sugar plantation. Such was his horror and disgust at the way in which slaves were treated on the plantation that he became an implacable opponent of the slave trade.He gave up his job in Jamaica # by this time a #model book-keeper# # and ed in  to Britain and secured a position in London. His sister Jean had married Thomas Babington of Rothley Temple, Leicestershire, a country gentleman and ardent evangelical. Babington took MacAulay under his wing and introduced him to the Clapham Sect # a group of Tories against slavery.Among them was William Wilberforce, founder and leader of the anti-slavery movement.Through working with the Clapham Sect, MacAulay was invited in  to visit Sierra Leone # the West African colony established to provide a home to emancipated slaves from the United States who came to Sierra Leone via Nova Scotia.In , aged , he was promoted to the post of governor and remained in the post until .Returning to England on a slave ship, he brought with him  African children, with the hope of finding them a better le in the Clapham Sect community.He settled in Surrey following his marriage to Selina Mills on August , .Having witnessed the misery of slavery, MacAulay became a member of the Society for the Abolition of the Slave Trade, working closely with Wilberforce, and soon became a leading figure in the parliamentary campaign. He later became secretary of the committee, which became known as the African Institution.The campaign succeeded in , with an Act of Parliament making the slave trade illegal throughout the British Empire. The practice, however, was to continue despite this victory.Many abolitionists had thought slavery would fade away once the slave trade was stopped, but that failed to happen.MacAulay continued in his activism, helping seize a slave ship in . On this act, William Wilberforce commented in a letter to MacAulay, #you really deserve a statue#.In the s MacAulay turned his attention towards securing the total abolition of slavery itself. He helped found the Society for the Mitigation and Gradual Abolition of Slaveryin , and was editor of its monthly publication, the Anti-Slavery Reporter from its launch in .His major contribution was the collection and collating of a huge volume of evidence showing the true scale of slavery # a role to which he was ideally suited as a skilled statistician with a meticulous approach and an exceptional head for figures.It was also during this period that MacAulay co-founded University College London.Publication of the Reporter continued until , but by the end the work had worn MacAulay out and he had got into debt.In  Selina died and, with his finances in disarray, MacAulay was exiled to Paris in  # the year the Slavery Abolition Act came into force which ended slavery throughout the British Empire.He ed to England once his debts were liquidated and died on May , . He was buried in a London cemetery, but after the site became a public park # St George#s Gardens # the exact location of his grave was lost.MacAulay is commemorated with a le-sized memorial bust in Westminster Abbey.To mark the th anniversary of his birth in , a memorial plaque was unveiled in the gardens, donated by the Royal Statistical Society, the Friends of St George#s Gardens, University College London and the Clan MacAulay Association.William Wilberforce said of Zachary MacAulay: #My sober and deliberate opinion is that you [Zachary MacAulay] have done more towards this consummation [abolishing slavery] than any other man.#For myself, I take pleasure in acknowledging that you have been my tutor all the way and that I could have done nothing without you.#"},{"url":null,"title":"a family passion for scotlands beauty","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Frances and Ross depict the ever-changing and often harsh weather conditions which frame their Argyll home.A Family Affair explores their shared artistic tropes as they both represent the landscape of Scotland’s islands and west coast, working in nature, directly inBoth use oil paint and other media, drawing with the brush or palette kne to make urgent, swt marks that capture the fleeting effects and drama of changing weather.They also share Crinan, where the Ryan family has run the Crinan Hotel since the mid-seventies, from where Ryan left for school, then art school and set out on extensive travels. But the beauty of Argyll # and his boat Sgarbh # drew him back.Earlier this year Ross held his second solo exhibition with The Scottish Gallery, but due to lockdown not a single person was able to attend.Frances has been a regular exhibitor with the gallery for years with her distinctive Hebridean seascapes and landscapes showing the repeated mots of Iona, The Mull of Kintyre, the bays around Crinan and the view across to Jura and the Corryvreckan.Like a good modernist Frances is reluctant to give any commentary on her works but Ross, on the other hand, makes extensive notes on his journeys allowing others to understand how hard-won the paintings are, particularly in winter when the harsh conditions create privations and huge physical problems. Each painting becomes a manestation and record of time and place.His affinity with the natural world is reflected in his long-term project of setting messages in bottles on the ocean, which brings him encounters as he journeys to meet the people who find them, and make new works at the location of the find.A Family Affair will be presented concurrently with Mark Hearld’s Menagerie, which will transport visitors to an animal-filled world with a series of prints, woodcut and linocuts inspired by the artist’s love of British flora and fauna.A Family Affair and Mark Hearld’s Menagerie will be at The Scottish Gallery in Edinburgh between Saturday November  and Wednesday December ."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column november 20 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

All representatives who are isolating or unable to attend must be able to speak up for their voters.We noted as early as June that the abrupt shut-down of remote participation was bound to leave communities unrepresented as the pandemic continued to rage. The Commons took a step backwards in ending this too early.MPs and voters need consistency and transparent standards for how these crucial democratic decisions are made.We can#t have ato the conga line chaos we saw in June, or the decisions simply being made on a whim by a minister.MPs need clarity about how they can continue to represent their voters during this stark second wave and beyond.There must be far greater transparency over how these decisions on participation are made, rather than ministers being forced to act at the last moment.Since some MPs may be isolating or not safe to travel in person, there’s a real threat for democratic representation and political equalityremote participation continues to be strictly limited or indeed denied. Virtual proceedings in the summer were a real success in bringing parliament into the st century. Let’s learn from that and ensure all voters are heard.Darren Hughes, chief executive, the Electoral Reform Society.Sir,SNP ministers must outline how they are planning for a Covid- vaccine rollout across Scotland.People are understandably feeling positive about a potential vaccine for coronavirus, which is why it is critical for the SNP government to lay out the detail of its roll-out plans as a matter of urgency.We can ill-afford to repeat the same mistakes we saw with the flu vaccination earlier this year.Ministers need to set out what infrastructure is being put in place right now so they are ahead of the game when it comes to rolling out any vaccine across Scotland when it becomes available, and doing so fairly and effectively.Getting this right will be particularly important for the Highlands and Islands with our dispersed population and challenging geography.We must be assured that our region does not end up playing catch-up with the central belt which is an understandable concern locally, given the track record of this government in other matters affecting us.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSP and Shadow Health Secretary.Sir,In the recent storms  houses at Bruach Gorm, Port Charlotte, using the communal West Highland Housing Association satellite dish lost half their sky channels including BBC  and STV.As I write, it#s been  working days since at least three of us that I know reported the issue to West Highland, but not a word of a fix date.The dish has done well for  years, but things degrade over time. I had an inkling this year there would be a dish problem and in the summer I bought a TV aerial kit for £ # a lot cheaper than fitting a dish.I put the aerial in the loft and there is a good reception, with BBC  and STV back. It is storm proof in the loft, though was disappointed with the lack of channels from the Bowmore transmitter.I Googled it and the mast is a Freeview Light and lacks channels other UK areas enjoy. I use Sky HD freeview channels but with Sky you have to navigate the TV guide through all the blocked subscription channels to find the one you want to watch. Via the Bowmore mast the TV guide just lists the the Freeview channels, which is great.Freeview said that there were more channels available on main transmitters than there was on relay transmitters, which play a vital role in providing more remote areas with TV coverage.There are a lot of aerials on houses and I think Islay#s TV transmitters should get an upgrade to the same channels as other areas expect.I will also raise this issue with those elected to improve our lives, including our MSP, MP, council leader Councillor Currie and Councillor Horn.Colin M Campbell, Port Charlotte, Isle of Islay.Sir,I think we all need a boost of positive news, so I would like to appeal to your readers to give a brave and special young person in your area the credit they deserve by nominating them for the  WellChild Awards.We are looking for inspirational children and young people who have defied the odds in the face of serious illness and the selfless nurses, doctors, brothers, sisters and friends who help care for them.This is your opportunity to give them the recognition they deserve at a prestigious event regularly attended by WellChild Patron, The Duke of Sussex.Nominations are open now so please get yours in before the closing date on Monday December  at noon.

The current bus stop and car park at the head of Glen Croe would also be bypassed. This is an important public transport link for local residents.The consultation launched by the Scottish Government’s Transport Secretary, Michael Matheson is a muddled exercise. It confuses the urgent need to decide on an alternative route for a new road through Glen Croe with the much longer-term strategic transport options for improving connectivity between Argyll and west-central Scotland.Most of the strategic options involve a number of new civil engineering challenges including the construction of bridges over Loch Long and Loch Fyne and extensive road building, both new and upgraded. For reasons of cost and complexity, none of these options are likely to be implemented within this decade.Whatever long-term strategy options may be investigated for their feasibility, there remains the urgent need to build a new road in Glen Croe. It will always be necessary to link the communities of Arrochar Tarbetwith Loch Goil, Cairndow, north Loch Fyne, Inveraray and beyond with the A.I note that both my local community council in Loch Goil and Argyll and Bute Council support the route that follows the existing forest track on the opposite side of the glen from the Rest and Be Thankful without a similar risk of landslides. Compared with the strategic options, this is a modestof road to construct.The sooner that steps are taken to realise this solution the better it will be for all who currently suffer the increasingly frequent road closures due to climate change and the unstable hill.Alastair R Moodie, LochgoilheadSir,Every year thousands of children contact Childline about being bullied online and tell us that they feel it is hard to escape from.Lockdown has intensied these feelings for many and since April we’ve counselled more than , children and young people across the UK about online bullying.Children have told us about people sending threatening or abusive messages and being pressured into engaging in sexual conversations. Others have shared that they’ve been excluded from online games by other children, while some spoke of online identities being stolen to embarrass or cause trouble while using their name.Before lockdown measures were first introduced this year, the average monthly number of counselling session with children about online bullying was . Between April and October that value increased by  per cent to a monthly average of .This is worrying, particularly as we continue to adhere to strict social-distancing restrictions across Scotland and children continue to spend more time online. Bullying can have a long-term impact on the mental wellbeing of a child and, as we mark Anti Bullying Week this month and beyond, it’s important to ensure that every child knows who they can turn to for support.If a parent thinks their child is being bullied online, it can be hard to remain calm, but it’s crucial not to overwhelm a child with questions. Taking their device away is likely to make them feel like whatever has happened is their fault instead, it’s helpful to listen to their worries, suggest they take some time away from certain apps, and provide them with reassurance.Adeniyi Alade, service head of Childline at NSPCC ScotlandSir,Boris Johnson’s comment that devolution has been #a disaster north of the border# and #Tony Blair’s worst mistake# should hardly come as a surprise to anyone.The Tories have never been great supporters of devolution, vehemently opposing both the referendums in  on establishing a Scottish Assembly and in  on the Scottish Parliament.Most recently the devolution power grab that is highlighted in the Internal Market Bill simply reinforces this stance.The Scottish Social Attitudes surveyon constitutional preference found that only seven per cent favour abolition of the Scottish Parliament and it found that trust in the Scottish Government sits at four times that of the UK Government. This points to it hardly being a disaster.For those accused of scaremongering that there is a threat to Holyrood, Mr Johnson’s comments are clear vindication. The irony of all this being that devolution has given new le to the Scottish Conservatives after its wipe out in  and it is now the opposition in the Scottish Parliament.Be under no doubt that the Scottish Parliament, which was hard fought for, is under threat and we must do all in our power to defend it.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures november 27 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Businesses need to act now! This is true for retail, those trading in consumer goods, services and investment, construction and housing as well as vehicle and haulier firms. The UK Government has put a raft of measures in place for all firms across England, Scotland and Wales. Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Michael Gove said: “We are leaving the EU single market and customs union. This will bring both new challenges and new opportunities for businesses. We recognise this is a challenging time for everyone. We are determined to support businesses to be ready for  January  and beyond. ”These are actions to take now#Procurement expert Laura Hobbs has led the way for the construction industry to prepare for the end of the UK transition period. Laura is the UK and Ireland One Procurement Programme Lead at Royal BAM Group, which is among the biggest construction firms covering England, Wales and Scotland. She said: “We have created a snapshot to give a clear picture for the industry where we believe pinch points are.” Laura explained: “I decided to pull my peers together, all the other main contractors that are part of the Construction Senior Leaders Group which I chair. We decided to write one set of questions for the end of UK transition and also share the workload – to go to all those dferent product categories key to construction.“As main contractors we deal a lot with sub-contractors so we need to ensure the message gets further into the supply chain.”The Construction Senior Leaders Group also includes representatives from Skanska, Costain, Murphys, Laing O’Rourke, housebuilders Berkeley and clients including Highways UK and Clarion Housing Group. Manufacturers are employing new customs experts to help them get in position for the new start, creating more strategic programmes to negate any currency fluctuations. Laura worked with Build UK, receiving useful information around imports and exports from the UK Government. “Information is the key and preparation is essential. The organisations we work with have been preparing for this for a long time so they are on their final rehearsal now. “To be able to give your own business the comfort you are going into this in a planned, coordinated way, it is key for people to start the exercise sooner rather than later,” stressed Laura. She said the new start will bring opportunities to invest in the UK supply chain. “We always see the positives and, definitely for the UK, there are opportunities coming.”"},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast episode 18 follow me","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Surely to goodness we should have a plan.#I am also quite annoyed that Fyne View has closed, because it cost a lot to get it up and running, so that is money down the drain.#The public want to have facilities in their area and we cannot have decisions made without proper focus on figures before us.#Fyne View was a Lochgilphead-based care facility for dementia sufferers which was revealed to have closed its doors in November.Caroline Cherry, head of adult services with the HSCP, responded: #I totally hear Ms Rhodick’s concerns. But the purpose of this paper is not to go over decisions that have been made, it is to look at the audit trail.#Ms Rhodick then said: #Councillor Gary Mulvaneyhas said that the decision has been taken and the report reiterates that.#But it didn’t matter how many times people pled with the board to listen and understand, especially in a smaller area like this.#The consultation was not a consultation. People were asked along for their views and officers turned and told the public what they were doing. They were putting the cart before the horse.#The community will be really angry as nobody is listening. The decision was made months ago with one public consultation. It should have been two or three to get proper feedback.#Officers said what was happening and it was an option that nobody knew about.#Everything has been massaged for the IJB’s benefit. They are not listening.#Councillor Mulvaney said in reply: #This paper is reiterating what we have already decided and we are reopening a debate we had a number of months ago.#We now have a board member going back through things to which officers are in no position to respond.#I know Ms Rhodick feels strongly about this issue but the decisions have been taken and you cannot make comments like those.#It is just not appropriate for a board member.

We want to remind people that our pet bereavement support service is here to help those who are grieving the loss of a pet.People can contact our free and confidential support line on    or email pbssmail@bluecross.org.uk for advice and support.Diane James, Pet Bereavement Support Service manager, Blue Cross.We know there are many people having a really dficult time during this pandemic who are suffering from anxiety, fear, despair, depression, etc. Might I suggest that there is only one sure antidote to this situation and that is PRAYER # it can do wonders!The person who prays sincerely from the heart will encounter an inner peace, even joy.  That person does not have to be ‘religious’ or of a certain religion, it can be anyone.  We are all God’s children because he created each one of us inidually andanyone who seeks him sincerely and humbly in prayer, God will answer that person who will experience ‘the peace that is beyond all human understanding’ which, of course, is God coming to live in their heart.You may not believe me but I can assure you prayer works. Evenyou are a non-believer or one who doubts in the existence of God, you can always say #Godyou are there please, please come and help me#.Give it a go and not only will it give you relief from boredom and loneliness when you pray but numerous other benefits will accrue – and, of course, dipping into a Bible will enrich your prayer enormously.Calum MacFarlane-Barrow, Dalmally."},{"url":null,"title":"oh christmas tree","story":"Kathie GrfithsUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

be decommissioned in order to pay the maintenance costs of the new destination play park in Victoria Park.The decision to close six small parks around Peebles has sparked controversy.Members of the

schools in top  in Scotland, says Sunday TimesLast month they were told that the small parks would be repurposed and heard of plans for a natural play park, developed by Borders Woodland Trust, and a small wheels park.There was a disagreement between Tweeddale councillors and members of the community council regarding the number of small parks set to close.Addressing the matter this month, community council chairman Les Turnbull said: ldquoThere was a conversation about the small playparks and I said we were going to lose all the small play parks apart from one. Of course I was referring to the small playparks that were under consideration by Scottish Borders Council, and you will recall that two councillors in particular were most adamant that what I said was not infact correct.ldquoWell what I said was correct ndash the play parks under threat are Kingsway, Provost Melrose Place, Kingsland Square, Crossburn Farm Road, Glen Crescent junior, and the small play park behind the hedge in Hay Lodge Park. Eliotrsquos Park is not going to be decommissioned, the other six are.Tweeddale councillor Heather Anderson said that at an Area Partnership meeting, elected members were given the list of parks to be decommissioned, adding that it was presented as a proposal that was going to be passed lsquoon the nodrsquo.She revealed that officers hadnrsquot allowed a maintenance budget for the new destination play park which is the reason behind decommissioning the small parks.:Coronavirus:  new cases recorded in the Borders over weekendMs Anderson also told the meeting that the costs of maintenance and removal were challenged by councillors and they ldquodidnrsquot get any satisfactory answers.Mr Turnbull said he wrote to Scottish Borders Council about the associated costs and failed to get an answer. It was suggested that the closures should be halted until costs are produced.Community councillor Peter Maudsley said: ldquoI wouldrsquove thought that there shouldrsquove been a proper cost benefit analysis because in taking away equipment from play parks there is a considerable cost.ldquoThe actual ongoing maintenance of the play parks is probably quite small, so someone somewhere shouldrsquove done a cost benefit analysis, and I think we should see it. There should be a moratorium on the closures until they produce the cost benefit analysis because they might be very well wasting the ratepayersrsquo money.Ms Anderson said it was ldquopursued vigorously, adding: ldquoWe didnrsquot manage to get the decision overturned.It is hoped that a group in the town will come forward and take on the responsibility for the six play parks under threat.:The imaginative way two young brothers donated to a Borders foodbankMr Turnbull added: ldquoThere has been a lack of consultation and whatrsquos alarming is we, the community council, did do a consultation, we had over  responses which I think is quite signicant, and most people wanted to see these small play parks retained. Again I appeal to the people of Peebles,there is a group willing to take over these play parks under threat then the community council will help as far as we can to try and keep and maintain them.ldquoIf not, Irsquove had a conversation with councillor Tatler and asked him to ensure that beforeany decommissioning is done on these small play parks, that there is a wider consultation with us in the community to work out whatrsquos going to be best for those actual areas.You might also be interested in:Radio station helping to bring Christmasto Borders childrenOld bombs discovered outside Scottish hotelby metal detectoristsPlans to build  wind turbinesnear Borders town set to be proposed"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-galashiels-academy-announces-positive-case","story":"A BORDERS school has announced a coronavirus case.On Friday afternoon , parents of S and S pupils at Galashiels Academy were informed.An email, sent by head teacher Kevin Ryalls, said a small number of students would likely be contacted by NHS Test and Protect ndashdetermined to be a close contact.Mr Ryalls explained that it was unlikely that pupils in other year groups would be contacted.:A ft Christmas tree has been gted to a Borders tourist attractionHe reassured parents that pupils forced to self-isolate would receive home-learning support.The school has also enhanced its cleaning programme ahead of theto learning tomorrow , said Mr Ryalls.

But, usually, it means yoursquoll find it more dficult to exercise your rights.This applies even where we see a rapid purchase of a company thatrsquos gone into administration, where on the surface it looks like itrsquos businesses as usual.Can Iitems to a retailer thats gone into administration It depends. Once a retailer goes into administration the administrators role is to try and save the company, and in doing so, it may take the decision not to accept s.But you could ask for a refundthe things you bought werent delivered, or you could claim for the cost of a repairthey were faulty.Do myrights still apply after a company has gone into administration If yoursquove been supplied with faulty goods and the company is placed into administration but is still trading, you may be able to get a replacement or a refund in the normal way under the Consumer Rights Act.If the company isnrsquot trading while itrsquos in administration, yoursquoll need to make a claim to the administrator as an unsecured creditor, so it may be unlikely that youll get a refund in this case.Butyou donrsquot submit a claim in writing to the administrators then it is highly unlikely that they will stand to get their money back. We think itrsquos worth at least trying.If you have a faulty item, you could register your claim with the administrators for the cost of fixing the item, or for a refundtheres still time to reject the item.Can I still use my warranty after a company has gone into administration If you bought an item thats faulty and it came with a warranty, you should be able to claim a refund or repair from the manufacturer under the terms of the warranty.You may be able to make a claim on an extended warrantythe cover was provided by a third party .If the retailer goes into administration and the goods are faulty, then your manufacturers warranty should cover you for at least the first year. Check your documentation to seethis is the case.Check the small print carefully to see who actually provided the warranty cover. Often itrsquos provided by a third partyin which case you shouldnrsquot be affecteda store ceases trading.If the cover was provided by the retailer in question, then it depends on what happens at the end of the administration period.If the retailer ceases to trade, then unfortunately you would lose the benefit of the extended warranty.Remember that youll usually get a manufacturerrsquos guarantee with an item that will provide some protection for the first year - sometimes even longer.Can I claim from my card company If you paid for goods that cost less than pound on a credit or debit card, you may be able to claim under chargeback.If youve bought something on your credit card costing more than pound, means the card provider is jointly responsible for any breaches of contract.You can claim under Section  of the Consumer Credit Actthe item is faulty.Write to your credit card company with details of your claim. You can use our template letter to claim a refund from your credit card companya retailer goes bust.Can I claimI only paid a deposit You dont have to have paid the full amount on your credit card ndash the card company is liable evenyou made only part of the paymenton your card.Its the value of the goods youre buying thats key, not the amount paid on the card.Under Section , as long as the value of the product is between pound and pound, then youll be covered, regardless of how much you paid on your card.So, for example,you ordered a new camera and paid a pound deposit with your credit card and paid the balance of pound by cheque, youd be covered for the whole poundthe company went out of business and you didnt get your camera.Can I still use my gt vouchers after a company has gone into administration A number of high street stores have refused to allow customers to use gt vouchers after going into administration. Unfortunately, this is within the law.But,the administrator takes this decision its worth waiting a few days to seeit will change its mind.If your gt vouchers are refused, you need to make a claim in writing to the administrators with proof of your vouchers.You can find the name of the administrator on the website of the retailer that has gone into administration.But theres no guarantee youll get all of your money back, and it could take up to  months to process the claim properly. And, not all administrators will take this approach.If you want to get your money back, you can use our template letter to claim a refund for vouchers from a bust company.Can I make a chargeback claim for gt vouchers If a company is accepting gt vouchers then chargeback claims will not be accepted.If gt vouchers arent being accepted and you bought gt vouchers on your card, you should be able to put in a chargeback request to your bank on the grounds that the vouchers are fundamentally dferent from what you paid for.This is because you expected to be able to exchange the vouchers for goods of a certain value and instead theyre worthless.If the vouchers were given to you as a gt, its trickier to make this argument. The person who received a voucher as a gt cant make a claim.But the person who bought the vouchers could put in a chargeback request to the bank. You can use our letter template to help you make a chargeback claim.Its worth noting though, that theres no guarantee the administrators will accept chargeback claims.Can I get my cashback If you were supposed to get cashback as part of your purchase, it depends on how the cashback offer was set up - you may still receive it.Check the terms and conditions to see whether the offer is backed by the manufacturer , or whether the cashback claim should be made to the retailer.If the manufacturer is providing the cashback, your claim shouldnt be affected.If its the retailer, you could still put in a claim and they would be in breach of contractthey didnt send the cash.If you didnt get the cash, unfortunately, you couldnt take court action against the retailer while its in administration.If at the end of the administration the retailer stopped trading, youd need to lodge your claim for unpaid cashback with the administrators."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-borders-recorded-nearly-300-cases-past-month","story":"NEARLY  cases of coronavirus have been recorded in the Borders over the past month.Data published by the Scottish Government at pm todayshows the Borders has recorded  new cases in the last  hours, bringing the regional total since March to .On November , a total of  cases had been confirmed since the beginning of the pandemic, meaning that, in the space of a month, the Borders has recorded  new cases.:Coronavirus: Borders school announces positive caseIn Scotland, the total number of cases since March now stands at ,.In the last  hours across Scotland, there have been  deaths where COVID-has been mentioned on the death certicate.In the Borders, the number of patients in hospital with the virus has increased since yesterdayfrom nine to ."},{"url":null,"title":"hawick-mcdonalds-reveals-number-jobs-available","story":"McDONALDrsquoS has revealed the number of jobs that will be created once its new Borders site opens.As reported last week, a new restaurant and drive-thru will be coming to Hawickafter plans were approved by Scottish ministers.The fast food giant has now revealed that ldquoat least  new jobs will be created.:Galashiels loses crown as happiest place to live in ScotlandA McDonaldrsquos spokesperson said: ldquoWersquore delighted that our plans for a new drive-thru restaurant in Hawick have been approved.ldquoWe look forward to opening our doors in the near future, bringing signicant investment to the local community and creating at least  new jobs.The Hawick site on Commercial Road, where the McDonaldrsquos is to be built, will also see a BM store added.There is currently one McDonaldrsquos store in the Borders, which opened in Galashiels in .You might also be interested in:Coronavirus: Borders recorded nearly  casesin the last monthTwo Borders high schools in top  in Scotland, says Sunday TimesCoronavirus: Borders school announces positive case"},{"url":null,"title":"selkirk-knowepark-primary-school-announces-coronavirus-case","story":"AN ENTIRE class at a Borders school has been forced to self-isolate following a coronavirus case.On Sunday , parents of pupils in the P P composite class at Knowepark Primary School, Selkirk, were informed of a positive case at the school.The NHS Test and Protect team identied the whole class as being in close contact with the case, and all pupils were therefore required to self-isolate.A spokesperson for Scottish Borders Councilsaid that three other schools in the Borders have also reported cases recently.:Two Borders high schools in top  in Scotland, says Sunday TimesHawick High School and Galashiels Academyhave each announced a single case, while Ayton Primary School has \"a small number of cases\", according to the spokesperson.The spokesperson said cases associated with Ayton Primary School have \"implications for a number of iniduals within the school\".\"Currently no [Ayton] pupils [are] required to self-isolate,\" the spokesperson added.Parents at Hawick High School and Galashiels Academy were informed of cases on November , and parents of children at Ayton Primary School were told about cases on November ."},{"url":null,"title":"covid-scotland-scotrail-offers-students-50-per-cent-discount-get-home-christmas","story":"SCOTRAIL has announced that students travelling home over Christmas will benefit from a fty per cent discount on tickets from Scotlandrsquos Railway.A mass testing programme of students planning to head home over the festive period is currently under way, in a bid to limit risk of transmission and provide reassurance to those travelling home to their families and loved ones.And now students will only need to pay half price for travel, on any ScotRail service until December .The train operator, run by Dutch firm Abellio, hopes the move will help students worried about getting home to their families under the current coronavirus travel restrictions.Students will first need to record a negative Covid- test before travelling, which could make it dficult to book specic train services due to testing appointments and the time spent awaiting results.Herersquos a little Christmas cheer for all of Scotlandrsquos university students.

It cost the lives of  British servicemen and severe injuries to many more but it made Blair a rich man, resulting from his popularity in America where many of my friends still think the sun shines from his posterior.I would agree, however, that allowing the electorate in Scotland to vote in favour of devolution, was undoubtedly Blair#s second biggest mistake.His motivation was to placate those crying for Scottish independence, following the discovery of North Sea oil, but the irony was that it led to a series of disastrously incompetent Labour Lib Dem coalition governments.These in turn resulted in the electorate choosing, in , a minority SNP government, enabled by support from the Greens.My letter would be far too long were I to dwell on all the areas of incompetence in Holyrood government since , so I#ll confine my evaluation to education, upon which the future of Scotland depends.In , Salmond#s election promise was primary school class sizes of under  but, two years later, Fiona Hyslop changed that target to fewer than  pupils. That was just before Salmond sacked her and Mike Russell admitted smaller class sizes might not be possible before .Those councils that did enforce the limit of  only did so by refusing places to children whose siblings were at the same school.The #attainment gap# between children from poorer backgrounds and those from more affluent areas has continued to widen rather than diminish, as Nicola Sturgeon promised, while older students cannot find places at Scottish universities because these have to be allocated to foreign students, whose fees are a necessity to fund the universities.Meanwhile, I hate to think what Scotland#s deficit is now. It was around eight per cent of GDP before Covid decimated so many areas vital to Scotland#s economy.Doubtless, Alex Orr will remind me Scotland cannot legally have a deficit, but an independent Scotland could and it would prevent the dream of Scotland rejoining the EU from ever being attained.Brian Gee, Carradale East.In the recent storms,  houses at Bruach Gorm, Port Charlotte using the communal West Highland Housing Association satellite dish, lost half our Sky channels, including BBC  and STV.As I write, it’s been  working days since at least three of us that I know reported the issue to West Highland, but not a word of a fix date.The dish has done well for  years, but things degrade over time.

Via the Bowmore mast, the TV guide just lists the freeview channels, which is great.Freeview said that there are more channels available on main transmitters than there is on relay transmitters, which play a vital role in providing more remote areas a TV coverage.There are a lot of aerials on houses and I think Islay’s TV transmitters should get an upgrade to the same channels as other areas expect.I will also raise this issue with those elected to improve our lives, including MSP, MP, council leader Councillor Currie and Councillor Horn.Colin M Campbell, Port Charlotte, Islay.I think we all need a boost of positive news, so I would like to appeal to your readers to give a brave and special young person in your area the credit they deserve by nominating them for the  WellChild Awards.We are looking for inspirational children and young people who have defied the odds in the face of serious illness and the selfless nurses, doctors, brothers, sisters and friends who help care for them.This is your opportunity to give them the recognition they deserve at a prestigious event regularly attended by WellChild Patron, The Duke of Sussex.Nominations are open now so please get yours in before the closing date on Monday December  at noon.

So there will be one window on st December , two windows on December  and so on – and they should stay in place until Twelfth Night.Everyone is invited to walk or drive around the parishes and spot the decorated windows. A guide will also be available in the village shops.In this way, we hope to brighten the preparation for Christmas for everyone.More than , children are admitted to hospital every day in the UK and it has never been a scarier time for them.With unfamiliar wards, health professionals in additional PPE, only being able to have one parent with them, and no visits from their brothers or sisters during the pandemic, it can be very worrying and lonely.That is why play and distraction services in hospitals are now more vital than ever. Having access to toys and entertainment, when recovering or waiting for treatment, or using play as a distraction for procedures can help to alleviate pain, aid recovery and bring joy back into children’s lives.At the children’s charity Starlight, thanks to our supporters, we provide hospitals with boxes filled with toys, games and puzzles to be used on wards.This year, Starlight’s fundraising income has fallen due to many cancelled events, which is why we have started our Time to Play campaign. Our goal is to raise £, before the end of the year to help , children get access to play in hospital and limit the negative effects of illness on their childhood.It’s easy to support and our website has fun ideas of how to take part, including our Stream for Starlight fundraiser for computer gamers.Or,you are able to, please considering making a simple one-off donation. However big or small, it will help Starlight to continue to be there to support children and their families this Christmas.I’m hoping your readers will join together and help support Starlight, to bring back joy into the lives of the , seriously ill children living in the UK this Christmas.Please visit www.starlight.org.uk time to help us.

Others have shared that they’ve been excluded from online games by other children, while some spoke of online identities being stolen to embarrass or cause trouble while using their name.Before lockdown measures were first introduced this year, the average monthly number of counselling sessions with children about online bullying was . Between April and October that value increased by  per cent to a monthly average of .This is worrying, particularly as we continue to adhere to strict social-distancing restrictions across Scotland and children continue to spend more time online. Bullying can have a long-term impact on the mental wellbeing of a child and, as we mark Anti Bullying Week this month and beyond, it’s important to ensure that every child knows who they can turn to for support.If a parent thinks their child is being bullied online, it can be hard to remain calm, but it’s crucial not to overwhelm a child with questions. Taking their device away is likely to make them feel like whatever has happened is their fault instead, it’s helpful to listen to their worries, suggest they take some time away from certain apps, and provide them with reassurance.Adeniyi Alade, service head of Childline at NSPCC Scotland.Boris Johnson’s comment that devolution has been #a disaster north of the border# and #Tony Blair’s worst mistake# should hardly come as a surprise to anyone.The Tories have never been great supporters of devolution, vehemently opposing both the referendums in  on establishing a Scottish Assembly and in  on the Scottish Parliament.Most recently the devolution power grab that is highlighted in the Internal Market Bill simply reinforces this stance.The Scottish Social Attitudes surveyon constitutional preference found that only seven per cent favour abolition of the Scottish Parliament and it found that trust in the Scottish Government sits at four times that of the UK Government. This points to it hardly being a disaster.For those accused of scaremongering that there is a threat to Holyrood, Mr Johnson’s comments are clear vindication. The irony of all this being that devolution has given new le to the Scottish Conservatives after its wipe out in  and it is now the opposition in the Scottish Parliament.Be under no doubt that the Scottish Parliament, which was hard fought for, is under threat and we must do all in our power to defend it.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.While this year Christmas is going to be dferent from usual for many of us, it is still a time for preparations and extra food.

Usually we look forward to the Christmas lights and decorations brightening up the dark winter nights and bringing hope and cheer.This year, we wait and wonder.

We watch the news and hope restrictions will be eased, but we are afraid of that too, as this could lead to the virus spreading. So we wait and watch and wonder – a bit like the shepherds of old, gathered on the hillside, waiting and watching and wondering.It has been a tough few months and for many it has been a gruelling and harrowing few months.How do we celebrate in such times Yet, I have heard so many people say: #Well I’m going to put up my tree and I’m going to do it early to bring some cheer into our lives.#We are a people of hope, even in the darkest days.We wait in the darkness for we know that even the darkest night has the first streaks of dawn to lighten the sky.So as we approach the time of preparing to welcome the Christ child once again, we will wait hopefully."},{"url":null,"title":"fundraising star lights up the night","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

This is true for retail, those trading in consumer goods, services and investment, construction and housing as well as vehicle and haulier firms. The UK Government has put a raft of measures in place for all firms across England, Scotland and Wales. Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Michael Gove said: “We are leaving the EU single market and customs union. This will bring both new challenges and new opportunities for businesses. We recognise this is a challenging time for everyone. We are determined to support businesses to be ready for  January  and beyond. ”These are actions to take now#Procurement expert Laura Hobbs has led the way for the construction industry to prepare for the end of the UK transition period. Laura is the UK and Ireland One Procurement Programme Lead at Royal BAM Group, which is among the biggest construction firms covering England, Wales and Scotland. She said: “We have created a snapshot to give a clear picture for the industry where we believe pinch points are.” Laura explained: “I decided to pull my peers together, all the other main contractors that are part of the Construction Senior Leaders Group which I chair. We decided to write one set of questions for the end of UK transition and also share the workload – to go to all those dferent product categories key to construction.“As main contractors we deal a lot with sub-contractors so we need to ensure the message gets further into the supply chain.”The Construction Senior Leaders Group also includes representatives from Skanska, Costain, Murphys, Laing O’Rourke, housebuilders Berkeley and clients including Highways UK and Clarion Housing Group. Manufacturers are employing new customs experts to help them get in position for the new start, creating more strategic programmes to negate any currency fluctuations. Laura worked with Build UK, receiving useful information around imports and exports from the UK Government. “Information is the key and preparation is essential. The organisations we work with have been preparing for this for a long time so they are on their final rehearsal now. “To be able to give your own business the comfort you are going into this in a planned, coordinated way, it is key for people to start the exercise sooner rather than later,” stressed Laura. She said the new start will bring opportunities to invest in the UK supply chain. “We always see the positives and, definitely for the UK, there are opportunities coming.”"},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast episode 18 follow me","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

For every dozen sold, p will be donated to the girls# fund.When staff at Jura Community Store, one of the shops selling the eggs, found out about the appeal, they decided that for every dozen eggs they sell in pink boxes, they will donate an additional p to Children st.Wearing T-shirts bearing the Children st logo and colours, the girls set off from Aqualibrium last Sunday morning, and were joined throughout their journey by Jessica#s big sister Adelle and her friend Jade McCallum, as well as Jessica and Adelle#s parents.Many friends and family members turned out to cheer and clap for the girls and there was even a special, hand-made banner which read: #Well done, girls!#Despite a drizzly shower, the weather was largely pleasant, meaning the girls could enjoy a few pit stops on their journey.They were welcomed at the finish line with balloons, cake, hot chocolate, medals and gts.The girls# parents said: #They smiled, danced and sang the whole way and, as they did, they spoke about the children and families they would be helping and how their Christmas might be now, as a result of the fantastic amount of money raised.#They were absolute stars and did so well. We could all see the pride bursting out of them which was lovely.#As always, friends, family and our community have just been so kind and supportive. Thank you to everyone who cheered them off, supported them along the way and welcomed them in at the end, it made the event so special for the girls.#And thanks again to everyone who has sponsored, we know the money will make such a dference.#There is still time to sponsor the girls as their online fundraising page # search #Friends walk for Christmas# on the JustGiving website # is being left open until the end of the month so the Deliciously Scottish Eggs donation can be added to the total."},{"url":null,"title":"district news december 4 2020","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Both schools have demonstrated rich, engaging and ied STEM experiences for learners.#Science Minister Richard Lochhead said: #Many congratulations to those schools who have achieved STEM Nation Awards.#The efforts of those schools to offer pupils the chance to develop skills and awareness of STEM subjects will open up fantastic career opportunities to them and help to make sure that the workforce of the future is equipped to protect Scotland’s reputation as a true science and technology nation.#Argyll and Bute Council’s policy lead for education, Councillor Yvonne McNeilly, said: #Here in Argyll and Bute, we have a track record for excellence in STEM learning experiences in our schools. With local key sectors that include creative industries, aquaculture and renewable energy, it’s important that our young people are well-equipped with skills our economy needs for the future – either at home or further afield.#So, congratulations to Port Ellen and Bowmore primaries, and good luck to North Bute Primary which I know has just completed the first step in achieving this award.#"},{"url":null,"title":"down memory lane december 4 2020","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

There are probably no more than half-a-dozen casks of -year-old Scotch whisky in existence.It is the habit at Springbank to reserve small quantities of whisky for longer than normal maturity. Although  years is not so very uncommon,  years is exceptional.The particular cask was ‘refill sherry hogshead’ which was filled on December  , with Springbank at a strength of . over proof .It originally contained the equivalent of . proof gallons but more than  years later, maturation had taken most of the spirit away: there was only the equivalent of . proof gallons left, and the strength had dropped to . proof.The out-turn of the bottling operation was  cases and one bottle. These will have a special label and each numbered bottle will carry a certicate inidually signed by the company’s chairman Mr Hedley G Wright, whose great-grandfather founded the present company. Unfortunately it is improbable that any of this whisky # after all there are only  bottles # will be seen by the retail trade the price would be astronomical anyway.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOIslay distilleriesLast working season was a prosperous one for the Islay distilleries, as well as for Highlands distilleries generally.During the summer great activity has been seen in the numerous arrivals of vessels with coal and barley and preparations were made for a resumption of distilling.Wet weather, scarcity of labour and a scarcity of carts made the securing of peats very dficult, and only the dry autumn relieved the situation and allowed the peats to be got home. At Ardbeg, Lagavulin, Laphroaig, Port Ellen, Port Charlotte, Bruichladdich, Bunnahabhain and Caol Ila work is now actively going on, and large deliveries are leaving the district.Highland distillers, however, have now to face the competition again of the distillers of grain whisky, which is now plentul on the market. The Distillers Co Ltd quotes its grain whisky at five shillingsper gallon and with all the high costs of wages, coal repairs etc which encumber the malt distillers, the competition is likely to be severely felt."},{"url":null,"title":"law book not just for legal eagles","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

What started as a personal challenge for David Brown has motivated not only himself but many others to raise money for charity as they keep fit.Many members of the charities for which David has raised money in  have supported him by completing their own runs and walks, the latest being Tom Donnachy, who features on our back page.The fundraising efforts of the three young girls who completed a K walk last weekend also inspired two businesses # Deliciously Scottish Eggs and Jura Community Stores # to donate money to Children st.Finally, it is heartening to hear of the community coming together to help dog Rogan who suffers from cancer.No matter what le throws at us, we can be sure our community will support us."},{"url":null,"title":"letters december 4 2020","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

He decided to donate the proceeds from his November fundraising to Kintyre Link Club.The #take five# challenge was created so others could join in by walking, running or doing the exercise of their choice, to raise additional sponsorship for the club.Tom decided to participate in a bid to repay some of the financial and emotional support he has received from Kintyre Link Club.He was joined on Monday by a troupe of supporters, many of whom also took part in the #take five# challenge throughout November.Tom told the Courier: #I suffer with a lot of mental health problems and, without the support of Kintyre Link Club and Tracy, who has been absolutely fantastic, I would have fallen into a really dark place.#Tom#s mental health deteriorated after the breakdown of a relationship, but it was his ex-partner who put him in contact with Tracy, and also sponsored him £ to take part in the challenge.He was also sponsored £ by Caroline Semple, of Campbeltown charity Shopper-Aide, whose idea it was to do the walk in drag.Tom explained: #I asked everyone to sponsor me £ and Caroline told me she would give me £I did it in drag. I couldn’t do it in drag every day – it would be too inconvenient to get my make up done # but I suggested doing the last day in drag and she said fair enough, she#d sponsor me £.#Tom has raised between £ and £ in total.#People have been really generous,# he said. #I hoped I would raise £ but it spiralled and people started offering me more and more money, especiallyI did it in drag.#He received help from Beckie Shields, also from Shopper-Aide, who applied his glamorous make-up ahead of Monday#s walk.He added: #Finding the motivation to get out the house can be really dficult, so having this challenge was brilliant it did me the world of good.#I think I will keep up the walking – not seven days a week but maybe Monday to Friday. I’ve actually treated myself to a pair of walking boots as all my trainers were wearing down.#I’d love to thank the people at Shopper-Aide for all their help and donations, Kintyre Link Club for being there and supporting me, and Sarah from ACUMENit wasn’t for her, we wouldn’t have done it.#"},{"url":null,"title":"fungi hobby unearths medicinal properties of mushrooms","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

I started a blog about Rogan#s journey and hopeful road to recovery and now he#s becoming a local hero with people stopping me in the street and asking about him.#Now comes the figurative mycelium part. After hearing from Katrina, Ian started looking for wild turkey tail mushroom and finally discovered some, growing on a log in a garden in Southend.He asked Frances Hill from Muneroy Tearoom whose house it was and she, in turn, asked the ownersome of the mushrooms could be harvested, explaining what it would be used for.The owners, Mark and Sadie, were only too happy for Ian to collect some, which he delivered to retired herbalist Kenneth Eames, who has been shielding for  months.Kenneth said: #I went on a mushroom hunt with Ian about  years ago and we#ve remained friends since. When he askedI could make Rogan a tincture, I was only too happy to help.#I came to Campbeltown  years ago and the people made me so welcome and since my we and I have been shielding, people have been as good as ever. I cannot tell you how pleased I am to provide some small help to Rogan.#People being connected and helping each another seems so apt.

But, usually, it means yoursquoll find it more dficult to exercise your rights.This applies even where we see a rapid purchase of a company thatrsquos gone into administration, where on the surface it looks like itrsquos businesses as usual.Can Iitems to a retailer thats gone into administration It depends. Once a retailer goes into administration the administrators role is to try and save the company, and in doing so, it may take the decision not to accept s.But you could ask for a refundthe things you bought werent delivered, or you could claim for the cost of a repairthey were faulty.Do myrights still apply after a company has gone into administration If yoursquove been supplied with faulty goods and the company is placed into administration but is still trading, you may be able to get a replacement or a refund in the normal way under the Consumer Rights Act.If the company isnrsquot trading while itrsquos in administration, yoursquoll need to make a claim to the administrator as an unsecured creditor, so it may be unlikely that youll get a refund in this case.Butyou donrsquot submit a claim in writing to the administrators then it is highly unlikely that they will stand to get their money back. We think itrsquos worth at least trying.If you have a faulty item, you could register your claim with the administrators for the cost of fixing the item, or for a refundtheres still time to reject the item.Can I still use my warranty after a company has gone into administration If you bought an item thats faulty and it came with a warranty, you should be able to claim a refund or repair from the manufacturer under the terms of the warranty.You may be able to make a claim on an extended warrantythe cover was provided by a third party .If the retailer goes into administration and the goods are faulty, then your manufacturers warranty should cover you for at least the first year. Check your documentation to seethis is the case.Check the small print carefully to see who actually provided the warranty cover. Often itrsquos provided by a third partyin which case you shouldnrsquot be affecteda store ceases trading.If the cover was provided by the retailer in question, then it depends on what happens at the end of the administration period.If the retailer ceases to trade, then unfortunately you would lose the benefit of the extended warranty.Remember that youll usually get a manufacturerrsquos guarantee with an item that will provide some protection for the first year - sometimes even longer.Can I claim from my card company If you paid for goods that cost less than pound on a credit or debit card, you may be able to claim under chargeback.If youve bought something on your credit card costing more than pound, means the card provider is jointly responsible for any breaches of contract.You can claim under Section  of the Consumer Credit Actthe item is faulty.Write to your credit card company with details of your claim. You can use our template letter to claim a refund from your credit card companya retailer goes bust.Can I claimI only paid a deposit You dont have to have paid the full amount on your credit card ndash the card company is liable evenyou made only part of the paymenton your card.Its the value of the goods youre buying thats key, not the amount paid on the card.Under Section , as long as the value of the product is between pound and pound, then youll be covered, regardless of how much you paid on your card.So, for example,you ordered a new camera and paid a pound deposit with your credit card and paid the balance of pound by cheque, youd be covered for the whole poundthe company went out of business and you didnt get your camera.Can I still use my gt vouchers after a company has gone into administration A number of high street stores have refused to allow customers to use gt vouchers after going into administration. Unfortunately, this is within the law.But,the administrator takes this decision its worth waiting a few days to seeit will change its mind.If your gt vouchers are refused, you need to make a claim in writing to the administrators with proof of your vouchers.You can find the name of the administrator on the website of the retailer that has gone into administration.But theres no guarantee youll get all of your money back, and it could take up to  months to process the claim properly.

It was to discover a place associated with a woman who, despite her achievements and talents, was ignored by history, as most women have been until recently.It was indeed an adventure to find her pool, for we had to scramble over wet rocks to get there. Our young children took it in their stride and my youngest Lewis was looking out for evidence of dinosaurs. There are steps cut in the rocks nearby and so I suspect Lady Hall had a more convenient route to reach her pool, but we had no time to search for that.When we arrived at the pool, the tide was not fully out so it was still partly submerged, but enough was revealed of the cut rock to show the outline of Lady Hallrsquos Pool. I could just see what looked like the small steps cut by its side.Susan and David told me of the local tradition that she would come down to bathe in the sea water. Perhaps this was frowned upon, given it was the th century and she was a lady of high aristocratic status. But the story goes that her determination to regularly bathe in the sea led to the creation of this pool, which captures the sea as it goes out, making it a safer place to swim in this rocky coastline.I did not know of this pool before Susan contacted me, and I knew next to nothing about Lady Hall, she was just another aristocratic name. But now, as I stood on the edge of the pool which bears her name, I became intrigued as I listened to the story.I saw no ghostly image of Lady Hall in the water, yet I felt her presence in the twilight. The sun had already vanished from the sky and a beautul moon was rising above the sea. It was cold but calm a perfect moment for a ghostly introduction. While I had not seen Lady Hall with my eyes, I now felt we had been introduced by her story, thanks to Susan.We chatted on ourabout stories and the importance of enchantment and magic when growing up. Susan and her husband had given my family a winterrsquos afternoon of discovery and adventure. Two-hundred years separate Susan and Lady Helen Hall, but there was a connection between them. Two remarkable women from the area who shared a love of the landscape and the stories itrsquos steeped in.And now I must source the book Lady Hall ndash Lang-heidit Lady, written by another local woman, Sally Wilson. She spent years researching the le of Lady Hall and, based on the titbits Irsquove managed to see, it looks fascinating.But I will alsoto the pool. There may be other stories attached to it, and now our story is part of it too. We plan toin the summer, when the tide is out, and have a swim.That is,the ghost of Lady Hall isnrsquot in it already!"},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-peeps-past-december-1-4-1995-1970-1920","story":"A FAMILY managed to get to safety following an early-morning fire in their home, reported the East Lothian Courier on December , .A teenager rescued his family from their smoke-logged home in Tranent in the early hours of Tuesday morning as fire raged in their lounge.Gareth Johnston, , stopped his terried sister Kerry, , from leaping out of the bedroom window and led her and his mum Jackie to safety with clothes thrown over their heads as protection against the fumes.When the family had escaped down the narrow stairway and were out of their home in Farsquoside Crescent, Gareth ed to save Gem, their pet Jack Russell, who was trapped in the kitchen at the back of the house.Yesterday , Jackie spoke of the familyrsquos ordeal and said that they probably owed their lives to Garethrsquos prompt action.ldquoWe were lucky to escape, she said.EAST Lothian residents were happy about the scrapping of British Standard Time ndash a three-year experiment of the country staying on British Summer Time all year round ndash as reported in The Haddingtonshire Courier on December , .Farmers and building workers in East Lothian heaved a sigh of relief this week when the decision toto Greenwich Mean Time was announced.Parents and schoolteachers too were equally jubilant about a change which will eliminate many road hazards for young children.The decision to reject British Standard Time after a three-year experimental period was the result of a free vote in the House of Commons on Wednesday.In its later stages, the debate was largely dominated by Scots members, most of whom were strongly opposed to its retention.lsquoWIVES Fall Outrsquo was a headline in The Haddingtonshire Courier on December , .In Haddington Sherf Court, on Friday, Ann Robertson or Black, we of John Black, miner, Prestonpans, was charged with having, on th October, in Pyperrsquos Wynd, assaulted Jessie Mackenzie or Moody, we of Robert Moody, miner.An agent, in tendering a plea of guilty, stated that the complainer had unjustly accused his client of having removed some clothes from a rope, and that this was the cause of the quarrel.The result was that she had given Mrs Moody a slap on the face.The Fiscal said he did not think the assault was of a serious nature, and, perhaps, as the agent had suggested, it might not be necessary to impose any penalty."},{"url":null,"title":"world-boxing-champion-josh-taylor-gets-engaged-danielle-murphy","story":"The undefeated star got down on one knee in front of his long-time girlfriend Danielle Murphy yesterdaywhile on a luxury yacht in Dubai.Danielle took to social media this morningto say: ldquo  , the day I said YES.ldquoOne of the best days of my le, Josh pulled out all the stops and I couldnrsquot have asked for a better day!ldquoThank you to everyone for the well wishes and love, Irsquom totally overwhelmed!ldquoItrsquos times like this that I wish heaven had a phone so I could phone big Jimmy [her late father] to tell him my best friend has made me the happiest girl on the planet.Josh, originally from Prestonpans but now living in Haddington, is the current holder of the WBA and IBF World Super Lightweight titles.The -year-old is expected to step into the ring with Jose Carlos Ramirez, who holds the WBC and WBO World Super Lightweight titles, in the spring for a unication bout.Josh also previously took gold at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow in  before turning pro.He also posted on social media, saying: ldquoSo she just said yes.ldquoI finally plucked up the courage to ask my beautul girlfriend to be my we.

What is nutmeg \"extract\" exactly  How does it dfer from the actual spice  Why doesnrsquot MS just use ground nutmeg  Why does the soy-based, no-chicken kiev contain anonymous synthetic \"flavouring\"  But these techno-food concoctions hit a spot. They appeal to that most stubborn aspect of the British palate: a weakness for a smidgen of anonymous proteinaceous matter, deep-fried in stodgy carbohydrate casing, and dunked in something sugary.Yet my friend, an able cook and someone who appreciates good food, is desperate to buy some.

They fret about meeting their familyrsquos expectations, and weeks-long Christmas food advertising campaigns pump up that anxiety. These adverts work as effectively on women as the Christmas toy equivalent work on children.And this year, the annual festive food pressure dial has been turned up to maximum setting. Memories of bare supermarket shelves during the first lockdown haunt us. The feeling that we must, against all odds, make this a successful Christmas to reassure ourselves, and our nearest and dearest, that deep down, everything is fine.Apologies to those relatively few men who take on the responsibility for planning and providing, but this is heavy burden that mainly women feel.Of course, this festive anxiety is orced from reality. There are shops other than supermarkets, independent shops. They usually sell better food, and they donrsquot run out. There are any number of smaller producers and distributors of first-rate food who would be delighted to have our online business.So letrsquos try to keep a cool head. Wersquove had enough panic this year already.Just remember that anyone who cooks, or who has any feeling for food whatsoever, can come up with something that is better quality and more delicious than those over-hyped supermarket reheats that never look, or taste, anywhere near as good as the enticing picture on the box."},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-panoramas-iconic-red-deer-glenshee","story":"The place is Glenshee, on the edge of the Cairngorms National Park.

Well,so, why did the Scottish Government pony up so much cash in the first place If Scotland is the Saudi Arabia of renewables, BiFabs loss is surely a national humiliation. No other country would countenance such industrial defeatism, certainly not Norway which now has a substantial stake in renewables.The Scottish Government has merely acquired a track record for pouring public money into lost causes from Prestwick Airport to Ferguson Marine. This confirms that civil servants and politicians are just not very good at business. They dont understand it.They leap into action chasing favourable headlines by promising cash injections, only to stand aside thereafter as it gets burnt by private sector companies whorsquoll never turn away free money.What Scotland lacks is a coherent overall industrial strategy, or any industrial strategy. We hear homilies about building back better and making the economy work ldquofor people not profit instead of just making it work.The Scottish Government had the option of taking over BiFab at next to no cost, but declined on the basis that a nationalised BiFab would still be hamstrung by European competition rules.This is a reminder that however much SNP likes to talk left and talk green, at least when trying to enlist support at elections time, it is no more socialist than New Labour or even Boris Johnson.:Anger as part Scottish Government-owned BiFab files for administrationPerhaps less so, now that the Tory government has essentially taken half the British workforce onto the public payroll and borrowed more money faster than even Jeremy Corbyn intended.No one wants to live in a communist state, but we have the right to expect the Scottish Government to have an activist industrial policy that puts Scotland first.That may sound like Donald Trump, but he wasnt wrong about the need to challenge corporate globalisation and labour arbitrage ndash that is, companies exporting jobs to low-wage countries and destroying the domestic industrial base.Ms Hyslop lamented that Scotland couldnt compete with workers being paid pound. an hour in China or Indonesia.

But it was not to be.Last week, the Scottish Government effectively signed BiFabs death warrant. This in the very week that Boris Johnson announced a dramatic further increase in targets for the reduction of UK emissions, most of which will be achieved through offshore wind.:Over poundm of taxpayers money face being lost as ministers rule out nationalisation of collapsed BiFabSo much for the green jobs revolution. Scotlands major hope for getting a poundbn slice of the renewable energy action has gone south.This is a major political scandal, and rightly condemned by a vote of the Scottish Parliament last week. BiFab has not one but two major windfarms on its very Fe doorstep: the Seagreen array off Angus and Neart na Goailthe . These poundbn projects together had contracts out for at least  full Methil jackets.It beggars belief that BiFab was unable to get any of this work, despite a poundm bung to its Canadian owners JV Driver.Instead, the French state-owned energy giant, EDF, will build them mostly in Asian yards and have them dragged , miles by diesel tugs.A jaunty-sounding Fiona Hyslop, the Scottish Economy Secretary, told Good Morning Scotland that her hands were tied by Brussels competition rules. Too bad. Lessons to be learned etc.. But arent we supposed to be leaving the EU  Why would they have any say in the matter It would be ldquonaive, she replied, to believe that these state aid restrictions will not continue in some form. Well,so, why did the Scottish Government pony up so much cash in the first place If Scotland is the Saudi Arabia of renewables, BiFabs loss is surely a national humiliation. No other country would countenance such industrial defeatism, certainly not Norway which now has a substantial stake in renewables.The Scottish Government has merely acquired a track record for pouring public money into lost causes from Prestwick Airport to Ferguson Marine. This confirms that civil servants and politicians are just not very good at business. They dont understand it.They leap into action chasing favourable headlines by promising cash injections, only to stand aside thereafter as it gets burnt by private sector companies whorsquoll never turn away free money.What Scotland lacks is a coherent overall industrial strategy, or any industrial strategy. We hear homilies about building back better and making the economy work ldquofor people not profit instead of just making it work.The Scottish Government had the option of taking over BiFab at next to no cost, but declined on the basis that a nationalised BiFab would still be hamstrung by European competition rules.This is a reminder that however much SNP likes to talk left and talk green, at least when trying to enlist support at elections time, it is no more socialist than New Labour or even Boris Johnson.:Anger as part Scottish Government-owned BiFab files for administrationPerhaps less so, now that the Tory government has essentially taken half the British workforce onto the public payroll and borrowed more money faster than even Jeremy Corbyn intended.No one wants to live in a communist state, but we have the right to expect the Scottish Government to have an activist industrial policy that puts Scotland first.That may sound like Donald Trump, but he wasnt wrong about the need to challenge corporate globalisation and labour arbitrage ndash that is, companies exporting jobs to low-wage countries and destroying the domestic industrial base.Ms Hyslop lamented that Scotland couldnt compete with workers being paid pound. an hour in China or Indonesia. But it beggars belief that Scotland couldnt secure some guarantees from EDF that local, sustainable industry should be part of the supply chain. The Scottish Government has many planning powers and licenses these mega windfarms in the first place.Every year Nicola Sturgeon makes inflated promises abut a green jobs revolution.

Does he think hersquoll see her again  ldquoZero chance.It was a Monday night a few weeks ago, he was in the shower when he heard barking and saw the outside security lights flash on. By the time he had dashed outside, Skye was gone, tucked under the arm of thief and spirited away into the foggy night.ldquoThey got lucky, he adds. ldquoNine out of ten times therersquos a padlock on but Irsquod just fed her and was going to take her for a last walk, he sighs.ldquoItrsquos probably breeders. Maybe Irsquoll see her in three or four years time when shersquos ten or  and no more use to them, and they throw her away.Meantime,he finds the person who snatched his dog from right outside his house, he may well struggle to contain himself from lashing out, he adds.Skyersquos theft was captured on CCTV footage from a nearby petrol station. Despite social media appeals across a swathe of missing, lost and stolen pet pages, there have been no sightings and no news. Pinning down the precise number of dog thefts in Scotland is tricky. Police Scotland say their records of thefts do not break down incidents in a way that records inidual items ndash such as dogs.While without clear evidence in the form of CCTV images or eyewitness accounts, it is impossible to determine whether a dog was stolen, or simply took advantage of an open gate.But concern is mounting that a worrying spate of dog thefts across England - where incidents have soared since the start of lockdown in March, coinciding with rocketing demand for puppies and dogs - may begin to encroach on owners north of the border.And with pets fetching eye-watering prices on social media sites particularly among popular medium-sized breeds such as Cocker Spaniels and cross-bred lsquodesignerrsquo cockerpoos, the potential for thieves to line their pockets can be huge.ldquoA cockerpoo used to cost around pound, now itrsquos around pound,. A Cocker Spaniel that was pound is now pound, and a Jack Russell has gone from pound to pound,, says Katie McCandless-Thomas, who runs a Facebook page, Missing Pets, Perth and Kinross, Scotland.Her page recently led an appeal for four dogs stolen from two addresses in rural Perthshire on the same day in October. One, a Jack Russell called Harvey, was lted from his kennel at Meikleour while his stunned owner watched helplessly from his home.Harvey was later found, while of the other three, taken from nearby Forneth, West of Blairgowrie, two ndash both Jack Russells - were found nearly  miles away in the Midlands. The remaining dog, a Springer Spaniel, remains missing.A -year-old man was arrested and charged in connection with the two incidents.ldquoThis type of thing has gotten worse since the start of lockdown, adds Katie. ldquoDemand for dogs has spiralled, they are selling for at least double the price theyrsquod normally sell for, and I think dog theft is part of it all.ldquoThe price of puppies is fuelling demand for more pets and people are stealing dogs thinking itrsquos a quick way to sell them on.ldquoIt is bad enough to know your dog is missing, but when you suspect it has been deliberately taken, itrsquos a whole dferent situation.ldquoItrsquos devastating for the owners.ldquoThere is a feeling that someone has deliberately targeted their dog and all kinds of scenarios run through their head of what could be happening.In England, charity DogLost said dog thefts in England rose by  per cent between  March, when lockdown was announced, and  June, compared with the same time last year.Over the course of just two months  dogs were taken in Norfolk, Suffolk and Cambridgeshire alone, raising concerns that organised gangs are targeting mostly pedigree and working dogs, with Cocker Spaniels top of the list.As a result, some English police forces have suggested owners change their dog-walking routines, fearing gangs might be watching popular routes.However, social media rumours that gangs mark pavements outside dog ownersrsquo homes with chalk or cable ties are thought to be misplaced. ldquoA lot of thefts are opportunistic, says Katie. ldquoPeople leave their dogs tied up outside a shop and someone just walks away with them.ldquoPeople think it wonrsquot happen to them, but it can.In West Lothian, dog owner Siobhan Lamont waits every day for news of Tyson, a nine-year-old Staffordshire Terrier, and year-old Staffy-Collie cross, Drax. Both dogs vanished from the back garden of their home in Armadale at the start of October.ldquoI suddenly realised they werenrsquot in the house. I went outside, and saw the gate, which had been locked, was open, she says.A series of mystery phone calls have added to her distress and heightened her concerns that the dogs ndash last spotted in nearby Fauldhouse ndash are being kept by someone.ldquoItrsquos heartbreaking, you donrsquot know what to do, she says. ldquoIrsquove since heard of so many dog thefts or dogs going missing. The house isnrsquot the same without them here.Earlier this month, a three years old chocolate-coloured spaniel called Obie, which had been snatched from a property in Harburn, West Lothian, was reunited with owners after being found  miles away in Penrith.According to Charlene Gun, who runs Lost  Found Dogs West Lothian on Facebook, dog thefts are not re in the area, but there is cause for concern.ldquoAre profits increasing for people selling dogs  Yes. Are the chances of thefts quite high  Irsquod tell anyone to never trust anyone or take any chances, she says.ldquoAre certain breeds more desirable and more likely to be picked up  Yes.ldquoWhen you are in a situation where one litter of eight puppies can earn someone around pound,, then itrsquos better not to leave your dog unattended.If Google searches for puppies and dogs in the wake of March lockdown is anything to go by, there is no shortage of demand: searches for lsquobuy a puppyrsquo rose by %, with lsquoadopt a puppyrsquo rising by %.As well as raising fears over dog thefts, demand has led to concerns of a growth in puppy farms.Just last week more than  dogs and cats were seized from a suspected puppy farm in Perthshire, including three pregnant bitches and three litters of puppies.Animal welfare charity the Scottish SPCA says it launched  investigations into puppy farming in October alone, and fears demand for puppies over the festive period would lead to a rise in the number of cases.ldquoThe combination of coronavirus restrictions and extortionate prices of puppies is being manipulated by puppy traders selling badly bred dogs, said Scottish SPCA chief superintendent, Mike Flynn.ldquoThere are things we would urge any buyer to do, such as insist on seeing the pup they are buying at the sellerrsquos home or premises with their mum.ldquoWe know many dealers are telling unsuspecting members of the public to meet them in a car park or public space to pass over the dog safely.ldquoThe seller will often be wearing a mask and afterwards they are impossible to get a hold of when the pup gets sick.He added: ldquoPrices have skyrocketed in  as responsible breeders scaled back due to the restrictions, yet demand increased as many people were stuck at home.ldquoNow, dealers can charge more than ever before and sell more easily than theyrsquove previously been able to.ldquoThe root of this problem is public demand.

Technological innovation combined with a global pandemic has transformed the way in which employers and employees interact forever. The Covid- lockdown plunged almost half of all British workers into remote working ndash which looks to be their reality for the foreseeable future.Though a begrudged necessity for many during the ongoing pandemic, the benefits of remote working to both employees and employers have long been recognised. A  Stanford University study found that remote working boosted productivity by  per cent. Research has also linked remote working to improved mental wellbeing, as well as a reduction in sick days and employee attrition.Hybrid working gives workers the power to decide how, when and where they work best. Whether you like being around others or work better alone whether you favour in-person meetings or remote video calls whether you enjoy routine or prefer flexibility in your daily schedule ndash hybrid working caters for all. In doing so, employees enjoy greater work-le balance, improved wellbeing, and ndash crucially for businesses ndash report increased productivity.Working solely from home can be an isolating experience, and many miss the collective buzz that comes from working together in a shared physical space. Some even miss the commute, which can act as an important bookend to the day and a way to compartmentalise work and home le. Thatrsquos where a hybrid working model comes in ndash a chance to blend remote and office working, and reap the benefits of both.Within this time of immense change lies an opportunity for employers to foster a hybrid work culture centred around wellbeing, and unlock greater levels of productivity, engagement and job satisfaction in the process. But thatrsquos not all the increase in hybrid working has also instigated a sht towards a model which prioritises productive output over the numbers of hours worked.For many years, our shared concept of work has been defined by the simple premise that the more hours you put in, the more you get done. But the rise of the knowledge economy, combined with rapid technological innovation, has made equating productivity with longer hours feel like a relic from a bygone era. With more and more employers now realising their employees can be as or even more productive working from home than at the office, the emphasis has shted from simply fulfilling contracted hours to measuring quantiable results.Trust and communication will be critical to supporting a hybrid working culture. Thankfully, the mass uptake of cloud-based s like Microsoft Teams has strengthened the ability of many teams to communicate and collaborate, regardless of their proximity to one another. The onus will be on managers to use these channels to foster motivation, trust and autonomy within their teams. In doing so, they can emphasise that results and achievements are what ultimately matter, not just attendance.In a post-pandemic world, many people would like toto the office mdash but not completely. Once the health risk decreases and solutions to creating Covid-secure workplaces become more prevalent, we will see the true power of hybrid working in action. By embracing flexibility, autonomy and trust, employers can foster happier, healthier workforces mdash and boost productivity in the process.

However, they too couldnrsquot wrench the ring free so they decided to cut off the finger whereupon, as the kne went in, Margorie snapped out of her coma and woke up screaming.

She said: “We have created a snapshot to give a clear picture for the industry where we believe pinch points are.” Laura explained: “I decided to pull my peers together, all the other main contractors that are part of the Construction Senior Leaders Group which I chair. We decided to write one set of questions for the end of UK transition and also share the workload – to go to all those dferent product categories key to construction.“As main contractors we deal a lot with sub-contractors so we need to ensure the message gets further into the supply chain.”The Construction Senior Leaders Group also includes representatives from Skanska, Costain, Murphys, Laing O’Rourke, housebuilders Berkeley and clients including Highways UK and Clarion Housing Group.

But I know that for families struggling now, February is still a long way off.“So I am announcing a £ million package to bridge that gap, and help others struggling most with the impact of COVID over the winter months.“It will include money to help people pay their fuel bills and make sure children don’t go hungry.“It will offer additional help for the homeless, and fund an initiative to get older people online and connected.“And, most importantly of all, it will provide a cash grant of £ for every family with children in receipt of free school meals.“The money will be paid before Christmas and families can use it for whatever will help them through the winter. That could be food, new shoes or a winter coat for the kids.“Families will know best what they need. That’s not for government to decide.“Initiatives like this are not just about providing practical help to those who need it most — they are an expression of our values and of the kind of country we are seeking to build.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Another would involve a change to soft drink sales.She added: “We have a drinks chiller at the front but were looking at introducing a bar restaurant-style system where fizzy drinks come from mixer taps.“If we could get something like that, we would be saving not just on bottles but also the water used for these which is transported around the country and is another waste.“That is quite a big investment, though, so I wouldn’t be able to consider that without a grant.”Zero Waste Scotland has said it will administer a total of £, in grant funding provided by the Scottish Government and European Regional Development Fund to empower island shops to take the next steps in the war on waste by ditching single-use packaging and moving to reusable options.It says that the new scheme would see cash made available to existing small and medium-sized enterprises in the isles to make the transition to package free dispensers.“My shop is so small, it is not just about fitting in the new stuff but also about moving everything  around so I don’t lose the things that I sell which enables me to pay staff and support the local community,” she said.“We have tried to do what we can within our budget. We do glass milk bottles for people, we have dispensing units for refills for washing up liquid and laundry liquid.“There are things that I have looked at that we can do, and sothey had just given us that money I applied for then I would have been really happy!”The scheme opened on th October, but Nancy stressed that wasn’t a great deal of time for small business owners like her.“It sounds like a lot of time but when you are running a shop it isn’t very long. We had to get three dferent quotes for some of these things,” she said.“I’m in the shop five and a half days a week — and my afternoons off have been spent on the phone and the internet scoping out possible projects.

This includes users of all ages and levels of mobility – cyclists, walkers, runners and wheelchair and mobility vehicle users.The route has been chosen to promote active travel, link communities, improve local access, and act as a springboard for an island-wide network of safe paths.The project group has lodged a planning application for the Skye Bridge to Ashaig Airstrip section of the route, following the old A road where possible. And they are now starting on a detailed consultation for a link between Ashaig and Broadford.In March the project group held a community consultation on the three possible routes for this section. It was concluded that the single track ‘committee road’ option running through Breakish would give the best compromise between a quiet, scenic, low-traffic area, and the straightest, most direct route. This was the link most favoured by public consultees. met with supporters of the project outside Breakish Hall to find out what the Skye Cycle Way would mean to them.Broadford Primary pupil Krista said a cycle path would allow her and other children to do what they loved without any worries.She said: “For little kids that want to do more cycling it would be safer because just a little slip off the pavement could lead to a road accidentthere’s a car coming, so I think the cycle path would be really handy.“It wouldn’t put me at risk of traffic and it would mean I just go out and cycle.”Breakish resident Lis Phillips felt the cycle way could help recapture the feeling of safety for cyclists experienced during the lockdown.She said: “I cycle back and forth to my work at Broadford surgery, and during the lockdown, I noticed people on bikes who I’ve never seen cycling before because there were hardly any cars on the roads.“There is obviously an appetite for people to be able to cycle but they don’t feel it is safe, so they don’t do it.”The project group has been working with engineering consultants and main funder Sustrans, to come up with a design proposal for the route that will meet their requirements.The plans involve separating cyclists from pedestrians and other users. Cyclists would share the single-track carriageway with motor traffic, and pedestrians would enjoy a new . metre wide footpath. that the safer environment would help pupils thrive.“There is no way to avoid traffic when you are living here in Broadford, it is so busy – all the traffic that comes through Skye comes through us. So for the children, it was quite daunting to let them out on their bikes through the village.“However, during the lockdown, they were out on bikes, and more of them were cycling than ever before. You are seeing fitter and healthy children with just that bit more independence and freedom.“The cycle way is a wonderful thing.”Kyleakin resident Ian Sikorski, who has a family house in the area, earmarked the best route between Ashaig and Broadford through the community consultation and said: “Hopefully people will see the necessity for it. We have the house at the end of the ‘committee road’ beside the cattle grid.“My auntie lived there, and at that time there weren’t many houses at all. Now look at the number, and in another  years there will probably be twice the number – and you have seen the state of the road, so it badly needs a footpath.“Highland Council should have put in a footpath really. It is definitely needed. If people with families are going to build houses then it would be greatthey are able to walk and cycle along to Broadford or Kyleakin.“I used to cycle up that main road, regularly. I haven#t cycled it for years now. It is too dangerous.”﻿‘Future users’ group to be launched to help shape design of cycle way﻿The Skye Cycle Way project group secured funding from Transport Scotland via Sustrans to develop the detailed design proposals for the whole route, secure access permissions, and planning consents, and work up its strategy for finding the estimated £. million required. Match funding will be needed as this accounts for  per cent of the overall project costs.This builds on earlier feasibility studies, concept designs, and community consultation undertaken during , also funded by Transport Scotland and Sustrans. that a ‘future users’ group will be launched in the new year to ensure that all sections of the community have the opportunity to help shape the design of the path.They added: “We want this to be a safe, shared-use path for everybody, an asset for our communities, our environment, and our economy.”Due to Covid restrictions, the group have been unable to hold any face-to-face public consultations since March but are hoping this changes in the new year..

This can then be used to send mobile alerts to visitors with suggestions for alternative sites that are not too busy.John Gordonwas pleased the plan was “progressing well” as it had been a priority for Skye and Raasay councillors for some time. He also thought that upgrading Portree harbour would be an ideal project.“This update is encouraging and is an exciting development for Skye and Raasay,” he added. “Over the last few years we have seen some great partnership working at ious tourist hot-spots that has attracted some investment which has made a signicant dference, but we acknowledge there is much to do, and major investment is still needed.“The local area committee and partners are ambitious for Skye and Raasay and this investment plan which spells out actions for coordinating and securing funding and for the implementation of the plan.”Calum Munro highlighted the redevelopment of Uig harbour as a possible candidate for inclusion.He added: “The development of the Skye and Raasay investment plan is at an important and exciting phase as over the next two months stakeholders gather to engage with all the potential projects which will be part of that plan. It will be great to look at projects and see which ones best achieve the outcomes we want to see for Skye and Raasay in terms of infrastructure, strengthening communities, health and education, developing a green and erse economy and sustainable tourism.“Looking at these projects and identying interconnectedness and partnership opportunities is crucial and it’s clear that to bring in the required investment there needs to be an approach which is strategic and cohesive.“We are now at the stage where virtually the whole of Skye and Raasay have formed community trusts so I’m really looking forward to seeing some of these communities building on the work they’ve already done and achieving some of their other ambitions over the next two-three years.”Calum MacLeod said: “I’d like to see a collaborative economic recovery plan continuing with all relevant stakeholders’ involvement that is essential to address the Covid impact, and also a continuing plan to address at pace more attainable affordable housing. “The plan would also be a great opportunity to improve sustainable green tourism including better public transport infrastructure and the Skye cycle path.“It is a necessity to see trunk road agencies working closer together in achieving better and safer measures for all road users and residents working with councillors. The good work and investment that has been established to date on improving ious key projects should continue going forward towards full development.”For John Finlayson, a place-based and joined up Skye plan is “long overdue” and it was essential that the public sector, businesses, community interests and the wider community “work together to support economic recovery and development taking account of the unique challenges and the unique opportunities” in the Eilean a’ Cheo ward.He added: “The key areas of focus in what has to be an outcome driven plan and which were included in the report to the area committee are strong starting points for further community discussion and engagement. But I doubt many willargue that strengthening communities, health and education, sustainable tourism, digital and transport infrastructure and a erse and green economy are not areas we need to focus on.“I personally have a strong commitment to ensuring the best for our young people. This of course means that we need to make sure that our children are educated in st century buildings which provide safe, healthy and modern learning environments and I will continue to champion the need to build new schools at Broadford and Dunvegan.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3511592.jpg--.jpg?1606925686000\n","title":"relaxation of sunday trading restrictions","story":"Retailers will be permitted to open earlier on Sunday  and Sunday  December.Mid and East Antrim Borough Council says the move will to support the local business community when the current Northern Ireland circuit breaker restrictions come to an end.It is hoped the additional shopping time will help with social distancing concerns and protect the community during these dficult times.A temporary relaxation of enforcement action against large food shops which choose to open earlier – ie from am to pm - on a Sunday to facilitate shopping for essential items for keyworkers, health care workers and vulnerable people including those with disabilities, in the lead up to Christmas, has also been agreed by Council.The same temporary relaxation will apply to all retailers for Sunday  December and Sunday  December, enabling these businesses to open from am.Mayor of Mid and East Antrim, Councillor Peter Johnston, welcomed the announcement.“This will help our businesses to make up some lost time coming up to Christmas and it should also assist with social distancing in our town centres on a busy Sunday”, the Mayor continued.“These arrangements are temporary and Council will keep them under continual review.

Shops, hairdressers, restaurants, places of worship and hotels are among the places that will be able to re-open from December . Pubs selling drink onlywill remain closed and an additional financial package will be put in place. The Executive has also agreed Christmas household bubbling arrangements from December -. Three households will be able to come together for this period in domestic settings, outdoor public spaces and places of worship. One of the households will be able to include their existing household bubble. First Minister Arlene Foster said: “Through our collective efforts over recent weeks we gained enough space in the transmission of the virus to relax a signicant number of restrictions, including the opening-up of non-essential retail, close contact services, sport and leisure activities and our places of worship at the end of next week. “These decisions will give families, businesses and employees some much-needed certainty and comfort in the run-up to Christmas and beyond. “This is a special time of the year and we want to support people to have a good Christmas, but also a safe one. “Signicant work has been completed with business sectors, faith groups, local government and police on new mitigation measures to reduce the risk of transmission. “I urge everyone to be Covid-aware and to make careful and sensible decisions when out and about or mixing with others. We need to make sure we continue doing all we can to protect ourselves and our loved ones.” Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill said: “The Executive wants to give people as much notice as possible on what the situation will look like from next Friday when the current circuit breaker comes to an end. “We have given detailed consideration to which restrictions need tobe maintained, and what we can open up, in light of the scientic and medical advice. “A package of measures that will see signicant relaxations to the current restrictions has been agreed, with maximum mitigations in place to minimise risks to the greatest extent possible. An additional support package will be put in place for traditional drink-only pubs that unfortunately will not be able to reopen at this time. “We appreciate how important Christmas time is for many families and the Executive has agreed arrangements that will allow families and friends to come together in a limited way between  and  December. “It’s important for people to understand that with any increased contact comes increased risk. Everyone needs to think very carefully about the risks posed to them, and their loved ones, by coming together over the Christmas period, particularly to those who are vulnerable. Some may choose not to form a Christmas bubble but for those who do, we encourage them to keep their bubbles small and limit the numbers of people gathering, as much as possible.”"},{"url":null,"title":"chances of brexit deal are 50 50","story":"Taoiseach Micheal Martin said he is hoping a deal can be reached  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueTaoiseach Micheal Martin said he is hoping a deal can be reached By Cate McCurry, PADecember   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailIrish premier Micheal Martin has said he is not “overly optimistic” about a breakthrough in the Brexit talks, saying he is “-” on a deal being reached.The Taoiseach described the talks as on a “kne-edge”.Negotiations resumed in Brussels on Sunday after Boris Johnson and European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen gave the green light for talks to resume.The discussions on reaching a trade deal are entering their final days, with both sides hoping to overcome signicant dferences on fair competition and fishing rights.Mr Martin said it is very important that “common sense prevails” and that a post-Brexit trade deal is reached.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming bb .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_ffcfc-b-dae-ee-dcdc_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming bb .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_ffcfc-b-dae-ee-dcdc_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming bb .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_ffcfc-b-dae-ee-dcdc_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming bb .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_ffcfc-b-dae-ee-dcdc_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming bb .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_ffcfc-b-dae-ee-dcdc_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming bb .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_ffcfc-b-dae-ee-dcdc_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming bb .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_ffcfc-b-dae-ee-dcdc_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming bb .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_ffcfc-b-dae-ee-dcdc_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming bb .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_ffcfc-b-dae-ee-dcdc_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming bb .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_ffcfc-b-dae-ee-dcdc_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"The UK Government said processes on goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland will be kept to an ‘absolute minimum’ following the end of the Brexit transition period PA FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueThe UK Government said processes on goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland will be kept to an ‘absolute minimum’ following the end of the Brexit transition period “I think the situation is serious and the three issues that prove very dficult to reconcile all the way through the talks are still there to be dealt with,” Mr Martin added.“Namely, the level field, which is proving particularly dficult, fisheries and of course the dispute resolution mechanism to deal with the level playing field issue.“My sense is that we are at a very dficult juncture and it’s important that the Zoom talks use every piece of creativity they can, that the participants try and get a resolution, because a no-deal would be very damaging to all concerned, to the United Kingdom, to the Irish economy and indeed to the economies of member states as well.“It’s very, very important that common sense prevails here and that a deal is done.”Things are on a kne-edge and it is serious.Taoiseach Micheal Martin He urged Irish businesses to “double down” on their preparations for Brexit.“In terms of a no-deal it will be signicantly more onerous on businesses out there,” Mr Martin told RTE.“Things are on a kne-edge and it is serious.”Mr Martin said it was his gut instinct that it was - on getting a Brexit deal.“I don’t think one can be overly optimistic about a resolution emerging and my sense, having spoken to some of the key principals here, that this is a very challenging issue to resolve, particularly around the level playing field,” Mr Martin added.“The important dimension here is to get a deal and to make sure it’s a deal that works in the medium to longer term because a good sustainable relationship with the UK and EU is what makes sense for the medium term.“If it takes an extra couple of days to get this resolved, it’s better to do that than to rush this.We will seethere is a way forward.

Annemarie Bell’s father, Hugh, died suddenly while showing a worker from The Resource Centre his famous Christmas garden on December , . He was  years of age at the time and had experienced a tough year with infections but remained fit. Hugh loved to decorate the family home at Moyola Walk in Shantallow at Christmas time where there was a ‘real sense of community’. He became known for his impressive festive displays and was hailed as the ‘King of Christmas’. googletag.cmd.push  Just prior to his death, Hugh taught daughter Annemarie how to wire the plugs but, she says, ‘little did I know, I would have to do it again so quickly’. He was well-known in the local community for his walks to Knock and charitable work with the Foyle Hospice, and also helped to organise the first Derry marathons. Annemarie said: “My daddy has been the king of Christmas from I can remember. “When we were young my mother and father smoked and they wrapped fag packets up with wrapping paper and hung them up on the tree. “That’s the tradition that I grew up with and shoe boxes at the bottom of the tree for fake presents. googletag.cmd.push “Our crib was always the centre piece of our home and the main focus of our celebrations.” When the family moved to Mount Vernon in Culmore, Hugh became even more invested in the Christmas season, lighting up hedges and setting up inflatable reindeers in the garden. “I’ve just followed suit now and added new features the past two years,” Annemarie explained. As a youth worker in Pennyburn she erected the Christmas tree as soon as Halloween ended. The spiritual side of Christmas is of most import to the family and as such they would have attended a Christmas nativity event at Thornhill.     The year Hugh died they had around  nativities but Annemarie continued gathering and now has  around the house. A nativity picture is the oldest item in the family’s collection. Sadly, some decorations have been consigned to the past, Annemarie explained: “We had this big inflatable snowman and it was really, really strange. “A big fat giant snowman, we must’ve had it for at least  years and my daddy died on the th and that just went kaput on the st. So, it was strange, it was probably one of his first.” This year, Annemarie says, many people have experienced hardship in the city with a further announcement this week of job cuts. She believes it is important for everyone to get back to basics and think about family and the true meaning of Christmas.  With the pandemic it felt strange for children to be locked indoors all day long. Annemarie reflected: “I think this Christmas is going to be more special for people, we’re more used to living with one another during the pandemic, and young people won’t be looking to run here, there and everywhere. “I’d imagine this year will be more traditional, that family board games will come back. “And people won’t want their children going to other houses. “When you look at the row of houses lit up in Shantallow right now, that is community. “I was driving around after work last night and you see houses lit up that weren’t before and you think to yourself, isn’t that so beautul, so much hope and joy in the community. “For me, that’s why my daddy wanted to do it, to spread some joy.” She added: “The wains are at school at the minute but the binmen were shouting to me, ‘your garden is class, I’m so glad you followed on in your daddy’s footsteps!’ “Those kind of comments from someone out doing his job, that’s what it’s all about.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Education Minister Peter Weir tweeted a picture of the paintings after he visited the school last week, and the portraits quickly went viral, appearing on BBCs The View programme. Titillated Executive ministers praised the childrens artwork on social media, with Justice Minister Naomi Long adopting the painting as her Twitter profile picture. The Alliance MLA felt the work captured her essence perfectly. “I love my wonky eyebrow! It looks like Im a bit cross about something which I usually am! Fantastic work and say thanks to all the young artists!” she said. googletag.cmd.push Finance Minister, Sinn Feacuteins Conor Murphy, took time to write to the pupils and express his gratitute, saying the painting was an improvement on the real thing. Mr Murphy also told the children that one of their local heroes had held pride of place in Stormont for years. “The late Martin McGuinness, who was Deputy First Minister, had in his office a large photograph behind his desk in Stormont Castle of someone who attended your school,” he wrote. “It was of the  All-Ireland winning captain, Henry Downey. In an office which had photographs of world leaders including Nelson Mandela, the photo of Henry Downey of Lavey had pride of place.” googletag.cmd.push After the paintings were beamed around the airwaves, requests began to make their way to South Derry and the children have been busy. The Blame Games Tim McGarry, Jake OKane and Colin Murphy got the full treatment from the Mayogall Monets, along with local councillor Sean McPeake, who helped arrange the visit. Principal Mary OKane said the paintings, and associated publicity, had created a great feeling of positivity around the school. “Its created a great buzz, which is very important at this time,” she said. “Following lockdown and the long period of absence from school, its important that children get a wee boost now.     “Its important for the whole school, but particularly those children who are getting a real buzz out of it at the moment. They see themselves as being pretty famous artists.”  Another famous local artist, Kilreas Conor Larkin, agreed to give the childrens paintings a professional artists scrutiny for us this week – and he was very impressed!  Aoe and Charley Arlene Foster: The artist has captured Arlenes ‘lockdown cofure’ – a large, thick plumage of black hair. Arlene is looking away from the viewer, maybe deep in thought or dreaming of an easier time. They have captured a fantastically sombre and meditative state that many artists strive for!  Lisa and Maria Michelle O’Neill: The subject has been caught in a moment of contemplation or reflection. She appears to be gazing just below the viewer’s eye-line. Thinking hard and remaining very tight-lipped, giving no clue to her inner-thoughts. Her hands are clasped, asplaying her cards close to her chest.  Isabelle, Christopher and Charlie Naomi Long: The artist has gone for a bold palette of contrasting colours. The subject is looking a little bewildered or deflated. She appears to have one hand behind her back, asnot wanting to show the viewer her crossed fingers. Or have we purposely been left wonderingNaomi’s hands are tied   Ella, Shannon and Dara Nichola Mallon: The subject appears very happy or comfortable in her own skin. She stands up straight with her hands by her side, portraying a certain pride. This could be the Mona Lisa of political portraits, with her confident gaze following the viewer around the room.  Serena and Chloe Caraacutel Niacute Chuiliacuten: Simple and effective brush strokes have been used to capture the subject’s vibrant hair and expressionless face. The subject stares directly from the canvas, almost straight through the viewer. The artist has done well to capture this moment of determination.  Anna, Riacutean and Molly Conor Murphy: The artist has captured this subject well, leaving the viewer wondering ‘what has he just been asked ’. His bottom lip juts out in a moment of deep concentration, staring past the viewer in search of an answer, as the viewer begs to know what exactly the question is.   Emily Rose and Isla Diane Dodds: A subtle palette of greys has been used to portray the subject’s face, perhaps an indication as to how she is feeling. The subject appears to be smiling, but also looks panicked as she scans her surroundings.  Charley, Don and Seamus Oacuteg Peter Weir: This subject is portrayed as being happy and almost laughing, leaving the viewer asking ‘what is so funny ’. But, looking behind the glasses and gazing further into his eyes, the viewer soon realises there is no joke here.  Amber and Riacuteonach Robin Swann: The artist has really taken the time to depict someone under extreme pressure. His fists are clenched tight, his mouth opened wide asshouting for someone to listen. But, his eyes look sad and his cheeks tear-stained. His gaze is directed straight at you, asto say ‘I have more bad news.  Johnny, Callum, Cathal and Conan Edwin Poots: This painting shows someone who appears to be very happy with themselves, but look deeper into the subjects eyes and you can see that one eye is looking hard at the viewer for approval and the other is looking back at himself in some doubt.  Sean, Conor and Donnacha Sean McPeake :The Artist has captured the subject wide eyed, maybe in disbelief. The pale hue used for his lips, blend into his skin tone – perhaps the artist is sending the subliminal message that the subject is lost for words. The silvery grey hair gives the subject a ‘worldly wise’ appeal.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In my view, the little magician was the greatest footballer the world has ever had the pleasure of watching. Its as simple as that. But, he was more than a footballer. He was an icon and it was fitting when the worlds greatest ever team, the New Zealand All-Blacks, recognised that. They carried out a black number ten jersey with his name emblazoned on it before last weekends meeting of the nations. Its just a pity Peter Shilton, a world-class goalkeeper in his own right, didnt have the same class. Yes, Maradona cheated with his hand of God goal against the England stopper. Some might say honesty is the best policy, but there is a time and a place to twist the dagger. And last week wasnt that time. googletag.cmd.push He may have had his problems off the pitch, but sporting stars should always be judged for what they do in the colosseums in which they perform. Maradona wasnt born with a silver spoon in his mouth. Of the nine mouths that needed fed in their home in the Villa Fiorito area of Buenos Aires, his father was the only earner, allowing his family to focus on study. It was Diegos ability to control the ball like it was an extension of his body that alerted the scouts of the local Argentinos Juniors. And so the roller-coaster was taking off. He bagged goal after goal and soon he was in the blue and gold of Boca Juniors. In their La Bombonera stadium, which shook with sheer atmosphere on game day, he led them to the Primera Divisioacuten. But, after just  games he was off to Europe as Barcelona came calling. googletag.cmd.push The fact that he moved to one of the Catalan giants, who were Mes Que Un Clubwas one thing. What defined him for me, was how he carried the national team. That wonder goal against England in  was a letime in the making. If you watch footage from his time at Napoli, that was the perfect grounding. Diego dragged an unfancied horse to two league titles, Italian and UEFA Cups, he was kicked black and blue. As he was in that  clash with England. Like the streets of Buenos Aires, Naples was the school of hard knocks. He literally had to dance his way around potential leg-breaking tackles and making a mockery of England was a by-product of it all.     Maradona is just one of those players that youd love to watch in the flesh. The viral video on social media of him juggling the ball is part of his legacy. He was just at one with the ball...oozing class. I remember trying to watch the  World Cup Final from a distance in the Bushtown Hotel. On the way home from the Port, we called in for grub. I pleaded to get away from the table. By that stage, the Germans had levelled the game at -. Maradona huffed and puffed all during the game, but he made the crucial play. His through ball played in Jorge Luis Burruchagafor the winner. Its that type of instinct that separates the good from the great. And the thing about it, much of that craft is self-taught away from the training field. I was chatting to Dermot Heaney during the week, for a feature in next weeks paper. His ball-winning ability was honed from endless hours kicking the ball against a gable wall. Unbelievable – like legend - is an overused word. It should only be used for occasions like last Sunday to describe Joe Cannings four sideline cuts over the bar. For all the great coaching hed had access to, Id say it was perfected on the family farm or at Portumna pitch. Eoin Bradleys goal in Derrys  qualier clash with Down. Owen Mulligans wonder goal against the Dubs the same year. All moments of magic. I remember chatting to a defender who had played against Glenullin one evening. How was he supposed to know what Skinner was going to do next, when the man didnt know himself. Thats the x-factor that makes all the dference. It was encouraging chatting to Damian Cassidy this week about the new proposals for Derrys coaching plan. In particular, it was the committees research around Go Games and making them five-a-side for the very young. Why  To promote decision-making and flair. Alleluia. This is what we have been missing. Back to the days of jumpers for goalposts and playing in the back field until either it got dark, or somebody huffed and went home with the ball. Once you realised that the big boys were going to kick you instead of the ball, it was time to figure out a wat to play around them. The great players learn on the job, away from regimented systems where they are forced to play with one hand tied behind your back. Thank God for Maradona. For those too young to remember him, the constant barrage of footage should inspire the next genius.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Covid has hurt millions, whether it be in terms of health, or financially. I think a really serious issue moving forward is going to be hunger, and it absolutely breaks my heart to think of parents lying awake at night worrying about feeding their kids the next day. It breaks my heart to think of kids going hungry, and Santa being something that is simply not on the cards. It’s not fair. As well as selling the calendar Damian asked his fans to donate what they could afford and has raised just under pound,. googletag.cmd.push This will go a long, long way, said Damian. We can make a families Christmas a little bit better, and that’s a light the world needs right now. I wanted to try and use my  to make a dference as it’s been a tough year for so many and my followers helped me do that and I want to say thanks, so, so much. Last week, Damian joined Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, Cllr Brian Tierney, for hislatest of his Covid- video appeal. Ive been really concerned to see the number of Covid cases across Derry and Strabane in the last few months – its really worrying, and the threat hasnt gone away, he commented.     I havent been home since Christmas and for me thats been quite dficult because I have never gone that long without visiting home in my le, and I miss it a lot. I know the community back home is full of amazing people that care about each other so Im appealing to everyone to do what they can to get us back to where we were and where we will be again. Mayor Tierney said that Damian is one of many people making sacrices for the greater good. I was delighted thatDamianjoined me in this message and has shared his personal experience to show why its important that we all follow the guidelines in place. Hehasnt been able to come home and visit his family since last Christmas, which, naturally, is incredibly dficult. Its just one example of many people and businesses who are making sacrices to protect our community and keep everyone safe, so alongsideDamianI am asking that everyone makes those sacrices worthwhile by doing all they can to reduce our cases numbers and stop the spread of Covid-.

The pensioner fell in the Greenwalk area of Creggan on Friday evening. Local people and family members who came to her aid did not want to move her, so they tried to keep her warm and dry after calling for an ambulance. However, local independent councillor Gary Donnelly said it took two hours for ambulance to arrive. Cllr Donnelly described the scene as shocking. He added that residents in Greenwalk have been trying to get improved street lighting for years but without success. googletag.cmd.push The family of the local woman said she suffered a broken shoulder in the fall. After being contacted by the Derry News, a NIAS spokesperson apologised for how Fridays call-out had been handled. “We apologise for any distress or discomfort suffered as a result of her prolonged wait for an ambulance,” the spokesperson said. “NIAS seeks to provide the quickest possible response to meet the clinical needs of any patient who contacts us as a result of having suffered illness or injury. “However, regrettably some patients are currently waiting longer than we would wish due to the demand for our service and the impact of the Covid- pandemic on our staffing levels.” googletag.cmd.push The NIAS spokesperson said the call in relation to the Creggan incident was received at .pm on Friday. “Based on information passed to ambulance control, it was prioritised as a Category  call with a performance target of  minutes. “A crew did not arrive at this scene until : which was  minutes outside of the target response. “NIAS recognises the distress and discomfort a wait of over two hours for an ambulance is to an elderly patient who is lying in the cold and wet, or to those who are caring for her at that time. “The delay in this case was as a result of crews in the area responding to calls which were more pressing in terms of clinical need.     “NIAS regrets that the patient had to endure this delay and once again offers a sincere apology. “We would have liked to have provided a more immediate response, particular given the age of the patient and the conditions in which she had to wait.” The NIAS spokesperson said they receive more than  calls each day through the  system. “To enable us to target our resources to those whose clinical condition is most urgent, each call is triaged and categorised accordingly. “Against each of the categories is a performance target for response times which NIAS aims to deliver. “Category  calls are those calls which are immediately or potentially le-threatening and to which NIAS seeks to despatch an immediate response with an average performance target of  minutes.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He spent time in both Australia and America, and local GAA clubs with whom he was involved posted messages of support for the family on social media. googletag.cmd.push St Pats Donegal GFC in Philadelphia said there was deep sadness within the community following news of his death. “It is with deep sadness that we learn of the passing of Breandaacuten McNally. Brendy had a great summer in Philadelphia in  and enjoyed some great times with the club,” they said. “We extend our deepest sympathy and condolences to Brendan, Patricia, Ruairiacute, Aoe and extended family and friends at this sad time.” Wolfe Tones GAC in Melbourne, where Breandaacuten starred for their football team in , also extended their condolences. “Everyone at Wolfe Tones has been saddened to learn of the passing of one of our former players, Breandaacuten McNally,” they said.     “Breandan played for the Wolfetones men’s team last year and was a huge part of the team and all their success throughout . “On behalf of everyone at Wolfe Tones GAC we would like to extend our deepest condolences to all of Breandans family and friends.” The McNally family business, B McNally  Sons Car Sales, are former sponsors of Watty Graham GAC, Glen, who also sympathised with the family. “Watty Grahams are saddened to learn of the untimely passing of Breandaacuten McNally, son of our former senior football team sponsor, Brendan,” they said. “Condolences to Brendan, Patricia, Ruairiacute, Aoe and the entire McNally family at this very sad time.” Everywhere he went, the young Greenlough man has touched lives, Fr OConnell told mourners at his funeral mass on Friday. After Breandaacuten travelled to America to receive treatment for his condition, he made such an impression on the hospital staff that they kept in touch. “The trip brought a host of new friends, real, caring people and was unbelievable the care that the family received and especially their son,” said Fr OConnell. “It was delightful, so delightful that the nurses and one of the surgeons kept in touch, so impressed were they by Brendy and his family, and his mother in particular.” Mourners heard how family was so important in Breandaacutens le. Fr OConnell also paid tribute to Breandaacutens familys devotion to him at his funeral mass last Friday, and described them as extraordinary. “All of them were in America at one time or another, supporting one another. Thats how the family became known. “As far as Im concerned, his family were pretty normal people. They did ordinary things and did them well, but truthfully, they had become extraordinary.” The night before his funeral, Breandaacutens sister Aoe appealed to friends and family to write down their memories of him along with any photos to be posted in a special memory box at the chapel. Fr OConnell ended his homily with a story that summed up the relationship between the McNally siblings. “Wed a concert one time in Greenlough. There were all kinds of people involved and Patsy was there with this wean on her knee,” he said. “Low and behold, when her brother appeared on stage, off she went like a scalded cat, leaving granny wondering where she was going. “Where did she go  She didnt settle until she got onto the stage and claimed her brother. Aoe was that wean. “She now claims him even more than ever. Family is important. Family is signicant,” he added.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The deferral by Causeway Coast and Glens Councils planning committee is to allow an alternative application to progress to the same stage so a decision can be made. The controversial proposal would see a single storey McDonalds restaurant with car parking and drive through facilities erected at a section of the existing Asda site alongside the towns Ring Road. Representatives of the Lodge Hotel, which backs onto the proposed site, have stated their objection to the application. After the initial application was deferred at Octobers Planning Committee meeting, a second application was lodged showing the location of the restaurant on the East side of the car park. googletag.cmd.push At a meeting of the Planning Committee, Causeway Coast and Glens councillors heard objections from a representative of the Lodge Hotel which is situated close to the proposed site. The spokesperson said noise and disturbance from the development would have an adverse impact on residents at the hotel and the knock-on effect could cause the hotel to go out of business. Representatives of the Lodge Hotel have raised objections to the proposal. The points were echoed by some councillors, with Alderman William Duddy citing anti-social behaviour arising from the existing McDonalds site in Coleraine. “Some residents have told me they can hear the revving and the music, and some of those are three quarters of a mile away,” said Alderman Duddy. googletag.cmd.push “We cannot leave the hotel out of this. Its  years in operation and is the only tourist asset we have in this town in regards to accommodation. “We have an obligation to secure and maintain that as a planning committee. The noise, the smell, the fumes, the litter and the strong likelihood of anti-social behaviour taking place in that car park. “The police have yet to be able to resolve the issues at Riverside, which has been ongoing for years. It is imperative to take into account the impact on those using the hotel.” The committee have voted to defer the current application until the alternative planning application reaches a stage where both can be reviewed at the same time.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

People Before Profit councillor Eamonn McCann was speaking after new documents revealed by the Derry News this week showed that there are currently no engineered controls preventing potentially dangerous substances at the Mobuoy site from leaking into the adjacent River Faughan. The River Faughan provides water to , local homes and businesses. The Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairshas issued a consultancy tender asking companies to put forward plans to clean up the Mobuoy site where an estimated .m cubic metres of waste is located. googletag.cmd.push The tender is worth up to pound.m. Cllr McCann said the Derry News had done the environment a favour in publishing the government documents dealing with the dangers emanating from the dump at Mobuoy Road. “The documents confirm in stark terms what many environmental and community groups have been arguing for years. – that the dump contains dangerous substances with a potential to pollute the Faughan river, which provides water to , premises in the Derry and Strabane area - and that current arrangements for containment are not adequate. “The Department of Agriculture, the Environment and Rural Affairsis at least now admitting what the environmental network The Gathering has been insisting for years now – that the Mobuoy dump poses a threat to health and well-being in the North West and must be dealt with as a matter urgency.” googletag.cmd.push Cllr McCann said the information published in the Derry News this week was telling. “But there’s a lot more we need to be told,” he said. “The process of obtaining and evaluating bids for the consultancy business will take months. “This is what we have become used to in campaigning on the Mobuoy issue - delay, and then more delay.” Foyle SDLP MLA Sinead McLaughlin said that this week she had submitted a number of questions to DAERA Minister Edwin Poots on the current situation at Mobuoy. One of the questions asked for the Ministers assessment of the risk to drinking water, river quality and wildle from the lack of ‘engineering controls’ at the Mobuoy waste dump.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

One local councillor described the news as a Christmas present for Derry City and Strabane District Council. Details of the financial support secured were outlined during a meeting of the councils Governance and Strategic Planning committee on Tuesday. At the meeting, Alfie Dallas, the councils Lead Finance Officer, presented a report on the situation faced by the council in the first half of this financial year from April  to September . Mr Dallas said the councils planned budget for   was poundm, with % of that money coming from rates collected. googletag.cmd.push However, Mr Dallas said the councils finances had been very signicantly impacted by the Covid crisis. He said that the council had lost approximately pound.m during the first half of the financial year. These losses included: - pound.m as a result of the closure of council facilities, including leisure centres- pound, due to the closure of council-run car parks- pound, as a result of the loss of building control income- pound, loss of income from cemeteries due to non-charging during the pandemic Mr Dallas said the council had also faced huge unplanned costs as a result of having to respond to the pandemic. googletag.cmd.push These included health and safety costs, costs associated with new working arrangements, communications and IT costs to enable home-working. However, Mr Dallas said that thankfully the councils losses had been completely mitigated by the financial support received from a number of government departments. He said the council had recouped pound.m of its losses from the Job Retention Scheme Furlough. He said the Department of Finance had provided support of pound.m as part of a package for all  councils in Northern Ireland, while the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs had allocated pound, to the council for waste management losses. Mr Dallas said the government had also provided pound.m to cover the losses at City of Derry Airport which means that this financial burden will not fall on the council.     Government support has therefore been critical in ensuring Council finances have remained stable and has enabled signicant decisions around services to be avoided, said Mr Dallas. However, he added that there remained signicant risk and uncertainty over the councils finances because of its reliance on rates income for its annual budget. Speaking at Tuesdays meeting, Sinn Fein councillor Mickey Cooper said that back in March April of this year, the situation had been scary in relation to the financial situation facing the council. Given the government support, he welcomed that the council could continue to look at major infrastructure projects that had been planned pre-Covid. DUP Alderman Hilary McClintock said given the doom and gloom earlier in the year, the news that the councils losses had been completely mitigated was like a Christmas present. This is an absolutely fantastic outcome, she said. SDLP councillor Martin Reilly paid tribute to the council officers for their efforts in recent months. It is such a good position to be in in comparison to where we thought we would be six months ago, said Cllr Reilly.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

One local councillor described the news as a Christmas present for Derry City and Strabane District Council. Details of the financial support secured were outlined during a meeting of the councils Governance and Strategic Planning committee on Tuesday. At the meeting, Alfie Dallas, the councils Lead Finance Officer, presented a report on the situation faced by the council in the first half of this financial year from April  to September . Mr Dallas said the councils planned budget for   was poundm, with % of that money coming from rates collected. googletag.cmd.push However, Mr Dallas said the councils finances had been very signicantly impacted by the Covid crisis. He said that the council had lost approximately pound.m during the first half of the financial year. These losses included: - pound.m as a result of the closure of council facilities, including leisure centres- pound, due to the closure of council-run car parks- pound, as a result of the loss of building control income- pound, loss of income from cemeteries due to non-charging during the pandemic Mr Dallas said the council had also faced huge unplanned costs as a result of having to respond to the pandemic. googletag.cmd.push These included health and safety costs, costs associated with new working arrangements, communications and IT costs to enable home-working. However, Mr Dallas said that thankfully the councils losses had been completely mitigated by the financial support received from a number of government departments. He said the council had recouped pound.m of its losses from the Job Retention Scheme Furlough. He said the Department of Finance had provided support of pound.m as part of a package for all  councils in Northern Ireland, while the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs had allocated pound, to the council for waste management losses. Mr Dallas said the government had also provided pound.m to cover the losses at City of Derry Airport which means that this financial burden will not fall on the council.     Government support has therefore been critical in ensuring Council finances have remained stable and has enabled signicant decisions around services to be avoided, said Mr Dallas. However, he added that there remained signicant risk and uncertainty over the councils finances because of its reliance on rates income for its annual budget. Speaking at Tuesdays meeting, Sinn Fein councillor Mickey Cooper said that back in March April of this year, the situation had been scary in relation to the financial situation facing the council. Given the government support, he welcomed that the council could continue to look at major infrastructure projects that had been planned pre-Covid. DUP Alderman Hilary McClintock said given the doom and gloom earlier in the year, the news that the councils losses had been completely mitigated was like a Christmas present. This is an absolutely fantastic outcome, she said. SDLP councillor Martin Reilly paid tribute to the council officers for their efforts in recent months. It is such a good position to be in in comparison to where we thought we would be six months ago, said Cllr Reilly.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It is easy to imagine the frustration among the group at present.“Obviously with the way the season ended last year with us being relegated and it finishing early, we were just chomping at the bit to get going and get a good run at the league,” Burke said.“But it just keeps getting put back and put back and for players its as frustrating as hell. We did a six weeks pre-season and we thought it was going to start then, then it’s put back two weeks, and you go between being fit and being not fit.“We have a really good group, a very young group, but players who are willing to learn and willing to work. There are a good mixture of young players and older heads, but it hasn’t been too hard on team morale because we’re all looking forward to the season starting up.”A number of players have left Stute since they last played a league game back in February, but Burke stayed put, determined to right a few wrongs this season.“I probably could have gone where but when I spoke to Sean, I wanted to give it a proper crack this year,” he explained. “Last year I had so many injuries, I was out for eight to ten weeks with a hamstring and I couldn’t get going.“Being made captain was a big pull obviously because I’ve never captained a senior club before and it’s a big honour and big trust for Sean to put in me.“I don’t feel extra responsibility really but I put a lot of pressure on myself to perform. That’s the thing for me this year, to perform on the pitch. There are a lot of players in the team who are vocal and do all the talking but for me it’s just to set an example and perform.” googletag.cmd.push ProfessionalBurke takes issue with the refusal to class Championship clubs and players as non-elite, saying the decision makes no logical sense.“With our team having so many professional contacted players, Institute is run like a professional club, so there’s no half measures,” he continued.“It’s hard to see that, specially when you see even fans being able to go to those games. The way we’re training at the minute we’re not even allowed to touch footballs so it’s very, very frustrating but we’ll get there.“You see Derry City in the same city playing games, then you see Coleraine and they’re playing just up around the corner. What’s the dference  I’m sure the coronavirus doesn’t dferentiate, just because you’re seen as an elite player.”Stute are slowly but surely closing in on a full calendar year without kicking a ball in a league game, and Burke, like his team mates, is desperate to finally get back on the pitch.“Hopefully now on January , or even before that in the Northwest Cup we can play,” he said. “Obviously we would like to play couple of games before the season starts but the way things are going, you never know. We’re under no illusions that it’s going to be a hard year. There are a couple of teams that could go for the league, and with it only being  games you have to hit the ground running. We’ll give it a good go anyway. googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

To be honest, it’s depressing, especially the way the matches ended up. I always watch them but it was soul destroying at times. Watch LOI was something I suppose but the way it ended up it might have made people worse, because there was no heart in it this season. It was hard to watch.”Breaking from such a tradition has been a real wrench for Norman, and hundreds of other fans, and while WatchLOI has provided coverage of every game, it is still a world away from the real thing.“The game definitely isn’t the same,” he continued.“It’s always been Derry City, they are the only team I’ve ever followed. My da, me and my brother always stand together at the matches and we have done for years. He took us from ’ and it’s always been Derry. Eventhey weren’t winning, we still went, like a lot of people. They are just the heart of the town. Even the boys who don’t go they would still ask you how did the match go. You want to see them do well, but it just wasn’t there this season.“The matches were hard to watch as well, and it just got worse and worse. We were all on messenger watching it and we were all cracking up with each other. It was probably good for the them that people weren’t at the matches.”MissingBe it the smell of the chippy, the dodgy pre-match music, the roar of the crowd, calling the referee everything or losing yourself in a goal celebration, it has all been swept away.In its place is silence, and whilst the absence of fans has clearly affected the players, those same supporters are also dealing with a huge loss.“I want to go back,” Norman insisted. “I would go back todayI could. I would go stand there tonightI could, but the way things are now nobody knows what to do. Everyone in Brandywell Pride, our weekend was for the matches. I just worked until Friday and waited for Friday night, and that’s what I’ve done the last  years.“It’s been a strange season for everyone. We don’t know when we’ll get back either which is the scary thing about it.“Evenwe do, I don’t think it will be the same, with everyone squashed in. We would have stood in Block J for years, but it might not be the same for a long time. googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

You enjoy playing and you take any opportunity you can get.ldquoI was nervous going into it but I probably had one of the best games I ever played. I was going out an expressing myself and I was named player of the match.However, her world came crashing down when she suffered an injury while playing for the NI U- team when what looked like a normal stress fracture in her foot was to keep her out of action for four years.ldquoIt should have healed naturally within eight to  weeks and I kept getting told it would heal with rest, she recalled.ldquoIt came to a year but it hadnrsquot healed fully, so I got a second opinion and the consultant said I should have had surgery straight away on it.ldquoI had the operation and went through the full rehab period, but I was still having quite a lot of issues, so I had a second surgery and it was back to square one.Caragh recalls ldquocrying day after day at the prospect of never playing football again and said every time she took a step forward ldquoit felt like five steps back again.She went on: I had thought about going to England or America when I left school, but being injured at that age there was no point trying to chase that.ldquoHaving a lot of success at a young age, I just didnrsquot know le without football.Caragh made herto action almost four years on from her injury and after a year with Glentoran she spent a season in Iceland with Fylkir.She says Reykjavik was an ldquoamazing place to play and live and after being introduced to CrossFit in her rehab, it was in Iceland her interest in the sport grew.ldquoI was totally hooked on it and progressed quite quickly in it. I started to do a few local competitions and for a while I was balancing the two.ldquoBecause I enjoyed CrossFit so much, my love for football waned slightly. I got to the point where I didnrsquot have the same desire as before.She ed to Glentoran after her year in Iceland, lting the Irish Cup with the east Belfast side and representing Northern Ireland before halting her time in the sport to focus on CrossFit.In her break from football, Caragh said her priorities changed away from the pitch when she married her husband, Michael, in .At the turn of  she was set to compete at high-level CrossFit competitions in Asia, Egypt and the Netherlands before the Covid- pandemic intervened.ldquoI hadnrsquot planned to come back to football. Gail Redmond at Glentoran heard the competitions were scrapped and saw it as an opportunity to get me back playing, she explained.ldquoInitially I was a bit hesitant but she said about the Glens challenging for the title. I think that pulled on my heart stings a bit.Caragh netted four goals in six Womenrsquos Premiership matches to set Glentoran on course for the title before an ldquounexpected call from NI manager Kenny Shiels saw her reintroduced to the international fold.ldquoKenny was watching out first game against Cltonville. After being away from football I donrsquot think he knew who I was but I got  minutes at the end and must have impressed him.Shiels invited Caragah to train with the senior squad and was named as a stand-by for Northern Irelandrsquos trip to the Faroe Islands in Septemberrsquos Euro  qualier.She was drafted into the squad when midfielder Marissa Callaghan pulled out and made her internationalas a second-half substitute in a - win.Despite her sensationalto the NI set-up, Hamiltonrsquos season was ended prematurely by a knee injury sustained days before the victory away to Belarus.She adds that while she is disappointed to be on the sidelines, she is thankful to both Glentoran and Shiels for their support to keep her involved in club and country as much as possible.She admits she is undecided whether she will focus on CrossFit orto the football pitch after her recovery.ldquoThatrsquos the million dollar question, she said. At the minute I am focusing on getting as fit as possible to make sure Irsquom able to do the best that I can in whatever I do.ldquoI want to be healthy and injury-free so I will make that decision closer to the time depending on how things are going.Going into last nightrsquos crunch tie, Northern Ireland were hoping to secure a play-off place in the European Championships for the first time.Despite her absence for the remainder of the campaign, Caragh says she has no doubts Northern Ireland can secure second position in Group C and make history.She credits manager Shiels with instilling a strong belief in his side. ldquoHe has brought out something that was always there but a lot of it is belief and confidence, she said.ldquoPreviously we would have played within ourselves to avoid defeat, but now there is an attitude that we can go and win this game.ldquoThere is a hunger and desire to push on. To think we are in with a possible play-off space in such a short space of time is incredible..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd December 2020 Christmas.jpg","title":"Christmas cup finals  ","story":"NEWCASTLE League officials have put in place what they say is ldquoone final attempt to play last seasonrsquos Harry Clarke Cup and Bobby Dalzell Cup finals.The Harry Clarke Cup final between Celtic Bhoys and Ballynagross has been rescheduled for Ballyhornan on Tuesday, December , with a pm kick off.The Bobby Dalzell decider between Killough and Ballynahinch Olympic Town is to be played at the same venue the following day with a .pm kick off.Itrsquos the latest attempt by the Newcastle League to play the fixtures, which have been postponed on a number of occasions owing to the Covid- pandemic.The Bobby Dalzell final is traditionally played on Boxing Day, while the Harry Clarke final is usually held over the Easter period.League secretary Alan Craig said he hopes the finals can at last get go ahead.However, he warned that there will be no further reschedulingthe matches are unable to be played.He said: ldquoDiscussions have taken place with the clubs concerned and agreement has been reached that should we find ourselves in a further lockdown, or unable to play the finals on these dates due to further restrictions, then we are at a stage that the finals will not be rescheduled.ldquoWe as a league have tried our utmost to give the players an opportunity to be involved in a cup final, but there comes a time when we need to make a decision on the values of the cup.

Once more they have gone right to the business end of the competition, but this time they are determined to carry off the silverware.ldquoFrom a neutralrsquos point of view, it should be a really exciting match, the Castlewellan woman said. ldquoIt is also great for Ulster camogie that two northern teams are in the final.ldquoWersquove been so close over the last few years and it would be great to be able to get over that final hurdle now.With Down teams performing strongly at schools level in camogie for a while, it was always felt that would ultimately translate to success higher up the age groups. And so it has proven to be. McMullan says a number of factors have come together to allow Down to prosper, including manager Derek Dunnersquos influence.ldquoDerek has been brilliant for us, she said. He is passionate and committed to the team. In his preparation, he leaves no stone unturned. He has definitely gone above and beyond the call of duty for us.ldquoHe has brought the best people into the off-field team around us, and he has invested in us. When someone does that, it makes you want to repay their faith by bringing success. It is a time-consuming role for him too, he does a lot as well away from the matches and the training ground, so the fact we have made it to the final is brilliant for him too.In what has been a year when sportsmen and sportswomen have been left unsure about what would happened because of the coronavirus, Karen and her team-mates are revelling in being able to anticipate the excitement around an All-Ireland final.ldquoWersquore delighted to be there, first and foremost. We are buzzing with excitement. And the other thing is too, especially with the dficulties that so many people are going through, we are able to feed off the excitement of others.ldquoSo many people have been affected badly by Covid-, but you can see the dference sport can make.It can help communities come together and that is certainly something we can feel heading into this game.Down booked their spot in the final with a - to - semi-final success against Meath in Clones. It was a match where the Mourne girls looked fairly comfortable and had a gear or two to spare.McMullan concurs, saying they could have racked up an even more convincing winning margin.ldquoWe should have scored more, and could have done. But Meath held out well, and then it became more of a case of seeing the game out and protecting the advantage. We knew Meath are a very dficult team to overcome.ldquoBefore the match, we spoke about how close we had come before going all the way. We absolutely did not want to experience those feelings again. A lot of players, to be honest, were not over last yearrsquos loss to Westmeath. It hurt a lot.ldquoSometimes it can take you to lose a game of that importance to toughen you up, make you ready to go that bit more the next time. There is no doubt the girls have the hunger and are driven to win this now. As for the challenge posed by Antrim, the Down camp are certainly not under-estimating the task at hand, as Karen admits.ldquoItrsquoll be a tough one against Antrim. They are a very young, very fit, quick team. They have some of their top players from the likes of Loughgiel and Ballycastle. Itrsquos a local derby which obviously adds a bit more spice to things. Honestly, on the day, it is anyonersquos game.Anyonersquos game indeed, but Down will know they have weapons in their team that they will look to on the day to make the dference between the pain of coming runners-up again, and the glory of being crowned All-Ireland champions.Paula OrsquoHagan is someone the team will certainly be looking towards to presenting a threat in front of the Antrim goal. She was a constant thorn in the side of Meath in the last four, accounting for seven points.Sarah-Louise Graffin is also a threat going forward. She ably dovetailed with OrsquoHagan in the last four, weighing in with three points. When those two click going forward, they can be a handful for even the most miserly of back-lines.Fionnuala Carr is the glue that held that line together so well in the success over Meath, and no doubt she will be the bedrock that Down will try to build their success on again.As well as that, Dougan has the team well-drilled in defence. And ahead of them, they have a midfield prowess that can take a grip on a game against the best. Niamh Mallon is a constant danger to the opposition, full of busy running and creativity. Alongside her, Saoirse McCartan is another wily operator.Undoubtedly, Down possess the tools in their armoury to carry off the title this time around. In terms of talent, and the experience of being there before and knowing what to expect on the big occasion, they know the drill.Now Dougan, and the players will be hoping they can shake off the lsquonearlyrsquo tag and be crowned camogie queens of Ireland.The throw-in for Saturdayrsquos final is .pm. It will be broadcast live on the RTE News Channel and also on the RTE Player International.

In these strange and dficult times, even the strongest and most resilient among us are not exempt from occasionally feeling weary and despondent.During the early months of lockdown back in the spring, how many of us enjoyed the slowing down of the hamster wheel of le and took time to enjoy nature at its finest and to reflect on what our priorities really are It all seems much harder this time around as people face the harsh reality of a huge economic downturn and the virus pandemic takes on a dferent guise.We need all the help we can get to keep ourselves as positive and hopeful as possible. This is where mindfulness can come in. It is a term that has become popular in recent times and often is wrongly used.It can get a bad press and seem shrouded in mystery mdash something that requires a knowledge of Zen beyond the reach of lsquoJoe Publicrsquo while others claim it to be some kind of panacea that can cure all ills. It is neither of these things.As a practitioner for several years and a Mindfulness in Schools Project trained teacher for five, I can honestly say it is a tool that can help some peoplefocus on the present and not let the mind wander into unnecessary places, whether that be worries or distractions.The analogy of thoughts being like buses is one I like. We donrsquot need to jump on every single one, instead just watch them pass by.An example of a mindful experience could be when a musician is playing a piece and sensing the music, rather than reading the notes.It is flowing completely naturally and no thinking is involved. Sport is another great example. Novak Djokovic and Jonny Wilkinson are two advocates of mindful practice and both claim their focus and steady performance can be attributed to the discipline.Interestingly, two of the most mindful sports are golf and cricket. Being at one with the little white ball as it gets smacked about the greens is said to be as good for mental health as much as physical.Our own Rory McIlroy summed it up well when he said: ldquoIrsquom not about to go and live with the monks in Nepal or anything like that, but Irsquom making sure that I centre myself and put my head in the right place.Cricket is similar.When you are bowling an over, the focus is on the line of the ball, the position of the field and the feel of the wicket under foot. The batsman is equally focussing on the ball and the fielders woe betide they lose their concentration.The halcyon days of local cricket as a mainstream sport appear to be over at the moment and there are multiple reasons offered for the demise mdash schools having less time for summer sports in the final term, the attention span of young players not being what it was and fewer people willing to commit to what could be a full day.Which leads me nicely back to the beginning.Remember those lovely, slower days of lockdown when we realised being busy wasnrsquot necessarily all it was cracked up to be and that many of the things on our mental lsquoto dorsquo list are not that important after all Maybe we really need to take time to smell the autumn leaves, the way we did for the daffodils of spring. Maybe we need to slow it down and find things to hope for.Local cricket clubs donrsquot have the crowds around the team boards any more on a Thursday evening after the selection committee when the team lists were pinned up.There isnrsquot that excitement of ldquodid I make it from the thirds to the seconds   or for me, ldquowhere am I serving the sandwiches It is a dferent era for the game, but those who love it, really love it. If anyone reading this has their whites from a bygone time hidden in an attic somewhere, why not retrieve them and dust them down for next spring If you played a bit at school and just feel like revisiting the sport for a bit of exercise and a bit of craic with new people, then please do it.Evenyoursquove never played, but have walked down the Strangford Road and loved that beautul setting, then it might be worth a go.We all need things to look forward to and we all need hope. Downpatrick Cricket Club needs that hope too.Maurice Irvine, a dear friend and colleague and master of cricket at Down High School, is also a former player for the school and the club.He strongly recommends anyone to take up the bat again or try it out whatever level you are at.When I asked him how he felt at the possible closure of Downpatrick Cricket Club, he said:ldquoIt is with great sadness that I learn of this possibility. I have many memories of playing there under the guidance of Roy Briggs, Ken McCammon and many others, developing my love of the game. ldquoCricket is a great game educating young people especially in respect, fair play, how to win and lose with dignity and team spirit.ldquoDownpatrick Cricket Club, along with Saintfield and Dundrum, is also a great place for Down High cricketers to gain valuable experience and the opportunity to learn from more experienced cricketers.ldquoDownpatrick have also been very generous to Down High, allowing us access to nets when they were not available at school and I would add my encouragement to anyone in the area to become involved to help the club at this dficult time.For me, the Linehan family are synonymous with cricket in Downpatrick.Alfie and Hugh will remain heroes of mine always, while current club chairman Paul Linehan hopes thatanyone can assist to keep the club going they will contact him on   or email paul.k.linehan@gmail..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd December 2020 Drumaness.jpg","title":"Drumaness green space plans  ","story":"A NEW amenity area is to be created in Drumaness by Newry, Mourne and Down Council.An area known locally as the lsquoBack Fieldrsquo where a play park was located a number of years ago is to be redeveloped.The news has been welcomed by Slieve Croob councillor, Cathy Mason, who is pleased that a raised area made of bricks and concrete is to be flattened and reseeded with GAA and football posts and nets to be provided.The local politician, who has been lobbying for the work to be carried out, said it is now possible as the village has two play parks, explaining that the remnants of bricks and concrete at the back field can now be removed, with this particular work long over due. ldquoThe area will be flattened and seeded so it can be safely used, with a set of GAA and soccer nets provided, said Cllr Mason.ldquoWe all know how vital it is to get outside into the fresh air, especially our children during these unprecedented times.

Progress is at last being made, but the money required to finance the scheme is the final piece in the development jigsaw, he said.ldquoThis scheme is good news for the people of Ballynahinch and the wider district and what everyone is keen to see is a timetable for delivery.Cllr Walker said the bypass had been talked about for  years and was now literally within touching distance.He added: ldquoWhat we require is a definitive timetable and confirmation from the roads minister that the money to build the new road is there. The scheme is finally moving in the right direction and now is the time to commit the money to ensure its delivery.Cllr Terry Andrews also welcomed progress in the bypass which he said can make a signicant dference for not only Ballynahinch, but the wider East and South Down areas.Rowallane councillor, Robert Burgess, said people in Ballynahinch look forward to the delivery of the scheme, urging consideration be given to farmers whose land has ben set aside for  years to accommodate the planned bypass.ldquoThese farmers have been unable to do anything with these areas of land which will probably be vested. The situation they fund themselves in is not fair, he added.The Department for Infrastructurersquos network manager, James Kelly, said while a previous roads manager was minded to proceed with the Ballynahinch scheme, it did not reach the point of going ahead.He said there was now an opportunity for roads officials to refresh the schemersquos environmental assessments before presenting them to the minister again.Mr Kelly said with the scheme expected to cost between poundm and poundm,Mrs Mallon wishes for it to proceed, the bypass will have to enter a process where it will be competing for finance with other schemes.He added: ldquoWe cannot guarantee that the money will be available next year..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd December 2020 New.jpg","title":"New bus at Knockevin Special School following £28k donation  ","story":"KNOCKEVIN Special School in Downpatrick has taken charge of a new bus thanks to the generosity of the Lordrsquos Taverners and the schoolrsquos parent staff association.The PSA donated pound, towards the cost of the new wheelchair accessible bus which was provided by the Lordrsquos Taverners, which provides support for people with disabilities.The bus was recently handed over to the school by PSA members, who will also fund its running costs.The PSA was formed in  when parents and staff came together to fund music therapy for the pupils which was no longer being funded by the relevant authorities.The associationrsquos goal is to support all of the pupils at Knockevin Special School in Downpatrick and Knockevin Early Years Centre in Dundrum.PSA chairperson Kelley OrsquoReilly said: ldquoSince we formed we have raised considerable amounts of money through ious events and projects, such as the Sparkle Project in , with our previous chairperson Paula Dillon at the helm, which saw the local community come together to raise money for the refurbishment of two sensory rooms and the hydrotherapy pool.ldquoWe smashed our target of pound, to raise a staggering amount of over pound, and we were able to provide the school with a bicycle track and new bikes.ldquoWe funded a Memory Tree, which the school had wanted for some considerable time, designed and constructed by local artist Kevin Killen, to remember pupils who passed away while attending Knockevin.Kelley added: ldquoWe also have recently agreed to fund the refurbishment of the soft play area in the Profound and Multiple Learning Disabilities unit within the Downpatrick school site.

An additional support package will be put in place for traditional drink-only pubs that unfortunately will not be able to reopen at this time.ldquoWe appreciate how important Christmas time is for many families and the Executive has agreed arrangements that will allow families and friends to come together in a limited way between  and  December.ldquoItrsquos important for people to understand that with any increased contact comes increased risk. Everyone needs to think very carefully about the risks posed to them, and their loved ones, by coming together over the Christmas period, particularly to those who are vulnerable. Some may choose not to form a Christmas bubble but for those who do, we encourage them to keep their bubbles small and limit the numbers of people gathering, as much as possible.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

When a bubble is formed it is fixed, and must not be changed or extended further at any point.bull Each Christmas bubble can meet at home, at a place of worship or an outdoor public place, but existing, more restrictive rules on hospitality and meeting in other venues will be maintained throughout this period.It is important that everyone respects and abides by the rules of each nation wherever they choose to spend the festive period.Where there are any iations in our approach, these will be communicated by each administration accordingly.Further guidance will be provided in due course.The winter holiday period is a time often spent with family and friends, with schools and offices closing and people travelling over the bank holidays.Many have already begun making their plans, and we are today providing clarity to help people make the right choices for them, and enjoy time with those closest to them while staying within the rules to protect us all. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I wouldnrsquot be surprised to see a spike in cases as a result of this decision.All pub and bar owners that spoke to the Penarth Times said they are concerned about what happens after the next review on December , with the majority saying they do not believe pubs will be able to serve alcohol until January.Health minister Vaughan Gething said he understood why companies in the industry are upset, but admitted there is \"no perfect balance\" between protecting public health and businesses.Health minister Vaughan GethingBut Brains CEO Alistair Darby told the Penarth Times he feels the government has got the balance wrong.Brains pubs including the Windsor and the Star Inn in Dinas Powys will close on Friday.ldquo, people have come through our doors since the start of the pandemic ndash seven staff members have tested positive in that time and test and trace have contacted us five times, said Mr Darby.ldquoI wonrsquot question the science behind the government decision, but it seems to me wersquove shown what wersquove done has worked.ldquoWersquove worked tirelessly to make sure people are as safe as possible in our pubs, and people have been safe.

I havenrsquot laid any of my staff off yet, and donrsquot intend to, but this is really becoming testing for us now.ldquoYet again we received hardly any notice before this comes into effect.

They are at the very top of the priority list but there are challenges with getting the jab to them.The Pfizer BioNTech vaccine needs to be stored at minus C before being thawed out and can only be moved four times within that cold chain before being used.The vaccine boxes containing  doses will need to be split so that they can be taken to care homes.Mr Hopson said this will get going in about a weekrsquos time and will be led by primary care networks.ndash What plans are in place in Scotland First Minister of Scotland Nicola Sturgeon said initial supplies of the vaccine have arrived safely and are being stored securely ahead of the first jabs being administered on Tuesday.Care home residents in Scotland will be able to receive the Pfizer Covid vaccine from December .Health Secretary Jeane Freeman MSP said Scotland will receive .% of the , dosesin the first delivery secured by the UK, with more to come in the weeks ahead.She said the doses will go to the  commercial-size freezers in acute hospitals around Scotland which can hold the vaccine in the very low temperature it requires.Future plans include mass vaccination centres but that will be further down the line when vaccinators are dealing with much younger people.Other plans include mobile vaccination centres and high street locations where people can go for a jab.ndash What is happening in Northern Ireland Tuesday is the big day in Northern Ireland too, and the PA news agency understands that the first Pfizer BioNTech dose will be administered at am at a mass vaccination centre at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast.The recipient will be one of an -plus team of vaccinators that will be involved in the subsequent roll-out programme and there are , doses in the initial batch of the vaccine.Healthcare workers will be able to get the vaccine through the remainder of December at seven centres spread across the region.Two of the facilities are located on hospital grounds ndash at the Ulster Hospital in Dundonald and Belfastrsquos Royal Victoria Hospital ndash and the rest in leisure centres.The centres will operate  hours a day and seven days a week in an effort to vaccinate , healthcare and care home staff. vw,vw,px, px\"A card will be given to patients following a vaccination Care home residents and people aged over  are also in the first priority vaccination group, and health officials are continuing to examine ways to administer the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine in care homes in Northern Ireland.ndash And how are things looking in Wales Frontline NHS and social care staff in Wales will receive the countryrsquos first coronavirus vaccine from Tuesday.First Minister Mark Drakeford said he hoped supplies of the Pfizer vaccine marked a ldquoturning point in the pandemic that would put Wales ldquoon what is going to be a long path back to normality.Health minister Vaughan Gething said Wales is ready to deploy the vaccine in phases, starting with hospital sites and then community settings.People will be sent appointments with details of the location where they will receive the vaccination, dependent on where they are on the schedule and risk.Those receiving a jab will be given a credit card-sized NHS Wales immunisation card which will have the vaccine name, date of immunisation and batch number of each of the doses given, handwritten on them.These will act as a reminder for a second dose and for the type of vaccine, and it will also give information about how to report side effects..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Covid- vaccine rollout: How it is all unfolding article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Shops, hairdressers, restaurants, places of worship and hotels are among the places that will be able to re-open from December . Pubs selling drink onlywill remain closed and an additional financial package will be put in place. The Executive has also agreed Christmas household bubbling arrangements from December -. Three households will be able to come together for this period in domestic settings, outdoor public spaces and places of worship. One of the households will be able to include their existing household bubble. First Minister Arlene Foster said: “Through our collective efforts over recent weeks we gained enough space in the transmission of the virus to relax a signicant number of restrictions, including the opening-up of non-essential retail, close contact services, sport and leisure activities and our places of worship at the end of next week. “These decisions will give families, businesses and employees some much-needed certainty and comfort in the run-up to Christmas and beyond. “This is a special time of the year and we want to support people to have a good Christmas, but also a safe one. “Signicant work has been completed with business sectors, faith groups, local government and police on new mitigation measures to reduce the risk of transmission. “I urge everyone to be Covid-aware and to make careful and sensible decisions when out and about or mixing with others. We need to make sure we continue doing all we can to protect ourselves and our loved ones.” Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill said: “The Executive wants to give people as much notice as possible on what the situation will look like from next Friday when the current circuit breaker comes to an end. “We have given detailed consideration to which restrictions need tobe maintained, and what we can open up, in light of the scientic and medical advice. “A package of measures that will see signicant relaxations to the current restrictions has been agreed, with maximum mitigations in place to minimise risks to the greatest extent possible. An additional support package will be put in place for traditional drink-only pubs that unfortunately will not be able to reopen at this time. “We appreciate how important Christmas time is for many families and the Executive has agreed arrangements that will allow families and friends to come together in a limited way between  and  December. “It’s important for people to understand that with any increased contact comes increased risk. Everyone needs to think very carefully about the risks posed to them, and their loved ones, by coming together over the Christmas period, particularly to those who are vulnerable. Some may choose not to form a Christmas bubble but for those who do, we encourage them to keep their bubbles small and limit the numbers of people gathering, as much as possible.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_bbbfbba   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_dfaadacbde   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
