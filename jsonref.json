Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from the last week.It’s only February, but JayZed thinks Hurricane Season by Fernanda Melchor (translated by Sophie Hughes) could be the book of the year:Wow, this novel left me reeling. It’s about a murder in the rural slums of Veracruz in Mexico, and the harsh and violent lives of the people involved. The subject matter is brutal throughout: as well as the murder there’s domestic violence, drug addiction, prostitution, child sexual abuse, police brutality, backstreet abortions and much more. Yes, it’s all very harrowing and as a reader you feel more than a few punches to the gut, but the book is sustained and elevated by the stunning prose: it’s relentless and unflinching, but also mesmerising and at times darkly, beautifully luminous… The year is young, but this is probably book of the year for me so far. A brilliant job by both writer and translator.BobHammond2 has just finished The Adventures of Kavalier and Clay by Michael Chabon:I won’t go on about it too much as it’s been widely reviewed and praised by others over the years, apart from to say I massively enjoyed it. There was a lot more to it than I was expecting, as it flitted from Prague to the US to the South Pole, and covered such topics as the treatment of the Jews during WW2, the explosion of the comic book industry during and after the war, magic and escapology. All delivered with a wry humour by Michael Chabon that had me constantly smiling in the two weeks it took me to read it.“I am truly amazed” by The Vet’s Daughter by Barbara Comyns, says lonelybloomer:It is about what I think should be called profound evil. There’s so much death and pain in it, and weirdness, and creepy fun. Yet it doesn’t bring one down. I can’t stop thinking about it.The Autumn of the Patriarch by Gabriel Garcia Márquez is “an incredible novel,” says SydneyH:The text is a sort of nightmarish satire of the dictator-state, set in a Caribbean nation. The term ‘magic realism’ may be appropriate for One Hundred Years of Solitude, where gypsies get up to mischief in an historical locale, but I don’t think it is suitable here. Firstly, because the country isn’t specified, and so the narrative takes place in a hazy fictional realm. Secondly, with the exception of an incident of fortune-telling, there is little sorcery in any recognisable form, though the lepers in the colony are convinced that the chief’s touch will cure their ailment. The dream-like episodes progress from the tyrant’s virile youth to senility, when his appointed deputies torture and kill quite independently. Through it all is an element of farce that seems inherent to this form of leadership, such as when the autocrat games the lottery to ensure that he is the winner on every occasion. Probably the most defining quality of the work is the immersive prose, written without paragraph breaks. I suspect this would be frustrating for many people, but this translation of Gregory Rabassa is irresistible.The Tiger’s Wife by Téa Obreht has proved irresistible to Sara Richards:As part of my project of reading through all the winners of the Women’s Prize I got to The Tiger’s Wife by Téa Obreht which was a haunting story of a village somewhere in the Balkans between the two world wars and the more recent conflicts. Obreht uses a mix of history and folklore which I find irresistible in any novel set among the villages in the area my grandparents came from, and in that rich mix some eternal truths are spelled out… This novel isn’t very long but is so different from the other prize winners and it is dense and moving and beautifully written.“Julian Barnes’s The Man in the Red Coat is an absolute delight,” says proust:I was given it in hardback for Christmas, and it is best appreciated in this format, given its exquisite illustrations. Brilliantly well written and researched, with laugh out loud sentences on every page. Fascinating insight into the fin-de-siècle and belle époque. This is a book to treasure.Dracula by Bram Stoker has sunk its teeth into dylan37:Undeniably classic. Powerful and emotional, covering a great deal of ground in economic and pacy storytelling: Victorian manners, social propriety, fairytale, folklore, and the early days of psychoanalysis. Genuinely eye-widening in the action sequences, and occasionally drily amusing. (On the journey to the Count’s castle, Harker overhears some remarks about him in an inn, and translates them as “devil” and “vampire”. He makes a memo to self: must ask the Count about these local superstitions). And there’s a very dirty joke smuggled in to the final lines of chapter 8.Bringing his diabolical endeavour ashore at Whitby, through a bustling dirty London, and back to misty mountains of Transylvania, this bloody midnight visitor keeps us on the run – breathless, watchful, and trying to get all business concluded before sunrise.Finally, Fear Is the Rider by Kenneth Cook has unsettled jimitron5000:This is hold-your-breath, shut your eyes and hope it’s over, edge of the seat stuff. A man driving across the outback to go his new job meets a young woman on the way. Thinking with his wrong brain he follows the track she is taking, something entirely unsuitable in his little Honda. As he drives along she runs out in front of him, terrified, having narrowly escaped from a madman. He picks her up and from then on it is chase in the desert. The two of them trying to get away in a small Honda, the axe-wielding assailant following them in a land cruiser. Sure, some of the dialogue might be a bit wooden, and there might not be a great deal of character development but what it lacks in polish it makes up for in just how unsettling it is.Never think with your wrong brain!If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

Last week the South Korean carmaker Hyundai halted production lines because of a shortage of parts from China.The rate is likely to remain high for months, according to Nomura analysts, as the coronavirus affects supplies and encourages families to stockpile goods."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fea42bdce2c95333b3e4421d48c825b7f58d0003/0_236_7080_4248/master/7080.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c120f510ce849c40c0ddb6f988797914","title":"trafford centre intu cash call lakeside","story":"Property company, which also owns Lakeside in Essex, in talks with Hong Kong groupShares in Intu Properties jumped on Monday after the company behind shopping centres including the Trafford Centre in Manchester and Lakeside in Essex confirmed it is in talks with investors over an emergency cash call.The debt-laden firm said it was “engaged in constructive discussions with shareholders”, including its largest shareholder Peel Group, and new investors including the Hong Kong-based Link Real Estate Investment Trust.Intu has previously confirmed that it will announce a cash call – expected to be worth at least £1bn – alongside its annual results later this month.

The argument is understood to be finely balanced between board members. Northumbrian Water is also expected to make a decision before the end of the week.

In an hour-long speech on Friday to L’École de guerre (School of War) in Paris, the French president called for a European dialogue about defence and deterrence based on France’s force de frappe of nuclear weapons launched by air and submarine, and invited other EU states to participate in exercises by his country’s nuclear forces.This is the post-Brexit revival of a vision held by successive French leaders, who itched to establish EU defence policies that would rely on European nuclear weapons rather than the US and Nato. For decades, this aim was marginalised by other EU members. Brexit, Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin have emboldened Macron to put it back on the table – and this time he is getting more attention.French ambitions to provide the nuclear deterrence role in an integrated EU defence policy had previously been thwarted by Germany and the UK, which were more closely embedded with Nato and considered the US to be more reliable. Those governments have always been wary of France’s nuclear plans, although David Cameron eagerly entered into the 2010 Teutates treaty with France that enabled both nuclear-armed nations to share research facilities and cooperate on technology. The main purpose of Teutates, however, was to help both countries share the financial burdens of maintaining their nuclear status.Everything has now changed: with Brexit, the UK no longer has a voice in the EU, while Germany has become increasingly anxious about the nuclear policies of President Trump. Last week, a senior member of Angela Merkel’s CDU party in the Bundestag, Johann Wadephul, publicly raised the “question of French nuclear weapons as an element of European deterrence”. The remarks appear to have been coordinated with France in advance of Macron’s speech. By characterising the role of French nuclear forces in terms of European security, stability and “proper deterrence”, Macron attempts to provide reassurance. Recognising the fears engendered by a reinvigorated nuclear arms race between the US and Russia in their efforts to build more, “usable” nuclear weapons, including a new generation of enhanced medium-range missiles, Macron promised that “France will never engage in nuclear battle”.Previous attempts to portray France’s military forces as “European deterrents” had come up against a locked door, bolted on the inside by the UK and Germany. Now, with Nato in disarray, the UK marginalised, and Putin and Trump busy competing with each other on various fronts, Macron clearly hopes that other European countries are ready to welcome French nuclear weapons as guarantors of regional security.Macron also hopes to legitimise France’s nuclear weapons and policies in advance of the important review conference of the 1968 non-proliferation treaty (NPT) in April. He and the other nuclear-armed governments know they will face strong criticism for undermining the NPT and failing to comply with its fundamental nuclear disarmament obligations. The newest tool in the non-proliferation regime is the 2017 treaty on the prohibition of nuclear weapons, which was negotiated in the UN general assembly after the 2015 NPT conference failed.This landmark treaty prohibits all activities associated with acquiring, possessing, deploying and using nuclear weapons. It was adopted in 2017 by 122 parties to the NPT, of which 80 have signed in the first two years, including EU members Ireland and Austria.Even before the treaty enters into full legal force, in France and other non-signatory countries, its objectives and provisions are leading to steps taken by municipal authorities and financial institutions to est from nuclear weapons and promote nuclear disarmament. Macron’s references to this treaty in his speech are dismissive, but they also demonstrate his anxiety about its impact on France’s nuclear establishment – France previously opposed the NPT before signing up to it in 1992.Beset by yellow vests and economic woes, Macron desperately needs a big idea to distract from his domestic challenges, and hopes that the vision of uniting Europe under a French nuclear umbrella will work. It won’t.Meanwhile, the municipal government of Paris has joined other cities and countries around the world in taking practical steps to end nuclear-related investments and comply with international laws prohibiting activities that could lead to nuclear weapons ever being used again. If Macron really wants to contribute to European security, he should ensure that France does so too.• Dr Rebecca E Johnson is director of the Acronym Institute for Disarmament Diplomacy"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b987329f5bd17757efcca5fae0e061ec7ee1113a/625_53_4116_2470/master/4116.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a52f7cbb04b8f9894eb75e1c8686f3d4","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of infinite","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘infinite’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘infinite’.Share your photos of what infinite means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 12 February at 10am.

In fact, we cannot afford to accept it.”The move by staff follows a weekend of protest at the museum, which began on Friday night when protesters dressed as ancient Greek warriors smuggled a four-metre Trojan horse on to the museum’s forecourt. The protest was in response to the exhibition Troy: Myth and Reality, which is described as “supported by BP”.On Saturday, 1,500 supporters took part in a day of protests, occupying 11 of the museum’s rooms, with speeches, singalongs, and talks by campaigners from West Papua and Senegal.Origami swans were scattered throughout the museum adorned with messages including: “Choose sponsors who care about our future.” Protesters finished the day by tearing apart paper versions of BP’s logo near the museum’s main entrance.The protest is the latest escalation in the campaign to end fossil fuel sponsorship at the UK’s leading cultural venues. In October, the Royal Shakespeare Company ditched its sponsorship deal with BP, after a campaign from artists, environmentalists and members of the public.Monday’s backing from museum staff will increase the pressure on management to take action. The statement was co-signed by former museum trustee Ahdaf Soueif, who resigned last summer over the BP sponsorship, the treatment of workers and the issue of repatriation of artefacts.Soueif said: “Cultural institutions have a moral responsibility in who they choose as partners. It’s time for the British Museum to respond to the legitimate and pressing concerns of young people across the planet. It’s time to drop BP.”A spokesperson for the British Museum said: “We are aware of the comments from the PCS union and will continue to liaise with the British Museum PCS branch and our staff more generally.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/337104c80f5d0848d105fb07d39f2e0750b94103/0_267_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=496184f95cf9e9ad027ba62978ed20bd","title":"french bracelet among surprises in mysterious havering hoard","story":"Bronze age specialists split on why so many objects would have been broken and buriedOne of the largest and most mysterious bronze age hoards ever found in the UK contains objects that have astonished archaeologists, including items more commonly found in France and the Alps.The Museum of London on Monday revealed new finds among the Havering hoard, a remarkable collection of 453 swords, axes, knives, chisels, sickles, razors, ingots and bracelets excavated from a quarry in east London over a period of three months and revealed last year.Dating from 900-800BC, it is the third largest bronze age hoard ever discovered in the UK.Closer examination has revealed a pair of terret rings believed to have been used to prevent the reins tangling on horse-drawn carts. Bronze age examples have been found before in France but not the UK.There is also a bracelet believed to be from what is now north-west France, and copper ingots possibly originating from the Alps.Kate Sumnall, a curator of archaeology at the museum, said the unexpected finds suggested links to Europe that were nearly 3,000 years old.“These objects give clues about how this wasn’t an isolated community but rather one that fitted into a much larger cultural group with connections along the Thames Valley and across the continent.”What the discoveries do not do is help solve the mystery of the hoard’s origins. Sumnall is curating an exhibition on the hoard to be staged at the museum’s Docklands outpost in April, and she admits there are still more questions than answers.“We pulled together a room full of bronze age specialists to discuss some of this, to discuss our interpretation and hopefully to narrow things down … and you can’t get the room to agree,” she said.There are four theories about why so many objects would have been deliberately broken and meticulously buried.All of the theories raise their own questions. If they were being stored, for example, why were they not retrieved?Sumnall said the exhibition would not be prescriptive. “We will be saying: here are the clues, form your own conclusion.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c31c73f876834045b268bf828290b956d505a26c/0_38_3636_2181/master/3636.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1778d746629e4eb1073d7b434522b1bb","title":"joaquin phoenix oscars speech","story":"The Joker star went off-script to bare his teeth at the meat industry, risking ridicule to advocate profound social changeAhead of Joker’s release, all the conversation around the film was about the harm it would cause, how it would encourage copycat violence and awaken a sleeper cell of resentful white guys itching to wreak violence upon the innocent. The joke was on us: Joker has paved the way for one of the most progressive and  undeniably bizarre acceptance speeches in living memory, courtesy of Joaquin Phoenix at Sunday night’s Oscars.Phoenix had been building up to this over the course of the awards season, not least at the Baftas two weeks ago, where he burst the bubble with a speech mentioning “systemic racism” and the messages that white-dominated awards shows send out to people of colour. Taking the stage to pick up his best actor Oscar, he began with a heartfelt plea for tolerance: “Whether we’re talking about gender inequality or racism or queer rights or indigenous rights or animal rights, we’re talking about the fight against injustice. We’re talking about the fight against the belief that one nation, one people, one race, one gender or one species has the right to dominate, control and use and exploit another with impunity.”But Phoenix, a lifelong vegan, somewhat undercut his broad opening sweep by then narrowing his focus on the cruelty of the dairy industry: “We feel entitled to artificially inseminate a cow, and when she gives birth, we steal her baby, even though her cries of anguish are unmistakable. Then, we take milk that’s intended for her calf and we put it in our coffee and our cereal.”In other words, don’t expect a Joker frozen yoghurt tie-in any time soon. Suddenly we were in the territory of Marlon Brando’s famous surrogate Sacheen Littlefeather, at the 1973 Oscars, who read out a speech against the stereotyping of Native Americans by Hollywood. Or the time Shirley MacLaine, winning for Terms of Endearment, thanked everyone she’d ever met in her life and the other life she might have had. Or perhaps Emma Thompson’s 1996 speech, which took in Jane Austen’s grave in Winchester and the writer’s popularity in Uruguay. Phoenix played Jesus two years ago in the movie Mary Magdalene – had it all gone to his head?But Phoenix brought his speech back round to a stirring plea for selflessness, forgiveness and respect. “When we use love and compassion as our guiding principles, we can create, develop and implement systems of change that are beneficial to all sentient beings and to the environment.” He wasn’t simply banging the drum for a pet cause, he was pretty much calling for a top-down rethink of human civilisation.Phoenix was opening himself up for ridicule but he is unlikely to care. Sure enough, the usual outlets have obliged, with his performance variously described as as a “bonkers Oscars acceptance speech” (Breitbart), a “sprawling sociopolitical epic” (Vox), and a “rant about veganism” (Mail Online). On the other hand, he has drawn praise from the likes of Peta: “This is what a true ally to animals looks like.”Most actors talk the talk about using their exposure to affect change Phoenix is actually doing it – in small ways (he’s already forced several ceremonies to change their meat-centric menus) and, as he did last night, large ones, calling out racism, misogyny, intolerance, inequality, cancel culture and bovine rights. He’s not quite Hollywood’s messiah, not yet, but he’s definitely more Jesus than Joker."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f75decfa6b55f81976357092e260abadc8516f8/0_127_1903_1141/master/1903.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc19918803b01398c082259a96ac34fc","title":"joaquin phoenixs oscars speech in full","story":"The full text of Phoenix’s passionate winner’s speech, as he accepts the best actor Academy Award for JokerI’m full of so much gratitude now.

Like many edible things, their origins are disputed it seems likely that the biscuits originated in Prato, a city and commune in Tuscany where they are also known as mandorlati di San Clemente. Wherever they originated, brutti ma buoni have migrated all over Italy and are now found in pretty much every bakery next to the soft almond biscuits, the biscuits made with wine (to dip in wine) and wisp-thin cat’s tongues.Quite how ugly the biscuits are depends on the bakery, and the beholder. Our local makes brutti ma buoni – and there is no getting around this – that look like neat mounds of poo. I am amused every time I see them, which is every day. However, this unfortunate association does not make them ugly to me. Quite the opposite: I find the tray of rough-hewn mounds delightful, like a soft almond amaretti, only made more interesting with the dense butteriness of hazelnuts and an almost toffee chew.Brutti ma buoni are made of just three ingredients: hazelnuts, sugar and egg whites, the proportion of each depending on the recipe. Having tried half a dozen, I found one I am happy with, not least because it is a recipe with two possible outcomes. Both, though, start with ground hazelnuts.You can buy ground hazelnuts, but the natural oils start dissipating as soon as they are ground, so the flavour fades in the bag. If you have time, it is worth buying whole, unblanched ones and roasting them, which brings out the flavour, then grinding them yourself. While some recipes claim that true brutti ma buoni must have a double cooking, others don’t. For the latter, let the soft mixture sit for five minutes, then plop teaspoons of it on to a baking tray lined with parchment. Bake at 130C (110C fan)gas ½ for 45 minutes. This makes 20 or so pale, meringue-like brutti ma buoni that have a brittle shell and a slightly chewy middle.The second option is to scrape the mixture into a pan and cook it again over a medium flame for five to seven minutes, stirring continuously. It will thicken like porridge and darken. Let it sit for five minutes, so it can tighten even more, then use a spoon to arrange the mixture in small, walnut-sized mounds on a baking tray lined with parchment. As before, bake at 130C (110C fan)gas ½ for 45 minutes the double cooking changes the nature of the dough and produces a dark, craggy outside – not so much crisp but firm – and a chewy, almost toffee-like middle.My preference is for the second option: the rough hewn version that justifies the second step. That said, if I was going to make them to go with a soft pudding, such as chocolate mousse, syllabub or lemon pudding, then the first option, the pale and delicate meringue brutti ma buoni with their gentle crumble, make for a beautiful partner.200g hazelnuts110g icing sugar80g egg white (the whites of two medium-sized eggs)1 pinch salt40g caster sugarPut the hazelnuts on a baking tray then into an oven set to 170C (150C fan)gas 3 for 10-15 minutes, or until lightly coloured and the skins blistered. Wrap the nuts in a kitchen towel, leave for one minute then, making sure the towel is wrapped tightly, rub vigorously to remove the loose skins – don’t worry about skins that don’t come off. Leave to cool.Grind or pound the nuts into a coarse rubble, set a third aside, then continue grinding the rest into a fine flour. Put the coarse and finely ground nuts into a bowl with the icing sugar.Whisk the egg whites and a pinch of salt until frothy, add the caster sugar and whisk until stiff, sleek peaks form. Fold the egg whites into the nuts and sugar.There are two options for baking. The first is to let the mixture rest for five minutes, then plop teaspoons of it onto a baking tray lined with parchment, leaving space between each one as they will spread. Bake at 130C (110C fan)gas ½ for 45 minutes, then leave to cool before lifting from the tin.The second option is to scrape the mixture into a pan and cook over a medium flame, stirring continuously, for five to seven minutes, in which time the mixture will thicken and darken from beige to a deep golden brown. Leave to rest for five minutes.Plop teaspoons of the mixture onto a baking tray lined with parchment. Bake at 130C (110C fan)gas ½ for 45 minutes.

Massage this into the lamb, so that it is generously coated, and set aside.Cut the radicchio heads in half and each half into four wedges, with the wedges attached to the core to keep them together. Put them in a roasting tray and drizzle with two tablespoons of oil, the balsamic vinegar and all but a tablespoon of the remaining rosemary. Season generously, then roast for about half an hour, until soft and caramelised at the edges.Vigorously chop the olives with the remaining garlic clove and the rest of the parsley and rosemary: it doesn’t have to be very finely chopped, but you don’t want huge chunks of garlic. Stir in four to five tablespoons of oil, followed by the pomegranate seeds. Taste and adjust accordingly.Heat the grill (or chargrill) for a few minutes until it is extremely hot, then grill the chops for two to three minutes a side, depending on how rare you like them.Serve the chops astride the roast radicchio, dressed with the tapenade. Creamy mash or buttered potatoes are nice partners.Try the roast radicchio and tapenade with a vegetarian-friendly cheesy polenta for a delicious meat-free alternative.

The Norwegian runner Ingrid Kristiansen famously won the Houston marathon while almost five months pregnant (though without knowing it). Paula Radcliffe took part in a 10km charity run while seven months pregnant in 2010 and, nine months after giving birth, won the New York marathon. Meanwhile in 1994, the US player Joy Fawcett became the first woman on the team to get pregnant mid-career. Later, following her third child, she returned to action after six weeks.NHS guidelines now encourage pregnant women to “keep up your normal daily physical activity or exercise for as long as you feel comfortable” and explicitly state that “exercise is not dangerous for your baby”, going on to state: “There is some evidence that active women are less likely to experience problems in later pregnancy and labour.” Yet it has taken time for the limited research available to pierce widely held views and to sink into public consciousness.The Morgan phenomenon – the celebrating of the pregnant athlete, is a new thing. And it has taken global poster-women such as Morgan, an eight-weeks pregnant Serena Williams revealing her pregnancy after winning the 2017 Australian Open and images of a five-and-a-half-month pregnant Orlando Pride forward Sydney Leroux training, coupled with a much greater awareness of the benefits of exercise during pregnancy in society generally, to break the stigma. As someone who fainted on the London Underground twice while three months pregnant, the efforts of the likes of Morgan, Williams and Leroux look almost superhuman.For too long having children has been pushed back by players until retirement, for a number of reasons. Players such as the former US players Mia Hamm and Julie Foudy and the England duo Kelly Smith and Rachel Yankey all waited until their playing careers were over before starting a family.Yes, some have undoubtedly chosen to wait until their careers had drawn to a close, mindful of just how short a playing career can be, but equally impactful on decision-making has been the lack of maternity rights, financial worries and a fear of being sidelined or replaced.Morgan announced her pregnancy alongside her husband and LA Galaxy player Servando Carrasco in October and, naturally, her return to action was not the focus. However, her new international manager Vlatko Andonovski hinted at the striker’s intention in his first press conference following the departure of the two-time World Cup‑winning coach Jill Ellis. “The most important thing is to have a healthy pregnancy and deliver a healthy baby,” he said. “When she does that, we’re going to do everything in our power, use the resources that the federation is providing, whether it’s high-performance director, staff, anything that we can do on our side to help her get back for the Olympics.”Making the slimmed-down USWNT squad for Tokyo 2020 three months after giving birth would be hugely impressive. But should she not make the squad her attempt to stay ready to play while her body is going through the most monumental of changes should be applauded regardless.Ultimately there is no reason Morgan cannot return, whenever that may be, as strong, if not stronger. Indeed the Chelsea manager, Emma Hayes, and the England international Katie Chapman put the longevity of the latter’s career down to her having had children. “Everybody who’s become a mother tells me that it increases your red blood cells so you can run longer,” said the then-pregnant Hayes following Chelsea’s 2018 FA Cup win. “You become better endurance runners, and Katie is insistent that because of the birth of her three children she runs more and more. She’s in impeccable shape – physically, she’s probably our most dominant athlete.”In 1894 Blanche Hillyard became the first mother to win Wimbledon. At the 1948 London Olympics the Dutch sprinter and mother of two, Fanny Blankers-Koen, won four gold medals. In 2010 there were five mothers in the Los Angeles Sparks basketball team. Jessica McDonald found herself injured and pregnant in 2010 but came back to earn her first senior call-up to the USWNT six years later and then, aged 30, made the squad for the 2019 World Cup.Last year Jasmin Paris, then 35, became the first woman to win the gruelling Montane Spine Race along the Pennine Way, setting a race record while expressing breast milk at aid stations along the route. All of which proves pregnancy no longer means your title switches from athlete to mother. That a player of Morgan’s profile is highlighting that will do no end of good."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7bc1e6eddf558559b3c3a7d890fd72d8bc67f4df/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b2cfb98343142b4dc9826d7821a11e9f","title":"premier league champiosnhip europe talking points","story":"Brighton still searching for right system, Richarlison is showing his class and ruthless Nottingham Forest have the momentumBrighton have been chopping and changing, looking for a formula that might help them beat the drop. They remain outside the relegation zone by three points and have a better goal difference than their rivals. But they have not won since December and, ever since, the team has gone through a number of permutations from 3-5-2 to 4-4-2 and others in between. On Saturday they started in a 4-1-4-1 with Davy Pröpper anchoring midfield behind Aaron Mooy and Pascal Gross. By the time the game ended there were two up top and two wide midfielders at full-back. In the end it worked, with one substitute, Alireza Jahanbakhsh, firing over the cross that Adrian Mariappa turned into his own net for Brighton’s equaliser. But it was a close-run thing. Brighton are still looking for an approach they can rely on. They will need to settle on one soon. Paul MacInnesSuch is Everton’s turnaround under Carlo Ancelotti that Europe now occupies their thoughts and not the relegation battle that loomed under Marco Silva. No one, least of all their new manager, is overplaying the quality of recent performances or the calibre of their squad, however. Richarlison is the exception on both counts. The Brazil international produced the key moment of Saturday’s win over Palace – the superb second goal that made it 17 points from eight league games under Ancelotti – and another commanding display that brought rich praise from a manager who knows world-class potential when he sees it. “He has to improve,” said Ancelotti. “He has to play with more consistency but he shows fantastic quality at counterattack and as a striker. It depends on him but he can be a world-class player.” Andy HunterBournemouth returned from Bramall Lane empty-handed but the performance of Ryan Fraser should provide more than a crumb of comfort. The winger was revitalised against Sheffield United, influential in helping Bournemouth open the scoring through Callum Wilson before carving out a couple more openings. Fraser, out of contract in the summer, recently said he had taken his eye off the ball as a result of being distracted by transfer speculation – “I didn’t play for the team, I’m honest enough to admit that” – but in that same interview he said he would endeavour to put that right. Fraser was much improved in victories against Brighton and Aston Villa and was Bournemouth’s best player in defeat on Sunday. How Eddie Howe, whose side travel to Burnley after the winter break, could do with Fraser finding peak form between now and May. Ben FisherHanging on the side of Sheffield United’s Kop is a large banner featuring a picture of the Blades’ captain mid celebration and a to-the-point message: “Billy Sharp scores goals.” Which is true, or at least has been for the vast majority of his career, and has certainly been the case as United have climbed the isions in this his third spell at the club. The 34-year-old has not been prolific this season but then he has not had much game time, that is until recently. Having made one start before Christmas, Sharp has been in the first XI in United’s last three fixtures and, though his goal against Bournemouth was his first since the opening day, his all-round performances have been excellent. With David McGoldrick returning to fitness and Lys Mousset providing the assist for John Lundstram’s winner, Chris Wilder has a tricky – but welcome – selection problem heading his way. John AshdownAs Leeds sank to a fifth defeat in six games on Saturday the obvious response was to marvel at yet another late-season collapse from a Marcelo Bielsa side. But Bielsa gets enough attention: credit should instead go to the Nottingham Forest team who are currently everything Leeds are not: resolute, ruthless and gathering real momentum. Sabri Lamouchi may not preach the snazzy football of his more illustrious peers but he has put together a tireless outfit, who are nine points better off than at this stage last season, and his use of Joe Lolley as a high-pressing destroyer on Saturday was proof that he is no mug when it comes to tactics either. Crucially, though, his team do not let nerves get to them. Of their seven games against the rest of the current top six, Forest have won four, drawn two and lost just one – and that due to a freak Matt Phillips goal on the opening day. But now a pivotal week looms: on Tuesday Forest take on Charlton under the lights at the City Ground, where a win could take Lamouchi’s side to second, and after that, it’s away to the leaders. They’re not out of the woods yet. Alex HessAlexander Isak’s start at Real Sociedad was a slow one, scoring just twice in his first 16 appearances for the Basque club following his move from Borussia Dortmund. Since mid-December, however, he has netted 13 in 12 games including against Real Madrid in the Bernabéu to earn a Copa del Rey semi-final spot and winning the derby against Athletic Bilbao on Sunday. Still only 20, the Swedish striker is finally living up to the hype which earned him a move to the Bundesliga in 2017. Having failed to have an impact at Dortmund, he now seems even more determined to prove his worth. The Swede’s form has made helped Real Sociedad to sixth in the table, a cup semi-final and primed him to lead his country’s forward line in this summer’s Euros. Plenty of youngsters have drifted away after an ill-advised big-money move early in their career but Isak has used the warning to his advantage. Will UnwinInternazionale reminded Manchester United what they were lacking on Sunday night, as Alexis Sánchez and Romelu Lukaku both put in impressive displays to help turn the Milan derby on its head. The Chilean did brilliantly to assist Matías Vecino, getting in behind the Milan defence with an intelligent run and then setting up his teammate for the easier chance, despite having the opportunity to shoot himself. Lukaku was a constant danger for Inter, eventually getting his reward late on thanks to clever movement at the back post from where he carefully guided a Victor Moses cross into the corner. If United’s management had dealt with the duo better they could have been doing the same at Old Trafford but instead Ole Gunnar Solskjær is left to rely on inferior players.

As Munich waited for a storm to brew, meteorologically as well as metaphorically, the Bundesliga’s big clash of the season to date simultaneously gave and took away, delivered and let down, satisfied and left you hungry for more.It felt as if the whole occasion had been set up to blindside you, from the scheduling – unquestionably the standout game of the weekend being left to last, unusually for Germany, and the 1800 Sunday timeslot – through the teams’ respective preparations, right down to the chronology of the match itself. At the end of it we didn’t quite have the spectacular that we wanted, but we did have a title race fully intact.The fear, for neutral and non-Bayern fans, of that not being the case had been clear in the days and weeks building up to it. As Leipzig faltered and flustered in recent weeks, looking far from their confident selves and letting five league points and a place in the DfB Pokal slip through their grasp, it seemed as if they were arriving to face Bayern – in a stadium where they’d never so much as taken a point – at just the wrong time. Behind that assured exterior even Julian Nagelsmann, who had very publicly admonished, questioned and encouraged his team as is his way, must surely have had his own doubts.In the first 45 minutes, it looked as if those fears were absolutely on the money, and that the script was an altogether familiar one. At times in that first half it felt as if the visitors’ defensive lynchpin Dayot Upamecano was the only thing standing between Bayern and a typical Allianz Arena procession, holding back an insistent tide with a Herculean display of fortitude. If there are people who believe he’s not at least agonisingly close to being the Bundesliga’s best defender, then they wouldn’t have been in the Allianz on Sunday.Maybe those tough opening moments could be the passage of play that changed something masquerading as a title race into the real deal. “With how we approached the first 20 minutes,” Timo Werner later reflected with more than a touch of his coach’s candour, “it was actually only a matter of time before we were behind.” While Upamecano stretched every sinew and Peter Gulacsi did his thing, denying Thiago Alcântara and Robert Lewandowski without fuss, there was an awakening, exactly as their manager had hoped.Nagelsmann had done his thinking - but he had not overthought things, like so many who have fallen by the wayside here before. “Bayern expected us to be high up the pitch,” he explained, “so we wanted to play a bit deeper and play on the counter-attack.” The plan wasn’t quite executed to precision in those early stages, he admitted, or to be “quite as deep as we actually were,” but it eventually gave his team more freedom.And that second half was the twist in the tale. It wasn’t as pronounced as it might have been had Marcel Sabitzer and Werner taken golden chances as Leipzig created a flurry at the start of a second period and attacked with gusto. “In the second half,” wrote Christoph Kneer in Süddeutsche Zeitung, “a game developed that represented the current top of the league. The new money from Leipzig fought back and were a bit cheeky, while Bayern’s old money felt challenged and tried to defend their status. Bayern might be light years ahead of Dortmund and Leipzig but games like this show them that they have to stay vigilant and make smart decisions. Simply buying Leipzig’s best won’t work. Leipzig don’t need the money.”Others spoke of a level of genuine competition giving Bayern a greater chance to realise their European dreams, keeping them on their toes unlike in many previous seasons, give or take Dortmund’s near miss last term. “You had the feeling from the 70th minute that nobody wanted to go all in,” Müller suggested. That level of mutual respect offers potential satisfaction going forward that surpasses an afternoon with no goals, and that may well not just blow over.• This should have been the weekend when Dortmund took advantage of the top two playing each other to close the gap, but the ceiling fell in, as it has threatened too ever since the Winterpause ended, with BVB on the wrong end of a seven-goal thriller at Leverkusen. There was much to like about their attacking play – including a stupendous debut goal for Emre Can – but having led 2-1 and 3-2, they conceded twice in 82 seconds in the final 10 minutes to go home with nothing. “We’re conceding too many goals,” lamented sporting director Michael Zorc, “and that’s why we’re not in a better position.” After leaking seven goals in the last two games during a week which also saw BVB exit the Pokal, Zorc isn’t joking.• For Leverkusen, it was a huge boost as they reignited their drive towards the top four. The feeling in Peter Bosz’s dressing room was that Die Werkself leapt an important mental barrier with their comeback – especially after they got past the blow of Kai Havertz hitting a post when clean through at 2-2, only for Raphaël Guerreiro to go back up the other end to give the visitors the lead. “There have been games where we’ve been broken by things like that,” said two-goal Kevin Volland.• Werder Bremen had hoped their stirring Pokal win over Dortmund in the week would be a turning point, but they slipped back into more Weserstadion misery as Union played their way to an excellent 2-0 win on the back of Marius Bülter’s superbly taken brace. Sporting director Frank Baumann again defended Florian Kohfeldt as Werder slipped into the bottom two, and turned his ire on to the players. “We are all responsible,” Baumann said emphatically, “but first and foremost, the team is responsible.”• It was a disappointing day for Union’s neighbours Hertha, again, as Mainz exited with all three points thanks to a Robin Quaison hat-trick. They got all four goals, in fact, with Jeffrey Bruma’s unfortunate own goal briefly giving the home side hope, although the Dutch centre-back was widely praised by his new teammates for a solid debut.• “You have to ask yourself what potion he’s been drinking,” said Sebastian Rode of Timothy Chandler after his US international teammate (previous season-best goalscoring of two) got a brace in Eintracht Frankfurt’s 5-0 Friday night demolition of Augsburg to make it four in five games and continue his side’s excellent start to 2020.• It’s Storm Sabine, rather than Ciara, in Germany but regardless of name, it was enough to put the kibosh on Mönchengladbach v Köln, the Bundesliga’s first postponed match in nearly nine years."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b9638cf026ff2a7b0c17015133ed440ce0baced/0_261_6555_3932/master/6555.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f55457ee87e1c8599261ba970a80ad47","title":"the lost art of having a chat","story":"We are more connected than ever, but we rarely seem to really speak to each other. So,  Rebecca Nicholson decided to tryLike most people I know, my Weekly Screen Report is obscene. Every Sunday, when the notification pops up to tell me the hours I have wasted, mostly texting, I think about all the things I could have done. Finished Middlemarch. Started Middlemarch. But as I have my phone in my hand, I scroll through Instagram instead. I send an article or a joke to a friend, a picture of the dog to the family WhatsApp, catch up on someone else’s night out. Recently, I clocked up – and I’m ashamed as I write this – six hours and 29 minutes of phone usage in a single day. I have had days where I’ve barely been awake that long. Messages is my most used app. I am talking all the time.I know many will welcome this as a kind of freedom. The very idea of talking on the phone invokes horror among those who claim to loathe it. There are thousands of memes explaining the many ways that talking, not texting, is rude, basically criminal. Calling is not time-efficient, ill-suited to the attention economy, where all eyes must be on several screens at once. You can send messages when you’re doing something else – watching The Irishman, or having a bath, or even talking to another person in real life. My dad recently marvelled at me being able to text with two thumbs I marvel at teenagers being able to text while talking to you and not looking at the screen. Once technology gave us the ability to easily screen calls, we ran with it. We can ignore the relative who phones with a list of recent hometown tragedies, the work call we don’t feel like taking, our chattiest of friends who might not let us go for an hour. But what happens if you are that chatty friend?Smart phones are smart enough to tell you that you’re using them too much. The dumb phone is making a comeback. I wondered if it was possible to ride this wave of the digital detox and make a deliberate effort to call instead of text. I wanted to see if it would change my relationships, particularly the ones I had grown lazy about maintaining. The plan was to stay off text and DMs for a solid month. I was fed up of paddling in the shallows. I wanted to swim. If I needed to speak to someone, I’d have to call them.When the writer Elizabeth Wurtzel died in January, a piece she wrote in 2013, about her “one-night stand of a life”, began to circulate again, and it contained one paragraph that hit me particularly hard. “Look at how we live,” she wrote. “We communicate in text messages and emails even those of us old enough to have lived in a world where landline was not a word because it’s all there was have fallen into this lazy substitute for human contact. I have.”Who hasn’t? It should be easier than ever to talk. There are limitless outlets for publishing our thoughts, endless ways to begin a kind of conversation. Voice memos are popular, particularly among young people, but they’re a halfway house, still one-sided. We talk with one eye on efficiency, and it strangles what is so good about it – the spontaneity, the lack of ability to control what happens when two people are rambling on to each other.The psychologist Sherry Turkle has been studying the impact of computers on human psychology since the early 1980s, and in 2015 she published Reclaiming Conversation, in which she referred to “the edited life” that we live now. She spoke to teachers who observed that their students seemed to develop empathetic skills at a slower rate than they would be expected to. “Face-to-face conversation is the most human – and humanising – thing we do,” she wrote. “Fully present to one another, we learn to listen. It’s where we develop the capacity for empathy. It’s where we experience the joy of being heard, of being understood.”Are we losing that joy of being heard? Most offices are quieter places than they have ever been. The open-plan rooms I have worked in over the last decade or so are filled with people wearing headphones, silently tapping away on Gchat or Slack. Even workplaces that should invite conversation are making it easier to avoid talking at all. If you stay in a budget hotel, you can check yourself in and out. If you scan your onions on the supermarket’s self- service checkout, you don’t need to chat about what you’re planning to do with them. When it was common enough to be considered a problem, making a phone call on public transport used to be frowned upon. In the early 00s, Dom Joly built a TV career out of shouting “Hello!” into an oversized mobile in public places. Train carriages are now full of heads bowed, illuminated by blue light. A few years ago the Daily Mash ran a much-shared satirical news story: “A northern man has left a trail of terror across London by attempting to interact socially with everyone he meets.” And even in the north, screens have begun to dominate. Quiet carriages are becoming redundant. We are making ourselves quiet.In 2014, someone set up a family WhatsApp group. Before then, I spoke to my family on the phone all the time. Now, we spend more time in touch with each other than ever before, yet I miss them. It’s a noticeboard, more than a conversation. The person I still speak to most often, and for longest, is my nan, who is 83. She has a mobile, but doesn’t text. The other day I phoned to see how she was, and she told me a long story about how she was never supposed to have the name that she has, but there were 23 pubs in the village she was born in, and her father stopped in at most of them on the way to register her birth. By the time he got to the clerk, he’d forgotten what he’d been told to call her, so he named her after the clerk instead.Verbal conversations are unpredictable and unwieldy in a way that those written down are not, because when we type or tap, we are in control, of our side, at least. This ruthless chat efficiency has excised the flab but, I realise, I love the flab. It’s where the excitement happens. I wanted to revive those conversations with everyone. So in my month of no texts, the WhatsApp group would be the first thing to go. I went to delete the app, pressed my finger on the screen, let it wobble – and then I stopped. There was a video of my niece dancing in front of the TV that I wanted to show my partner and I thought, I can just look at the photos and videos, every now and then. Can’t I?Dr Scott Wark is a research associate at Warwick University who studies culture, technology and social media his PhD thesis was about memes. I called him to see if we are actually moving away from verbal communication. He was in Chile for work, and I couldn’t get through until I emailed to check he was there. But when we finally managed it, he was more optimistic than I had anticipated.He does believe that people are less willing to make calls. “It feels like more of an imposition. If I want to talk to my boss, we schedule a time to make a call. She doesn’t just call.” He points out that social media gives us far more control over a chat. “Even though there’s an idea that everyone’s addicted to social media and constantly checking updates, you can ignore a notification of a message. If I’m chatting to a friend in Australia, and I stop responding to her, I’ve probably just gone to sleep and I’ll pick it up the next day. It’s a continuous conversation that doesn’t interrupt anything and is parallel to whatever else we’re both doing.”Wark disputes the idea that we are becoming more disconnected he says it’s important to make a distinction between disconnection and distraction. If people are becoming more mindful about their phone usage, though, does he think calling might make a comeback?“What people are responding to, with the idea of a ‘digital detox’, is this overload of distractions. That is a huge problem, because there are all these demands on our cognitive capacity and that’s overwhelming, and exhausting. We’re spread thin.”It’s good to know we’re all at it. There is a running joke in my house that if the phone rings after 7pm, without a text to warn that a call is coming, one of us has to say, “Who’s dead now?” It’s not ha-ha funny, but it speaks volumes about what the once humble phone call has come to mean. I thought it was just us, that we’d developed gallows humour after a year of the kind of calls that drain the blood from the body, that in saying the worst out loud, it somehow would ward off more bad news.Wark said that he, too, thinks the worst if he has an unexpected missed call. When I talked to my friends about it, I realised that most people feel the same way. A phone call, out of the blue, is alarming. It’s a harbinger of doom, its ringtone a tiny scythe. The first thing I say when I answer the phone is usually, “What’s wrong?”On the first day of not texting for a month, a friend had some bad news about her health. I wanted to know how she was. But I thought calling would alarm her, because it has become alarming. So I texted, and we had a text chat, while the telly was on. Calling really would have felt like an imposition. I thought I’d call my girlfriend to see what she fancied for dinner, but she was on the tube, and the missed call made her worried that something had happened, so we ended up texting about that, too. My month of not texting was barely even a day old. I failed completely.I am wary of nostalgia. Nobody wants to hear another old person chirping that it was better in their day. When I spoke to Dr Wark, he sounded hopeful about the changing nature of communication. “I’m 31, and I’ve been chatting to people online since I was nine. Talking to people on text is totally naturalised,” he says. “Younger people are more willing to FaceTime one another now, and be watching TV, without really saying anything, just hanging out. There’s a different kind of presence involved.” There’s an argument that all this texting facilitates people meeting up in real life anyway, he says, and research to back that up. We may be more distracted than before, but we are more connected. I ask Wark if he’s a texter or a caller himself. It depends, he says, on the person, and his relationship to them. He calls his mum, he texts his partner. “But personally, I would prefer to meet my friends and just talk to them in a pub.”I could not stop texting, but in the search for a better connection, I did start to call more. I started to phone to cancel plans, and it proved a good litmus test: having to talk about it made me consider whether I genuinely wanted to cancel, or whether I was just being idle. I phoned a friend to say that, honestly, I couldn’t be bothered to travel for 45 minutes to see a film I wasn’t interested in and he said that, honestly, neither could he. We talked for half an hour. My girlfriend is often away for work and it’s become clear that talking on the phone once every couple of days is more substantial and infinitely nicer than constant texting about humdrum stuff.On the Failed Day of No Texts, it became horribly apparent just how compelled I was to share every little detail of what was happening to me. I dropped a plate, and went to tell someone about it, anyone. But to realise I might have to call someone to tell them I was clumsy, which they already knew, made it seem totally redundant. I felt free, somehow, from the obligation to transmit the boring bits of my life as rolling news. By texting less and calling more, I was reminded that people are almost always nicer on the phone than on text. Face to face, they’re even nicer than that. Arguments are resolved more quickly. It is much more difficult to be rude, and we could all use a bit of that.Talking on the phone scares people. Technology has created a new rigidity when it comes to conversation. Calling is usually planned, scheduled, and to call is to really mean it. I still text, all the time. I feel inordinately proud of myself if my screen time drops below three hours a day. But I am calling more, too. I am back in the habit, and for me, it is infinitely more satisfying to have a conversation that is two-sided and flexible and unpredictable. I just send a text to say I’m going to call first."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed0b6a2ceabf0db2aa651a09dc9e293084766255/0_49_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c58f4d48e38e33d2162d2c82fc625242","title":"militia strike gold to cast a shadow over sudans hopes of prosperity","story":"Supported by wealthy foreign backers, a feared paramilitary outfit controls Sudan’s most lucrative industry, complicating the country’s path to democracyOrnate, heavy necklaces gleam on stands above stacks of thick filigree bangles in the windows of Khartoum’s gold market.

The RSF and Hemedti also control at least three other goldmines in other parts of the country, such as South Kordofan, making them a key player in an industry that produces Sudan’s largest export.After the 2019 uprising that overthrew former dictator Omar al-Bashir, Hemedti became part of the transitional military council and the sovereignty council designed to shepherd Sudan to democracy before elections are held in 2022.Despite tentative government efforts to wrestle parts of the gold industry away from Sudan’s security services and back under state or private control, questions remain about whether Sudan can truly transition to democracy while the politically powerful RSF run a parallel economy all of their own.To buy gold from the RSF, where do you go? Abdulay answers without hesitation: “Al Gunade have an office upstairs on the second floor,” he said, gesturing at the ceiling, unapologetically connecting the two organisations.Al Gunade is a mining and trading corporation with deep ties to Hemedti and the RSF. Hemedti’s brother Abdul Rahim Dagalo and his sons are the three owners of Al Gunade, while reported RSF deputy Abdul Rahman al-Bakri is the general manager. According to one of the documents obtained by the anti-corruption NGO Global Witness, Hemedti himself sits on the board of directors. After reviewing evidence of the activities of Al Gunade and the RSF, Global Witness concluded that “the RSF and a connected company have captured a swathe of the country’s gold industry and are likely using it to fund their operations”.The organisation obtained bank data and corporate documents that, they say, show the RSF maintains a bank account in their name at the National Bank of Abu Dhabi (now part of the First Abu Dhabi Bank) in the United Arab Emirates, providing “evidence of the financial autonomy of the RSF”.The relationship between Sudan’s gold, wealthy foreign backers and the RSF militia is concerning observers. Global Witness believes the RSF is “an organisation whose military power and financial independence poses a threat to a peaceful democratic transition in Sudan”.A former camel-trader, Hemedti gained his nickname from the words “my protector”. Before taking part in the coup that toppled him, he was the right-hand man of former dictator Bashir. Hemedti’s RSF grew out of the infamous Janjaweed militia active in Darfur, described as “men with no mercy” and accused of war crimes in a 2015 Human Rights Watch report. HRW found that during the RSF’s campaign in Darfur, the militia were responsible for “egregious abuses against civilians … torture, extrajudicial killings and mass rapes”, as well as “the forced displacement of entire communities the destruction of wells, food stores and other infrastructure necessary for sustaining life in a harsh desert environment”.Last June, the RSF were accused of attacking peaceful protesters to disperse a sit-in in Khartoum calling for a handover to civilian rule. Protestors and observers said the RSF brought the violent methods deployed in Blue Nile, South Kordofan and Darfur to the capital, shooting, stabbing, burning or crushing the skulls of at least 104 civilians, dumping bodies in the Nile, and raping at least 70 men and women.The RSF have consistently denied their involvement. An investigation is ongoing.“Hemedti himself, he understands the process of transition personally,” says Montaser Ibrahim, a former human rights defender who works with the RSF as an “unofficial consultant” on human rights. “This is one of the reasons that led me to deal with him.”His new role has led to criticism from some in human rights activism, but Ibrahim sees the RSF as champions of minority rights, and Hemedti as a challenge against political elites.“Hemedti is a revolutionary,” he says. He dismisses any notion of the RSF’s involvement in violence against protesters, branding accusations of war crimes against Hemedti and the Janjaweed as “propaganda”.Both of Al Gunade’s two offices above Khartoum’s gold market are accessed via a dank staircase where bare wires jostle for space on the filthy walls. Behind the tinted windows of Gunade’s offices, a kilogram gold bar sat on a lacquered wooden desk among office stationary, an ostentatious paperweight that may be the real thing. A man who repeatedly refused to give his name referred all questions about Al Gunade to the central bank, opening the office door to indicate that no further discussion would be accepted.An official from Sudan’s mining ministry, who cannot be named as they are not permitted to brief the media, said extra checks are made to screen out companies associated with the previous regime. The official said that the people behind a company mattered less than whether or not it followed the rules. “Now even if the head of the transitional military council came himself, he has to go with the regulations,” the official said.Mohammed Tabidi, a Khartoum gold trader, says the new gold trading laws are a world away from those under the previous government that forced traders to buy gold from Sudan’s security services, or face arrest. “It’s a free market now,” he says.He is hopeful about the possibilities of free trade amid a powerful black market and spiralling inflation that make daily life a struggle for many. Around the corner from the glistening mall where Tabidi works, men perch on bonnets in a car park, flicking fat wads of Sudanese pounds to signal their trade to drivers passing through. The official rate of 25 Sudanese pounds to the dollar is obsolete compared with the black market rate of 75, maybe even 80.Tabidi says that while gold companies associated with other security services were rendered obsolete by the overhaul, Al Gunade remained.“If export opens for traders, maybe Al Gunade won’t work,” he says. “But if they get a deal with the ministry of finance, they can.” “Hemedti now is vice-president,” he said. “There are some things I can’t talk about.”The RSF said in December that they would hand control of Jebel Amer to the government. Who will reap the profits remains very much in question, given the lack of transparency in Sudan’s gold industry and the difficulties in controlling a supply chain plagued by smuggling and remote sites controlled by militias. There are also few safeguards in place to prevent the RSF and Al Gunade operating illegally.Richard Kent of Global Witness is critical of the RSF’s claim: “We welcome the development because it is potentially very beneficial to the Sudanese people and gold industry, but it’s still unclear exactly what this means,” he says. “Does this mean giving up the Al Gunade concession, reinstating some kind of civil or traditional administration – and if so how would that work, would it be independently appointed by the civilian government?”Political transition offers the tools needed to transform Sudan’s most lucrative industry, cleaning up ministries and the supply chain. But there is a long road ahead before the Sudanese gold industry reaches the standards set by international observer bodies such as the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.Sipping tea outside a French cultural centre where he is taking classes, the RSF’s consultant Ibrahim, an avid reader of Paulo Coelho, says: “The RSF looks like a rebel force. But we need to use them to change the political situation in Sudan.”Ibrahim’s role illustrates the RSF’s hints of reform and change. While Ibrahim is very concerned about being misunderstood, he declines to say whether he is paid, what the job actually entails or whether he believes there are receptive RSF ears for his talk of human rights.“Hemedti believes in the revolution – I know you might be shocked by this,” he says.Ibrahim maintained that the only way forward for Sudan’s transition is for cooperation between civil society and the security sector. He believes he is part of the solution, not the problem. “The security sector in Sudan can’t be cut from the political process,” he says. “This doesn’t contradict the idea of democracy.”Formerly a “a political adviser” to the Sudan Liberation Army, Darfur-based militants, Ibrahim says he became a prisoners’ rights campaigner during Bashir’s regime and his latest role is the apex of a long journey in Sudanese politics. He has created an organisation within the RSF intended to provide training “for NGOs and civil society”. But not the RSF themselves? “No,” he answers dismissively.Members of the Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA), an umbrella trade union association that spearheaded the mass protests leading to Bashir’s overthrow, are confident that Sudan’s path towards democracy isn’t threatened by the RSF or their economic interests, says their spokesman Dr Mohanad Hamid.Hamid is confident that Hemedti and the RSF’s wealth won’t present a problem, provided their business profits are eventually funnelled back into state coffers. “It’s all of four months since the beginning of the transitional period – this process is years,” he says. “If we get all the money back into the ministry of finance at the end of the three years it will be great, but we’re still waiting.”Other SPA representatives, like Dr Batoul Altayeb, are unfazed by the RSF.After protesters staged a mass demonstration against the RSF and the military following the Khartoum massacre, the SPA believe people power can contain the force of the RSF."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b8add50a333db8bcc4f8acc519914824938dfbd/0_400_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=18fd1b08797dbe10711ce9ac5f374ced","title":"how we met i asked him to move to berlin with me after a week","story":"In 2014, Rob left the grey skies of the UK to travel around Canada and the US. “I started volunteering on an avocado and olive farm close to San Diego, where they offered food and accommodation in exchange for work,” he explains. After a short trip to Death Valley, he returned to find a new worker at the farm. “I was telling everyone about my travels and she seemed totally unimpressed,” he remembers. “I thought she was a bit spiky at first, but I later discovered she is just direct and honest.”Mareike insists she found Rob’s stories “very funny” but wanted to know more. “I asked him lots of questions about his trip. He seemed interesting and I wanted to get to know him.”It didn’t take long for Rob to be won over. “By the second day I noticed how at home she seemed outdoors, caring for the rescued animals on the farm. She was so free-spirited and just lived in the moment. She was different from everyone else.”The pair quickly became inseparable. Like the rest of the young volunteers, they were living in shared caravans. “We found a tiny corner of space at the end of a caravan with a kitchen in it,” recalls Mareike. “We asked everyone if they’d be happy for us to stay there together. Luckily they said yes.”Rob says things “moved fast” because Mareike was only staying for a week. “After such a great time together, it hit me like a ton of bricks when I watched her leave,” he says.At the airport Mareike wrote Rob a letter, inviting him to Berlin. “It was a six-page letter about what a great time we’d had,” she says. “I said that if he was serious about a future, we could go to Berlin together. I knew it was a place we could live and work without him needing to speak German.”When the letter arrived, Rob didn’t hesitate. “I knew we’d connected, but when I saw it written down on paper it suddenly felt right.” He emailed her to say he wanted to make the move, and in December, a few days after he returned to the UK, he flew on to Berlin. “I spent the next few weeks getting to know the city and then we went to stay with her family in Hamburg for Christmas.”Mareike had already found work as a graphic designer a few months later Rob got a job as a content manager for an interior design website. They spent the next two years exploring the city, making friends and visiting the local countryside. But they knew city life was not for them in the long term. “We both love being outdoors,” says Mareike. “But the winters are so cold in Germany. We wanted to settle somewhere warmer.”In March 2017, the couple bought an old ambulance to renovate. “We drove it to Barcelona and a friend of ours from California helped us to turn it into a campervan,” says Rob. After several months touring Portugal, they settled at an eco-glamping site in the Algarve. “We volunteered there and built a vegetable garden. It was meant to be a short stop, but we ended up staying for 11 months.” The pair have since moved their van to a vegan community, where they have befriended like-minded people. They both work at a pizza restaurant in the summer, while Mareike also sells fruit and vegetables at a local market.They love nature and have discovered a shared passion for climbing. “In future I’m hoping to run cycling and climbing tours for tourists,” says Rob. “It’s what I’m passionate about.” The couple are working hard to build a home for themselves to continue their sustainable lifestyle. “It’s going to be a little yurt,” says Rob. “We’re making everything by hand.”Mareike loves her partner’s sense of humour. “He always makes me laugh and I know that whatever happens, things will never be boring.” He adores her glass-half-full attitude. “She’s such a happy, positive person. I would never be living this amazing life without her – but it feels so right.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d9917705e51ae3d91bf613685308b5b3c491c13/0_84_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5cb91e5880e8c6d91e19eac31f79178e","title":"i was in despair at world news then i started a local campaign group","story":"I knew I had a problem when I realised that my days were bookended with despair. My blood would be boiling along with the kettle as I listened to the radio while making my first cup of tea of the day, and I would go to bed either seething or feeling forlorn about everything that was going wrong in the world after watching late-night news shows.It had all become too depressing and I felt useless. Environmental apocalypse, alternative facts, taking back control. I didn’t want to hear about it any more, which was a bit of a problem, given I was a reporter. Like a butcher who turns vegan or a podiatrist who goes off feet, it is hard to do your job as a journalist if you can no longer stomach the news.The real problem, I realised after a while, was the feeling of impotence. I could do nothing to change gun laws in the US or to stop a bad Brexit. But, if I thought small, maybe I could try to make things better.I had not long moved out of Manchester to Romiley, on the edge of Stockport. It was my first taste of suburbia since I had left home at 18, drawn to the bright lights of various big cities. I didn’t know anyone there, but I was determined that this time I would get to know my neighbours. I wanted the newsagent to remember my shopping habits and for the people next door to trust me with a key.Early last year I spotted an opportunity when I heard about a group of residents in Levenshulme, a suburb in south Manchester, who had won £2.5m of funding to make their area nicer and safer to walk and ride a bike. I knew that Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, had £160m to spend exclusively on walking and cycling, and I thought my new neighbourhood should have a piece of the pie. I had already helped set up Walk Ride Greater Manchester, a regional lobbying group, but it was time to go hyperlocal.Calling the first meeting of your new group is like organising a party when you don’t know any of the invitees. I was nervous. I booked the tiny back room of the pub and hoped someone other than my husband would turn up. Last March, to my enormous relief, about 30 people crammed in and I thought: OK, this might just work.The premise behind Walk Ride Romiley was pretty simple: bid for some of that £160m and make our area better, particularly for children walking or cycling to school. The learning curve was steep. I entered the baffling world of transport engineering, where lamp-posts are “lamp columns” and everyone insists on calling pavements “footways”. I discovered that a pegasus crossing has an extra set of buttons high up for equestrians, that toucan crossings also allow bicycles across and that the railings people think keep them safe mostly just encourage cars to drive fast. Thinking about dropped kerbs provided welcome respite from writing about flooding or investigating terrible crimes.I had to learn to be diplomatic – not necessarily my strongest suit – when people on the local Facebook site responded to all of our news with: “Use the money to build a bypass instead.” I learned when to let things go: alas, the pavement, sorry, footway trampolines of Romiley did not get past Stockport’s highway department. But when I felt my patience faltering, I thought of Leslie Knope, the indefatigable heroine of Parks and Recreation, determined to build a park in an ugly pit. “What I hear when I’m being yelled at is people caring really loudly at me,” she says after a particularly fractious public meeting.The best thing about campaigning is meeting people. One happy day last June we closed our street for a party, as a way to introduce the idea that roads don’t always have to be for cars. Children whizzed up and down on their bikes the dog show was won by Marjorie, our street’s oldest resident, who, on her Zimmer, expertly guided her pooch through an assault course. In September, we all dressed as Mancunian worker bees when the Tour of Britain passed over a hill on the outskirts of the village. Just before Christmas, the news came: Walk Ride Romiley’s bid had been successful. Stockport council will get £3.9m we will coordinate with the council to spend it locally. In some ways, the hard work starts now. It is one thing dreaming big, another being told: all right then, here’s a huge wodge of public cash. But on days when the news feels too much, it feels good trying to make our little corner of the world better, one toucan crossing at a time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f3e62147700de3af63dfb7d41c02872e8d1d6ca3/0_35_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c12cc0ca816c76fea18770a6aacb5af9","title":"next bbc director general may be based outside london","story":"Job specification says new boss faces ‘unprecedented scrutiny’ of value of servicesThe next BBC director general could be based outside London, as the broadcaster formally launches the search for a leader who can secure the corporation’s future in the face of changing media habits and a battle for funding with Boris Johnson’s government.The official job specification released on Monday makes clear the scale of the challenge facing the inidual who replaces Tony Hall. Issues highlighted included the government’s consultation on licence fee decriminalisation, finding ways to adapt output to meet the changing media habits of younger audiences, and dealing with “unprecedented scrutiny over the breadth, quality, content and value of its services”. Due to the level of stress associated with the job, they must also be able to show “demonstrable resilience”.The job specification, produced by headhunting firm Odgers Berndtson, states that although the role will require significant time in London it “can be based in any of the BBC’s main UK bases”.However, there is little expectation that the successful candidate will break with tradition and choose to base themselves in Glasgow, Salford or Cardiff, given the importance of close negotiations with Downing Street and Whitehall officials in the coming years.“The right candidate is likely to have experience of managing a large, erse organisation, dealing with significant budgets and delivering change on a significant scale,” according to the specification.Potential candidates for the role have already begun lobbying support for the job, which comes with a £450,000-a-year pay packet. Applications need to be filed by the start of March. The appointment will be made by the BBC board, chaired by Sir David Clementi.Some candidates linked to the job have already privately expressed concern about the level of scrutiny that would come with it. The role could become a poisoned chalice, given the challenges facing the corporation and the highly-politicised nature of the job.The government is already considering decriminalising non-payment of the licence fee, while signalling that it expects that the funding model itself may need to be replaced this decade – moves that could leave the next director general overseeing a series of cuts while trying to ensure the BBC remains relevant.Recent director generals have tended to have experience of hands-on programme-making but the board could be tempted to choose a figure with more experience in politics.The specification for the role was posted on the BBC’s jobs website alongside other “jobs in the same category”, including as a property supervisor at London’s Television Centre and an assistant principal timpani player for the BBC Philharmonic in Salford, inadvertently highlighting the breadth of the corporation’s output."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a09db2cbf03d95d6a929cc388218916aee9ec5ab/77_320_3303_1982/master/3303.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=44f99fc4e38efbf06a40be9106f5f2b2","title":"top gear is switching to bbc1 in attempt to safeguard licence fee","story":"‘The time is right to move the world’s best motor show to the nation’s most popular channel’ Veteran car show Top Gear is switching to BBC1 after 43 years on BBC2 as part of the corporation’s drive to attract younger viewers and safeguard the future of the licence fee. Following the success of new presenting line-up Freddie Flintoff, Paddy McGuinness and Chris Harris, Top Gear is to follow in the footsteps of other hit shows including Line of Duty, Peaky Blinders and Great British Bake Off and make the transition from BBC2 to its bigger stablemate BBC1. The BBC hopes it will reach an even wider audience than the latest series, which has hit a four-year high of 4.3million viewers thanks to the new line-up’s chemistry and stunts, such as Flintoff’s daredevil car bungee jump in a Rover  off a 500-foot dam.The move to BBC1 marks a turnaround in the show’s fortunes, which took a dip after Jeremy Clarkson, James May and Richard Hammond left in 2015 when Clarkson was sacked for punching a producer.Their replacements, Chris Evans and Matt Le Blanc, failed to ignite the same reaction with the motoring show’s fans and it hit the ratings buffers, until the new trio of Harris, Flintoff and McGuinness were hired last year. Their bid to combine entertaining banter with what they called “emotional depth” made Top Gear BBC2’s highest-rated show of last year and put it among the top four shows for 16-34-year-olds during each week of its run. It is not known whether the show will move from its regular Sunday evening time slot.Attracting younger audiences is crucial for the BBC at the moment as it faces a battle with the government over the future of its funding in the face of rivals such as streaming giants Netflix and Amazon. Culture secretary, Nicky Morgan, suggested the television licence could be abolished from 2027 and has launched a consultation on whether to decriminalise non-payment of the licence fee.The corporation is also facing cuts due to taking on free licence fees for over-75s so the future of Top Gear is vital as it is made by the BBC’s commercial wing BBC Studios and sold to over 100 countries around the world including the US and Australia.Explaining the move to BBC1, director of BBC content Charlotte Moore said : “The time is right to move the world’s best motor show to the nation’s most popular channel and bring it to an even broader audience on BBC1. Freddie, Paddy and Chris have revitalised the hit series with their escapades and banter and we couldn’t have asked for a better response to their series so far and the impact it’s had with young audiences.”Losing Top Gear will be a blow for BBC2, which has aired the show since it began over four decades ago.However BBC2 controller Patrick Holland said rejuvenating Top Gear was “one of my biggest priorities” and it was an “utter joy” to see the new presenters do well.“From Peaky Blinders to Line of Duty and now Top Gear, BBC2 is a place where unique shows can evolve and thrive before moving to even broader audiences on BBC1, it’s a vital part of the BBC portfolio.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d634904b11ef2a24f3d93c27526350dcafba290b/0_0_1980_1188/master/1980.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ce414ea51222c8f3b7e3ee216197ebd6","title":"home ownership ons rent","story":"Adults in their mid-30s to mid-40s are three times more likely to rent than 20 years agoHome ownership has collapsed for prime working age adults, according to official figures that show those in their mid-30s to mid-40s are three times more likely to rent than 20 years ago.In a reflection of surging house prices and a lost decade for wage growth since the financial crisis, the Office for National Statistics found that a third of 35- to 44-year-olds in England were renting from a private landlord in 2017, compared with fewer than one in 10 in 1997.The government statistics agency said home ownership had become increasingly concentrated among people over the age of 65. Almost three-quarters of adults in the generation that includes baby boomers born after the second world war own their own homes outright, up from just over half in 1993.Against a backdrop of rising generational isions in modern Britain, the ONS linked Margaret Thatcher’s flagship right to buy policy with the boom in home ownership among older Britons, as well as a slump in social housing across the country.The findings from the ONS will come with potentially damaging implications for living standards for the current generation of adults under the age of 65, who are poised for a retirement in worse financial health than their parents.According to research from the insurer Royal London, someone who owns their home outright could expect to maintain their living standards on a pension pot of about £260,000, while someone who rents privately would need almost double this, at about £445,000.The ONS said that if the declining home ownership trend continued for the current generation of 35- to 44-year-olds, older people in future would be more likely to live in private rented accommodation than today.Nathan Long, a senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, the investments platform, said problems were being stored up for those in their 40s and early 50s.“Not only were they born too late to benefit from final salary pensions, they were born too early to benefit from a lifetime of automatic pension saving and many won’t be able to call on their house if times get tough,” he added."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f41cda91381e43189939a4ed26798c403e30f0f/0_0_6016_3610/master/6016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b4f7efa25ad8666b23747e2442cdbd0e","title":"bob marley 75th birthday how ghetto reggae star rebranded jamaica","story":"Seeing fans and family gather in Kingston to celebrate the late musician’s 75th birthday, music writer Vivien Goldman reflects on his indelible legacyAt 7am on 6 February, on what would have been Bob Marley’s 75th birthday, the abeng conch shell blows at his old home at uptown Kingston’s 56 Hope Road – now the Bob Marley museum – as it did in the days of the long-gone indigenous Taino tribe, and later as a call to slave uprisings on the plantation.Today, the museum is the Jamaican capital’s hottest tourist ticket, drawing more than 60,000 visitors a year. But in the turbulent 1970s, when the downtown area was torn between superpower ideologies and their local paymasters, it was audacious of Marley to insert his ragtag “ghetto star” Rasta crew into Hope Road – also home to Jamaica’s prime minister – a process he described to me in the 1970s as “bringing the ghetto uptown”. He hoped to make a safe space for the gangs of youth who were controlled on their home turf by opposing political forces: it worked, at least until gunmen tried to kill him there in 1976. It worked again when he triumphantly returned later in the decade to build a studio.Witnessing police politely dealing with the crowd gathered for the Marley 75 celebration offered a strange disconnect: back then, their presence outside the gates would have suggested a raid. These are different times, as evidenced by the MC who announces: “Big up to all the Airbnb-ers in Trench Town!” – the dangerous downtown “ghetto” of Marley’s teenage years. His message and mystique have mobilised a peaceful army of international followers, such as those holidaymakers venturing where few wealthy Kingstonians go. The music at Hope Road shows how Marley helped lay the foundation for the island’s enduring music industry, as a new generation of voices such as Jesse Royal, Kelissa and Kim Nain perform alongside Bob’s original bred’ren including Bongo Herman, Marcia Griffiths and Toots of the Maytals. Alone with a guitar, Toots explains that “Bob Marley was my friend” and had liked 54-46 Was My Number, the 1960s gem that thrills the crowd.The celebration features a strong focus on family. Rita Marley, Bob’s widow, puts in a regal appearance from her wheelchair during the daytime children’s event, as pupils from St Andrew prep school sing and dance to Redemption Song, while the night’s show was headlined by the Marley Brothers, Julian and Ky-Mani, and dynamically led by Damian Marley, who crowned the night with a deft mix of authority and playfulness.Marley’s estate is one of music’s biggest earners: the event was supported and organised by the Bob Marley Foundation, with similar festivities taking place in London, Lagos, Los Angeles, Singapore, Paris, Hawaii and New Zealand. What has made Bob Marley’s music settle so bone-deep worldwide? Following Marley’s powerful template, there can be a tendency for artists to become didactic, plodding in their litany of social woes. That was never Marley’s way. He was proud of the chop of his rhythm guitar, but it was his skill at sugarcoating the toughest frontline communiques in sticky melodies that is arguably his creative essence.As Marley once explained to me, he wanted to make his music so simple that a child could sing it. Babies famously respond to the directness of his music, and reggae’s heartbeat has been credited with healing properties: Marissa “Mar” Lelogeais, an American living with cerebral palsy and reduced vision, sang about how Marley’s music had freed her to accept her body on the song Embrace It.Above all, Marley effected a triumphant cultural flip, one founded on political truth but also will and vision. At Hope Road, Brother Westie, a Nyabinghi (Rasta) priest clad in dramatic white robes, intones prayers in Amharic. When he invokes Igziabeher, a name for the Rasta deity Jah Rastafari, he demonstrates that change in action: when Marley was the age of the attentive, uniformed school children sat before Brother Westie, he never learned the history of his own island or people. The postwar Wailers generation came up with a British colonial education that taught them more about the Battle of Hastings in 1066 than pan-African history. Marley was a leader among Rasta artists who painstakingly researched and pieced together their concealed past and communicated it in music so effectively that it became the new orthodoxy – certainly where the island’s official cultural representation is concerned. Once reviled as “dutty Rastas”, they have become crucial to the island’s brand.Though the Marley machine has made efforts to defang the lion by focusing on his more feelgood crowdpleasers – the One Love effect – his commitment to the sufferer, and unflinching confrontation of unpalatable truths as he saw them, is ever more necessary: a cause for continued celebrations like these in Kingston.

But they started out as inseparable friends at the same school in north London. Now their focus is on what comes next for the party. Plus: Matthew Taylor on the growing prevalence of climate anxiety Peter Mandelson rose through Labour’s ranks to become a key architect of the party’s 1997 landslide election win with Tony Blair. Steve Howell has spent his life in the party and rose to become a key strategist in Jeremy Corbyn’s 2017 election campaign, which stripped the Conservatives of their majority. Both men sit on different sides of an ideological ide within the party – but it wasn’t always this way. The pair met at school in Hendon, north London, and became inseparable friends.  The two men join Anushka Asthana to look back at Labour’s recent past and the decisions both made as key advisers to the leader of the day. And they discuss how their experiences inform their decisions on who to back in the current leadership contest.

Most of the problems are too technical for a non-specialist audience but the column always includes a quickie, which he calls the Speed Department. Here are four word-based conundrums I’ve selected from the last decade.1. What is the numerically largest Roman numeral that is a normal English word?2. How do you prove literally that 11 + 2  12 + 1?3. The 9-letter word SPLATTERS has an intriguing property. You can remove a single letter to make an 8-letter word, without rearranging the other letters. You can remove another letter to make a 7-letter word, and then a 6-letter word, and so on down to a single-letter word. At no stage is the order of the letters rearranged.Find two other 9-letter words that share the same property. As a (kosher) hint, the words pig and sin appear as the 3-letter words. (Remember: at no stage do you ever change the order of the letters.)4. What is special about 8,549,176,320?I’ll be back at 5pm with the answers. Meanwhile, NO SPOILERS!

There was a point in the middle of last year where I was four ranking points behind Brooks, which is a big gap.“So it wasn’t on the radar when I was flying back from Ireland after the Open but then, once I’d won the Tour Championship and then won again in China, I kind of saw that gap closing. Then it sort of became, ‘Huh, I’m actually close.’ We all have egos out here and it would be great to get back there.”Spain’s Jon Rahm is also within touching distance of top spot after two wins, two runners-up finishes and two other top-10s in his past six events.LPGA tournaments in Thailand and Singapore have been cancelled because of concerns over the spread of the coronavirus.

But why? Fiona Cowood investigates ...First love, first kiss, first job, first car … it’s easy to transport yourself back to those heady experiences, even though decades may have passed since they happened. Contrast that with a simple question about what you did last Wednesday … can you honestly remember?Meik Wiking runs the world’s only Happiness Research Institute in Denmark, and in his latest book, the Art of Making Memories, explores the hold that first experiences have over us.“First experiences stick better to our memories,” he says. “Several studies show that we are better at remembering the novel and the new, the extraordinary days when we did something different.” This helps to explain why, as we get older, we might have dozens of treasured memories from our youth while our present flashes by with perhaps only a house move and a holiday memory-banked for safekeeping. Wiking refers to this phenomenon as the “reminiscence bump”, AKA “the good old days” – that period from 15-30 that is the source of so many of the stories we tell about ourselves.“Firsts in my 40s are rarer than when I was 15,” says Wiking, “but that’s why I seek them out now. First experiences are able to stretch the flow of time – they can help stop the feeling that the years are going by quicker and quicker.”“When we’re out of our comfort zone, we make sure we record every aspect of the experience in case we need to retrieve the memory later on,” he says. “For example, we might not know if the situation is safe or dangerous so we open up our senses to pick up all the signs and signals.”First experiences also serve as building blocks, helping us to construct a solid sense of who we are in the world. Any parent will know how much children love being told the stories of their first steps, or their first trip to the swimming pool. Those moments are insights into identity-building, as kids make sense of how they got to where they are today. As we get older, these “firsts” become bookmarks that distinguish between chapters – who you were before a major breakup, versus who you became, for example.“Each of us has an ancient and universal human need to be seen and to be remembered,” says Wiking, “and firsts, and changes of scene, play an important role in organising autobiographical memory.”To avoid the mid-years of your life becoming a depressing blur of chores, childcare and days spent at the same desk, Wiking advocates opening yourself up to new experiences to ensure a steady imprint of new, vivid memories. Memorable grownup firsts can come in all shapes and sizes – from big, bucket-list adventures in far-flung places to practical, domestic endeavours, like hosting your first Christmas or driving your first electric car.And making these little adjustments not only enriches your own life but will positively affect others too, says Wiking. “One of my biggest ‘a-ha’ moments in writing the book was going from a perception that memory is something random that we don’t control to realising that my memory – and that of my friends and family – is actually something I can influence. Realising I can influence what my friends remember in 10 years’ time is very empowering. It makes you want to do new things – and share those experiences with others.”You’ll always remember your first EVUnlock the thrill of a game-changing first for yourself with the New Renault ZOE – the ideal first electric car.

We’ve taken five of the most common EV questions to the experts to help you make an informed decision ...Are electric cars cheaper and easier to maintain than internal combustion engine (ICE) cars?In short, yes. An electric motor is much more simple than an ICE, with fewer moving parts. As a result, the battery pack and motor need less maintenance than the equivalent parts in an ICE vehicle.“There’s no oil or oil filter to change, no engine to maintain and fewer parts to wear out, so an EV will be cheaper to service,” explains Emily Rice, product manager at Renault Electric Vehicles. “Some drivers also find they drive more economically as the instrument panel indicates how you are driving and shows you, in real time, the energy being consumed by the battery. This can mean drivers are lighter on the accelerator and brakes, therefore extending the life of brakes and tyres too.”Renault has also adopted an energy recovery braking system: every time the vehicle slows down, part of its kinetic energy is converted into electricity. The battery is recharged when the driver lifts the foot off the accelerator or slightly engages the brake. This helps preserve or even increase your driving range, and of course save you electricity charges.How far can electric cars go?This varies from electric car to electric car, but almost all will do more than 100 miles on a full charge, with most newer models going past 200 miles.Even EVs with smaller battery capacities can be charged quickly, though. Using a rapid charger, just 20-30 minutes of charging will give more than enough juice to complete most everyday journeys.Do electric cars pay road tax?Yes and no … depending on the age and price.All EVs registered prior to April 2017 pay zero vehicle excise duty (VED, often called “road tax”), as it’s all based on tailpipe emissions – and as EVs generate 0 gkm of CO2, they’re exempt.However, the rules around VED changed in April 2017, and a premium tax was introduced. Now, any car over £40,000 when new has to pay an annual supplement (£310-320 a year depending on the model year of the vehicle) for the first five years, regardless of its emissions.Fortunately, it’s possible to bag a brand new EV for far less than the £40,000 threshold. For instance, New Renault ZOEs start at £25,670 – no VED is just one of the reasons it’s the ideal first electric car.Are electric cars automatic?Not exactly. Like automatic cars, electric cars don’t have a clutch or gear stick, but that’s where the comparison stops. Unlike automatic cars, electric cars don’t have a gearbox at all, which results in a smoother ride and nippy acceleration.Confused? Rice explains: “ICE cars need gears as they can only generate powertorque in a narrow band of engine speeds and the gears help keep the engine within those bands. In an electric car, maximum torque is available instantly and at low speeds so there is no need to have multiple gears.”Can I charge my electric car at home?Not only can you charge your electric car at home, it’s the preferred option for most EV owners.When it comes to charging at home, you have two options. By far the most efficient is using a dedicated home-charging point – something Renault provides for free with every retail purchase** of the New Renault ZOE. These are wall-mounted, weather-proof units that you connect to your car to using a dedicated charging cable. It’s best to charge your car at night – when electricity rates are often cheaper – and then top up in smaller bursts throughout the day, if needed.The second home-charging option is to charge your car using a normal three-pin socket. This is a great solution if you’re away from home and need a top-up, but shouldn’t be your only, or primary, charging solution. Charging this way is much slower than using a wall-mounted unit, and gives eight miles of range an hour of charging compared with a 7kW home charger that will give around 30 miles of range an hour, according to WLTP testing*. You can also often top up for free on public networks when you are out and about – look for charging points at supermarkets and public car parks. Rapid DC charging at 50kW available on the New Renault ZOE will give an estimated 90 miles driving range in 30 minutes.Curious to learn more about EVs?

Motoring journalist Maria McCarthy explains why they’re more than just a passing trendThere’s no doubt that this acceleration is in part being driven by increased awareness and fears about the climate crisis. But while we know that EVs are greener than traditional internal combustion engine cars, making the transition from the familiarity of fossil fuel to embracing electric can feel daunting, no matter how urgently you feel the climate emergency. Will vast amounts of number-crunching and spreadsheets be required to work out if an electric car will fit your lifestyle? Might you have to draw on vague memories of what Kws are from long-ago physics lessons? Thankfully, that won’t be necessary.“People often worry that deciding to move over to an electric car will be a chore and involve a lot of research,” says Emily Rice, product manager at Renault Electric Vehicles. “But once they get started, they discover there’s lots of independent, accessible information out there, and the process can be very straightforward.”When electric cars first came on to the market, there was a lot of hand-wringing about “range anxiety” – the fear of the battery running out before you can get to a charging point. But it turns out that unless you embark on epic road trips on a regular basis, range anxiety isn’t a cause for concern. “The New Renault ZOE has a range of up to 245 miles according to WLTP testing*,” explains Rice. “And that’s plenty for most of us.”According to the Department of Transport, the average annual mileage for private cars in 2018 was 7,400 – this works out at just over 20 miles a day, so the New Renault ZOE will easily meet most people’s day-to-day needs.And when you do need to charge your battery, it’s as easy as charging your smartphone. Most electric car drivers charge at home – something made even easier by Renault, which provides a free home charge point for new retail customers purchasing a New Renault ZOE**. Once you set off with a full battery, you rarely need to top up on regular journeys. And if you do run out of juice on the go, there’s no need to panic – the UK now has more EV charging points than petrol stations (almost 10,000 locations now offer public charging points, according to Zap-Map).And best of all, the mileage costs are significantly cheaper. Costs will vary depending on your electricity tariff but, according to the Energy Saving Trust, charging an electric vehicle at home will cost on average 4-6p per mile, and 8-10p if using a public charging point. This compares with 13-16p for a petrol or diesel car.But choosing a car isn’t just about drawing up budgets – it’s about how it feels. And if you’ve never driven an electric car before then it’s time to get behind the wheel. “I find electric cars provide a versatile, relaxing drive,” says Thomas Clifton, electrification and new mobility manager at Renault. “As there’s no gear changes, they’re ideal for navigating city traffic. Then out of town, they handle just as well as a petrol or diesel car on motorways and rural roads. Forget the myth that electric cars are like driving a milk float – they give a smooth, powerful drive with great acceleration.”“If you’re curious about electric cars, then do take one for a test drive,” suggests Rice. “And don’t just try it out in town – take the New Renault ZOE out on a motorway or dual carriageway and let it show you what it can do. I would recommend asking to borrow it over night if you can and see how easily it could fit into your lifestyle.”It’s easy to put off making the switch to electric car ownership until some vague, undefined point in the future – but the truth is, there’s really no need to. If you have any reservations about the costs, charging options or drive, a little research and a test drive will quickly allay your fears. Once motorists take the plunge, they quickly become “electrical evangelists” with zero interest revisiting the dark days of internal combustion engine ownership. The only question is: when will you join them and start reaping the benefits of greener motoring?Curious to learn more about EVs?

You swap gilded spires, cobbled backstreets and tourists for peaceful tree-lined avenues and a masterclass in socialist realism. The Nowa Huta museum in the monumental former theatre documents the area’s short, action-packed history: “a job for everyone” in 1954 through the rise of Solidarity in the Lenin steelworks to the downfall of communism. That wasn’t in the Soviet master plan, but thanks for the parks and affordable housing!Martin CharlesworthThe district of Śródmieście, or downtown, is a swath of land above Wrocław’s old town. To its east are the brutalist grandeur of Wrocławski Manhattan, the smattering of bars and restaurants around the university buildings (my favourite restaurant, once you get past the decor, is Warzywniak, which caters for vegans) and the culture centre at the Unesco heritage-listed Centennial Hall, surrounded by one of the finest urban green spaces in Poland. But what really makes the area a cut above the bars and architecture elsewhere in the city (and Świdnickie is a really honourable mention for its nightlife) are the cycle paths along the River Oder, wonderful in the summer.Emily MooreAs a student I lived near Wilhelminapark in the Dutch city of Utrecht. It is a beautifully green area with gorgeous villas as well as typically Dutch narrow houses. It continues to be one of my favourite neighbourhoods in Europe: it’s very peaceful and tourists don’t seem to have discovered it yet. It is named after its large park, where my friends and I would go for picnics in summer, and adjacent are a number of tasteful cafes and restaurants, among them the lovely Parkcafé Buiten. Close by, you will also find the Rietveld Schröder House (€18€9.50 in advance), an extraordinary example of De Stijl architecture and a Unesco world heritage site.Paula KaandersEvery week we ask our readers for recommendations from their travels.

A trip here will return you to an authentically Madrileño experience and the Madrid of yesteryear. Stepping out of  Portazgo, you’ll come straight on to the bar-lined Avenida de la Albufera in front of the stadium of football team Rayo Vallecano, which lends a lively atmosphere to the local tapas joints. Behind the main street there’s a good park known as Las Siete Tetas (Park of the Seven Tits) for its seven hills. Take a winding climb up to one of the peaks and be rewarded with the best vistas in Madrid and sunset over the city centre.ClaireUnlike some of its flashy neighbours, Moabit in Berlin is still a few years off full gentrification so there’s still a nice mix of old family businesses (mainly around Turmstrasse) alongside the hip street food and craft breweries you find near the beautifully restored covered market of Arminius Markthalle. Lots of the old industrial buildings have had makeovers – the train depot was transformed into a great art space and an old meat factory became the Kulturfabrik, which hosts theatre, festivals and more. Fritz Schloss Park, in postwar years a dumping ground for bombing debris, offers plenty of green space alongside mini-golf, climbing walls and a spa. And adjacent is the Poststadion, which hosted football in the 1936 Olympic Games, where Germany was defeated by Norway in a match witnessed by Nazi leaders who were not best-pleased.Paul After the hustle and bustle of the old port of Marseille, head up the steep steps towards the peaceful Panier district of leafy squares and cobbled streets. Independent shops and restaurants reflect the city’s multicultural roots while cool cafes host theatre and live music, buzzing with an energising arty vibe at night. Old houses in pastel shades with fragrant flower baskets create an ambience of a Provençal village in the heart of a busy city. You almost expect to see the ghosts of Monet and Renoir setting up canvas and easel outside. Try fresh fish dishes at Le Refuge (22 rue du Refuge) from €12, menu chalked on a blackboard as you enter.Bill CoxA charming, working fishing port on a peninsula north-east of Dublin, Howth is easily accessible from the city centre by taking the frequent Dart train from Connolly station (30 minute-ride). You can stroll along the harbour and the pretty streets lined with pubs and restaurants all serving the freshest of the local catch, or rummage through the market for a range of artisanal goods and crafts. If you really want to blow the cobwebs away, spend an hour or two walking on Howth Head, a green and wild outcrop with stunning views and salty air, and watch the seabirds and sailing boats.BerniI lived in Vienna’s 9th district for two years, and it was a great halfway house between the city centre and the hills. But my favourite was the 19th, Döbling, with charming wine villages surrounded by vines where scenic hiking routes show off the best views over the city. Among lots of fabulous heuriger (wine taverns) where you can sit in the vineyard garden looking over vines quaffing a carafe or two, our favourite was Weinhof Zimmerman, for its lovely garden full of apple trees and its fine food. Another summer favourite was the Döblinger Freibad, an appealing open- air pool complex with huge lawns, free sunbeds and dappled shade.MarthaThe charming streets of Józsefváros are the veins pumping lifeblood into Budapest’s District Eight. An area once renowned for its chaotic energy and seen as somewhat dangerous has become one of the best areas to enjoy a drink, food or even just a leisurely stroll. Head over to Mikszáth Kalman Ter (named after revered novelist Mikszáth Kalman) for a bite to eat at fabulously decorated Zappa cafe or a coffee over at airy Lumen with its plethora of indoor plants. A short stroll away lies the baroque revivalist Szabo Ervin library, once the private home of aristocrats, whose gorgeous interiors certainly have a wow factor. Grab some traditional lunch at family-run Öcsi Étkezde and peruse the stunning art nouveau Iparművészeti Museum, among the oldest applied arts institutions in the world, with interiors inspired by Hindu, Mogul and Islamic design. AmyMidway between central Athens and the coast is the lush family-friendly neighbourhood of Nea Smyrni (tram from Syntagma to Aghia Fotinis, or an easy 25-minute walk). Its many squares are host to an interesting history: the neighbourhood gained its name from the former Greek city of Smyrna, now Izmir, from where refugees settled the area in the 1920s. Car-free Nea Smyrni Square is at the neighbourhood’s heart and is spectacular, with fountains, shops, restaurants, trendy cafes and bars to suit all ages, trends and budgets. With a plethora of outdoor entertainment during the summer, it’s a real find not on the typical tourist route. Venture beyond the square and you’ll find Nea Smyrni Alsos park, a large green oasis with aleppo pines, cypress and stone pines and good for strolling. It also has a jogging track, an outdoor gym and a cafe. DavidLooking for a holiday with a difference?

In fact, it’s like rearranging deckchairs on the TitanicTop Gear is moving to BBC One. For the first time in almost half a century, it has been announced that the motoring show is going the way of The Apprentice and the Great British Bake Off, switching to the country’s biggest television channel in order to turbo charge its success.And, like it or not, it is a success. Although it might have seemed like a dead duck in the dark distant post-punch Chris Evans days, Top Gear has spent the last few years focusing on its fundamentals and building a better version of itself. Top Gear in 2020 is completely rejuvenated. The new presenting team have found their feet. Knackered old format points have been jettisoned. And, most impressively of all, people are watching again. Ratings have hit a four-year high of 4.3 million. It’s easily the most watched show on BBC Two at the moment. As comebacks go, it’s incredible.Take Sunday’s episode, for example. It consisted of just two things a long challenge-style travelogue around the mountains of Peru and a 10-minute review of an electric car. That’s it. No tortuous Star in a Reasonably Priced Car. No lumbering witless ‘news’ segment that only exists so the hosts can nudge the needle on uncomfortable xenophobia. Just a long, charming, beautiful film about a distant country, and a serious review to keep the car nerds happy.And, although it began as something of an arranged marriage, the hosts have struck upon their all-important chemistry. Paddy McGuinness is the enthusiastic dimwit, Freddie Flintoff is the amiable dimwit and Chris Harris is the angry little ball of stress holding it all together. Back in its juggernaut days, Top Gear found success by simplifying its hosts into recognisable personas Hamster, Captain Slow and a sort of walking manifestation of gout. The new hosts have already cracked this, and that’s most of the battle won. Whichever way you look at it, Top Gear’s turnaround has been startling.But that doesn’t necessarily mean it deserves to be on BBC One. Ostensibly, the move has been designed to ‘attract younger viewers and safeguard the future of the licence fee’. But that doesn’t make sense. From a terrestrial viewpoint, it seems shortsighted so many shows have made the leap from BBC Two to BBC One that it has robbed the former of its identity. It has become a feeder channel for its big brother, and now you’d be hard pushed to find anyone who could tell you what BBC Two is actually for any more.Besides, young people don’t care what channel a show is on. Young people don’t consume television like that. I’m not especially young, but I can’t remember the last time I sat down to watch Top Gear at the allotted time on a terrestrial channel. It might have been seven or eight years ago. Instead, like everyone else, I tend to watch it on iPlayer where channel identities are blurred into a big homogenous ‘BBC’. If the BBC wants to attract younger viewers, why move Top Gear around in a way that makes zero difference to how young people watch it? It feels like rearranging deckchairs on the Titanic.This is not the answer to the BBC’s problems. Especially with Top Gear a show that even in its modern incarnation is almost two decades old. To attract young audiences, you have to reflect what young audiences want, not buff 20-year-old shows to a high sheen. Top Gear hasn’t been in such good shape for years, but there’s no avoiding the fact that it’s still Top Gear. It’s still a mouldy old car show. Perhaps the real way to get new viewers onboard is to ditch it completely and start again from scratch."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c6f7dd524599d6cc1e0ed6a98494815e2397a7ec/106_0_3750_2250/master/3750.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2c808d2903dc5c9d34abf14663b6815d","title":"pizza sushi ben jerrys what 2020 democrats are feeding their staffers","story":"What the presidential hopefuls and their teams are eating on the campaign trail – and what it tells us about themStaying competitive in this feat of endurance requires fueling your foot soldiers. So what are the campaigns feeding their staff and what, if anything, does it tell us about them?Campaigns are required to submit detailed records of their spending to the Federal Election Commission (FEC) each quarter, showing how much money they raised from donors – and what they spent it on. We used those filings to analyze the remaining candidates’ expenditures on all things edible – from Starbucks coffee runs and airplane snacks to and steakhouse dinners and pizza pies. This analysis covers spending from each campaign’s launch through 31 December 2019.A caveat: each campaign uses slightly different categorizations in its FEC filings. We excluded expenditures if they included event space rentals or appeared to refer to catering for fundraising events. This decision primarily affected the analyses for the Amy Klobuchar, Pete Buttigieg, Joe Biden and Andrew Yang campaigns, since Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Tom Steyer and Michael Bloomberg are not holding high-dollar fundraisers.Overall, we examined $1.9m in spending on food and beverages by these eight campaigns. Here’s what we found.About $1m of that spending went to catering companies or restaurants that we characterized as generally American. Of the other $900,000, Mexican food was the top choice. Democratic campaigns spent $92,120 at Mexican restaurants throughout 2019, led by the Warren campaign, which accounted for more than a third of that total.Soul food and barbecue were popular choices in South Carolina, another state with an early primary. Andrew Yang, whose parents emigrated to the US from Taiwan, spent the most on Chinese food, followed by Tom Steyer, Warren, Biden and Sanders. Yang’s campaign was also the only one to show expenditures from Korean and Creole restaurants.The Warren and Sanders campaigns also demonstrated notable ersity in their choices. Sanders staffers shelled out for Thai, Jamaican and Middle Eastern food. Warren workers dined on Filipino, vegan, Thai and Indian food.Meanwhile, Bloomberg’s campaign dominated the spending on Japanese food, shelling out $16,877 at a single sushi restaurant in the six weeks after he launched his run in late November. That restaurant, Hanabi Japanese Cuisine, is just a few blocks away from the Bloomberg Philanthropies offices, which are housed in a 19th-century Italianate mansion on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. (The Bloomberg campaign is paying rent to the Bloomberg Philanthropies building, according to the filings.)Lest you think the campaign blew all that money in one sitting, Hanabi is no Nobu. The storefront restaurant offers specialty rolls at prices ranging from just $7 to $13.Bloomberg staffers might have a taste for mid-range sushi, but his campaign is not exactly pinching pennies when it comes to meals. Despite only having launched in late November, the campaign has already spent about $310,000 on food. Most of that went to office catering services, but one notable line item was more than $10,000 to Air Culinaire, an in-flight catering service for private jets. Options for travelers out of New York range from a seared wagyu steak with foie gras, morels and potato hash to sous-vide black chicken thighs with green onion salad, beetroot puree, jasmine tea-infused rice and sesame dressing. Each menu also features extensive options from Petrossian Caviar, Air Culinaire’s “caviar partner”.The other self-funding billionaire in the race, Steyer, spent more than half a million dollars on food and beverages. Much of that spending went to catering and restaurants, but there were also some notable expenditures:For those campaign workers who don’t work for billionaires, however, meals of pizza, sandwiches and bar food were much more common.The Sanders campaign spent the most on pizza – about $30,000 – while Domino’s racked up the most orders of any pizzeria.America’s most disappointing sandwich chain,Panera Bread, meanwhile, accounted for $50,450 in spending across all the campaigns.Campaign staff typically work exceptionally long hours, and you can’t make it through the day without a strong breakfast. The most popular breakfast choice was Dunkin’ Donuts, followed by a number of bagel shops and Starbucks.The Buttigieg campaign also spent $2,160 at a specialty croissant bakery in northern California.As for afters, two campaigns dominated the dessert menu – Klobuchar’s and Sanders’. The Minnesota senator spent more than $10,000 at the Cookie Cart, a Minneapolis not-for-profit bakery that provides job training for teenagers.Meanwhile, Sanders’ campaign has spent $13,837 on Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s ice cream. He is from Vermont, after all."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5626b97c918ffd6548a75688bc2fc8952beebea/0_247_3210_1927/master/3210.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1bb9d7c200a052675a231817d45a8014","title":"sinn fein to try to form ruling coalition after irish election success","story":"Party disrupts Ireland’s centrist tradition by taking almost a quarter of votesSinn Féin will try to form a government in Ireland after apparently winning more votes than any other party in Saturday’s general election – a historic result that upended the political system.The party leader, Mary Lou McDonald, told cheering supporters on Sunday that a “revolution” had occurred and she would try to form a ruling coalition with other parties. “This is no longer a two-party system,” she said.Sinn Féin, once a pariah for its IRA links, won almost a quarter of first-preference votes, possibly pipping Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, two centrist rivals that have taken turns ruling Ireland for a century.It rode a wave of anger over homelessness, soaring rents and hospital waiting lists as well as disillusionment with the traditional political duopoly.McDonald, speaking over rapturous, deafening chants at a Dublin count centre, said she had spoken to the Greens and small leftwing parties in hope of forming a coalition without Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil – an unlikely scenario. She did not rule out a deal with either Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil.Parliamentary arithmetic may exclude Sinn Féin from power, however. Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael ran more candidates and are expected to each win more seats than Sinn Féin in the 160-seat Dáil Éireann, the Irish parliament’s lower chamber, leaving unclear which parties – if any – will be able to form a viable coalition. Deadlock could lead to another election.Its name can be translated as family or tribe of the Irish. A centre-right party with a socially progressive tilt. In office since 2011, first led by Enda Kenny, then\u0026nbspLeo Varadkar, with support from smaller coalition partners. Traces roots to Michael Collins and the winning side in Ireland’s 1922-23 civil war. The party traditionally advocates market economics and fiscal discipline. Appeals to the urban middle class and well-off farmers.Its name means Soldiers of Destiny. A centrist, ideologically malleable party that dominated Irish politics until it steered the Celtic Tiger economy over a cliff, prompting decade-long banishment to opposition benches. Under Micheál Martin, a nimble political veteran, it has clawed back support and may overtake Fine Gael as the biggest party and lead the next coalition government. Founded by Éamon de Valera, who backed the civil war’s losing side but turned Fianna Fáil into an election-winning machine.Its name means We Ourselves, signifying Irish sovereignty. A leftwing republican party that competes in Northern Ireland as well as the Republic. Traces roots to 1905. Emerged in current form during the Troubles, when it was linked to the IRA. Peace in Northern Ireland helped Sinn Féin rebrand as a working-class advocate opposed to austerity. Under Mary Lou McDonald, a Dubliner without paramilitary baggage, Sinn Féin has become the third-biggest party, and its vote share surged in the 2020 election.\u0026nbspPartnership with Fine Gael during post-Celtic Tiger austerity tainted the centre-left Labour party. The political arm of the trade union movement, it is led by Brendan Howlin, a former teacher and government minister.The Social Democrats and Solidarity-People Before Profit are part of an alphabet soup of smaller, more leftwing parties. The Greens, wiped out in 2011 after a ruinous coalition with Fianna Fáil, have campaigned on the back of climate crisis anxiety and youth-led protests. Independent TDs have prospered in recent elections, turning some into outsized players in ruling coalitions. Rory CarrollDuring the campaign Leo Varadkar, the taoiseach and Fine Gael leader, and Micheál Martin, the leader of Fianna Fáil, both ruled out entering government with Sinn Féin, citing ethical and policy reasons.On Sunday evening, Varadkar told journalists in Dublin: “For us, coalition with Sinn Fein is not an option, but we are willing to talk to other parties.”Varadkar, Ireland’s first gay taoiseach, had hoped a healthy economy and his record on Brexit would deliver a third term for Fine Gael, but he encountered voter fatigue and anger over the cost of living and state of public services.Varadkar’s party colleague Richard Bruton, the outgoing environment minister, said Fine Gael’s poor but not disastrous results gave it a chance of forming another government.Asked if Fianna Fáil would now consider sharing power with Fine Gael or Sinn Féin, Martin appeared to leave the door ajar, citing a need for stability amid political fragmentation. “The country comes first … there is an onus and an obligation on all that such a functioning government is formed after this.”Many in Fianna Fáil, stung by the backlash over their confidence-and-supply deal with Varadkar’s outgoing government, would prefer a deal with Sinn Féin than another centrist alliance.Ireland’s single transferrable vote system of proportional representation means it could be Monday, Tuesday or even later before all Dáil seats are allocated.It was a stunning result for Sinn Féin, which was the IRA’s political wing during the Troubles and remained a fringe party in the republic until well after the 1998 Good Friday agreement.Preliminary vote tallies suggested Sinn Féin could win around 36 seats, up from 22 in the outgoing Dáil, far exceeding its own expectations.Many candidates ratcheted up huge surpluses in urban heartlands while others appeared on course for unexpected victories in Galway, Tipperary, Roscommon, Mayo and Wexford.Gerry Adams, who stepped down as party leader in 2018 and as a Dáil member in this election, credited McDonald’s leadership and said he had not foreseen the extent of the gains. He said Sinn Féin would use its mandate to plan for a united Ireland – a defining tenet for the party.The issue of a united Ireland barely featured in the campaign, but an exit poll of voters found most supporting a border poll in the next five years. Sceptics say that could destabilise both sides of the island. Unionist leaders in Northern Ireland gave no immediate response to the results south of the border.People across the political spectrum said the election was seismic, even if its consequences remained unclear. The former Labour leader Pat Rabbitte said a tectonic shift had killed the old system of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael alternating in power with Labour or other small, establishment parties.The commentator Fintan O’Toole wrote in the  that young voters had shattered the taboo of backing a party associated with terrorism. “They have gone where they were warned not to go and in doing so they have redrawn the map of Irish politics to include territory previously marked ‘here be dragons’.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd5d320e39099d198d30f08e8ca3fdde7b0619dc/912_931_3451_2070/master/3451.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef923c47e5ae0749693905094eda682b","title":"come back soon coronavirus wreaks havoc on global tourism hotspots","story":"Outbreak huge blow for Thailand, Japan and Italy, which rely heavily on Chinese visitorsMost February evenings, it’s a struggle to push through the crowds to get to Yanakawee Srialam’s souvenir stall in Bangkok’s Ratchada Train night market. It’s peak tourism season and the market’s alleyways would normally be heaving with visitors.But Chinese tourists, who make up the vast majority of Srialam’s usual customers, have all but disappeared. His best-selling items now include disposable face masks, which have surpassed sales of souvenirs such as pad Thai fridge magnets.China has stopped all outbound tour groups from leaving the country in a bid to halt the spread of coronavirus and encouraged citizens to reconsider travelling abroad. International airlines have suspended tens of thousands of trips to and from mainland China. For countries such as Thailand – whose tourism sector depends heavily on Chinese travellers – it’s a huge blow.Visitor numbers have plummeted, with hotel bookings and guided tours cancelled. On the resort island of Phuket, the professional guide association warned last week that 3,000 Chinese-speaking tour guides are out of work and need financial support.Last year, 11 million Chinese people visited Thailand– a number that is expected to fall by 2 million this year.The outbreak has wreaked havoc across the global tourism industry, which has become increasingly reliant on Chinese visitors. The number of Chinese people going abroad grew rapidly to 150 million in 2018, and operators have responded by designing packages specifically aimed at them.Italy’s national hotel association, Federalberghi, has said the country – the most popular destination for Chinese visitors to Europe, recording 3.5 million in 2019 – could lose billions of euros as Chinese tourists cancel hotel bookings amid a flight ban. Ignazio Visco, the chief of the Bank of Italy, has also warned that the coronavirus outbreak could seriously affect the country’s already weak economy.The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the Wuhan coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.Despite a surge in sales of face masks in the aftermath of the outbreak of the coronavirus outbreak, experts are ided over whether they can prevent transmission and infection. There is some evidence to suggest that masks can help prevent hand-to-mouth transmissions, given the large number of times people touch their faces. The consensus appears to be that wearing a mask can limit – but not eliminate – the risks, provided they are used correctly.The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has advised UK nationals to leave China where possible. It is also warning that travellers from Hong Kong, Japan, Macau, Malaysia, Republic of Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand who develop symptoms of cough or fever or shortness of breath within 14 days of returning the UK should contact the NHS by phone.“A temporary ban on arrivals is manageable,” said Bernabò Bocca, the president of the Venice hotel association. “But if coronavirus discourages the Americans from travelling, it would mean trouble for Italy. The potential damage from a prolonged crisis could reach €4.5bn.”Meanwhile, thousands of people on a luxury cruise ship, the Diamond Princess, remain stuck in quarantine off the coast of Japan. Passengers have mostly been confined to their cabins to stop the spread of the virus, which has so far reportedly infected 136 people.The impact of the outbreak on the global tourism market is unknown, but it’s expected that Thailand, Japan and other nearby destinations will be among those hardest hit. Officials warn that an outbreak in one of Thailand’s tourist hotspots is possible.In Bangkok, anti-bacterial gels are offered in shops while one of the luxury malls has begun taking customers’ temperatures. Masks were already worn by many because of the heavy pollution, but have now become even more common. Thailand’s health minister, Anutin Charnvirakul, has previously said that “farang” tourists, a sometimes dismissive term for westerners, should be kicked out of the country if they do not wear a mask. He later apologised.At Ratchada market, Radek Slepowronski and Margaret Ciszkowska, from Poland, said they were taking precautions but were not overly concerned. “In crowded places, on planes, buses, we wear masks, we wash our hands, we disinfect them,” said Ciszkowska. “But we’re not scared about it,” added Slepowronski.For others, who have traveled from Japan, Hong Kong or who have not been able to return home to mainland China, Thailand feels a safe place to be. Anthony James, who is from the UK but lived for nine years in Wuhan, the centre of the outbreak, left the city to go travelling shortly before it was placed under lockdown. He has not experienced any symptoms.The handful of westerners visiting the market were little consolation to stallholders. “There are a few westerners coming, but westerners are not big spenders,” says Srialam. “It’s hard to make sales to them, they negotiate very strongly.” Chinese tourists, he says, are the most important for business.At Wongtaraloesakul’s food stall, a sign reads “jiāyóu China, jiāyóu Wuhan”, which translates literally as “add oil”, meaning “keep up the fight”. His message to China is to get well soon: “Come back soon. We are waiting.”Additional reporting by Angela Giuffrida in Rome"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/216ff0a2c6d4c17985d8561a34b36083a78c036f/187_0_3750_2250/master/3750.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=22051837e703fff02db9d27f25c98930","title":"could the coronavirus mutate if a vaccine cant be found in time","story":"As scientists race to trace out paths the virus might take we ask the crucial questionsIn just a month, the coronavirus outbreak has snowballed from a handful of cases to more than 40,000, reaching four continents and prompting an all-out battle to stop the spread across China and beyond. As those in Wuhan face shortages of hospital beds and supplies that have been likened to “wartime conditions”, experts and scientists are attempting to trace out the possible paths that the virus might take.When Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) hit in 2002, after an initial surge in cases, the epidemic fizzled out. However, many experts believe the chances of this happening with 2019-nCoV are looking increasingly slim. In fact, the odds may have been more difficult even from the start of the latest outbreak, according to David Heymann, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM). “Sars emerged in one or two people,” he said. “This current outbreak it seems was quite explosive at the start – it was many different people infected at the start, and they each set off their own chain of transmission.”Although the difference in initial case numbers may sound small – two people versus 16, say – in an epidemic where numbers of infections are doubling every five days that could have set back containment efforts by several weeks.It is too early to calculate how effective quarantines have been in containing the spread. A slight levelling off in the number of global cases over the past few days has been taken by some as a cause for optimism, although this may also reflect difficulties in recording cases.On Sunday, World Health Organisation chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned that cases of the coronavirus being transmitted by people who had never been to China could be “the tip of the iceberg”, while on Monday the UK health secretary, Matt Hancock, declared the virus “a serious and imminent threat to public health” after four new cases were diagnosed in the country.“One has to be a little bit pessimistic at this stage,” said Prof Peter Smith, an epidemiologist at LSHTM. “There are a large number of cases in China, even though they’re putting in place these draconian measures to contain it. It’s looking increasingly likely that it will become well-established in China. The likelihood is then that it will leak to other countries.”“My pessimistic view at this stage is that it is likely to become quite widespread and will be around for some time.”Some coronaviruses are seasonal and so it is possible that the number of cases may begin to dampen down as spring comes. But if the virus is already widespread by that point, it does not necessarily mean it is gone for good – just like flu, coronavirus could rear its head again next winter, at which point it would be considered an endemic human disease.There are already four circulating coronaviruses (chances are you have had one – they cause about a quarter of common colds) that originally made the leap to humans from cows, bats and other animals.“Coronaviruses have established themselves before. We have four of them that cause common cold-like illness,” said Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease specialist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. “There’s a very high chance that can be the fifth.”If the coronavirus is still circulating in a year, its impact could be lessened by a level of immunity in the population and, possibly, the availability of vaccine to protect health workers and those most vulnerable. “This is the situation where a vaccine will become relevant,” said Smith.Tests so far suggest that the coronavirus is relatively stable but as it is passed from human to human the virus will become more adapted as a human disease. This is not necessarily a bad thing, though. “In Darwinian terms, the virus wants to survive,” said Smith. “And to do that it’s generally not a sensible idea for a virus to kill people. The most successful viruses infect a lot of people and cause relatively little pathology.”It’s worth noting that coronaviruses do not undergo the same type of genome shuffling that leads to the constantly shifting variety of flu strains in circulation. It is this genetic drift that means new flu vaccines have to be created each year and that means getting the flu once does not mean you’ll be immune next time it comes around. The coronavirus is not expected to mutate this rapidly and so once a vaccine is here, it should continue to work far into the future.Teams around the world are racing to produce a vaccine, with some vaccine candidates already being tested in animals, just weeks after the coronavirus DNA sequence was released.Jeff Richardson of Inovio Pharmaceuticals, one of the teams backed by funding from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (Cepi), said the team’s DNA-based vaccine is already being manufactured on a larger scale for human testing projected to start early summer. A team from the University of Queensland, also backed by Cepi, is already testing its vaccine in combination with a technology developed by GSK, which makes the immune system respond more strongly to vaccines, potentially lowering the dose required by a factor of four.Few people doubt that a viable vaccine will be in human testing by the summer. But these incremental trials, in which the numbers given the vaccine are ramped up from 20 to 200 and then thousands, will unavoidably take many months to ensure that the vaccine is safe and that even rare side-effects are spotted. A commercially available vaccine within a year would be quick.The global vaccines community faced severe criticism after the Ebola epidemic, which killed 11,000 people, over the failure to deploy a vaccine quickly enough it took more than a year, despite a vaccine having been in development for a decade. This time things have moved more quickly. But some argue that there is still much more the world could do to prepare for infectious disease outside times of crisis.Seth Berkley, head of the vaccine alliance Gavi, said: “The hardest thing for me is that we live in a world where we want to prevent. We have nuclear submarines as the third line of defence. We spend a lot of money to be prepared. But this is an evolutionary certainty whereas nuclear war is not – and yet we spend a lot less on this type of prevention.“During the Ebola outbreak it was the Isis of infectious disease,” he added. “A few weeks after that people were like, ‘Ebola? Yesterday’s story.’ The question is, how do we get people to pay attention to this in peacetime?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/59ff93fd27eea2be66feecf0b9a7c0b98d12877a/0_71_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b490a5e80a678a72158cff730598095b","title":"irish general election everything you need to know","story":"Weeks – possibly months – of negotiations are likely to follow Sinn Féin’s strong showingSinn Féin fielded too few candidates to fully translate its support into seats so Fianna Fáil is expected to be the biggest party in Dáil Éireann, the Irish parliament’s lower house, which has 160 members, when all seats are allocated under Ireland’s single transferrable vote system of proportional representation.Current projections give Fianna Fáil around 42, with Sinn Féin and Fine Gael each in the mid to high 30s.

Its leader, Mary Lou McDonald, and party colleagues such as Eoin Ó Broin and Pearse Doherty offered leftwing solutions, such as an ambitious public housing building programme, that enthused voters, especially those under 50.Varadkar’s attempt to frame the election around his Brexit diplomacy and the humming economy fell flat. Fianna Fáil was contaminated by its confidence-and-supply deal that had propped up Varadkar’s minority administration, leaving Sinn Féin to cast itself as the agent of real change. Voters forgot, forgave or did not care about its past as the IRA’s political wing during the Troubles.Weeks – possibly months – of negotiations between party leaders. McDonald is floating an alliance of leftwing parties led by Sinn Féin but that’s unlikely – it would be far short of 80 seats. The only viable looking option entails an alliance between two of the three main parties plus perhaps the Greens.Varadkar has ruled out a pact with Sinn Féin and floated a deal with Fianna Fáil. During the campaign the Fianna Fáil leader, Micheál Martin, ruled out entering government with Fine Gael or Sinn Féin but since Sunday has hinted he may do a deal with one or the other.Expect shadow boxing. Sinn Féin will be very wary about entering government as a junior partner – a recipe for punishment at the next election, as other parties have discovered. Some suspect its preferred outcome is a Fianna Fáil-Fine Gael government – an unpopular continuation of the status quo that would consolidate Sinn Féin as leader-in-waiting of the subsequent government.For that reason Fianna Fáil will hesitate to do a deal with Fine Gael.

We have won the popular vote,” McDonald said, as counting of votes to fill seats in Dáil Éireann, parliament’s lower house, continued in constituencies across the country.With full results expected late on Monday or Tuesday, Leo Varadkar, the taoiseach and Fine Gael leader, faced a call from Paudie Coffey, a former Fine Gael TD and junior minister, to quit as party leader.Simon Coveney called the voters’ verdict “harsh” but backed Varadkar’s continued leadership. Another senior party figure, Paschal Donohoe, said Fine Gael could end up forming another government.The fragmented results will produce a hung parliament with no party close to 80 seats – the number for a majority and stable government in the 160-seat chamber, which includes a speaker.Sinn Féin, having fielded too few candidates to fully translate support into seats, was expected to end up with about 36 seats, similar to Fine Gael. Fianna Fáil was expected to win 40, making its leader, Micheál Martin, the favourite to emerge as taoiseach after negotiations that could last weeks or even months.McDonald told RTE her preference was to form a government without either of the two formerly biggest parties but that she would speak to Varadkar and Martin because “that’s what grownups do”.She called for an end to the era of her party, formerly led by Gerry Adams, being frozen out of coalitions. “The democratic thing is for them to speak to me and stop this business of saying Sinn Féin can be put on the margin … So many people now have chosen us to represent them.”Varadkar has ruled out a Fine Gael pact with Sinn Féin, citing its leftwing policies and past IRA links, and floated a centrist alliance with Fianna Fáil.The former Fine Gael deputy leader James Reilly said the party needed to “reflect and decide” on whether Varadkar should remain leader if it does not form the next government. He told RTE there were a “number of mistakes” in a campaign “fraught with own goals” including the controversy over a proposed and then cancelled Royal Irish Constabulary commemoration.Its name can be translated as family or tribe of the Irish.

We certainly will engage with them, we are not going to refuse to talk to them.”Brendan Howlin, the leader of the Labour party, which appeared on course for about half a dozen seats, said any viable government would need two of the big three parties.“Ultimately we either have to have Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael together or Sinn Féin with one of those parties. That will happen in my judgment … I think that is the only stability that can be offered.” Another election would hurt Ireland, he said.Bread and butter issues dominated the campaign, which virtually ignored Northern Ireland and Brexit, but Sinn Féin said it wished to promote its defining issue – a united Ireland – in any future government.At a victory celebration in a Dublin count centre, Dessie Ellis, a re-elected Sinn Féin TD and former IRA member, joined supporters in singing the rebel song Come Out Ye Black and Tans.

The Chinese gadget manufacturer, TCL communication, has become the latest company to make cutbacks to its planned presence at the upcoming Mobile World Congress (MWC) amid the coronavirus crisis. The company has said it would still have a booth on the tech show’s floor, but would no longer hold a press conference. Sony and Amazon are among the other phone makers to have withdrawn from the event – which will be held in Barcelona later this month – in recent days, citing concerns about the spread of the virus. Ericsson, LG and Nvidia have also pulled out of the show. In a statement, TCL said: “Given the recent global health concerns due to the spread of the 2019-nCoV virus, and out of an abundance of caution and care for our staff, customers, press and other guests, TCL Communication is cancelling its global press event for MWC 2020, which was planned for 22 February 2020.“This decision does not impact any other MWC 2020 activities planned by the company and TCL will still announce its latest mobile devices and showcase them at its booth in the Fira Gran Via - Hall 3, Stand 3D11 - from 24-27 February as scheduled.”A UK law firm that specialises in private education has said independent schools should discourage students from flying to China and consider keeping their boarding house open and staffed during the half-term break.Vicky Wilson, Senior Associate in the Education practice at Wilsons, said:Pupils from China and Hong Kong make up the biggest single group of overseas student in the UK’s independent schools. Coronavirus is something every school must address this week.The Foreign Office has advised people in the UK to avoid all but essential travel to China and independent schools must reinforce that to pupils and their families.Missing a family reunion is hard on everyone but it is preferable to pupils risking their education being seriously disrupted by Coronavirus and its fallout.Wilsons Solicitors have listed six things all independent schools should be doing ahead of the holiday.The Royal Free Hospital, in north London, said two of the patients had been taken for treatment at its high consequence infectious disease treatment centre.We are treating an additional two patients with Wuhan novel coronavirus at the Royal Free Hospital (RFH), which means there are a total of three patients with the condition at the RFH.The RFH is one of a small number of specialist centres in England for treating infectious diseases such as coronavirus.As the patients are being treated in isolation, there is no risk to any other patients or visitors.All of our services remain open as usual, so if you have a hospital appointment please attend as planned.Staff at a local community centre in Brighton have been advised to self-isolate after the man at the centre of the Brighton and Hove outbreak visited a class there last week, The Argus reports. A manager and some volunteers at the Cornerstone Community Centre in Hove have been advised by Public Health England to self-isolate after the man attended a yoga class. The man visited the centre last week to go to a runners yoga class.People are very concerned about the lack of clear information from the NHS about this man’s movements.The centre manager has been told to self-isolate. “People are turning up at the centre and don’t know what to do.”Eight people have tested positive for coronavirus in the UK out of 1,114 tested as of 2pm Monday, Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty said.At the Grenadier pub in Hove punters seemed unconcerned that a man who has been diagnosed with coronavirus was served here a few days ago.There were about a dozen customers watching football and enjoying a pint on Monday afternoon, and although all staff who were on duty at the time the man was hosted have been told to self-isolate, there were plenty of people behind the bar too.A Grenadier pub spokesperson said: “We are following the advice and working closely with Public Health England who have advised us that there is minimal ongoing risk of infection to either guests or staff, and as such the pub remains open for business as usual.”The man, who was the third confirmed case of coronavirus in the UK, is believed to have visited the pub on the evening of 1 February. Breaking: a GP in Sussex has been temporarily shut down after a member of staff tested positive for the coronavirus, BBC reportsAn message left at the medical centre’s phone says: “Unfortunately, the building has had to close due to an urgent operational health and safety reason,” Reuters reports.Here’s a report by my colleague Haroon Siddique on the British national believed to have passed the bug to at least 11 Britons in three countries, prompting concerns about the danger posed by so-called super spreaders.The unnamed man, the first Briton to have tested positive for coronavirus, travelled to Singapore for a sales conference that exposed the Sussex businessman to the Wuhan coronavirus. After the conference, the Briton travelled to the French ski resort of Les Contamines-Montjoie near Mont Blanc, where he stayed with his family between 24 and 28 January.He then flew back to the UK on a busy easyJet flight from Geneva to Gatwick. Still oblivious to the fact he had the virus, which has a two-week incubation period, he returned home and on the evening of 1 February he visited a local pub, The Grenadier, in Hove.Just under a fifth of known cases of the new coronavirus in the worst-affected region in China may result in death, a report from Imperial College London estimates. It is important to note that the differences in these estimates does not reflect underlying differences in disease severity between countries. CFRs seen in inidual countries will vary depending on the sensitivity of different surveillance systems to detect cases of differing levels of severity and the clinical care offered to severely ill cases.All CFR estimates should be viewed cautiously at the current time as the sensitivity of surveillance of both deaths and cases in mainland China is unclear.The UK’s decision to declare the coronavirus outbreak as a “serious and imminent threat” to public health gives the government fresh legal powers to forcibly quarantine people and send them into isolation if they pose a threat.The PA Media news agency reports that the decision was in response to one of the Britons who returned from Wuhan in China, the centre of the outbreak, attempting to leave isolation at Arrowe Park hospital on Merseyside.The news agency cited a government source that “there was someone who was threatening to abscond from Arrowe Park”. All the Britons who returned on the evacuation flight signed a contract agreeing to a 14-day quarantine period, which ends this Thursday. There were concerns, however, that those contracts were not legally enforceable, leading to the new regulations.The Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, has made his first public appearance in weeks. State broadcaster CCTV has posted a short segment of Xi visiting a neighbourhood in Beijing. Xi is shown wearing a surgical mask, having his temperature taken, and greeting residents. According to CCTV, Xi “investigated and directed” the ongoing virus prevention work and asked after residents and workers.Xi’s disappearance over the last few weeks is unusual for a leader whose face is featured constantly on state newspapers and broadcast on the nightly news. While state media have frequently reported statements made by Xi, he had not been seen in public since a meeting with the WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, on 29 January and a meeting with the Cambodian prime minister, Hun Sen, in Beijing on 5 February. He has not been shown visiting doctors or hospitals or patients or visiting Wuhan. Instead, he sent his second-in-command, the premier, Li Keqiang.Observers say Xi may have been insulating himself from the public fallout from the crisis, making it easier to blame local officials. Others have pointed out that he is doing what several other Chinese leaders before have done during times of crisis of stepping back from the limelight while still maintaining firm control. Internet users have joked that he may have found a safe place to quarantine himself.Now that the central government has taken control of the handling of the outbreak, it may be harder to deflect blame. Moreover, the top leadership is also facing an outpouring of public anger over the recent death of a doctor who was punished for trying to warn colleagues and friends about the virus. Xi may not have the luxury of staying in the background. Public Health England is speaking to people who have had close and sustained contact with the new confirmed cases. Dr Nick Phin, the deputy director of national infection service at Public Health England, said: These new cases are all closely linked and were rapidly identified through Public Health England’s comprehensive contact tracing approach and tested quickly. Our priority is speaking to those people who have had close and sustained contact with confirmed cases so that we can advise them on what they can do to limit the spread of the virus."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4167123.1581260473!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"study into impact of bonus for irish on cao points questions fairness","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA State Examinations Commission report found the bonus scheme delivered an average CAO bonus of 12 points, though in some cases it was as high as 30-35 pointsAn unpublished study on the impact of bonus points for students who answer the Leaving Cert through Irish has questioned the fairness of the measure.Under rules that date back to the mid-1920s, any student who answers a written exam in Irish may receive bonus marks of up to 10 per cent, depending on the subject.A State Examinations Commission (SEC) report examined the impact of this on more than 120 students who completed their exams in Irish across two unnamed all-Irish schools.It found the bonus scheme delivered an average CAO bonus of 12 points, though in some cases it was as high as 30-35 points.Students who scored high CAO points benefitted the most. For example, the bonus allowed students who scored between 500 and 600 points overtake about 20 per cent of other students who scored above them.A commentary accompanying the report states that it is not possible to determine whether students who completed their exams in Irish would have performed better if they answered them in English.“While we can assume that all of these candidates are very good at Irish, the great majority are not native speakers. They might therefore have done better (exclusive of the bonus) had they both studied the subject and been examined in it through English,” the report states.“If one takes this view, the effect of the bonus scheme is to partially or fully rectify a cause of unfairness. If one does not, then the effect is to create an unfair advantage.”Scheme rulesUnder Irish bonus scheme rules, students who answer written exams in Irish may receive bonus marks of up to 10 per cent for subjects such as history, geography, physics, chemistry and biology.The bonus marks are lower – 5 per cent – for subjects where there is less reliance on Irish, such as foreign languages, maths, accounting and engineering.Irish and English are excluded from the bonus scheme.The full bonus only applies if the student has obtained less than 75 per cent in their exam.Above this point, the bonus applies on a sliding scale to the point where a student who scores 100 per cent gets no bonus.The SEC report also found that the way students benefit from the Irish bonus is “erratic” due to the way the grading process works by disproportionately benefitting more students over others.For example, it points out that it is possible for the Irish bonus to cause an upgrade from an E to a D3 in a higher-level subject, which would yield 45 points, or 70 points in the case of higher maths.It says changes should be considered so there is a more even distribution of the benefit.“Decisions over the future of the bonus points scheme do not simply come down to whether to abolish it or not,” it states.“The scheme has been amended in its manner of application on a number of occasions through its history. There is no reason why it cannot be amended again if there is agreement that there is a fairer way for it to operate.”AnomaliesIn response to queries from The , the State Examinations Commission said some of the anomalies highlighted in its report no longer arise due to grading changes introduced in 2017.These changes – which replaced As, Bs and Cs with wider grade bands such as H1s and H2s – followed recommendations from a group led by the Department of Education which included education partners such as higher education institutions.This same group decided not to make any recommendation in relation to the Irish bonus scheme when making the grading changes in 2017.“The SEC continues to implement the Irish bonus scheme in accordance with Government policy,” it said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4168461.1581348381!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"carlow kilkenny results green party s malcolm noonan takes final seat","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGreen Party’s Malcolm Noonan was the final TD elected in the  Carlow-Kilkenny constituencyThe Green Party claimed their first seat in the Carlow-Kilkenny constituency since 2011 on the final count in the Lyrath Hotel.Malcolm Noonan (GP) claimed the last seat after proving transfer friendly throughout the count.He fended off sitting TD Bobby Aylward to secure his place on the tenth count.He spoke of the responsibility the Green Party now had to tackle climate change.“For the first time, we didn’t have to sell the climate issue this election.

Despite its best efforts, Fine Gael was  unable to make Brexit a critical talking point for voters. Photograph: Donall FarmerGetty ImagesThe B-word barely figured as an election issue, despite Fine Gael’s best efforts during the campaign to make Brexit a critical talking point for voters.Despite Brexit dominating Irish and British politics for the past three years, the UK’s departure from the EU – and the potential risks of a no-deal crash-out (still) at the end of the year – came joint last along with immigration on a list of 10 issues cited by voters in Saturday night’s exit poll.But the talk about Fianna Fáil being the “junior B team” failed to hit home with voters on the issue. Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin dismissed the attacks, stating that he had supported Fine Gael’s stance on Brexit and the parties maintained “a good national consensus” on the issue.Backroom dealings“There is a lot of goodwill and thanks on the doorsteps for Brexit, but voters have priced it in as yesterday’s news,” said one Fine Gael insider. He regretted that, to set it apart, Fine Gael did not tell the electorate more during the campaign about the Government’s backroom diplomatic dealings at critical junctures in the Brexit process – for example, the Varadkar-Boris Johnson meeting on the Wirral that broke the Brexit deadlock in October or the times when EU solidarity behind Ireland and the Border waned in recent years.Any attempt to make Brexit more of an issue during the campaign by calling an election for a week after the UK’s scheduled exit from EU on January 31st – even though Fine Gael dismissed this - was hampered by the fact that the departure ended up being a non-event for Irish voters.The risk of a hard border on the island of Ireland faded, with the Brexit deal putting a trade border between Northern Ireland and Britain in the Irish Sea. When it formally happened, the UK exited with a whimper.“It is a measure of the fact that January 31st went off without a single piece of friction that the voters don’t care about it,” said the Fine Gael source.Full impactThe standstill transition period, postponing any Brexit effect on Irish businesses until the end of December 2020, means that the full impact of the UK’s departure has not yet been felt at home.“People have put it to the back of their minds until the end of the year, to the date when it kicks in. It is the only explanation why it has not been an issue because everyone was very concerned,” said Imelda Munster, the Sinn Féin TD re-elected in Co Louth.Munster said the seriousness of the country’s health and housing crises overtook Brexit as an election issue.“It was the only thing they could go with,” she said of Fine Gael pushing Brexit as a concern during the campaign.“They could hardly go with health, housing or the pension age with people lying on trolleys. It was the only positive thing that they thought would work for them.”Damian McGenity, a south Armagh farmer and spokesman for Border Communities Against Brexit, said the increase in Sinn Féin’s vote in the Border counties was a sign that Brexit was “definitely a factor” in those parts.It was “not a big issue to people south of the Boyne”, he said.“Eaten bread is soon forgotten. The withdrawal agreement has, for now, achieved a deal, but it is yesterday’s news the future is what people see as critical,” he said.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail Full results and counts for the 39 election constituencies.

The was a departure from his consistent line during the campaign that Fianna Fáil would not agree to any arrangement with Sinn Féin. Ms McDonald said her preference remains a government without either of the two formerly largest parties, but added that “grown up people” sit down and talk.Also speaking this morning, Fianna Fáil deputy leader Dara Calleary said his party would “certainly” be willing to talk to Sinn Féin.Voter ‘impatience’Tánaiste Simon Coveney has described the verdict of voters as “harsh” and a result of the public being “impatient” for more housing and a better health service.Housing and health were the key issues of the “hugely disappointing” election, he told RTÉ’s Today with Sean O’Rourke show.He said Fine Gael needs to respond with “more radical thinking” in terms of delivering the public services which people clearly expect on foot of a thriving economy.Counting in the general election resumed in centres across the State this morning with 69 of 160 seats left to be filled.Fourteen of 39 constituencies have completed their count with Sinn Féin currently leading with 32 seats, Fianna Fáil on 19, Fine Gael on 17 Independents on 10, Green Party on five, Social Democrats on three, Solidarity People Before Profit on two and Labour on two.Mr Coveney said housing and health were “undoubtedly the two big issues of the campaign and people were impatient for progress and an improvement to public services in both of those areas.”Mr Coveney said the electorate had voted for something more radical in the belief it could be delivered quicker, adding that he wasn’t sure it could.“I accept that not enough has happened in the minds of the electorate and the public to be satisfied with the Government’s performance in both of those areas,” he said.Fine Gael, he believed, had made a credible case about having made significant progress on the housing crisis.But he said the election campaign “got away from us” in the first couple of weeks and it was “everyone against the government party”.Asked if Leo Varadkar should continue as party leader, Mr Coveney said he should.Varadkar: ‘I hope they’ll keep me on’On Monday, Mr Varadkar said Fine Gael will “do it’s duty” and lead the Opposition if it cannot form a government. In such a scenario he would seek to stay on as leader of Fine Gael but “that will be a matter for my party.”The Taoiseach who was elected on the fifth count in Dublin West said,“I hope they’ll keep me on but if they don’t I’ll stay here and represent the place I grew up, the people who supported me.”Asked by Sky News what he would have done differently in the election he said: “There’s always things you would have done the same and things you would do differently but I think overall we had a good campaign.” He said his biggest regret was there wasn’t more time to show results in housing and again ruled out going into government with Sinn Féin.Counting continuesMeanwhile, counting got under way from 9am this morning but final results may take a number of days. Labour leader Brendan Howlin was elected in Wexford late on Monday morning bringing the party’s total seat count to date to two. In the same constituency Independent Verona Murphy, a former Fine Gael byelection candidate, is now in third place with 9,014 votes and looks like getting a seat. In Dublin North-West, co-leader of the Social Democrats Róisín Shortall was elected. In Wicklow, Fianna Fáil’s high-profile health spokesman Stephen Donnelly TD is facing a tight battle to hold onto his seat.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail Full results and counts for the 39 election constituencies.

Fianna Fáil’s manifesto calls for some relief for low- and middle- earners and no significant rises1. The public finances: The two parties are both committed to keeping the exchequer finances in surplus. Fianna Fáil aims for a somewhat bigger surplus – around €5.7 billion per annum by the end of a five-year term, compared to €3.4 billion for Sinn Féin. As part of this Fianna Fáil is also in favour of building up the rainy day fund to deal with future shocks, while Sinn Féin is not. Finally, Fianna Fáil wants to use the surplus payments due from Nama, estimated at €4 billion, to pay down debt, while Sinn Féin wants to use the Nama money as a once-off boost to the housing programme. Overall Sinn Féin plans to commit more than Fianna Fáil to both current and capital spending . A mid-point might be agreed, but finding an agreed definition of “prudence” and ways to protect the public finances from shocks might not be easy. A vital issue would be clarity between the parties of what would happen if growth and tax revenues were lower than expected.2. Personal Tax: Sinn Féin has called for tax cuts for lower-earners to be paid for by hikes on the better-off. Fianna Fáil’s manifesto called for some relief for low -and middle-earners and no significant rises. On the USC, both are calling for some cuts – Sinn Féin on the first €30,000 of earnings and Fianna Fáil opting for a reduction in the main rate, which applies on earnings from around €20,500 to €70,000, from 4.5 per cent to 3.5 per cent. Compromise might be found here, but Sinn Féin’s plans to tax higher earners by gradually eliminating tax credits on earnings of more than €100,000 and imposing a new 5 per cent levy on earnings above €140,000 were criticised by Fianna Fáil during the campaign. Sinn Féin also wants higher tax on bigger pension pots. 3. Housing: This area would be central to any deal, with Sinn Féin calling for an additional €6.5 billion to be spent on social and affordable homes, partly funded by the Nama cash. Fianna Fáil also wants to spend significantly more to deliver social and affordable houses – and both parties highlight the role of local authorities and housing bodies. Both also support a big rise in the vacant site levy, although Sinn Féin goes further and also calls for a rise in stamp duty on commercial property to 12.5 per cent. So some ground to be covered in the funding and implementation of housing policy, but both are heading in the same direction on house-building. On rent both favour tax credits for renters, but Sinn Féin also wants a three-year rent freeze, which Micheál Martin has backed away from citing legal advice.4. Big business: Sinn Féin’s targeting of multinationals and big business sets it apart from Fianna Fáil in this area and led to warnings from Fianna Fáil of the impact of its policies on growth and investment. A number of big fund-raisers in the Sinn Féin manifesto are based on rises in business tax, including a change in the rules for taxing intellectual property and a proposed rise in employers’ PRSI on incomes above €100,000. The party also wants to end the use of past losses by the banks to avoid corporate tax bills and raise the bank levy, which led to a fall in the value of bank shares on Monday. Fianna Fáil has pointed to a Department of Finance review which warned that this could cut the value of the State shareholding in the banks and also lead to higher costs for customers on products such as mortgages. Sinn Féin also wants to give the Central Bank power to cap mortgage rates. In summary, the Sinn Féin policies towards big business and the banks are likely to be a significant problem for Fianna Fáil. 5. Other areas : Sinn Féin wants to return the State pension age to 65, while Fianna Fáil wants to freeze the age where it is now at 66, pending a review. So some compromise would be needed here. As it would on Sinn Féin’s call to abolish the local property tax, which Fianna Fáil wants to retain. On carbon tax, Sinn Féin wants to freeze it at current levels until viable public transport alternatives are available, while Fianna Fáil wants to continue to increase it to €80 by 2030 as agreed by the Joint Oireachtas Committee last year.

But I really, really question the people who use social media in the way that they use it,” he said.Mr Byrne, who narrowly missed out on retaining his seat, agreed, saying this general election has been “a dirty campaign”.

Photograph: Krisztian BocsiBloombergReporters at the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) conference in December 2018 had only one concern: how to report on a new party leader with a double-barrel 24-letter eight-syllable name?Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer’s looming departure resolves that problem for us, but creates many more serious concerns for Germany’s dominant, centre-right party.A transformative earthquake is underway in German politics triggered by the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD). Last week, its support in the eastern state of Thuringia helped elect as premier a little known liberal politician. That the local CDU also voted for the candidate, effectively throwing its lot in with the far-right to thwart a left-wing candidate, shattered a post-war political taboo. The consequence: first Thuringia’s CDU leader announced his resignation, followed now by Kramp-Karrenbauer. For the AfD, it’s two heads for the price of one.In reality, the turbulence of last week’s vote merely catalysed doubts about AKK’s authority in her party and exposed the CDU’s long-deferred decisions about its political direction.The CDU’S two-decade Merkel era, in particular her 15 years in power, saw the party adopt a centrist course – with occasional swings left in welfare and migration politics. But is this still a winning formula or does the CDU, as a growing conservative wing in the party argues, need to follow Austria’s People’s Party (ÖVP) and shift right to halt conservative voter drift to the fringes?That Kramp-Karrenbauer never established any authority in her party was painfully clear last week when the Thuringian CDU ignored both her and a strict party ban on AfD co-operation.Despite lacking credibility she plans to stay on and “moderate” the transition. In the next breath she admitted on Monday that her co-habitation with Angela Merkel - splitting party chair and chancellorship - had created confusion. Why should such a job share work for her successor? Kramp-Karrenbauer’s premature departure is a humiliation for Merkel. Securing her successor the top job was the chancellor’s last political coup. That coup has failed.\u0026nbspThe resignation of the CDU’s second female leader after just 14 months tears up the chancellor’s plan for an orderly transition. Merkel has vowed to stay on until her fourth term as chancellor ends in the autumn of 2021. As of now, that is no longer her decision to make."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4168079.1581333606!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"angela merkel s successor as cdu party leader to stand down","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAnnegret Kramp-Karrenbauer and Angela Merkel: The former was seen as the candidate most likely to continue the current German chancellor’s centrist course. Photograph: Matthias RietschelReutersGermany’s centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) is on the hunt for a new leader after just 14 months as Angela Merkel’s successor announced on Monday she is to stand down.Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer announced her decision to the party’s steering committee on Monday amid growing doubts she had authority to hold her party together – or win next year’s federal election.She will stay on until the summer and begin the process of finding an election candidate who will aim to inherit the keys to the chancellery from Dr Merkel when she stands down in autumn 2021.Mrs Kramp-Karrenbauer - known to all in Berlin as AKK - was elected in December 2018 but has proven a luckless leader, with even supporters admitting she was proving a difficult sell to voters.A conservative Catholic from the southwestern state of Saarbrücken, she first made waves at national level in 2015 by suggesting allowing marriage equality could open the door to incestuous or polygamous marriages. In office, she caused a flap during last year’s European elections by appearing to question media freedom as part of a row with a YouTuber CDU critic.Her time as leader was marked by an ongoing series of regional election disasters. Despite that, and her full-time job of retooling the CDU for the post-Merkel era, Mrs Kramp-Karrenbauer surprised political Berlin last July by becoming defence minister.She has signalled her wish to retain that portfolio while setting in motion a process of choosing a new CDU leader. That soul-searching process is likely to paralyse Germany politically for months to come, two years after the CDU’s last, months-long leadership contest. Last year was a political go-slow in Berlin as the CDU’s grand coalition partners, the Social Democratic Party (SPD), indulges in a similar journey of self-discovery, which is still ongoing under a new leadership duo.But the CDU’s reinvention process is likely to be even more difficult, given the aftershocks of last week’s events in the eastern state of Thuringia. The local CDU party defied Mrs Kramp-Karrenbauer, and disregarded internal party rules, by voting along with the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) to elect a new state premier from the liberal Free Democratic Party (FDP).The result triggered an earthquake in German politics, shattering post-war taboos and increasing pressure on the CDU to define its profile in the post-Merkel era. It cost the Thuringian CDU leader his job and now, too, Mrs Kramp-Karrenbauer’s position.The CDU has always prided itself on its unity, but in recent years two rival camps have grown up in the party – and Mrs Kramp-Karrenbauer a powerless onlooker. A more pragmatic camp, closer to the leader, insists the party should continue Dr Merkel’s centrist path to maximise the CDU’s vote share.But a rising conservative camp, neglected under Dr Merkel, feels the party needs to shift right to survive. Leading this camp is Friedrich Merz, a Merkel rival who has been circling Berlin in a holding position since losing the leadership to Mrs Kramp-Karrenbauer in December 2018.He is now likely to make his move and force discussion on a question avoided both by Dr Merkel and Mrs Kramp-Karrenbauer but now forced onto the agenda by the Thuringian vote: how the CDU defines itself vis-a-vis other political parties.At the 2018 party conference that elected Mrs Kramp-Karrenbauer leader, CDU delegates backed a motion insisting the party should remain equidistant from both the AfD and the Left Party, successors to the ruling East German party.But the political dilemma this creates has become clear in Thuringia, which for the last five years has been ruled by a stable three-way coalition with the Social Democratic Party (SPD) and Greens and led by a pragmatic Left Party leader. For many local CDU figures in Thuringia, teaming up with the AfD to prevent another Left-lead coalition was the lesser of two evils.Elsewhere in the country, the opposite is the case. Nearly a week on, horror and anger still linger at the local CDU’s alliance with the AfD and its leader, Björn Höcke, whom courts have said can be described as a fascist.Above all Mrs Kramp-Karrenbauer’s premature departure is a humiliation for Dr Merkel. She promoted AKK as CDU general secretary and securing her the party leadership was seen as the chancellor’s final political coup. That coup has gone wrong and could see Dr Merkel sharing power in her last months with her greatest political nemesis: Friedrich Merz. The two were once close allies but have been foes since Dr Merkel, sensing his ambition, fired him as CDU general secretary in 2002. What’s already clear is the new European term in Brussels is likely to grind to a halt thanks to internal politics in Europe’s largest member state. Just as Ireland’s election result has forced other parties to reassess their policy to Sinn Féin, Germany’s major parties are now being forced to redefine their voters’ expectations, their place in the political landscape and their approach to the growing political fringe."},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons february 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178.Coronavirus latest news: Four new cases confirmed in the UK as disease declared \u0026#39serious and imminent threat\u0026#39Analysis: Chosen heir\u0026#39s resignation leaves Angela Merkel\u0026#39s succession plans in ruinsStorm Ciara: Mercedes driver killed by falling tree as Britain wakes up to fresh devastationComment: The SNP would have a better case for independence if it turned its back on the EU Comment: Let\u0026#39s stop this descent into self-pitying Empire shame over our universities\u0026#39 ancient artefactsPolitics latest: Scoping work underway for a \u0026#39Boris bridge\u0026#39 between Scotland and Northern IrelandSyria and Turkey on collision course in Idlib after regime fire kills Turkish troopsTaliban hardliners push to quit US talks as frustration grows at impasseArt critic accidentally destroys $20,000 contemporary installation at Mexico\u0026#39s premiere art fairComment: Brexit was the UK\u0026#39s democratic reckoning.

For Mr Fredricks there are errands to be run, gifts to be delivered and political news to be relayed. On March 2 the former British colony, South America’s only English speaking country, will hold its most important general election in a generation. Whoever wins will preside over the first revenues from a colossal offshore oil project set to radically transform the tiny country\u0027s fortunes.With the main parties equally matched, the votes of the country’s Amerindian minority could be crucial for victory.  “We make the difference in the election,” says Mr Fredricks. “Recently we have seen a lot of development. Our requests for assistance have been coming through, but will that happen after the elections?”The three villages Mr Fredricks represents - totalling 700 members of the Macushi people - lie at the heart of a 5,000 square mile region of grasslands. The area is separated from the coastal capital, Georgetown, by 500 kilometres of pristine rainforest populated by giant anteaters, 40-stone anacondas and monkey-eating harpy eagles.The region is famously remote. When a bruised and penitent Evelyn Waugh visited in 1932 while escaping a collapsing marriage, he used the savannah and region and surrounding jungles as the setting for the nightmarish ending of A Handful of Dust. In his notes he described the local parish of St Ignatius “as lonely an outpost of religion as you could find anywhere.”Outside of campaigning season, the Macushi – along with the nearby Wapishana and Wai-Wai tribes – are largely neglected by the state.Following the decline of the cattle ranching and latex industries, many inhabitants rely on subsistence agriculture and the tiny eco-tourism industry.Three quarters of inhabitants live in poverty, compared to a national average of 36 per cent.Nine out of ten Guyanese live on the country’s Caribbean coast, once home to vast sugar estates worked first by slaves and then indentured labour from the Indian subcontinent.Those waves of immigration has left the population of 778,000 almost evenly split between Guyanese of African and East Indian ancestry.With each group expected to vote along ethnic lines, the backing of indigenous voters, who make up 10 per cent of the population, is the key to victory.The stakes have never been higher. Guyana is on the brink of becoming filthily, incomparably rich. A few days before Christmas the first oil began to flow from the depths of ExxonMobil’s giant Liza 1 offshore field, the first of a series of oil projects that promise to transform Guyana’s economic destiny.Early estimates say the oil will earn Guyana’s government over $120 billion in royalties and taxes, pushing up its GDP by 86 per cent in 2020 alone.In Georgetown, however, there is little sign of such riches. The city’s once-grand timber architecture creaks and crumbles in the Caribbean climate. The roadside waterways clog with litter.So far the main benefits of the boom have been landowners, who have sold riverside and coastal terrains to shore bases for the oil industry and property developers who can charge New York City prices for houses in gated communities.A sense of pessimism prevails. “We’ve been told Guyana would be a rich country before, first with sugrar, then with bauxite, then with gold, yet our country remains poor” says Jared Kissoon, an agribusiness entrepreneur. “People are sceptical about how politicians will manage the money and whether that the oil wealth with filter down to where it is needed.”International experts share the concern that the country could succumb to the resource curse, whereby immense natural resource riches leads to worse economic and developmental outcomes.Its neighbour to the west, Venezuela, has seen economic collapse and the establishment of authoritarian rule despite sitting on top of the world’s largest oil reserves.“We are already seeing the effects of the resource curse in Guyana,” says Marla Dukharan, a Trinidadian economist with a regional focus. “There is serious – and wide – institutional weakness, a lack of transparency and rising levels of corruption.”The government has made positive steps, she concedes, through the establishment of a sovereign wealth fund aimed at saving and invested oil funds for benefit future generations and the development of a national development strategy focused on green growth and investing in human capital.Winston Jordan, the finance minister, says that of the $300 million the government expects to earn from ExxonMobil’s oil production in 2020, roughly half will be saved in the fund and half made available for spending.“This is not a slush fund, we have strict rules on what can be drawn down by the government,” he says. “Oil has been a saviour for the economy.”Guyanese politics are already balanced on the tiniest margins. In 2015 the People’s National Congress party (PNC), which draws its support from Afro-Guyanese voters  – in coalition with a smaller party – won 33 of the country’s 65 national assembly seats but, following the defection of one its members, it subsequently lost a no confidence vote in December 2018.That should have led to a general election within 90 days but a protracted legal debate pushed the date back until 2020, to the frustration of many voters.The opposition People’s Progressive Party (PPP) – and its East Indian base – are emboldened, but the emergence of a new party with indigenous rights at the centre of its campaign strategy, has created the prospect of a hung parliament with the new party as potential kingmakers.“The traditional parties use indigenous votes to get into office and then marginalize the very same people,” says Lenox Shuman, a former toshao and presidential candidate for the newly-formed Liberty \u0026amp Justice Party (LJP).“They delay the awarding of indigenous land rights, give timber and mining licenses to their political allies and do nothing to prevent the daily incursion of hunters who slaughter animals and destroy livelihoods.” The LJIP have a real chance of winning a handful of seats in indigenous majority regions, according to Denis Chabol, a journalist and political commentator.Mr Shuman – who renounced his dual Canadian citizenship in order to run for office – has refused the overtures of both main parties to enter into coalition but says if his party win seats in parliament he will propose legislation allowing for the establishment of post-election coalitions, potentially putting his party in the position of kingmakers.Then the LJP will target the oil industry, with Mr Shuman promising to table legislature to renegotiate oil contracts, which many Guyanese believe are overly generous to foreign companies.A report by Global Witness released this week alleges that ExxonMobil’s “exploitative deal” in Guyana has deprived the country and its citizens of up to $55 billion. The government and Exxon deny the claims.“It is very difficult to see how the oil revenues will be governed with integrity and integrity and in the best interest of the people,” Mr Shuman says. “The international oil companies have conspired with the politicians to undermine the sovereignty of Guyana.”Guyana’s government “views the report as a cunning and calculated attack on a sovereign state with a duly elected government mere weeks before an election.”“We have complied with applicable laws at each step of the exploration, appraisal and development stages, anything to the contrary is baseless and without merit,”  Exxon said in an email to Bloomberg.In Georgetown, Julian McEwan, wipes down the long wooden bar of his guesthouse, a popular watering hole for PNC members. With demand for accommodation surging, he is about to add another floor of rooms upstairs.A close vote and a legal challenge from the losing party could lead to a period of limbo and slowed investment. “In Guyana the races live in harmony,” he says with a pause, “until election time.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pressure health chiefs british virus super spreader","story":"Health officials are under pressure to release details of the movements of a British coronavirus “super spreader” - amid fears the virus is far more contagious than was thought.The unnamed businessman, who contracted the virus in Singapore, is now known to have infected at least seven fellow Britons in a French ski resort, before returning home to Brighton, falling ill some some five days later.Those he infected include the fourth person to have contracted the disease in the UK and patients in Spain and France, all of whom were believed to have been with the \u0027super spreader\u0027 in France.But health authorities have refused to provide any details of the man’s movements during the five days he spent in the UK before showing symptoms - all that is known is that he spent two hours in a local pub the night before finally succumbing to the illness.On Sunday, it emerged that the man travelled back by Easyjet from Geneva to Gatwick on the 6.50pm flight on January 28th. The budget airline said it was notified by PHE on the evening of Thursday 6th. PHE said all passengers sitting near the man had been contacted and given advice.

Note this happened 12 days ago and none are displaying any symptoms.”On Sunday night scientists warned that medics may be “flying blind” in the war on coronavirus, amid growing evidence that it could be passed on long before symptoms show.Their warnings came as Public Health England (PHE) came under increasing fire for refusing to provide any information about the whereabouts of the “superspreader” during the period when he was likely to have been infectious.Health officials say they are tracking anyone who was within two metres of him for more than 15 minutes in the two weeks before his diagnosis, including those on the flight with him.They say those who have not been have not been contacted as a close contact, do not need to take any action. But the stance is coming under question, amid concerns that the virus appears to be far more contagious that was first thought.The middle-aged man contracted the virus during a company conference run by Servomex Gas, in Singapore, before flying to the Alps for a four-day break with friends. He is understood to have displayed no symptoms as he spent time in the resort of Contamines-Montjoie in the French Alps, before flying home on January 28. During the short break, he infected seven people, including environmental consultant Bob Saynor, 48, and his nine-year-old son. Two of the cases were only identified on Sunday one after flying back to his home near Palma in Majorca and the other having returned to London.Mrs Saynor\u0027s wife Catriona is now in a UK hospital, though it is not clear if she is the latest case to be diagnosed in Britain.The ski resort at the centre of the outbreak is now in lock-down.It was not until February 2 - five days after his return -  that the businessman fell ill, alerting the NHS which treated him in isolation at Royal Sussex Hospital, before transferring him to London for specialist treatment. He had felt well enough to visit his local pub before succumbing to the illness, spending two hours at The Grenadier in Hove last Saturday evening, February 1.Five members of staff working that night have been told to “self-isolate,” while a student at the nearby Portslade Aldridge Community Academy, who is also understood to have had contact with the man, has been advised to remain in isolation for two weeks. His journey is outlined here:Prof Richard Tedder, Visiting Professor in Medical Virology, Imperial College London, said the fact that the virus might have been passed on by a person without symptoms suggested the outbreak could be worse than SARS, and turn into a pandemic. Given current testing methods, “we are truly flying blind if it is the case that the coronavirus can be transmitted by those without symptoms,” he said. Brighton residents expressed anger at the refusal of the authorities to provide more information. Valerie Painter, a regular patient at the Royal Sussex County Hospital, said: The population of Brighton and Hove is very densely populated. We are living cheek by jowl in tiny streets close together,” she said. “Where has this person been on the buses and trains? What kind of tracing are the authorities doing?A spokesman for PHE said: “We are contacting people who were in close contact with any of the cases that have been confirmed in the UK, to provide them with health advice. We are working closely with the French authorities.PHE said it would not release patient identifiable information, such as a timeline of movements about any inidual who is part of a public health investigation.The new cases came as a second and final plane carrying British citizens evacuated from the Chinese city of Wuhan landed in Oxfordshire.The flight, with more than 200 people on board, including some foreign nationals, arrived at RAF Brize Norton shortly before 7.30am on Sunday, taking evacuees to a conference centre in Milton Keynes. The death toll in China from the virus now stands at 904, surpassing the number of Sars fatalities in 2002-2003.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus cases stricken cruise ship almost double overnight","story":"Quarantined passengers on board the Diamond Princess cruise liner were dealt another blow on Monday when 60 more people tested positive for the coronavirus, almost doubling the total number of cases to 130. The cruise ship, which is docked in the Japanese port of Yokohama, has strictly confined thousands of passengers to their cabins since last Wednesday. They face a total lockdown until February 19 and are only allowed to exercise on deck for 1.5 hours a day in small groups.  The Japanese health authorities began testing on board the ship after an elderly holidaymaker from Hong Kong, who disembarked in late January, was found to be carrying the deadly coronavirus, which has killed 908 and infected more than 40,000 since it emerged from China in mid-December. Following the high spike in cases, the Japanese government said it was planning to test dozens more elderly people on board and to investigate whether there were any issues with hygiene control. “We are considering testing, if possible, all those over 80 years old who are in ill health,” Yoshihide Suga, the Chief Cabinet Secretary told a news conference, reported the Japan Times. The Health, Labour and Welfare Ministry said that it would consider testing all of the approximately 3,600 people aboard the ship when the two-week quarantine ends, allowing them to leave the vessel if their results are clear.“We need to properly address the unease and concerns of our citizens,” said Katsunobu Kato, the health minister. Some passengers over the weekend already called for more health checks, questioning why fewer than 300 people have been tested in full, although every passenger has been asked to check their temperature and fill out health questionnaire forms. “The worrying thing to me is that they have tested relatively few people on the ship,” Kent Frasure, 42, from Oregon, told the . “The symptoms are still minor. They need to be doing more and testing more people.”On Friday, Mr Frasure’s wife Rebecca, 35, was one of the passengers escorted from the ship after being diagnosed with the virus even though she only had a minor cough and slight fever. Alan Steele, 58, was the first Brit to test positive on the ship last Thursday. On Monday, he posted the good news that doctors had were already planning his discharge. “As long as I pass the tests I will be free on Friday… heard bad news on more cases on ship but possible good news is all will now be tested so if your free of virus they should let you go,” he wrote on his Facebook page. Princess Cruise Lines Ltd., which operates the luxury liner, has now offered to fully refund all passengers who were trapped on board because of the outbreak. The refund will include accommodation prior to and following the cruise, onshore excursions and services used on board.However, David Abel, a British pensioner posting regular livestream broadcasts from his room, said that passengers are starting to display signs of “cabin fever.”A counselling hotline has been set up to help people, especially those with inside cabins and no natural light, cope with the ordeal. The risks of the virus spreading through the confined spaces of cruise ships and being transmitted across Asian ports has led to other liners being denied entry to ports.  Multiple excursions by Diamond Cruise passengers in the Taiwanese port of Keelung and Taiwan’s capital, Taipei, at the end of January, has put the island on high alert. Taiwan has since banned the docking of cruise ships that have recently visited Hong Kong, Macau or China. On Monday, South Korea also placed a temporary ban on liners entering its ports. The new restrictions have left thousands of passengers adrift at sea.The Westerdam, a ship carrying some 2,000 people, is not under quarantine and has no confirmed cases but has been denied entry to multiple ports in Japan, the Philippines and Taiwan since it left Hong Kong on February 1. We are floating around the ocean, American passenger Steve Muth told the Detroit Free Press on Sunday.I think we\u0027re headed toward Vietnam, maybe Malaysia, Cambodia, not sure — they won\u0027t tell us just yet, he added. We have no known cases onboard, but there\u0027s just a lot of fear that someone may have it and bring it to their country.Fears about the rapid transmission of the disease, which can cause fever and breathing difficulties have been heightened by a report by a team including renowned Chinese epidemiologist Zhong Nanshan that the virus incubation period can last for up to 24 days. An advance team of international experts working for the World Health Organisation has now set off for China. But concerns remain that the Chinese authorities are not being fully transparent about the extent of the crisis. Chen Qiushi, a citizen journalist, who has been doing critical reporting and posting YouTube videos from Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, went missing on Thursday, his friends and family said. He disappeared as the nation was mourning the death of Li Wenliang, a doctor who had been admonished for alerting colleagues to the spread of a new virus in early January. Mr Chen, 34, went missing as hundreds of thousands in China started to demand freedom of speech on social media platforms. The police reportedly said he had been forced into quarantine but his family said they had been unable to speak to him and did not know if he would be released after the mandatory 14 days.   More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/02/06/14/beetroot-leaf-dhal-cooking-indyeats.jpg","title":"garden sustainable space how to build tips tricks climate 20 pledges","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.This year, Chris Riotta is growing his own fruit and vegetables – in the middle of New York CityWhether you’re working with a few feet of space in a community vegetable patch, or have 65 acres of luscious foliage on a sprawling estate (looking at you, Oprah Winfrey), the first step to building a sustainable garden is mapping out a vision of your intentions.Each year before planting my own vegetable patch, I draw out an image of the garden I hope to build, indicating where each plant should go based on available sunlight and shading.\u0026nbspI’m currently planning to build the largest garden I’ve ever grown, while working to harvest one-third of my annual vegetable consumption directly from my backyard, as part of my mission for The Independent’s 20\u0026nbspPledges\u0026nbspfor 2020 initiative. While mapping out the garden, I put together a few tips and tricks to help get you started on your own sustainable vegetable patch.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesPlan out where to place your\u0026nbspplantsRoot to fruit: How to join the ethical food revolutionI like to plant crops that grow on vines (think: cucumbers and cherry tomatoes) in small groups, as close to a fence as possible so they scale upwards, while giving other plants that will likely grow much larger a separate space off to the side. That way, I can still walk by and tend to the crops growing up the fence, no matter how big the other plants off to the side eventually grow.\u0026nbspThis also works with smaller plots of soil like community garden space: keep clusters of similar plants in the same tight groups, and don’t worry so much about spacing. With some proper TLC, plants usually find their way around each other in the dirt.\u0026nbspSeeds can always begin growing indoors ahead of the season around the time you lay out your soil, which will provide you with plenty of time to start growing your crops in a stable environment. Some farmers will recommend you transport these seeds to your garden based on the location of the moon, but since I don’t have time for all that, I simply give the soil a good rinse of water for a week before transporting or planting anything in my garden.Study your plotBefore stepping into that dirt, it’s important to study your space and gain an understanding of how many hours of sunlight you’re working with and what kind of plants grow well in the region. Most will require about eight hours of sun, but if you’re in a shaded area and can only get six, that should still work, as many plants favour partial shade and only require about four hours of direct sunlight.\u0026nbspGetting a head start on laying out the groundwork for your garden will help it produce sustainable harvests that last throughout the summer months – and then some. You can look up the last frost date in your region here.\u0026nbspI tend to lay out my organic soil exactly where I plant to grow my garden about six weeks before this date.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Back to our roots: Warming winter vegetables recipes Show all 2Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Maximise your spaceIt’s also just as important to consider ways to maximise the space while gardening. Vertical garden walls can be purchased or made easily in DIY projects, allowing plants to grow above each other rather than spread out over a small space.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailLastly, don’t be afraid to plant intensively. Most crops only need a few inches of space for their roots to grow: things like peppers, tomatoes, broccoli and kale can all grow much closer together than most people think. I tend to believe that crops grow better when they’re in close, clustered mixes of similar plants, but that’s just my unprofessional semi-gardening enthusiast opinion.Transplant the seeds to your garden once its warm enough for them to survive in an outdoor climate, but only when the seeds are busting out of their trays or starter pots. The seeds should look vibrant and almost too big for their trays by the time they are brought to the garden for planting.\u0026nbspI tend to believe the first moments catering to a garden and each inidual plant are some of the most important in a life cycle the only way a garden will produce healthy crops is with tender love and care during its birth. These moments of transporting, growing the seeds, placing them into the ground and giving them nutrients and fresh water throughout the process are all vital to the longevity of a harvest.\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Show all 34Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.134 34. Ciaran Hinds as Steppenwolf (Justice League)We were so distracted by the bad jokes and Henry Cavill’s computer generated upper lip that it’s easy to forget that the Justice League faced off against a horned CGI muscle man voiced by Ciaran Hinds. So bad it effectively got everyone but Gal Gadot dumped from the franchise. (AW)234 33. Mark Pillow as Nuclear Man (Superman IV: The Quest for Peace)Presumably hired because fellow “foreign, unconvincing muscle-man” Dolph Lundgren wasn’t available, Mark Pillow made for one of the worst DC movie villains. To be fair to him, Superman IV: The Quest for Peace is a famously abysmal film, but his Nuclear Man – a villain so blandly nefarious even his name feels like it came about via 30 seconds of brainstorming – doesn’t help matters. (AW)334 32. Cara Delevingne as EnchantressJune Moone (Suicide Squad)It’s not been plain sailing swapping the catwalk for the big screen for this aristocratic supermodel-turned-actor, specifically with her role in this puerile comic book film. She plays June Moone, an archeological boffin transformed into a bikini-clad witch by some haunted dust. The film got devastatingly bad reviews, despite doing well at the box office. It may well be a performance Delevingne would like to forget. (CC)434 31. David Thewlis as Ares (Wonder Woman)The one area of Wonder Woman we don’t like to talk about is its villain, as his appearance in the film’s final act turns a smart and funny movie into one just like all the others – namely with two superpowered beings throwing things at each other. (AW)534 30. Patrick Wilson as Ocean Master (Aquaman)It was always going to be tricky to make much of an impression in a movie in which Amber Heard, sporting an enormous red wig, catapults her way into underwater battle riding a dolphin. Which might explain why Patrick Wilson, playing Aquaman’s dastardly half-brother Orm, has fallen so rapidly out of memory. (AW)634 29. Faye Dunaway as Selena (Supergirl)The doomed Supergirl movie is a living testament to how badly Mommie Dearest impacted the career of Faye Dunaway, with her turn as a witchy supervillain with a dangerous love spell at her disposal secretly the nadir of her Eighties career. She may nail a certain level of camp here, whether deliberate or not, but Dunaway is certainly no good – it’s no surprise she was awarded a Razzie for her performance. (AW)734 28. Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor (Superman Returns)A big gulp in 2019 for obvious reasons, but also pretty regretful because it\u0027s an incredibly dull performance from an actor who was, whether we like to admit it or not, masterful at playing villains in his prime. Here, however, Spacey is just a snooze. (AW)834 27. Yahya Abdul-Mahteen III as Black Manta (Aquaman)About as threatening as a Power Rangers villain and just as stupid-looking, Aquaman\u0027s recurring nemesis is more a perpetual irritant than someone particularly enjoyable to watch. (AW)934 26. Liam Neeson as Ra\u0027s al Ghul (Batman Begins)Ra\u0027s al Ghul, or The Demon\u0027s Head in Arabic, jumped on the climate activism bandwagon nice and early. For him, the human race is a cancer poisoning the Earth, and he wants to eliminate people to save the world from environmental disaster. Neeson played the villain so well because he really believed in him. “It was quite a good argument he comes up with,” the actor said. Terrifying. (EH)1034 25. Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr Freeze (Batman \u0026amp Robin)Arnold Schwarzenegger wasn\u0027t so much playing Mr Freeze in Batman \u0026amp Robin as he was The Pun King, few surviving his merciless deployment of woeful gags. Schwarzenegger is by no means good here, but he\u0027s absolutely captivating nonetheless. (AW)1134 24. Sharon Stone as Laurel Hedare (Catwoman)Only one of the worst DC villains because her evil plot was to poison Gotham City via killer face cream, Laurel Hedare at least allowed Sharon Stone to be devious, slinky and cartoonish for the first time since Basic Instinct. It\u0027s a very minor victory, though. (AW)1234 23. Jared Leto as Joker (Suicide Squad)It would be easy to pity Jared Leto, who was always going to be compared to the late Heath Ledger’s transcendent portrayal of the Joker in Christopher Nolan’s The Dark Knight, if it weren’t for how much hype he built up before Suicide Squad was even released. There were the tattoos, his green hair, a shiny grill in his mouth, and a ludicrous number of articles about his supposed bad behaviour on set. So it was downright embarrassing when it turned out Joker wasn’t even the lead villain in the movie, and instead just an annoyance who turns up to mock the lead cast every now and then. (RO)1334 22. Marion Cotillard as Miranda Tate (The Dark Knight Rises)Although many will purely remember Cotillard’s performance in The Dark Knight Rises for that awfully awkward death scene, she was great in the rest of the movie. She played one of Batman’s most interesting female adversaries with a slyness and a deception that was mysteriously alluring and effective. (EH)1434 21. Michael Shannon as General Zod (Man of Steel)The kind of role Shannon could play in his sleep, his General Zod is more angsty and human than his live-action predecessors playing the same character, but harmed by the relentlessly dank surroundings of Zack Snyder’s film. He’s also saddled with the most unflattering haircut in all of DC movie history, which couldn’t have helped. (AW)1534 20. Tom Hardy as Bane (The Dark Knight Rises)1634 19. Burgess Meredith as The Penguin (Batman 1966)Entirely unsubtle work from Meredith here, the actor grinding his teeth and chewing on the end of a large, thin cigarette to emphasise the Penguin’s dastardly villainy. But it’s a lot of fun to behold nonetheless. (AW)1734 18. Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor (Superman)The Oscar-winning actor was easily the most fun incarnation of Lex Luthor when he was cast in the 1978 Superman. As the hero’s arch nemesis, his light-hearted and theatrical portrayal came across as more comical than menacing. But despite the fact it was hard to take him as a serious threat, he was still a compelling villain to watch. He reprised the role in Superman II and Superman IV: The Quest for Peace. (CC)1834 17. Parker Posey as Kitty Kowalski (Superman Returns)One of the few bright spots in an otherwise drab and rapidly forgotten Superman reboot, Parker Posey very much plays to type here. But it\u0027s such a delicious, mischievous performance, all eccentricity and barely-concealed madness, that it\u0027s not remotely a problem. (AW)1934 16. Joaquin Phoenix as Joker (Joker)The role that, for better and for worse, Phoenix was born to play, his Joker is disturbing and brilliantly oddball. But it’s a performance that is also suffocating by nature of how present it is. Without any respite, in the form of a Christian Bale or a Michael Keaton, it ends up feeling a lot like Phoenix swallowing you whole, and that’s not the best of experiences. (AW)2034 15. Anne Hathaway as Selina Kyle (The Dark Knight Rises)Catwoman – the thieving, on-again, off-again love interest of Batman – was brought to life brilliantly by Anne Hathaway who deftly encapsulated her slinky, feline energy and gave an emotionally nuanced performance which offered a fresh perspective on the character after Michelle Pfeiffer’s turn in the Nineties. (EH)2134 14. Lee Meriwether as Catwoman (Batman 1966)The actor, who is now 84, is unforgettable in her portrayal of Catwoman in the 1966 film. Using feline movements when she walks, she winds up with one of the best scenes in any Batman: when disguised as a Soviet reporter called Miss Kitka, complete with Sixties Beehive hair, she seduces Adam West’s Caped Crusader so she can abduct him. They have a very passionate kiss, but when he figures out she is Catwoman, he is heartbroken. (CC)2234 13. Cesar Romero as Joker (Batman 1966)It may be an unpopular opinion, but Cesar Romero always had the best Joker laugh – a shrill, gleeful racket of purely mad joy. He’s also one of the few actors to play the character without a heap of exhausting off-screen intensity, too. With his white makeup merely painted over his moustache because Romero couldn’t be bothered to shave it off, there’s a blissful, unique ease to his work in the original Batman movie. (AW)2334 12. Uma Thurman as Poison Ivy (Batman \u0026amp Robin)Batman \u0026amp Robin may feature a vast ensemble of stars all acting in very different films, but Uma Thurman is the only one truly in keeping with the gaudy, camp vision that director Joel Schumacher (probably?) had in mind for it. Her Poison Ivy is basically a ludicrous, plant-groping drag queen dressed occasionally in a gorilla suit, and playing up the absurdity is arguably the smartest acting choice in the whole damn film. (AW)2434 11. Jim Carrey as The Riddler (Batman Forever)Released at the peak of Carrey’s Nineties fame, Batman Forever didn’t cast Carrey because he would be perfect for The Riddler, but because they wanted Jim Carrey – squirming, scenery-chewing, face-contorting and all. It ends up falling somewhere between genuinely brilliant and mildly awful, but on occasion becomes actually chilling. (AW)2534 10. Frank Gorshin as The Riddler (Batman 1966)Gorshin’s work on the original Sixties Batman series, and its 1966 film, has always been underappreciated. It’s partly due to The Riddler himself, a character notorious in Batman’s rogues gallery of villains, but always one that has struggled to be well portrayed on-screen. But Gorshin tried his best, morphing his Riddler into a sinister genius with a maniacal laugh and a fearsome, intimidating intelligence. (AW)2634 9. Tommy Lee Jones as Two-Face (Batman Forever)“I will not sanction your buffoonery,” Jones reportedly told his co-star Jim Carrey on the Batman Forever set. One of the most notorious examples of Jones\u0027s famed workplace grouchiness, his unhappiness working on the film at least wasn\u0027t visible on screen. He\u0027s fantastic here, all mad cackling and hysterical showboating. (AW)2734 8. Cillian Murphy as Scarecrow (Batman Begins)Cillian Murphy didn’t get the screentime he needed – or deserved – to really develop what could have been one of DC’s most intriguing villains: a corrupt psychopharmacologist testing his wares on the inmates at Arkham Asylum. What works is his understated manner and appearance Scarecrow didn’t need an outlandish costume because the terror he instilled was all in your head. (RO)2834 7. Christopher Walken as Max Schreck (Batman Returns)The true villain of Batman Returns, the tragic humanity of Catwoman and The Penguin entirely lacking in Schreck\u0027s capitalist, salacious and pro-gentrification business mogul. It\u0027s no surprise there have been Trump comparisons in the years since. But it\u0027s also important to not forget quite how brilliant Walken is in the role, too. (AW)2934 6. Aaron Eckhart as Two-Face (The Dark Knight)Less spoken about by nature of the stunning work by Heath Ledger elsewhere in The Dark Knight, Aaron Eckhart is also the film\u0027s secret weapon. His Harvey Dent is noble and well-intentioned and dripping with vaguely Kennedy-esque suave, which only makes his eventual transformation into Two-Face that much more tragic. (AW)3034 5. Danny DeVito as The Penguin (Batman Returns)3134 4. Terence Stamp as General Zod (Superman II)A villain played with delicious apathy and verve by Terence Stamp, General Zod is far and away the finest nemesis Christopher Reeve’s Superman ever had to face off against. Ruthless, menacing and dressed like the coolest cat on the Studio 54 dancefloor, he’s a blast. (AW)3234 3. Jack Nicholson as The Joker (Batman)The only thing lacking from Jack Nicholson’s Joker is an element of surprise. Even in 1989, there was something admittedly tried-and-tested about Nicholson playing insanity with such ripe conviction on screen. But regardless, his work here is terrifying – not quite Jack Torrance levels, but equally as captivating. It’s no wonder he got top billing over the guy who actually played Batman. (AW)3334 2. Heath Ledger as The Joker (The Dark Knight)The best of the best: Heath Ledger transformed himself completely and made the role his own opposite Christian Bale’s Batman in The Dark Knight. His performance was so outstanding that he has become the gold standard to which all other actors aspire when they take on a villainous role. It’s hard to believe there will ever be a better Joker. (RO)3434 1. Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman (Batman Returns)The mystery over Catwoman\u0027s moral allegiances has been alive almost as long as she has in comic book lore, but it also makes her the most captivating sort-of nemesis in all of the DC movies. Michelle Pfeiffer is a sensual, terrifying and incredibly funny presence throughout Batman Returns, her irresistible allure making her the most threatening inidual Batman has ever faced off against. She also gives one of the greatest performances not only in comic book movies but in all movies entirely, to whom all her successors, Catwoman or not, can\u0027t help but pail in comparison. (AW)134 34. Ciaran Hinds as Steppenwolf (Justice League)We were so distracted by the bad jokes and Henry Cavill’s computer generated upper lip that it’s easy to forget that the Justice League faced off against a horned CGI muscle man voiced by Ciaran Hinds. So bad it effectively got everyone but Gal Gadot dumped from the franchise. (AW)234 33. Mark Pillow as Nuclear Man (Superman IV: The Quest for Peace)Presumably hired because fellow “foreign, unconvincing muscle-man” Dolph Lundgren wasn’t available, Mark Pillow made for one of the worst DC movie villains. To be fair to him, Superman IV: The Quest for Peace is a famously abysmal film, but his Nuclear Man – a villain so blandly nefarious even his name feels like it came about via 30 seconds of brainstorming – doesn’t help matters. (AW)334 32. Cara Delevingne as EnchantressJune Moone (Suicide Squad)It’s not been plain sailing swapping the catwalk for the big screen for this aristocratic supermodel-turned-actor, specifically with her role in this puerile comic book film. She plays June Moone, an archeological boffin transformed into a bikini-clad witch by some haunted dust. The film got devastatingly bad reviews, despite doing well at the box office. It may well be a performance Delevingne would like to forget. (CC)434 31. David Thewlis as Ares (Wonder Woman)The one area of Wonder Woman we don’t like to talk about is its villain, as his appearance in the film’s final act turns a smart and funny movie into one just like all the others – namely with two superpowered beings throwing things at each other.

Which might explain why Patrick Wilson, playing Aquaman’s dastardly half-brother Orm, has fallen so rapidly out of memory. (AW)634 29. Faye Dunaway as Selena (Supergirl)The doomed Supergirl movie is a living testament to how badly Mommie Dearest impacted the career of Faye Dunaway, with her turn as a witchy supervillain with a dangerous love spell at her disposal secretly the nadir of her Eighties career. She may nail a certain level of camp here, whether deliberate or not, but Dunaway is certainly no good – it’s no surprise she was awarded a Razzie for her performance. (AW)734 28. Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor (Superman Returns)A big gulp in 2019 for obvious reasons, but also pretty regretful because it\u0027s an incredibly dull performance from an actor who was, whether we like to admit it or not, masterful at playing villains in his prime. Here, however, Spacey is just a snooze. (AW)834 27. Yahya Abdul-Mahteen III as Black Manta (Aquaman)About as threatening as a Power Rangers villain and just as stupid-looking, Aquaman\u0027s recurring nemesis is more a perpetual irritant than someone particularly enjoyable to watch. (AW)934 26. Liam Neeson as Ra\u0027s al Ghul (Batman Begins)Ra\u0027s al Ghul, or The Demon\u0027s Head in Arabic, jumped on the climate activism bandwagon nice and early. For him, the human race is a cancer poisoning the Earth, and he wants to eliminate people to save the world from environmental disaster. Neeson played the villain so well because he really believed in him. “It was quite a good argument he comes up with,” the actor said. Terrifying. (EH)1034 25. Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr Freeze (Batman \u0026amp Robin)Arnold Schwarzenegger wasn\u0027t so much playing Mr Freeze in Batman \u0026amp Robin as he was The Pun King, few surviving his merciless deployment of woeful gags. Schwarzenegger is by no means good here, but he\u0027s absolutely captivating nonetheless. (AW)1134 24. Sharon Stone as Laurel Hedare (Catwoman)Only one of the worst DC villains because her evil plot was to poison Gotham City via killer face cream, Laurel Hedare at least allowed Sharon Stone to be devious, slinky and cartoonish for the first time since Basic Instinct. It\u0027s a very minor victory, though. (AW)1234 23. Jared Leto as Joker (Suicide Squad)It would be easy to pity Jared Leto, who was always going to be compared to the late Heath Ledger’s transcendent portrayal of the Joker in Christopher Nolan’s The Dark Knight, if it weren’t for how much hype he built up before Suicide Squad was even released. There were the tattoos, his green hair, a shiny grill in his mouth, and a ludicrous number of articles about his supposed bad behaviour on set. So it was downright embarrassing when it turned out Joker wasn’t even the lead villain in the movie, and instead just an annoyance who turns up to mock the lead cast every now and then. (RO)1334 22. Marion Cotillard as Miranda Tate (The Dark Knight Rises)Although many will purely remember Cotillard’s performance in The Dark Knight Rises for that awfully awkward death scene, she was great in the rest of the movie. She played one of Batman’s most interesting female adversaries with a slyness and a deception that was mysteriously alluring and effective. (EH)1434 21. Michael Shannon as General Zod (Man of Steel)The kind of role Shannon could play in his sleep, his General Zod is more angsty and human than his live-action predecessors playing the same character, but harmed by the relentlessly dank surroundings of Zack Snyder’s film. He’s also saddled with the most unflattering haircut in all of DC movie history, which couldn’t have helped. (AW)1534 20. Tom Hardy as Bane (The Dark Knight Rises)1634 19. Burgess Meredith as The Penguin (Batman 1966)Entirely unsubtle work from Meredith here, the actor grinding his teeth and chewing on the end of a large, thin cigarette to emphasise the Penguin’s dastardly villainy. But it’s a lot of fun to behold nonetheless. (AW)1734 18. Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor (Superman)The Oscar-winning actor was easily the most fun incarnation of Lex Luthor when he was cast in the 1978 Superman. As the hero’s arch nemesis, his light-hearted and theatrical portrayal came across as more comical than menacing. But despite the fact it was hard to take him as a serious threat, he was still a compelling villain to watch. He reprised the role in Superman II and Superman IV: The Quest for Peace. (CC)1834 17. Parker Posey as Kitty Kowalski (Superman Returns)One of the few bright spots in an otherwise drab and rapidly forgotten Superman reboot, Parker Posey very much plays to type here. But it\u0027s such a delicious, mischievous performance, all eccentricity and barely-concealed madness, that it\u0027s not remotely a problem. (AW)1934 16. Joaquin Phoenix as Joker (Joker)The role that, for better and for worse, Phoenix was born to play, his Joker is disturbing and brilliantly oddball. But it’s a performance that is also suffocating by nature of how present it is. Without any respite, in the form of a Christian Bale or a Michael Keaton, it ends up feeling a lot like Phoenix swallowing you whole, and that’s not the best of experiences. (AW)2034 15. Anne Hathaway as Selina Kyle (The Dark Knight Rises)Catwoman – the thieving, on-again, off-again love interest of Batman – was brought to life brilliantly by Anne Hathaway who deftly encapsulated her slinky, feline energy and gave an emotionally nuanced performance which offered a fresh perspective on the character after Michelle Pfeiffer’s turn in the Nineties. (EH)2134 14. Lee Meriwether as Catwoman (Batman 1966)The actor, who is now 84, is unforgettable in her portrayal of Catwoman in the 1966 film. Using feline movements when she walks, she winds up with one of the best scenes in any Batman: when disguised as a Soviet reporter called Miss Kitka, complete with Sixties Beehive hair, she seduces Adam West’s Caped Crusader so she can abduct him. They have a very passionate kiss, but when he figures out she is Catwoman, he is heartbroken. (CC)2234 13. Cesar Romero as Joker (Batman 1966)It may be an unpopular opinion, but Cesar Romero always had the best Joker laugh – a shrill, gleeful racket of purely mad joy. He’s also one of the few actors to play the character without a heap of exhausting off-screen intensity, too. With his white makeup merely painted over his moustache because Romero couldn’t be bothered to shave it off, there’s a blissful, unique ease to his work in the original Batman movie. (AW)2334 12. Uma Thurman as Poison Ivy (Batman \u0026amp Robin)Batman \u0026amp Robin may feature a vast ensemble of stars all acting in very different films, but Uma Thurman is the only one truly in keeping with the gaudy, camp vision that director Joel Schumacher (probably?) had in mind for it. Her Poison Ivy is basically a ludicrous, plant-groping drag queen dressed occasionally in a gorilla suit, and playing up the absurdity is arguably the smartest acting choice in the whole damn film. (AW)2434 11. Jim Carrey as The Riddler (Batman Forever)Released at the peak of Carrey’s Nineties fame, Batman Forever didn’t cast Carrey because he would be perfect for The Riddler, but because they wanted Jim Carrey – squirming, scenery-chewing, face-contorting and all. It ends up falling somewhere between genuinely brilliant and mildly awful, but on occasion becomes actually chilling. (AW)2534 10. Frank Gorshin as The Riddler (Batman 1966)Gorshin’s work on the original Sixties Batman series, and its 1966 film, has always been underappreciated. It’s partly due to The Riddler himself, a character notorious in Batman’s rogues gallery of villains, but always one that has struggled to be well portrayed on-screen. But Gorshin tried his best, morphing his Riddler into a sinister genius with a maniacal laugh and a fearsome, intimidating intelligence. (AW)2634 9. Tommy Lee Jones as Two-Face (Batman Forever)“I will not sanction your buffoonery,” Jones reportedly told his co-star Jim Carrey on the Batman Forever set. One of the most notorious examples of Jones\u0027s famed workplace grouchiness, his unhappiness working on the film at least wasn\u0027t visible on screen. He\u0027s fantastic here, all mad cackling and hysterical showboating. (AW)2734 8. Cillian Murphy as Scarecrow (Batman Begins)Cillian Murphy didn’t get the screentime he needed – or deserved – to really develop what could have been one of DC’s most intriguing villains: a corrupt psychopharmacologist testing his wares on the inmates at Arkham Asylum. What works is his understated manner and appearance Scarecrow didn’t need an outlandish costume because the terror he instilled was all in your head. (RO)2834 7. Christopher Walken as Max Schreck (Batman Returns)The true villain of Batman Returns, the tragic humanity of Catwoman and The Penguin entirely lacking in Schreck\u0027s capitalist, salacious and pro-gentrification business mogul. It\u0027s no surprise there have been Trump comparisons in the years since. But it\u0027s also important to not forget quite how brilliant Walken is in the role, too. (AW)2934 6. Aaron Eckhart as Two-Face (The Dark Knight)Less spoken about by nature of the stunning work by Heath Ledger elsewhere in The Dark Knight, Aaron Eckhart is also the film\u0027s secret weapon. His Harvey Dent is noble and well-intentioned and dripping with vaguely Kennedy-esque suave, which only makes his eventual transformation into Two-Face that much more tragic. (AW)3034 5. Danny DeVito as The Penguin (Batman Returns)3134 4. Terence Stamp as General Zod (Superman II)A villain played with delicious apathy and verve by Terence Stamp, General Zod is far and away the finest nemesis Christopher Reeve’s Superman ever had to face off against. Ruthless, menacing and dressed like the coolest cat on the Studio 54 dancefloor, he’s a blast. (AW)3234 3. Jack Nicholson as The Joker (Batman)The only thing lacking from Jack Nicholson’s Joker is an element of surprise. Even in 1989, there was something admittedly tried-and-tested about Nicholson playing insanity with such ripe conviction on screen. But regardless, his work here is terrifying – not quite Jack Torrance levels, but equally as captivating. It’s no wonder he got top billing over the guy who actually played Batman. (AW)3334 2. Heath Ledger as The Joker (The Dark Knight)The best of the best: Heath Ledger transformed himself completely and made the role his own opposite Christian Bale’s Batman in The Dark Knight. His performance was so outstanding that he has become the gold standard to which all other actors aspire when they take on a villainous role. It’s hard to believe there will ever be a better Joker. (RO)3434 1. Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman (Batman Returns)The mystery over Catwoman\u0027s moral allegiances has been alive almost as long as she has in comic book lore, but it also makes her the most captivating sort-of nemesis in all of the DC movies. Michelle Pfeiffer is a sensual, terrifying and incredibly funny presence throughout Batman Returns, her irresistible allure making her the most threatening inidual Batman has ever faced off against. She also gives one of the greatest performances not only in comic book movies but in all movies entirely, to whom all her successors, Catwoman or not, can\u0027t help but pail in comparison. (AW)Prior to this Margo Robbie appeared as Harley Quinn in Suicide Squad, a film which had a record-breaking $133.6m ($103.6m) opening.\u0026nbspIt’s possible the film’s R-rating held back younger female audiences from being able to enjoy the film.\u0026nbspThe Birds of Prey comic writer Gail Simone has criticised the film’s depiction of the character of Cassandra Cain. While in the original comics, Cass struggles with speech, reading and socialisation, this aspect of her character was largely missing from the film. Simone detailed in a Twitter thread that she sees this as a “missed opportunity”, adding “I love Cass dearly, and this is not a Cass I recognize.”The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Daniel Kaluuya and Jodie Turner-Smith are the unlikely couple thrust together on a go-nowhere blind date, only for tragedy to transform them into folk heroes roaming across the USA searching for shelter. It’s a spellbinding debut. (Adam White) Guaranteed to be one of the major players in next year’s Oscars, Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite works better the less you know about it. What you should know is that it is a devilishly inventive deconstruction of class, brimming with energy, dark humour and nervous tension. (Adam White) Rising from the ashes of the aborted Universal Monsters multiverse, which was due to star Johnny Depp and Tom Cruise, this rebooted Invisible Man uses the iconic branding to tell the smaller and far more intriguing story of a woman on the run from her invisible ex. Elisabeth Moss is the domestic violence survivor convinced that her supposedly dead boyfriend has merely mastered the art of invisibility. Leigh Whannell, who directed 2018’s wonderfully inventive sci-fi thriller Upgrade, is behind the camera. (Adam White) A Quiet Place would surely have been better off as a standalone film, but the financial success of writer-director John Krasinski’s B-movie-style horror tale put paid to that. This isn’t to say there’s no more story to tell. In fact, Krasinski made no secret of the fact he had a whole universe he could one day explore, and sure enough, joining returning stars Emily Blunt, Millicent Thomas and Noah Jupe (so brilliant in Honey Boy) are new additions in the form of Cillian Murphy and Djimon Honsou. (Jacob Stolworthy) 519 No Time to DieWhile Daniel Craig’s Bond tenure has been marked by severe whiplash in terms of quality, there remains something incredibly exciting about the arrival of a new 007 movie. No Time to Die, Craig’s final outing as the super-spy, also boasts an intoxicating array of talent on and off screen, from Cary Fukunaga on directorial duties, to a script co-written by Phoebe Waller-Bridge and cast newcomers including Ana de Armas, Rami Malek and Lashana Lynch. (Adam White) Little is known about the plot for Antebellum, the feature film debut of artists and music video directors Gerard Bush and Christopher Renz. But the thriller\u0027s trailer is a visual feast, with Janelle Monáe appearing to be caught between the present day and the horrors of a 19th century plantation. From producer Jordan Peele, director of Get Out and Us, it also features Jena Malone, Gabourey Sidibe and Kiersey Clemons. (Adam White)719 The Woman in the WindowAn adaptation of the pulpy bestseller (which itself was engulfed in mystery when a New Yorker feature claimed its author, AJ Finn, had extensively lied about his personal life and history), The Woman in the Window puts Amy Adams centre stage for the first time since 2018’s Sharp Objects. She’s an agoraphobic psychologist convinced she has witnessed a murder across the street from her apartment. Julianne Moore, Gary Oldman and Brian Tyree Henry co-star. (Adam White) Watchmen star Yahya Abdul-Mateen III continues his incredible ascent with the starring role in this remake. Produced by the ubiquitous Jordan Peele, the new Candyman revives the hook-handed killer originated in 1992’s genuinely terrifying Bernard Rose film, but with a black and female director and predominantly black cast – which ought to mean the frustratingly ambiguous racial themes of the original can finally be given their due. (Adam White) The sequel to 2017’s mega successful Wonder Woman is a rare thing: a DC film worthy of excitement. The first outing saw Patty Jenkins become the highest-grossing woman director in cinema history, and she’s looking to beat her own record with a follow-up centred on the Amazon princess’s battle against a villain named Cheetah (Kristen Wiig in her superhero film debut). That Jenkins describes it as “a grand tentpole like they use to make in the 1980s” is reason alone to mark its release on your 2020 calendar. (Jacob Stolworthy) Soul is a curious new Pixar film that appears to emulate the philosophical wonder of Inside Out with the lived-in cultural exploration of Coco. Jamie Foxx is a struggling musician who finally gets his big break, only to experience a freak accident that propels him into a mysterious netherworld in which souls are imbued with talents and passions, before being implanted in newborn babies. It looks gorgeous, is potentially insane, and is co-written by Tina Fey. (Adam White) Hours after the first reviews of both Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker and Cats took over social media, Warner Bros dropped the trailer for Tenet, Christopher Nolan’s top secret espionage thriller. It’s fair to say plenty of sunshine was stolen – and for good reason. Tenet marks Nolan’s return to the mind-melting thrills of Inception and, while the plot remains unknown, it seems to focus on a team of heroes who must rewind time to prevent the outbreak of war. Sign us up. (Jacob Stolworthy) Tom Cruise is taking a (short) break from carrying out impossible missions in 2020. Instead, he’ll return to the cockpit for a sequel to the daddy of all Eighties films, Top Gun. There’ll surely be an element of “teach new dogs old tricks” in the Joseph Kosinski-directed film as Pete “Maverick” Mitchell mentors a new generation of US Navy fighter pilots. We’re hopeful the result will – wait for it – take our breath away. (Jacob Stolworthy) 1319 Barb and Star Go to Vista Del MarIt’s not the Bridesmaids sequel everyone begged for nearly a decade ago, but Barb and Star is its spiritual follow-up at least. Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumulo, the women behind the 2011 smash, write and star in this new comedy, playing two best friends who venture out of their small Midwestern community for the very first time. They soon get mixed up in a villainous plot to kill an entire town, while Jamie Dornan and Damon Wayans Jr also star. (Adam White) 1419 The Many Saints of NewarkWhether you like it or not, a film prequel based on The Sopranos is being released in 2020. The presence of David Chase, the HBO show’s creator, goes a long way to abate any concerns fans might have, and it’ll at least be a fine chance to explore the mobsters’s family history. The film is expected to focus on Dickie Moltisanti, the father of Christopher, whose memory loomed large over the series. (Jacob Stolworthy) 1519 Last Night in SohoEdgar Wright is adding “psychological horror” to his filmmaking repertoire with Last Night in Soho, a neon-soaked thrill ride starring quite the ensemble (Anya Taylor-Joy, Matt Smith, Diana Rigg). The intriguing plot focuses on a young girl for whom “time falls apart” after she’s somehow transported to the 1960s. It sounds like a cult hit in waiting. (Jacob Stolworthy) The feel-good West End smash is transformed into a feel-good movie, with Richard E Grant, Sarah Lancashire and Sharon Horgan leading the story of a teenage boy who overcomes insecurity by embracing drag. Newcomer Max Harwood portrays the title character. (Adam White) Regardless of whether you’re a keen follower of the Marvel Cinematic Universe or not, The Eternals should pique your interest. Sure, it may be spearheading a brand new phase of Marvel franchises – there really is no end to the studios’ box office stronghold – but it features what has to be one of the most eclectic casts ever seen in a superhero film: Angelina Jolie, Kit Harington, Kumail Nanjiani, Brian Tyree Henry and Salma Hayek. Colour us intrigued. (Jacob Stolworthy) Alberto E. RodriguezGetty Images for DisneyA remake of David Lynch’s Dune would ordinarily cause our eyeballs to rattle around our sockets, but not when Denis Villeneuve’s in the director’s chair. So committed to his vision is Warner Bros that they ignored the fact his breathtaking Blade Runner sequel flopped and handed him the keys to a fresh adaptation of Herbert Ross’ novel. He did direct Prisoners, Enemy and Arrival, after all. Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya head up the cast. (Jacob Stolworthy) Long in the works, Steven Spielberg’s West Side Story looks set to be a festive smash this time next year. Speculated to be closer in spirit to the original Stephen Sondheim musical than the iconic 1961 film, this new version casts Ansel Elgort as Tony and newcomer Rachel Zegler as Maria – the latter, incredibly, beat out more than 30,000 candidates for the role, after submitting an audition video via Twitter. (Adam White)An intoxicating and romantic drama about lovers on the run, Queen \u0026amp Slim marks the first feature film from Melina Matsoukas, the director responsible for music videos including Beyoncé’s “Formation”. Daniel Kaluuya and Jodie Turner-Smith are the unlikely couple thrust together on a go-nowhere blind date, only for tragedy to transform them into folk heroes roaming across the USA searching for shelter. It’s a spellbinding debut. (Adam White) Guaranteed to be one of the major players in next year’s Oscars, Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite works better the less you know about it.

They have even seen that limited numbers of them appear to repeat.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut the new breakthrough, spotted by scientists using a telescope in Canada and described in an early paper published online, is the first time that researchers have seen the blasts appearing in a regular, predictable pattern.Astronomers have no confirmed explanation for the FRBs, with the only certain fact about their origin that they must be coming from somewhere very extreme and unusual. Proposed explanations have included everything from alien civilisations sending us messages to a star falling into a black hole, but the fact that the messages are repeating have led some scientists to lead out such cataclysmic causes.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

Over the course of the cycle, the bursts will appear intensely for a four day flurry that sees a signal come every hour or more, and then it will go quiet for 12 days.That pattern is an important clue to the nature of this object, the researchers write in the new paper.Are aliens sending us messages from light years away?It appears to be coming from the edge of a massive spiral galaxy, about 500 million light years away, the researchers say. But there are few other clues about where it could be coming from or the processes that may have given rise to it.The fact that it is repeating over a predictable period could suggest that it is coming from a binary system, since other objects in space that demonstrate similar characteristics tend to be binary systems, too. The object could be being swung around by a star or black hole, and the periodic blasts could be an indication that the object is facing us during those times, the researchers say.It could also be possible that winds or tidal disruptions from the black hole block the signal during the periods it is silent, they note.The repeating signals were spotted by the\u0026nbspCanadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment, which spends time looking for more FRBs in an attempt to find their origin. It should spend more time looking at the source of the current bursts – known as\u0026nbspFRB 180916.J0158+65 – in an attempt to learn more about it, the researchers conclude in their paper, which is for now published on the website ArXiv before being peer reviewed and published in a journal.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He also complained that users were forced to open their laptop and sit in uncomfortable positions.Waititi didn\u0027t specify which Apple keyboard or computer he so disliked. While he did make a passing reference to the iMac, his focus appears also to have been on the MacBook, which has accrued some unwanted fame for the reliability and feel of its keys in recent years.Late last year, Apple introduced a new keyboard with its new 16-inch MacBook Pro. At the time, Apple executive Phil Schiller told\u0026nbspThe Independent that engineers had redesigned the keys in line with feedback from users, and that changes in the design should prevent the problems reported with the previous versions.Waititi did not indicate whether he had tried that new keyboard,\u0026nbspwhich has not been rolled out to other laptops in Apple\u0027s line-up yet.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It\u0027s reasonable, it\u0027s proportionate, and something the British people would expect us to do for foreign criminals who have committed very serious crimes who should be sent back to their countries where they have a right to reside elsewhere, he said.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Many of those scheduled to be on this flight are not hardened criminals, but one-time drug offenders.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The majority of the patients had contracted the virus from being in contact with people from Wuhan, where the centre of the outbreak is.More than 80 percent of patients developed lymphopenia, which is a state where a specific white blood cell that is part of the body’s first-line defence against diseases is reduced.Lymphopenia is commonly caused by infections and the flu, and usually recovers on its own after the patient recovers.The 55 patients observed in the study were admitted into the intensive care unit, some with severe pneumonia as a result of the virus. Of those patients, 15 died.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Note this happened  days ago and none are displaying any symptoms.It comes as the Government declared coronavirus a serious and imminent threat to public health as it introduced new powers to deal with the spread of the virus.Under new powers announced today, the health ministry said people with the illness can now be forcibly quarantined and will not be free to leave, and can be forcibly sent into isolationthey pose a threat to public health.The measures are understood to have been introduced after a Brit attempted to flee a Milton Keynes quarantine centre.Around  Brits were flown to Arrowe Park in the city from coronavirus ground zero Wuhan and have agreed to remain there for the -day quarantine period.Meanwhile,  more people on the quarantined Diamond Princess cruise ship in the port of Yokohama have tested positive for the disease.There are now  confirmed cases on the ship with more than , people, including  Brits, still in a -day quarantine on board.And where in the UK, a University of York student and their relative are still being treated at the Royal Victoria Infirmary infectious diseases centre in Newcastle for the bug.There have been more than , cases of the virus globally, mostly in China, while the death toll in China now stands at .More to follow...For the latest news on this story keep checking back at Sun Online.Thesun is your go to destination for the best celebrity news, football news, real-le stories, jaw-dropping pictures and must-see video.Download our fantastic, new and improved free App for the best ever Sun Online experience.

Earning huge sums of money while hanging out with your sporting heroes, favourite actresses and musicians.But Chris and Jordan* are just two of a growing number of Brits who are making new lives for themselves abroad by acting as a well-connected middle man.Chris, , moved to the United Arab Emirates four years ago, tempted by the tax-free salaries and luxury living.He started off as an estate agent, but working on a commission-only basis meant he struggled to fund his expensive tastes.One night, a friend introduced him to a Premier League footballer and it sparked an unlikely new career.Today, Chris is the go-to guy for top sports stars, reality television stars and Instagram influencers in Dubai. He tells us he can now make up to £, a month from famous faces who want him to deliver the perfect holiday.And he says it is something most people could make a good living out of with a bit of nous, charm and luck.He tells us: “I started out a few years ago with absolutely no experience in this kind of thing and with no celebrity contacts to help me. But I slowly grew my contacts book through word of mouth and now I am even turning people away who I don’t think are worth the hassle.“The key is taking the rough with the smooth. There are going to be dficult times, but you just have to deal with them and remember you are nothing without your reputation.”But Chris has had more than his fair share of trouble in paradise.He says: “On the face of it, I am living the best le in the world. My friends back home see me on Instagram partying with famous faces, enjoying boozy parties, the best food and the hottest nightclubs.“What they don’t see is that I’ve had to live in a tiny maid’s room for a year because a reality star didn’t pay me the £, bill he racked up on champagne and drugs.“I’ve tried desperately to get it back, but he doesn’t answer his phone and he blocked me on social media, so I don’t think I’ll be seeing that money again.“I had another bad experience with a soap actress who flew over for the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. I got her into an ultra-exclusive yacht party with some rich UAE businessmen, but she downed so much champagne she vomited on the dance floor. Needless to say, I wasn’t invited to the party the following year.”For Chris, image is everything.He tells how he uses a range of tactics to give the impression he is the perfect one-stop VIP concierge, from hiring designer suits for the day to blagging free hotel stays and slap-up meals in exchange for Instagram posts from stars.On one occasion, he was so desperate to impress an England international footballer, he rented a stunning apartment in the world’s tallest building, the Burj Khala, that cost £, for one night – just so he could pretend it was his own home.He says: “I deal with really expensive experiences, so sometimes I have to stump up my own cash as I don’t want people to think I’m a fraud. Helicopter rides, boozy brunches, supercar rentals - they all cost money. In thrill-a-minute Dubai, money can buy you anythingyou know the right people.But his work has sometimes left him having panic attacks and fearing jail when things go wrong.He says: “The clients I deal with are usually pretty high net worth people, but it’s definitely true that money can’t buy class.“One of my clients was a really arrogant singer who thought he was the king of Dubai, even though hardly anyone outside of the UK would know who he is.“He got drunk and had a minor brawl with a guy in a bar, but he was so paranoid about the Dubai police scare stories he had heard that he went straight to the airport and flew home.”The UAE is an Islamic country and has uber-strict laws on alcohol, drugs and public indecency. Chris says that some tourists arrive in Dubai believing boozing is illegal and women must dress conservatively, but are surprised when they see how liberal the desert city really is.High-class prostitutes are a familiar sight in many nightclubs, and while drugs such as cocaine and MDMA are not quite as accessible as in the UK, they can still be bought from well-connected dealers.“Dubai is nowhere near as strict as people often think it is,” says Chris. “You see scare stories in the news but there is always more to them than meets the eye.“It’s the perfect place for British celebrities to come and let their hair down as the huge cultural ersity means they aren’t as likely to be recognised as they would be at home.“Often the celeb will be posting a beach photo on Instagram to give the impression of a chilled break, while in real le they’re up to their eyes in drugs, sex and once-in-a-letime thrills.”Dubai’s reputation as a party paradise has been hard earned over many years, but celebrities are always keen to discover new and exciting destinations.The picture perfect Greek island of Mykonos has now firmly established itself as a rival to the UAE when it comes to A-list visitors.Celebrities are lured by the dazzling blue waters, rugged scenery and, of course, the luxury lestyle on offer.Jordan, , is a DJ living in oil rich Abu Dhabi, but has a network of contacts in Mykonos that allows him to spread his net a little further.Now he has a phone book full of famous faces who drop him a line when they want the inside track on the holiday hotspot.He says: “Mykonos is definitely rivalling Ibiza and Dubai in the holiday stakes, but it’s not all about partying.“This year, the likes of Kendall Jenner, Cristiano Ronaldo and Leigh-Ann Pinnock have all been here to enjoy some downtime.“I’ve probably made more than £, working with a number of UK celebrities over the summer, helping them with everything from organising mega parties to doing their laundry.“It’s a millionaires’ playground, for sure, and while it generally attracts a higher-class crowd than most places, you still get plenty of people who take things too far.”He recalls: “I helped an international footballer out when he arrived here in summer and hired an expensive boat for him and his mates. But they got drunk and absolutely trashed it. There were a few smashed windows, and a big dent in one of the safety rails on the side of the boat, and it cost thousands of pounds to repair it.“I also caught a reality star having sex on the beach after a particularly boozy night out. I can’t help but feel bad for his long-term girlfriend, who he’s always posting about his love for on Instagram.”Many of us wish we could make a living out of travelling the world like a growing number of travel influencers.And while for some it is little more than a pipe dream, Jordan has his sights firmly set on global domination. His job in Abu Dhabi allows him the flexibility to travel regularly and he hopes one day to become a full-time travel influencer.He says: “I always used to see people on Instagram who had given up their jobs to travel the world and I always wondered how they could afford it. But it turns out anyone with a decent number of followers on social media can blag free hotel stays in exchange for posts.“I’ve collaborated with a few places around the world and got free stays, and I’m hoping in a few years to quit working and do that full-time.“I love being able to do what I do now and it is a lot of fun, but I know I won’t be able to do it forever.“My dream is to be able tohome to the UK and buy a house in the countryside mortgage-free, then retire by the age of .”* The names in this story have been changed to protect their identity.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There is often hope where we may first see ­dficulty. You just have to look a bit harder sometimes.In Portpatrick, at Scotland’s bottom left corner, the harbour had fallen into miserable disrepair. A plan was hatched to stop the rot.A local hero organised a share issue for locals to raise the money to buy the harbour and restore the buildings around it. The village now has its pecker up again and the future looks bright.It’s a similar story on Anglesey. At Halen Mon a thriving family business draws water out of the Menai Strait, harvests the salt and sells it all over the world.Near there I met a woman called Sian Sykes who cared about those waters so much she paddle-boarded  miles around Anglesey picking out the plastic.Asthat wasn’t enough, she then paddled the whole coast of Wales doing exactly the same.But my favourite character round there is no longer with us. On the very western tip of Holy Island off Anglesey’s west coast, there is the South Stack lighthouse. It’s been saving sailors from watery deaths since .A hundred years ago, John Jones was its keeper and it was his great granddaughter Denise Shaw who took me up to the top of it.Denise showed me a photograph of her great-grandad sporting a magnicent moustache the seagulls must have coveted for their nests.He was no loner, though. Denise remembers her mum saying old great-gramps was a bit of a ladies’ man.And what a chat-up line he had at his disposal: “Do you want to come back to my place to see how bright my light is ”All four of the areas we’ve looked at for this series of Our Coast are around the Irish Sea. I had a brilliant time at Belfast docks where I joined the harbour pilots, whose work astounded me.It’s their job to bring the giant ships safely into port.I sort of assumed they did this by chugging out to meet them, lighting up a sign saying, “follow me” and gently leading them to their berths.Far from it. Round the clock, all year round, whatever the weather, they race out several miles to pull up alongside these huge vessels.Incredibly, a rope ladder is dropped over the side for the pilots to clamber aboard, make their way to the bridge, take over the controls and steer these monsters into tight spaces on the docks.The ship I boarded with them, somewhat terried, was carrying grain from Romania.As my man took the helm I asked the Polish skipper which country had the best harbour pilots. “You do,” he said, with feeling.Back across the Irish Sea, in Formby, north of Liverpool, I met Mike McComb in the £million place he’s built himself a stone’s throw from the sea.He has more bedrooms, bathrooms and children than I could count .His fortune could have bought him a lavish home anywhere in the world. But it was up here, along the endless beach, that back in the day he and his mates would come on their bikes from their tiny homes in Bootle.So, he tells me as we stand on the beach, lashed by rain and wind, you can keep St Tropez or Malibu. This coast, his coast, is where he’ll stay.The sea seems to be a magnet for the most memorable people, from Grace the crane engineer in Belfast Docks who played rugby for Ireland in three rugby world cups, to Sandy the tattooed pagan near Stranraer who says the sea’s our mother, and the Bulgarian dissident I chanced upon sitting in a hot tub ­surveying Liverpool from the deck of the Queen Mary .My grandad used to tell me that when you put your toe in the sea you’re connected with the whole world.With that in mind, I’ve enjoyed many a paddle this summer reflecting on the power and history of what our island nation is all about.And I urge you to do it, too. After all, it’s pretty easy. Britain’s most landlocked place — Coton in the Elms in Derbyshire — is just  miles from the coast. So none of us is more than a couple of hours away from the sea.There’s never been a more relevant time to get out to the edges and see the soul of this country.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But it saddened us all because it felt like this incredible human being would go on for ever.He headed the Douglas dynasty with a zest for le that put the rest of us to shame and was one of our final links to Hollywood’s golden age.Long before actors ostentatiously wore their hearts on their sleeves and made self-aggrandising speeches about the latest trendy cause, Kirk determinedly set out to do the right thing, regardless of any impact on his career.In the Fties, at the height of the Cold War, he stood up to a paranoid US government that considered anyone to the left of Genghis Khan a Soviet sympathiser.The McCarthy witchhunts ruined careers and wrecked lives, but Kirk dug in his heels and hired blacklisted writer Dalton Trumbo to work on Spartacus, which would become Kirk’s most famous movie.That took balls of steel.Kirk gave millions to charity and was a US Goodwill Ambassador, receiving the Presidential Medal of Freedom from Jimmy Carter in .He experienced heartache with the death of his son Eric from an overdose and the jailing of grandson Cameron for drug offences.But even a near-fatal helicopter crash and a stroke couldn’t defeat Kirk.His son Michael — a superstar in his own right, of course — told me last year his dad worked out almost every day with a personal trainer and remained as sharp as a tack, keeping the whole extended family on their toes.I was lucky enough to interview Kirk back in my days with TV-am.The Beeb would fly them over from LA and put them up in a posh hotel.All we could offer was a hearty breakfast, plus the chance to talk about themselves and their new project for as long as they liked.There were no pesky managers and PRs to go through.Bette Davis, Burt Lancaster, Lauren Bacall and Sammy Davis Jnr all popped into our studio at the crack of sparrows, staying for the duration of the show.Kirk was here in , promoting Dance With The Devil, a racy novel that bore a passing resemblance to his extraordinary le story.After his Jewish parents escaped persecution in Russia, Kirk was born and raised in a poor area of New York.It is a real rags-to-riches tale. His dad actually worked as a rag-and-bone man.Kirk never forgot where he came from, which is perhaps why he became a champion for justice and a fairer society.He was a delight that morning and even laughed when the crew declared, “I’m Spartacus”, one after another in his honour — though he must have seen it done hundreds of times before.He was a also a much-loved husband, father, grandfather and great-grandfather.The Douglas clan will be in mourning but they can celebrate a le well lived.This weekend, I am on a Kirk Douglas marathon, starting with Paths Of Glory, before The Bad And The Beautul, Ace In The Hole, The Vikings, Lust For Le and, of course, Spartacus.Tomorrow’s Oscars will rightly honour him. We won’t see his like again.I WAS honoured to host The Millies this week.It is a wonderful event run by The Sun to salute our Armed Forces and give us all a chance to say a huge thank you.As always, there were astonishing stories of bravery, courage and self-sacrice.And as always, our lovely winners told me they were nothing special, just doing their job.I honestly don’t think they realise just how remarkable they are, or how much we owe them.One of my highlights was seeing -year-old Private Fin Doherty collect his award for inspiring others.Fin was just six when his paratrooper big brother JJ was killed in action in Afghanistan.Fin was determined to follow in JJ’s footsteps to honour his brother’s memory, and join the Parachute Regiment.He has been an outstanding addition and, in an emotional ceremony, was presented with JJ’s beret in December.Their mum Joyce admits she struggled with Fin’s decision to sign up, following the death of her eldest son.But she knew it was all Fin wanted – and she is so very proud of him.We honestly don’t deserve such an inspirational young man. But thank the Lord we have him on our side.NOTHING has changed. Phillip Schofield is exactly the same person he was before he felt the time was right to tell the world he’s gay.He’s still a loving father and husband and will still host his TV shows with consummate professionalism and skill.As Phillip said himself, you never know what people are struggling with every day and, for him, it was time to be honest with himself and everyone .I’m really glad that he has made the decision and very proud of him, although obviously it can’t have been easy.There’s been lots of tears, sleepless nights and a great deal of soul-searching. I hope he now finds peace of mind.He is a very lucky man to have a family and friends who love him very much and just want him to be happy.He also has a loyal fan base who love watching him on This Morning and that won’t change. Why would it Of course, he can expect a small number of bigots and homophobes to spew out hateful bile, but they are to be pitied and ignored.Those carping about why he took so long also need to shut up.People should be allowed to come out when it feels the right time for them.Phillip began his career at a time when being openly gay in a TV presenting role was just not an option.Thank goodness things have changed and he can be open now – and know that the overwhelmingly vast majority of us wish him and his family nothing but the very best.I was really touched by what he said about interviewing brave people on This Morning, and realising that he had to be just like them and tell his truth.Love comes in many dferent forms.Phillip and his we Stephanie adore each other and that won’t change. Again, why on earth would it At the end of his statement Phillip urged us all to be kind, especially to his family, and I hope we all take those words on board.Let’s wish them all the best and let them get on with their lives.WHAT a furore over a bare shoulder. Actress-turned-MP Tracy Brabin didn’t deserve the vitriol about her outfit but it WAS distracting.It’s unfortunate because Tracy was making important points about journalists being shut out of No  briefings – a move that makes my blood run cold and threatens Press freedom. Sadly, no one was really listening.Tracy told me she had been at a music event and didn’t expect to be back in the House. She is bemused by all the fuss.How those in public le dress should not detract from their message, be it a female MP in a low-cut top or mini-skirt, or a man wearing a gaudy tie or tight trousers.Our MPs are not known for their style and rarely make headlines for their fashion sense.I am very happy for them to keep it that way.WELL, that was a rather ill-advised memo to send, reminding local councils to fly the Union Flag on February  as a “celebration” of Prince Andrew’s birthday.I had no idea this was a “thing” and that Andrew was on a list of VIPs whose birthdays are marked with a flag waving on the roof of our town halls, instead of just cake and prosecco like the rest of us.Unsurprisingly, this ludicrous edict has caused much disgruntlement.As we know, Andrew has been booted out of The Firm by his own mum after that disastrous TV interview delving into his friendship with the American paedophile Jeffrey Epstein.Then there is the ongoing scandal over whether or not Andrew will be interviewed by the FBI as part of its investigations into child trafficking allegations against Epstein.It is all very sordid and murky. Surely even his nearest and dearest would agree this is not the time for official celebrations.He is no longer a working royal and has no place on that list.Time to lower the flags for good. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But I can’t be sure, as I have other things to think about like: I need some new trousers.Then out of the blue she announced on social media that she was going to speak out because “mine and my families le is no longer up for entertainment or gossip”.“Wow,” I thought. “That’s amazing. She doesn’t know how to use apostrophes.”It turns out, however, that while she can’t write properly, she can at least think straight because she never did speak out. Which means she stopped the story from rearing up again.If only Prince Andrew was as bright. We were all dimly aware that he knew a man in America who’d had lots of sex with young girls.And that one day, this man had been found dead in a police cell. Then we went back to wonderingwe needed more washing-up liquid.Prince Andrew, however, decided that instead of letting the story die down by not saying anything, he’d go on television to set the record straight.It was a disaster. He was suddenly front-page news all over the world and he looked guilty as hell.Of what, we weren’t sure. But whatever it was, we all worked out that as he has a Bentley, he could definitely have got from a Pizza Express restaurant in Woking to the centre of London in less than six hours.A few weeks later, as the story was withering once more, Hank J Dieselburger, an American prosecutor involved in the dead sex-man’s case, announced that the FBI had received “zero co-operation” from Prince Andrew.You’d think Andrew would have learned from his earlier mistake. You’d think he’d do a Flack and say nothing.But no. The very next day, “friends” of the Prince — which is another way of saying “the Prince” — went on the attack, telling reporters he was angry and bewildered. “They haven’t even approached me — I mean him.”The problem is that ego-fed celebrities read every single thing that is written about them. And they believe everyone  is reading everything, as well.We aren’t. We don’t really care. So when you attempt to clear your name, it’s like trying to put out a fire with petrol.It’s better for Andrew, and the whole Royal Family,he takes a leaf from singer Ronan Keating’s book — “You say it best, when you say nothing atThen, perhaps, he could take a leaf from his nephew’s book. And bugger off to Canada.I’M not defending drugs here, but when you see someone giggling their way through a packet of frozen peas and some leftover sherry trle at five in the morning, it’s easy to see why someone might think: “Yes, that cannabis malarkey looks like fun. I shall give it a go.”It’s the same story with cocaine.You see a dullard finding himself absolutely fascinating at a party and you think: “I’ll have a crack at that.”But this new drug, flakka, is dferent.One man who took it ate a homeless man’s face. Another gouged her own mother’s eyes out. And a third cut off his own penis.Which raises an interesting point. Why would anyone look at someone cutting off his old fella and think, “Ooh, I’ll have what he’s having ”A BUNCH of people who think the Lake District should only be used by ramblers decided to stage a protest over plans to put ten small tourist yachts on Grasmere lake.However, before the protest could take place, the idea was abandoned. And guess what  Yup. The protest went ahead anyway.They were actually protesting about something that wasn’t going to happen. Which proves what I’ve suspected for quite some time. Ramblers aren’t entirely right in the head.Next week, they will be protesting about the sonic booms made by Concorde and the burning of witches.LAST Sunday, driving was banned in the Italian city of Milan.Who thought that was a good idea  Getting an Italian to leave his car at home is impossible. It’s a part of his being, like his liver and his lungs.Needless to say, the scheme was not very successful.So not very successful in fact that, in the first three hours, the police had issued  fines. And the authorities now admit the ban was “largely ignored”.THERE’S much talk at the moment about how internet shopping is killing the High Street. But I’m not one of the murderers.When the time comes for my annual clothes shopping trip, I simply head to the Levi’s store on Regent Street in London, point at the label on the back of the jeans I’m wearing and ask for three more pairs just the same.I love Levi’s. I’ve worn nothing  since I was  and I’ve always loved their shop, the staff have always been brilliant. They always have what I need in stock and they never ask for my phone number or email address. I’m in and out in two minutes flat.This year, though, there was a disaster. There were two disinterested youths in there who looked at the label on the back of my jeans and said, “We don’t make those any more.”WHAT  ! !On the verge of fainting with shock, I dragged them back from their interesting conversation about Stormzy and was told in an exasperated fashion that I could still buy them online.This begs a question. What’s the point of having an expensive-to-run shopyou then fill it with people who tell you to go home and buy what you need on the net PETA, an organisation for animal enthusiasts who like to wear clothes made from crude oil, have announced that people often see their pet dog as nothing more than a cheap burglar alarm.Cheap You can buy a home alarm kit these days for less than £, whereas a proper dog is going to be way more than that.Plus, you only need feed an alarm with a tiny amount of electricity to keep it running, whereas a dog requires a bed, a blanket, food, water and, later on, vets bills that will make your eyes water.THIS week, a car crashed through my fence, turning it and an expensive new gate into matchsticks.By the time I got there, the car was gone. But there was still a lot of “police aware” tape fluttering about in the breeze.So I called the nearest station, which was approximately  miles away, as I needed to contact the driver to talk about insurance. Sadly, however, while the police are “aware” of the incident, they are not prepared to give me any details.Mustn’t grumble, though. While it will cost a few hundred quid to get everything mended, I must accept that the police have much more important things to do, such as investigating dead people who weren’t paedophiles.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The young folk born this century, like my -year-old daughter, do not watch it. The BBC means nothing to Generation YouTube.And the millions of us who grew up with the Beeb no longer recognise it as the benign Auntie that gave us Doctor Who, Top Of The Pops, Le On Earth, Fawlty Towers, The Likely Lads and David Dimbleby staying up all night at the General Election.That old beloved BBC — endlessly entertaining, scrupulously fair — is dead now. The BBC’s coverage of the night we left the European Union was nothing less than shameful.Here was a moment of truly historical signicance, the kind of national event that the BBC was born to cover. And it was dished up like a dull night at the Eurovision Song Contest.Down in Parliament Square, awash with Union Jacks and peaceful, happy patriots, BBC reporter Geeta Guru-Murthy blurted: “It’s a very white crowd mostly” — to the bewilderment of the many black and Asian people who were there to celebrate.But, of course, the BBC continues to peddle the filthy little lie that Brexit has its roots in the racism of the bigoted British people.Meanwhile, Sophie Raworth sat primly in a BBC studio made up to look like the EU flag. The studio never turned red, white and blue. There was no sense that the largest vote for anything in British history was being honoured. Why must we pay £billion a year for this one-sided garbage My colleague Ally Ross has pointed out that BBC “comedy” shows like Have I Got News For You, Frankie Boyle’s New World Order and The Mash Report have all been larded with anti-Brexit orthodoxy for years. Now the predictably loony Remainer-speak even seeps into the poison the BBC drips into our children.On the day we left the EU, the BBC released a CBBC Horrible Histories special mocking British stupidity.Queen Victoria was accused of callously sweetening her tea with sugar harvested by slaves — even though slavery was abolished four years before Victoria came to the throne.Historian Andrew Roberts described the mocking film as “a stream of bigoted hatred directed at this country”. They truly don’t get it in Broadcasting House. Millions of licence fee payers are deeply offended by the BBC’s relentlessly anti-British, anti-Brexit sentiment.It is why we fell out of love with the BBC. There is talk about decriminalising non-payment of the licence fee, or making payment optional. But the BBC no longer represents the entire nation. It peddles the prejudices of the disappointed elite who run it.The BBC does not speak for the British people. It doesn’t even seem to like us very much. So why should we pay anything at all for this crap AFTER being overlooked at the Oscars for her sensational performance in Hustlers, the half-time show at the Super Bowl felt like the revenge of Jenner Lopez.But Hustlers is my favourite film of the past  months. Lopez deserved an Oscar for her role.And whoever wins Best Actress at the Oscars tonight, I bet they can’t slide down a pole like her.MICHELLE OBAMA always said: “When they go low, we go high.”Meaning that when the Republican opponents of President Obama struck a low blow the Obamas had a strict policy of keeping their cool, their dignity and the moral high ground.The most senior Democratic politician in America just failed to take Michelle Obama’s advice. At his State of the Union address, President Trump petulantly refused to shake the hand of NancyPelosi, the Democratic Speaker of the House of Representatives. Pelosi should have shrugged off Trump’s rudeness and perhaps laughed in Donald’s orange face.Instead, clearly boiling with rage, Nancy ripped a copy of Trump’s speech to pieces. As the speech was full of optimistic stuff about making America a fairer, more prosperous place, the only person Pelosi humiliated was herself.The Democrats are starting to make Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party look like an effective opposition.THE classic James Bond films – Dr No, From Russia With Love, Goldfinger – were all less than two hours long.But in the modern fashion for over-long movies – The Irishman clocks in at three hours and  minutes – the next Bond film, No Time To Die, will be the longest ever at almost three hours.Let’s hope that means plenty of Ana de Armas, , as Bond girl Paloma. And not too much of Daniel Craig, , moaning about ’s dodgy knees.Teenage girls are messier than teenage boys. But teenage boys are, in my experience, more likely to leave takeaway pizza under the bed for six months for the mice to nibble.And when vermin move in, you really long for your little darling to move out.SUCKING up to the millionaire snowflakes in the audience, Prince William complained about the lack of ersity at the Baftas.I don’t believe it.

The NHS is asking anybody who has recently travelled to Wuhan to self-quarantine themselves for  days and call  to report your recent stay.  If you get a cough, high temperature or feel short of breath within  days of ing from other parts of China, including Macao and Hong Kong, Thailand, Japan, Republic of Korea, Taiwan, Singapore or Malaysia - you should stay indoors and avoid contact with other people and also call NHS  to tell them of your recent travel. Avoid using public transportyou appear to have symptoms. To avoid catching or spreading the virus, the NHS advise washing hands after coughing or sneezing and throw away tissues used. Using alcohol gel or washing hands after using public transport and avoiding touching eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands  Who is most at risk from coronavirus  People of all ages can contract coronavirus, but once caught itaposs more dangerous for young children, the elderly, people with pre-existing health conditions, or people with weakened immune systems.  Why has the UK declared an aposimminent threatapos  The UK Health Secretary has declared that the incidence or transmission of the Coronavirus is a serious and imminent threat to public health. Tory Matt Hancockaposs announcement gives him emergency powers to stop people leaving quarantine. A statement from the Department for Health said: In accordance with Regulation , the Secretary of State declares that the incidence or transmission of novel coronavirus constitutes a serious and imminent threat to public health. The measures outlined in these regulations are considered as an effective means of delaying or preventing further transmission of the virus. Itaposs understood he took the decision because someone threatened to abscond from a quarantine centre at Arrowe Park Hospital, Merseyside. Scores of Brits are in isolation there after  arrived from Wuhan for two weeksapos quarantine on January . The new law will give officials power to stop someone leaving. A source told the Mirror: Someone was threatening to abscond over the weekend. The source said the move was as much for the personaposs own safety as the safety of the public. They added: Overwhelmingly everyone who has been in quarantine has been really good about it. Many of them refused to get on the plane unless they would be quarantined afterwards.  What does aposimminent threatapos mean  The phrasing of the governmentaposs statement is really important. It doesnapost say the Coronavirus itself is an imminent threat - it says the transmission of it is. So the imminent threat is actually the specic person who threatened to leave, not the virus as a whole. Ministers needed to use this language to justy making emergency laws that havenapost yet been seen by Parliament. Is the threat to the public changed  No. Government officials say the threat to the public was still moderate this morning, despite the new declaration.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailA row has erupted between Boris Johnsonaposs partner Carrie Symonds and his chief advisor Dominic Cummings over the Cabinet reshuffle, it has been claimed. Miss Symonds is apparently backing ministers who claim Mr Cummingsapos heavy-handed treatment of ministers, officials and journalists is harming the Prime Ministeraposs image, according to Treasury sources. Reports that the advisor urged the PM to sack Chancellor Sajid Javid and Defence Secretary Ben Wallace - two ministers with close links to Miss Symonds - has stoked the flames of the feud. Mr Johnson is said to be against firing Mr Javid but how secure Mr Wallace remains is unclear with a reshuffle likely to happen this week, reports the Daily Mail. Mr Cummings is also understood to be looking to remove several Tory ministerial special advisers, some who are close to Miss Symonds. The Prime Minister could be dragged into the centre of a potentially damaging power struggle between the pair - the most powerful members of his Cabinet of key advisors. Miss Symonds and Mr Cummings each have prominent Cabinet allies and hobby horses fighting their corners. The former joined the party as a press officer a decade ago before being pushed up to director of communications three years ago, working for senior Conservatives John Whittingdale, Zac Goldsmith and Mr Javid.  She is described as a skilled networker, as well as being a environmental campaigner, with her animal welfare views and stance on the release of violent criminals having influenced Mr Johnson. But she left the Tories in August . She was allegedly accused of claiming thousands of pounds of unauthorised expenses. Mr Cummings, meanwhile, pioneered radical school reforms as special adviser to then-Education Secretary Michael Gove and is hailed as the genius behind the Vote Leave campaign in aposs EU referendum. During a party on January , marking Brexit night, the Prime Minister praised his chief advisor for coming up with the powerful aposGet Brexit Doneapos slogan, paving the way for his landslide General Election victory in December.  Mr Cummingsapos war on the mainstream media since then though has seen him come under fire, including recently banning reporters from organisations considered hostile to the Government, resulting in a revolt of Westminster lobby journalists. He had also banned ministersapos special advisors lunching with journalists, to avoid stories being leaked, though both he and Miss Symonds have close ties with certain senior journalists. It is also understood he is behind a Number  campaign to chop the BBC down to size, including blocking ministers from appearing on Radio aposs Today show, claiming it is anti-Tory. A Treasury source told the Mail: There was always a risk that Carrie and Dom were going to fall out and that the PM would get caught in the crossfire.

Lynne and Alan Crooks, from Middlesbrough, moved back to the north east two years ago after living in Australia for eight years. However within weeks Alan was showing signs of dementia, and when he was finally diagnosed more than a year later in April , Lynne became his full-time carer. But she was shocked to discover Alan did not qualy for the PIP benefit and because of that she was unable to claim Carersapos Allowance. The blow left them struggling to make ends meet, and now they are warning others thinking of ing to the UK after Brexit to check their entitlements. The Department for Work and Pensions , responsible for making decisions on claims, said it has always published its eligibility criteria for benefits on its website. Both Alan and Lynne, who lived in Middlesbrough all their lives until emigrating in , paid National Insurance contributions for more than  years and had been reassured they would qualy for state pensions. However the couple, who now live in Seaham, were unaware of rules that meant they had to be resident in the UK for two years before making a claim for PIP and Carers Allowance, reports Chronicle Live. Lynne said: “We had no idea about Alan’s illness when we made the decision toto the UK. Not being able to claim these benefits for the past two years feels like we have been penalised for emigrating in the first place. “It has been really tough and we have had to rely on family to get through this, especially as I can’t work anymore because Alan needs me  .” Former painter and decorator Alan, , has Semantic Dementia, a rare form of the condition that affects language skills. Lynne, , continued: “Alan is unable to identy everyday objects and their uses. He can no longer speak, read or write with the exception of copying his first name and saying ‘yes’. Everything he has ever been taught has been erased from his memory. The way it was described to me by his doctor was to think of the brain as a dictionary. Most people can access pages and pages of words, but Alan’s pages are blank. The couple, who have two children, ed to the UK with the intention of ‘doing something exciting every day’ after le Down Under didnapost work out as they’d hoped. But their plans to travel and socialise ground to a halt when Alan became ill. Since then, Lynne says support from Alzheimer’s Society has been invaluable.  Rowena Carr, a Dementia Support Worker for the charity, has been advising the couple on how to ensure they don’t miss out on the benefits they are entitled to once they qualy in March, as well as other support they can access. The stress they have been under over the past two years could have torn many couples apart, but Lynne says it has only made them stronger. She added: “Alan and I were childhood sweethearts. When I was five and he was six we’d sit on top of his mam’s shed and look at the stars. We started courting when I was  and this coming November we will celebrate our th wedding anniversary. So, Alan has always been part of my le. At the end of the day, I love him and dementia won’t change that. I knowthe roles were reversed, heaposd do the same for me.

Last month, the pair had been involved in a bust up with police before being photographed out shopping together.  Matthewsapos engagement to Saunders also saw her sacked from her job at a charity shop and her home - the location of which cannot be disclosed for legal reasons - egged by angry vigilantes, reports the Sun.“She has got no friends where she lives any more because of Saunders, a former friend told the newspaper. “People have ditched her because she refuses to kick him out.  The unnamed former pal said Matthews lied to people that she was going to do so when in reality he has been living there full-time for a while. “To see a paedophile move into any neighbourhood is just disgusting, they continued. “Some people believed she should be given the time to prove she had turned over a new leaf after she got out of jail. But this relationship is a line that has been crossed. “People don’t want anything to do with hershe is still with him.”  The Sun previously published pictures of Matthews out with Saunders while wearing a Princess Diana-style ring. She is currently living in a town in the south of the UK after being released from prison halfway through her sentence in April .

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailA McDonaldaposs employee who became the man behind four of the UKaposs biggest and busiest franchises has given his top business secrets. Dean Chapman, , snubbed university to serve burgers at McDonaldaposs and now runs a business boasting four branches with a turnover of more than £ million. The dad-of-three, from Leicester, took his first McDonaldaposs job aged  job to generate cash for a college canoeing holiday. But now, Dean and his team run restaurants at Cherry Street near Temple Row, Bristol Road, near Belgrave Middleway Stephenson Place, on the New Street ramp, and Kings Parade in Dale End, Birmingham Live reports. Deanaposs blue collar parents -  dad was painter and decorator and mum a machinist - were less than thrilled when he decided to ditch his A Levels to work full-time at the Golden Arches.  But he worked his way up from McDonaldaposs crew member to director level. In  he was appointed Head of Franchising UK, helping franchise owners run and manage their restaurant more effectively. In , he resigned as a McDonaldaposs employee to buy his own restaurants as a franchisee. Dean said: I first bought two - Stephenson Place and Dale End. A year later I took on Cherry Street, followed by Bristol Road. All the McDonaldaposs in Birmingham are franchisee owned. Dean said: When I started only around  to  per cent of UK McDonaldaposs restaurants were franchises - that is owned by independent business owners like me. It was not the UK model then. Now around  per cent of McDonalds restaurants in the UK are franchises. It has grown hugely. With a turnover of more than £.million, according to public accounts published for the year ending December , , he is certainly doing something right. Dean put his success down to hard work, graft and a bit of luck along the way. He said: If you put your heart and soul into the work, the opportunities are there. So what are his multi-million pound secrets   What were you doing before you started at McDonaldaposs  I was studying Physics,  Maths and Electronics at Leicester College. I wanted to be an electrical engineer and planned to go to university - I would have been the first in my family to go. I got a part-time job at my local McDonaldaposs in Leicester to help pay for a canoeing holiday.  When I came back from the holiday, I continued to work at McDonaldaposs and I ended up working more and more hours. I was practically a full-time employee before I knew it. I guess my lightbulb moment came after I ed from my holiday. I remember sitting in class at college, putting my hand up to ask to be excused to go to the toilet and being told I couldnapost and that I should have gone on a break. I threw my toys out of the pram, walked out and never went back. My parents were very disappointed,  I wasnapost going to university. Obviously they donapost feel that way now.  What I loved about the job - which is still true today - was it was all about teamwork and camaraderie. I’m a very shy person in general but after a few weeks I found my feet and within a few months,  I was running the kitchen with  staff. How do you progress from crew member   The management set-up back then was quite dferent. By the age of ,  I was running my own restaurant. I became Leicester area manager at . While going through the ranks I got a lot of training and business qualications at what we call hamburger university - an office in Sutton Coldfield. These are courses not externally recognised but when I go into organisations to talk about the franchisees, the stuff I’ve been taught are well-known business models.  My last few jobs as a McDonaldaposs employee were as director of operations and head of franchising in the UK. Why did you decide you wanted to be a franchisee  The higher up I got in the company, the further away I got from what I loved - interacting with staff. When I was training franchisees for the company, Iaposd give advice about what they could do to run a better McDonaldaposs and move the business forward. I wanted to implement these things myself. Now I have my own franchise business consultant  - the job I used to do -  who gives me a fresh pair of eyes and a good overview. Have your children any plans to follow your career path  They are very proud and it is a family business - my we is the bookkeeper. I have three children, Heidi, Finlay and Luke. Finlay has a natural affinity with business and wants to study that at university.  Luke and Heidi love maths. She is studying maths at St Andrews, where Kate Middleton and Prince William met. Apparently an Indian princess is studying there now! How do you become a franchisee and how much money do you need  You need an initial outlay of unencumbered cash of £,. And be accepted for an application programme. The selection process is quite intense. There is an extensive application process. Then there is a nine-month training period after that. Whataposs the best thing about being a franchisee  Seeing people progress. All my managers worked from crew up. I think it would be frustrating to work somewhere where there were no ways to progress - absolutely the opportunities are there in McDonaldapossyou want them.  For example one employee Cha who was on our apprenticeship programme started as crew in October  and was promoted to sht manager within four years. aposYou need an initial outlay of unencumbered cash of £, to own a franchiseapos You have to work very hard and put your heart and soul into it. There are other employees who donapost want to go up the ranks - which is fine. They just want a flexible job - and some cash to let them focus on other interests, whether that be sport or the arts. What changes have you seen since you started  When I started we didn’t sell breakfast - shocking when you consider how popular it is.   On the back of customer demand we have increased the breakfast time from .am to am so people can have a lie-in.  I remember the film Falling Down, when Michael Douglas is told he is a few minutes too late for the breakfast menu at a fast food restaurant and explodes. We donapost want people to feel like that! Also back when we started, it was just filter coffee. The only chicken we sold was nuggets. Now  per cent of our products are chicken.We sell as much chicken as beef. As the years have progressed,  peopleaposs tastes have evolved. More recently we have offered salads, veggie wraps and vegan dippers. Who knows what it will look like in  years  The restaurants themselves have transformed massively over the last five years, we have table service, the My McDonald’s app and McDelivery. Describe your average day Every morning I get up at  and drive to Birmingham. Iaposm usually at the Dale End branch by .am. Iaposll get the business managers for the four stores together for a couple of hours.  Then they go back to their teams and have similar meetings with their teams. The rest of the day is spent catching up on emails. Every day starts with a meeting of some description - so it could be a team meeting. It could be a franchisee meeting, so we get together as franchisees and the community as well I currently have seven business managers working for me. I give them targets - feedback on how they are performing.

While its streets have been turned into canals with submerged cars. Were you affected by Storm Ciara this weekend  Email webnews@trinitymirror The floods are so intense they caused the stock inside a Sainsburyaposs branch in Hebden Bridge to float down the aisles. Remzi Samsa was forced to close his restaurant Rendezvous Bistro in Hebden Bridge after it was flooded. Councils had spent millions of pounds on the flood defences believing it would stop history repeating itself - but they now face criticism for the colossal failure. Part of the scheme was completed last year and the remainder is due to be finished this summer. Calder Valley could face further floods as the Met Office has issued  warnings and alerts across Britain including Yorkshire. West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Services said it was called out to  incidents, they carried out  rescues and there were  emergency  calls on Sunday between am and pm. The service also warned residents in a tweet: Flood warnings remain in place across the county for today. Please check your local flood risk, never drive through flood water and take action to stay safe. Last year natural flood defences to protect farms from the effects of heavy rain were rolled out across the Yorkshire Dales.The techniques which include earth bunds and tree planting were introduced in Bishopdale and Wensleydale to stem the flow of the River Ure.     It is believed the new defences partially worked but many homes were still flooded. The Met Office maintained its yellow wind warning as the storm is expected to bring strong gales, heavy showers, snow and ice today resulting in widespread disruption during the rush hour. Train passengers have been warned to check for cancellations before they head out as the damage from Sundayaposs storm is likely to result in cancellations due to damage including fallen trees and debris on rail tracks.The storm has claimed its first fatal victim after a driver was killed when a tree crashed onto his car on the A during the heavy winds. The -year-old man was driving from Winchester to his home in Micheldever, Hants, when the tree came down. The accident happened at pm on Sunday afternoon when wind speeds in the area were believed to be in excess of mph.

Some areas saw a month and a halfaposs rainfall in just  hours and gusts of more than mph swept across the country on Sunday, bringing widespread flooding. Thousands of people were left without power, some homes were evacuated, buildings were damaged and sporting occasions postponed. Flights, ferries and trains all saw cancellations and delays, while drivers faced treacherous conditions with floodwater, fallen trees and other debris closing roads. A Met Office amber weather warning for wind, which had been in place across most of England, elapsed at pm Sunday as Storm Ciara moved away to the north-east of Scotland. But a yellow warning for wind remained in force for the whole UK until midnight, with strong winds, heavy showers, snow and ice expected on Monday. A yellow warning for heavy snow and strong winds is in place for Northern Ireland and most of Scotland and a yellow warning of snow and ice is in force for North West England throughout Monday and Tuesday. A yellow warning for wind in the south is in place between am and pm Monday. Met Office meteorologist Alex Burkill said: While Storm Ciara is clearing away, that doesnapost mean weaposre entering a quieter period of weather. Itaposs going to stay very unsettled.  We have got colder air coming through the UK and will be feeling a real drop in temperatures, with an increased risk of snow in northern parts of the UK and likely in Scotland. There could be up to cm on Monday and Tuesday and with strong winds, blizzards arenapost out of the question. The Met Office warning states: Frequent and heavy snow showers will affect the region throughout Monday and Tuesday. Snow showers will occur especially over high ground, giving slight accumulations of one to three cm above  metres and five to cm above  metres. Snow will gradually build up and in a few locations, accumulations of over cm are possible by Tuesday evening over the highest routes in Scotland.  The height of the snow level will y throughout the period, but it is likely that any snow accumulations at low levels will only be temporary. Strong winds, gusting - mph, will lead to blizzard conditions at times and considerable drting of lying snow over high ground. Train passengers are being advised to check with operators before travelling as there are likely to be some cancellations to early trains as Network Rail engineers work through the night to assess the damage. Motorists are also warned to take care with continued disruption to the road network and tricky driving conditions likely to continue into rush hour. And airports around the country on Sunday night told travellers to check their flight with their airline due to the continuing bad weather conditions. British Airways said in a statement there will be a minor knock-on effect to Mondayaposs schedule. Weaposre getting in touch with those affected, and have brought in extra customer teams to help them with a range of options including a full refund or an alternative flight between now and Thursday, the airline said. Any customer flying short-haul to or from Heathrow or Gatwick, can also choose to make changes to their travel plansthey would prefer to fly another time.  Scotland Transport Secretary Michael Matheson said there is the potential for signicant disruption to travel. He said: The Traffic Scotland service gives details of aposwind basedapos closures for the bridges on trunk road network, allowing people to plan ahead accordingly. Motorists should check Traffic Scotland before they set off to make sure that their route is available.

Dozens of flights were cancelled with others erted as far away as Germany because of the perilous conditions from the high winds and torrential rain. One BA plane was forced to declare an emergency and land in Lyon, France as it ran low on fuel while waiting to touch down at Gatwick.

Sporting events, including Manchester City’s Premier League clash with West Ham were called off. Helen Roberts, from the Met Office, said: “In terms of area this is probably the biggest storm this century.” She added she had not seen amber warnings – the second most severe level – “on this scale across all of Wales and much of England”.  “This could end up being the biggest since ,” Ms Roberts said, when the “Great Storm” killed  people and felled an estimated  million trees. Her colleague, Alex Burkill, said that this was just the start warning of “plummeting” temperatures this week. There would be dangerous ice in the North he said, and snow showers affecting many parts of the country.  “Once we say goodbye to Storm Ciara, it’s not a complete calm-down by any means,” Mr Burkill said. “It’s not a pleasant outlook. It’s going to stay very windy, we’re going to have plenty of heavy showers with hail and thunder and some snow.” Yesterday’s winds damaged multiple buildings including London’s Victoria station and a guest house in Hawick, Scotland, which partially collapsed.

Resident Adele Smith said: “Utter devastation in my home town of Mytholmroyd and Hebden Bridge and a catastrophic failure of the flood alleviation scheme, which is nowhere near finished. “For all those non-believers of global warming visit the Calder Valley.” Keith Crabtree, a flood warden for nearby Todmorden added: “I can sum it up in one word: grim. “That’s through the whole of the Valley, ...there’s problems all the way down. “It’s striking me like another Boxing Day... the number of incidents are certainly at Boxing Day  levels.”  Yorkshire shepherdess Amanda Owen watched a metal livestock carrier being swept away on a hillside. She said: “The energy and power of this storm are unreal. The gusts of wind are exceptional and water is pouring. “Can’t believe this just happened. A flood of biblical proportions.” Emergency services ferried residents to safety using inflatable boats in the Lancashire towns of Bury and Ramsbottom. And Bury councillor Tamoor Tariq helped families board a bus to a temporary rescue point set up at a local leisure centre. Mr Tariq told the Mirror: “It’s so deep we’ve had to close off the roads, we had to support people coming out the properties because some of the water was knee high.  There are bins floating around and lots of residents outside their properties.” The Environment Agency issued  flood warnings and a red “danger to le” was declared for severe flooding from the River Nidd at Pateley Bridge in North Yorkshire.

However, the Tories must take responsibility for dithering which added to spiralling costs after Labour launched HS in . Even now Boris Johnson repeats past mistakes by leaving a question mark over routes north of Birmingham instead of giving a vote of confidence in the whole line. Making savings wherever possible to keep down the final bill is most important - but the huge HS project is vital. It will boost rail capacity and speed up journeys. HS will also help spread wealth by linking England’s North and Midlands with more prosperous London and the South East. The benefits might not be felt until it’s running, yet no Government committed to rebuilding Britain could derail HS and pretend to be constructing the future.

Saleswoman Courtney Henderson was in the market for a new outfit to wear on her birthday night out, and ordered a £ emerald dress from online retailer Dressmezee. Pictures of the dress on the website show the figure-hugging shape with cut-outs at the side - but Courtney, from Newcastle, found the reality of the fit left her practically naked from the waist up. Embracing the X-rated results, the EE sales worker posted a photos of the model online, alongside a censored one of herself after trying on the aposEx Lovers Glitter Dressapos. It shows the material awkwardly cut above her chest, leaving her breasts hanging out on either side.The post, which has more than , likes and , retweets, is captioned: Dressmezee sorted me right out with this little belta, fits like a dream. Adding a note on the photo of herself, Courtney praises the aposbrilliant fitapos of the dress, which she jokes is definitely worth keeping and £ well spent. One replied: I just spat coffee out everywhere. I am in f***ing stitches.  Another said: Donapost buy clothes online - a lesson. A third commented: Courtney hahahaha I’m creasing, to which she replied: Some heels on and I’m ready to go. Courtney said: To be completely honest, thereaposs not that much to say about it. Apart from ordering a dress which clearly is made for the smaller-breasted in society, which most dresses are these days. Dressmezee said: Our Ex Lovers dress has continuously been one of our best sellers since being added to the website last year.If you check out our tagged images on Instagram you will see we have had many customers who have worn the dress and have been super happy with it.  We can only apologise that the dress was not suitable for the customer, we do offer a size chart so we can ensure we are as accurate as we can possibly be.Our website clearly states that we have a very fair  daypolicy, as with the ious shapes and sizes of our customer’s bodies it is unlikely that every garment will fit every inidual. Of course not all poor fittings generate as much publicity as Courtney’s, so as a gesture of goodwill and thanks for all the extra publicity, in addition to her refund we’re happy to offer % off her next purchase.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailAt about  oaposclock this morning, while Storm Ciara was keeping you awake, the most amazing thing ever to happen on a Monday happened.A cave painting was fired at the most deadly and important thing that human beings have ever seen.You might wonder why anyone went to the effort. After all, prehistoric charcoal drawings boasting about what people ate for dinner have been superseded by Instagram filters. But the caveman who painted a story about how him and his mates killed this mammoth, it was well big honest, spent his days beneath the same large, fiery ball thataposs in your sky.He did not know what it was, how it worked, or what it might do next. He knew only it gave him warmth and light. Perhaps he knew it encouraged plants, or when it was in a certain place it meant the bison were about to migrate. There would have been times it was eclipsed and he was frightened it might not .In the tens of thousands of years since then, neither the Sun, nor we, have changed very much. It still rises. We still paint.  Oh, we have smartphones, cars, passenger jets, concrete, laser printers, medicine. But take that all away and weaposre still a naked ape, walking upright and wondering whataposs next. The thing that has always set cavemen apart is planning, and the best things we ever did have all involved teamwork. And so it is that, in the small hours of a winter Monday about , years since cave painting was in fashion, thousands of such creatures co-operated, in a mixture of English and French, to put a cave painting inside a car on top of some rocket fuel, pointed it at Venus, and set a match to it.There isnapost space here to consider the technological advances that were made in order to produce the match, or the car. Suffice to say, they were pretty astonishing on their own.Anyway, that cave painting has been blasted through the Earthaposs atmosphere. A  of polished rock capable of converting sunlight to electricity has been unfolded, and the car has communicated with us to say all is well, even though there is nobody driving it. It is about the same size as a Citroen Berlingo.  This small lump of metal is going to slingshot around Venus, twice. Then itaposll ping back round Earth next year, using planetary gravity to propel it towards the Sun. During this time, itaposll test and use a whole bunch of instruments, sending back data and observations from telescopes, spectrometers, ultra-violet cameras, magnetometers, and X-ray measurements. Then itaposll go past Mercury, and go all wonky.The Sun is so massive that any satellite fired from Earth gravitates to the same aposhorizonapos - a level the same as that of the Sunaposs equator. But this driverless Berlingo is going to orbit the Sun on the yang, at an angle of  degrees, so it can look down onto the solar poles where the interesting stuff happens and which we know least about. That car-sized satellite will orbit the Sun  times, about once every  months. At times it will spin at the same speed as the Sun, enabling it to aposhoverapos over areas of interest. It is going to look at the ions, magnetic field, the solar wind, the photons of light fired out by the constant firestorm. It will send the results of its experiments back to Earth by radio wave, and some of the cleverest people from  dferent countries are going to spend years getting very excited about it.We do not know what we will learn. But seeing as the Sun is one massive fusion reaction, maybe weaposll find out something about using the same power to replace fossil fuels. The scientists hope to learn about predicting solar flares. There is a % risk, say some, that these could combine to cause a solar storm that hits the Earth within the next decade - causing satellites to crash, knocking out power grids, and sending us all back to the Stone Age. Be a good idea to get ahead of that. And according to the World Health Organisation, up to million of us develop some form of skin cancer each year, mainly from exposure to sunlight. With our atmosphere damaged by human activity, it could increase by %. Itaposd be useful, then, to look at the radiation close up, and figure out more about how it works. The only way that something the size of a Berlingo van can spend  years in space, drive million miles, and park next to the equivalent of a trillion hydrogen bombs mid-explosion, is because of the cave painting. In particular, animal bones burned to charcoal and ground down to powder. These cinders have been sprayed onto titanium foil, which is  th of a millimetre thick. It has been wrapped over a heat shield .metres by .metres across, and inches deep. Itaposs got layers of carbon fibre inside, and lots of this powdered foil, which will melt off only at temperatures of , degrees C.The shield has doors in it, which can be opened remotely from Earth, allowing instruments to poke through and do stuff. On the side nearest the Sun the heat should be about C, and about -C on the other. And despite these extremes, the cave painting should survive. Engineers have heated it up enormously, then dipped it in liquid nitrogen to seeit cracks. Theyaposve opened and closed the doors , times to seeit flakes under stress. Theyaposve even tried scraping it off. Turns out, the stuff cavemen used to make their mark is one of the most robust materials in the solar system.  There are several amazing things about this worth considering. That heat shield was designed and built in Stevenage, a town whose main claim to fame, hitherto, was being home to the first pedestrianised high street in the UK. The Solar Orbiter it is protecting was built in a joint project by NASA and the European Space Agency of  member countries, whose citizens all contribute the price of a cinema ticket infor such amazing feats.And the price of the whole project is about £billion. This would buy you a ninth of the London Olympics, or at current estimates about  miles of the HS rail link.  But most amazing of all, this has all been done by cavemen.Creatures who war over rocks, who hate skin colour, and donapost understand sexuality. Animals who starve and slice their bodies to make them appear less ape-like, who elect fools to lead them, and think Instagram filters improve things. Yet these imperfect beings are also using the materials they once used to paint on cave walls to understand the universe. To source clean energy, solve medical problems, and plan for solar catastrophe, using teamwork and less money than it takes to build a railway. One day, the Sun will boil our oceans, and kill all le as it absorbs every planet in the solar system. It is the most deadly and important thing that has ever glared down at us, and now we are staring back, and making notes. Thataposs not bad going for a caveman. You can take the rest of the day off, humanity.

More than  people on board the flight held on as the woman screamed out, while the plane was buffeted around by the strong winds. The pilot had attempted to land five times at Schiphol airport in Amsterdam but aborted at the last moment. The plane was eventually turned round and headed back to Madrid in Spain, where it had started its journey. Mark Haagan, who was on board the Air Europa flight and recorded the video footage, told RTLNieuws in the Netherlands that some on board were being sick. He said: The turbulence above Schiphol was enormous. The pilot really stopped the landing twice at the very last moment. We took off again at  metres above the runway. Really not cool. People screamed and were puking. The turbulence was enormous, everything vibrated and went back and forth. The luggage flew back and forth.  I am used to flying, but I have never experienced this.

We used to be jealous of what other clubs were doing before but we’re now probably one of the frontrunners.“We’re doing a lot of things other teams are aspiring to do. Because of the money and finance put in, it certainly makes your job a lot easier and helps a long way.“When you’re attracting young players to join the club, you want the kids to come into an elite environment rather than what it was before.“We weren’t bad before but there was no finance to do it properly. Andy Goldie is driving it on and we’ve managed to get to Elite status which is brilliant.“Restructuring the whole thing has meant new faces have come in with new ideas.“It’s about evolving all the time, you can’t just sit and accept it because that’s what was happening  or  years ago.”That said, Bow still believes attitude is what will help players get to where they want to be, citing former United man and Liverpool star Andy Robertson as an example.“That’s one of the biggest things I see with kids that are talented,” he added.“It’s how you install it into them to give that extra %. When you come out the other end of an academy, that’s the bit that will help you.“You need to be disciplined. Even since I played, and it’s changed a lot since then, football’s been like that.“You can’t go out every night, you’ve got to practice things and get the basics right first before you work on your game.“We’re wanting to give them the whole package by putting all the fragments together and glue them so we get better players at the end of the day. vw, px\"  “I’m a great believer in always getting to where you want to go.“You could stay here, play in the first team and,you’re good enough, you could always move.“We’ve had one recently with Banksy .“Andy Robertson is a fine example, to have came from Queen’s Park then come up here.“From us he probably could’ve gone straight to a Liverpool or a higher team but he went to Hull and earned his stripes.“Sometimes they want to accelerate it and get from down at E right up to A straight away, rather than working their way up.“That’s the way it goes sometimes and I’ve seen others like wee Gauldy .“I’d have put my mortgage on wee Gauldy being a success at Sporting eventually but, unfortunately for him, things turn out dferent ways.“He’s still playing in Portugal, of course, but he was the one I thought would’ve kicked on.“If I’d looked at Andy and Gauldy back then I’d have probably said Gauldy was the better player. It says a lot about Andy’s character as well and his real drive and determination.”Not everyone can be Andy Robertson, though, Bowman concedes.“I always think the Dutch are a brilliant example because even when players leave the likes of PSV and Ajax, they’ll go where.#Whereas, sometimes in Scotland they’ll drop out of academies and then football altogether.“We’d like to see those boys progress and keep playing as well. That’s a big part of my job, too.“I hope that when they come in full-time with us, they’ll aspire to be players at one level or another.“They’ve just got to show what they’re about. If you want to give that extra , , % to get there it will help you in the end.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/02/d0385dbd-8f68-4c14-abd9-1bef13043149-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/02/d0385dbd-8f68-4c14-abd9-1bef13043149-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/02/d0385dbd-8f68-4c14-abd9-1bef13043149-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/02/d0385dbd-8f68-4c14-abd9-1bef13043149-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"car left on its roof following two vehicle collision in dundee","story":"A vehicle was left on its roof following a two car collision on Albany Terrace in Dundee.Two vehicles were involved in the crash but no injuries have been reported.Police and fire engines were called to the crash at .pm.A spokeswoman for Tayside Fire and Rescue said: “We received a call at pm following reports of a two vehicle RTC on Albany Terrace, appliances from Blackness and Balmossie were dispatched.#One vehicle was on its roof and Police Scotland were also requested to attend.#The stop message came in at .pm.”A police spokeswoman confirmed officers were in attendance."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/02/19831881-940x552.jpg ","title":"dundee 2 0 partick hemmings double earns dark blues first win of 2020 with dominant display","story":"Dundee finally picked up their first victory of  with a dominant - victory over bottom club Partick Thistle at Dens Park.Two first-half Kane Hemming goals did the damage for the Dark Blues as they moved back into the play-off places with a first three points since beating the Jags at Firhill on December .Dens boss James McPake made three changes after Cammy Kerr and Jordan McGhee underwent surgery during the week.That saw Josh Meekings come in to join Christophe Berra and Jordon Forster in a back three while Paul McGowan ed to partner Kane Hemmings up front and Christie Elliott made his first start.Andrew Nelson was on the bench after recovering from surgery himself alongside new signing Tom Field.The home side made a positive start and got the all-important breakthrough on  minutes.It stemmed from Meekings launching a throw into the Partick box and earning a corner.

All have end-stage organ failure, be it kidney, liver, lung or heart, and require a le-saving transplant.Organs for transplant usually come from bodies of people who agreed to donate before death. But as this does not produce enough organs, both Scotland and England plan to bring in an #opt out# system, meaning that on death a person#s agreement to organ donation is assumed unless they had actively opted out.Live donation is an alternative to awaiting a cadaveric organ. As people can live happily with one kidney or half a liver, family members or altruistic iniduals sometimes offer to donate these organs. Since matching donor and recipient tissue-type, however, is generally required these donations are not always acceptable.Now groups of tissue-type incompatible donor recipient pairs are getting together to mix and match, producing duos who are tissue-type-compatible. So let#s say Annie is rejected as a kidney donor for her sister Jean for incompatibility reasons, and similarly, Arthur is rejected as kidney donor for Jim. But pairing donor Annie with recipient Jim and Arthur with Jean could lead to two successful transplants. A recent report from the US describes the first ever bi-organ exchange involving a liver-kidney swap * .In this specic case a daughter wished to donate a kidney to her mother with renal failure but was rejected because she might later develop the same kidney problem. So she offered half of her liver in exchange for a kidney for her mother. Another donor was eventually identied who wanted to donate half her liver to her sister with liver failure but was rejected because her liver was too small. But she was cleared for kidney donation.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community. More of the same meritorious awards for the ordinary people of Scotland please.Credit to all editors and staff for their outstanding journalism given over the years in all of Scotlands progressive, thriving local papers.Stephen Jones, Oban"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures january 3 2020 2","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThis week#s photograph whas been submitted by Tom Cullen of Ardfern.The serene scene was taken overlooking the Crinan estuary at about .am on Friday January ."},{"url":null,"title":"lochgilphead bowls into 2020","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead Bowling Club launched into the new year with the first of its indoor singles competitions.Some  members played for the Argyll Arms Ardrishaig trophy on Saturday January  and after some great matches throughout the afternoon it was Alan Guy and Neil Ward that progressed to the final.In a closely fought final, Neil Ward edged the victory in the last end, winning -."},{"url":null,"title":"tarberts senior citizens party the night away","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowWet and windy weather failed to dampen the spirits of Tarbert’s seniors as they gathered in the village hall for the senior citizens# Christmas dinner.A large number of willing volunteers had organised a sumptuous meal and decked the hall with multi-coloured fairy lights and balloons to provide a warm welcome for their guests.The familiar venue quickly came alive with smiles, hugs and the happy chatter of friends gathering for this much-loved annual event which has been going for more than  years.Elma McGougan and Jean Johnston, who had served on the original organising committee, reminisced about their experiences, explaining they ran fund-raising events and that many in the village donated money and goods so the dinner could be provided free of charge.The event, held this year on Friday January , is still organised by a committee and continues to be generously supported by businesses and iniduals in the village and surrounding area.Elma said: #In the s, the women on the committee made soup and brought it along.

Back then, we had ice-cream and jelly for dessert.#Jean added: #It was all good fun and we had loads of laughs.#Elma continued: #We used to have sales to raise money for the dinner. Santa was on the stage and Jean’s children were his elves. They were only little then.#We modelled the clothes and the older women loved the bargains. We thought they were old, but they were probably the age we are now,# Elma said laughing. #We would shout #Roll up, roll up# to get them to come and see what we had on offer.#After a warm welcome from compère Martin Jefferies and a prayer of thanks for the food, the five-course meal was expertly served by members of the organising committee and their youthful helpers.A raffle, again free of charge, saw a large number of guests receive prizes and no-one was left disappointed as the remainder of the guests received selection boxes.Tarbert’s seniors showed they know how to party as dancers left their seats and enthusiastically took to the floor as soon as the musical entertainment began.A stunned Margaret Henderson was named #Citizen of the Year#, confessing she never expected to win the award.For more than  years, Margaret has collected money to support the Tarbert Sea Food Festival and Music Festival.

A wee van and a motorbike were behind them at the time and they let them pass and they disappeared down the twisty road at an incrediblespeed.They reached Tighnabruaich at about  o#clock and saw Fulmar in the water, but when they stopped to speak to Johnny Malcolm and Donald Turner they were told she was not in the water more than # an hour and still not fully rigged. They were quite right but George Smith said they were busy getting Psyche ready for launchingbut they would be out first thing in the morning to bend on the sails and finish off the rigging.They got their storesin the yard and with these and their luggage went aboard in two trips. Things were soon put sufficiently enough in order to allow them to get to bed and after watching Psyche go down the slip they were soon in their bunks. It was a beautully clear evening but distinctly cold.Next morning they were up at sevenand about eight the yard men came out and finished up their jobs. Jimmy Smith fixed up the slipping clutch and suggested we do away with the present gear lever fancy arrangement which was not strong enough for its work. This the Skipper agreed to though it meant a less handy working but it did away with the pin and shield that broke up the dog-house seat, they being replaced by a removable hatch cover. It certainly made sitting in the dog-house more comfortable.The Skipper went ashore to the village for meat and some curtain hooks while Archie watered ship and the other two continued cleaning and clearing up aboard.At quarter to twelve they were away under full sail and in brilliant sunshine but with a cold north-westerly they ran to Ardlamont then beat up to Tarbert, being passed just outside Tarbert as an aeroplane flew close overhead, by Blink. They noticed a huge oil tanker doing trials just off Arran.They were anchored off the herring pier before  o#clock and they had supper-cum-lunch then went ashore. The Pilot to visit a friend, the others to get milk in the village then to walk to the end of the road on Loch Fyne. On their way they spoke to an enthusiastic English pair, working in their garden, who wanted to know off which yacht they had come.During the evening Arcturus and Tunnag came in and one or two motor boats. Zaidie was in when they arrived and Leonora was anchored across Loch Fyne in Buck Bay.All aboard, Margaret and Archie went off to the islet in the harbour to get some roots for their new garden then soon afterwards all turned in, for though it was a glorious looking evening it was perishingly cold and the stove, lit as soon as they anchored, had been very welcome.On Sunday they were again up early and found a dull overcast day. The Pilot, ashore for water, heard a poor weather forecastfrom a fishing board. On the strength of this they hurried breakfast and by  o’clock were away with a south-westerly breeze.The Skipper gave the first beacon a rap with the boom-end as they ran out of the harbour. The beat down to Ardlamontand thee ran the engine for five minutes to get out of a nasty lop. The sun came out for about five minutes but by the time they had reached the Carry Buoythe rain had started and it got heavier and heavier.The wind strengthened with the rain and they moved up very fast into Tighnabruaich Bay then up to Loch Riddon to anchor off the pier at Ormidale. As they passed Tighnabruaich they saw Torridon was on Fulmar’s mooring and they watched her crew panicking to get off before Fulmar arrived. They wondered what the Torridons said when they saw Fulmar pass on through and realised that they could have stayed where they were. As they passed Glen Caladh the new Jansi of Kames passed under a not very healthy-sounding engine.They had lunch and the stove was lit then Margaret and Archie went ashore to visit friends and when they came back they brought with them a big sack of coal . The late afternoon and evening were spent below talking and listening to the rain hammering on the deck.Monday morning it was dry but blowing hard. They got the anchor early and motored to the moorings. The sails were hoisted to dry them and St Roma came close by to make their number and at one time a big school of thrasher whales went through the Kyles heading east and at a great speed.About noon they went ashore for a visit to the hotel and for a run round the Ardlamont road . Back aboard they had lunch and soon after packed up and came home."},{"url":null,"title":"the cinema on wheels returns","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe screen machine will be rolling back into Mid Argyll at the end of the month.Bringing with it a host of movies for film fans the Screen Machine will be in Campbeltown Road car park in Tarbert from Wednesday January  to Thursday January  and Lochgilphead Resource Centre car park from Friday January  to Sunday February .Musical fantasy film Cats, based on the Andrew Lloyd Webber stage musical, features an ensemble cast including James Corden, Judi Dench, Jason Derulo, Idris Elba, Jenner Hudson, Ian McKellen, Taylor Swt, Rebel Wilson, and Francesca Hayward.Also known as Star Wars: Episode IX, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is an epic space-opera film.

Indeed, the suggestion has been made that any opinions counter to the management view have been distinctly unwelcome.Nobody is suggesting that Knapdale Ward is perfect, and common sense tells us that dementia patients are more comfortable and relaxed in their home environment. An enhanced community care model is an excellent idea # but healthcare professionals are adamant that Knapdale Ward should be retained, with improvements made in discussion with staff.It is needed, they say, as an option within Argyll when the home environment is no longer suitable for dementia sufferers, their families and carers.Serious questions need to be answered.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"hair raising happenings at the co op","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead Co-op staff are on a fundraising mission which they hope will raise awareness and help overcome stigma around mental illness.Trusting her hairdresser Nicky MacDougall, from Casa in Ardrishaig, Tina Holloway will have her hair shaved off to raise funds for the Scottish Association for Mental Health .Explaining why she decided to take on the challenge, Tina said: #I didn#t really think before I opened my mouth.

Fulmar got off equal first with half a dozen others and the Bosun, at the tiller, is reported to have had a look of near terror on his face. If he had known that one of the yachts, Sinbad, had lost its rudder during the melee and was virtually out of control he would probably have been more frightened. Two boats, Islay and Saionara, were in trouble with burst and torn mainsails. Fulmar held her position well and was among the first half dozen boats up to Colintraive but thereafter the wind fell light and they got stuck in the south narrows and nearly all the boats passed them – those taking the north channel scoring very decisively.Down the Kerry Kyle they recovered some of the lost ground but when they rounded Ardlamont they were still well down in the tail. They passed through the Skate and this paid handsomely as they got a tremendous lt up the east shore and passed boat after boat – those out in the middle of the loch got stuck and never got going again. Seewolf was lying rd or th at the Skate but she crossed the line a very bad last of the whole fleet. A spell of very calm weather followed while Fulmar was away over at Kilfinnan but, a light air coming away, they managed to cross over to the west shore and there got quite a nice little breeze which brought them along splendidly till they reached the buoys south of the breakwater then it died – absolutely. And it took them half an hour to do the distance.Next day, in a strong easterly, they had a slow and strenuous trip through the canal to Crinan then, borrowing Davie Weston’s dinghy to save launching their own, they went straight out and anchored off the canal entrance.There was a straggling start at .am on Monday owing to there being no gun and no one quite knew when to go but followed Arcturus when she gave a lead. Fulmar was moderately well placed about the middle of the ruck. A quite steady easterly gave them a quick passage to Fladda but, off Sheep, it fell light and all were becalmed. This, of course, suited Fulmarfine as no one was moving and, as long as this was the case, she was piling up a fine credit balance of handicap minutes. She tried to keep as well up to the eastward as possible but did not quite succeed in passing east of Sheep island as Arcturus did .A puffer coming south with her smoke trailing away to the west gave them a hint which few,any, of the others took and they held more and more to the east and, as a consequence, got the first of a fresh easterly breeze and swept past boat after boat, most of which had held down to Mull. By the time they got to Duart and were able to bring the breeze dead astern they were well up in the first half and well ahead of their time allowance. Thereafter it was just a question of #Would the wind hold # Provided it did so they felt they had an excellent chance as, with the hold-up at Sheep, they had accumulated more than half an hour of handicap from the leading boats and had lots in hand for those but a little ahead of them.The wind did hold and Fulmar won the Tobermory Cup and the st prize for the second section of the race which with Saturday’s second prize made a very good showing for the weekend.The Mate, Tar and Skipper, were following the race as best they could from the shore. When they came down Loch Fyne side it was a dead calm and they were very surprised when they got to Tarbert to see the boats, half hidden in the rain, coming round Ardlamont – they had no inkling of the breezy start. In Loch Fyne they watched the very slow progress, then the rain cleared off and they were glad to see the big lt Fulmar got up the east shore after going through Skate. For the last two or three hours things went desperately slowly till late-ish in the evening a little breeze brought in the leading boards but it died and left Fulmar no further from the finishing line than the buoys south of the breakwater – she was well up and ahead of several in the big class and most of the small class. She had only about  yards to do when she stopped and, after hurriedly working out the elapsed time handicaps, the Skipper found she had  minutes in which to do them but she failed by a little over two minutes to do it. The Skipper thought she had won as he thought Vanda had been the leader up till then and it was a disappointment when, checking up, he discovered Sally of Kames was ahead of Vanda and had saved her time by two minutes on Fulmar.The start from Crinan was at .am and the Skipper, Tar and Mate got up at .and went across to see them go. The start was a bit of a fiasco as the officials slept in but all the boatsgot off more or less together. As it happens it was perhaps a good thing as, with all the boats starting together on a short line and with the strong easterly breeze that was then blowing there might, too easily, have been some nasty accidents.The Tar, Skipper and Mate went back to their beds then after breakfast went to Oban with little expectation of seeing anything more of the boats. Again they were surprised when, on going to the summit of the Pulpit Hill in Oban, they saw the leading boats just coming up to Duart – they did not know anything of the hold-up at Sheep.Anxiously they watched a number of boats come into view round a hill on Kerrera and were more than pleased when, well up amongst the leaders and passing boat after boat as they watched, they saw the red gaff sails of Fulmar reaching up the Firth of Lorn then running up the Sound of Mull. They watched until most of the boats were well out of recognition distance up the Sound then went home confident thatconditions remained as they were Fulmar had more than a good chance of winning that leg of the race and, with luck, the whole thing.Extract from The Glasgow Herald of Tuesday, July : #Clyde Cruising ClubIn the early hours of yesterday morning the yachts of the Clyde Cruising Club set off from Crinan on the nd leg of their face from Port Bannatyne to Tobermory. The first part of the race ended at Ardrishaig, after which the yachts went through the Crinan Canal.The winners at Ardrishaig were:-Class . st Sally of Kamesh m s.nd Fulmarh m srd Vandah m sExtract from the Glasgow Herald of Monday, July :-Clyde Cruising ClubThe  yachts which raced from Port Bannatyne to Tobermory under the burgee of the Clyde Cruising Club got a rare dusting and with as much wind as they wished the bigger boats came into their own. The  ton cutter Fulmar, which distinguished herself many years ago as one of the few finishers in a stormy Fastnet race, won the Tobermory Cup for the large class, and the  ton sloop Trefoil captured the Torridon Cup for the small class.Driven hard from Port Bannatyne by a fresh easterly, the yachts found a calm patch off Ardrishaig, but they were blown through the canal to Crinan, where the second leg of the race was sailed in a good easterly breeze, resulting in fast passages. The -metre yacht Cerigo arrived first at Tobermory from Crinan in  secs short of  hours.Results:-Class  Fulmar– h m s Sally of Kames– h m s Arcturus– h m sVandah m s. Helenh m s. Torridonh m s.

and embarked on a year-long campaign to eradicate dog fouling.Now, thanks to a successful bid for funding, new bins and bag dispensers have been located throughout the town.ldquoIrsquove always found the notion of dog poo smeared across our streets abhorrent, even as a small child, said community councillor Jackie Couchman.ldquoInnerleithen has a high density of dogs in a relatively small area which magnies the issue.ldquoMost dog owners are responsible and pick up, a sizeable minority do not and, it would seem, will not. I thought it was worth a concerted effort to seewe could make a dference to the state of our streets to benefit everyone. I was prepared to make a personal commitment of time and effort to this cause.The project got off ground last January when Innerleithen community councillors made the decision to try and rid the streets of dog mess.Reflecting on the actions they undertook, Jackie said: ldquoI became involved after Gordon Daly taped plastic bottles to lampposts to dispense free poo bags to those in need.\"Susan Meikle and I offered to help these from supplies Gordon had procured from the Dogs Trust.The following month, the community council was encouraged by local authority councillors to apply for funding through the Localities Area Bid Fund.ldquoThis concentrated my mind and I took it upon myself to complete the application with offers of help from both a previous applicant and The Bridge, said Jackie.ldquoWe heard our project had been shortlisted to be put to the public vote in time for our May community council meeting.But the timetable for the public voting process was disrupted by other political happenings, and after a tense wait and a flurry of activity to encourage voting, good news was delivered.Jackie added: ldquoWe heard our bid was successful in time for our July meeting.\"Various conditions had to be met before the funds could be released, including  percent of the amount applied for supplied by us, copies of our constitution and accounts.ldquoHaving won the funding, final details of ordering, delivery, installation and maintenance had to be agreed.Whilst waiting on the new bins to arrive, the community councillors did not rest on their laurels.With the help of SBC leader Shona Haslam, Jackie and Gordon stencilled anti-fouling signs on problem pavements in Innerleithen.Community councillors also mapped out locations for the new bins and Scottish Borders Council agreed to install these and remove or relocate the redundant ones.ldquoOperationally, the local authority agreed to provide the litter bags and to replenish the poo bags with us taking responsibility for funding them, added Jackie.With the bins now in place, the community council is due to meet on Monday to discuss further fundraising initiatives.The townrsquos community council, in particular, the poo-busting trio of Jackie, Gordon and Susan, have worked tirelessly this last year to combat the dog fouling issue in Innerleithen.Nevertheless, inevitable questions remain.Will they no longer witness the flattened deposit bearing the imprint of a shoe, the stressed parent quickly steering their child away from the offending brown mess, or irritated adult repeatedly scraping their foot off a kerb Probably not says Jackie, adding: ldquoWas it worth it  Yes.\"And in the shorter term it has made a dference.\"Longer term, my feeling is that it will depend on continuing effort and collective ownership of the problem. People have generally been very supportive although every post on social media has triggered lsquothey wonrsquot ever pick up commentsrsquo.\"Despite the campaign Jackie says itrsquos unlikely that everyone will become law abiding citizens and pick up after their dog, but says shersquod do it all again in an effort to keep clean the streets and grass verges of the bonnie town she resides in."},{"url":null,"title":"council-asked-declare-interest-planet","story":"CAMPAIGNERS descended on Thursdays meeting of Scottish Borders Council in a bid to convince the local authority to declare a Climate Emergency.So far  councils across Scotland have made the declaration as efforts continue to halt and reverse the damage being done to the planet.Despite the Extinction Rebellion protest outside the council headquarters at Newtown St Boswells, bosses have yet to issue any statement.Protestor Jennie Gibson said: \"The declaration is the first step to deal with the problem.\"It shows the council takes climate crisis seriously and so should we.\"It means they have to make plans to cut emissions and we can seethey do it or not.

attempted to defend their track record despite being rated amongst the worst performing in Scotland.Figures released by the Local Government Benchmarking Framework last week puts the Newtown St Boswells authority towards the bottom of the heap in most categories.With housing stock transferred over to Scottish Borders Housing Association and all cultural and leisure facilities in the hands of Live Borders, the local authoritys portfolio of responsibility has diminished over the past decade or so.But much of what remains under Scottish Borders Council control is lagging behind other authorities.As well as having the second worst roads in the country, according to the   findings, bosses at Newtown spent less than half the national average on repairs, pound, per kilometre against the Scotland-wide pound,.Although an argument can be made regarding the additional amount of carriageway in the rural Borders, similar authorities, such as Highland, Aberdeenshire, Moray and both North and East Ayrshire, all spent considerably more.Only Dumfries and Galloway, and Eilean Siar authorities spent less during  .Scottish Borders Council also spent below the national average on every aspect of education.Across Scotland the average spend per pupil in secondary education was pound,, while in the Borders it was only pound,.Primary pupil spend in Scotland was pound,, while in the Borders during   it was pound,.And pre-school spend per pupil in the Borders was only pound, against a national average of pound,.The number of sick days taken by teachers in the Borders was also worse than the national average.While spending on frontline education is well below Scottish averages, the amount spent on office-based administration and support across the whole authority during  , at seven percent of budget, was almost double the national level of four percent.Local MSP Christine Grahame believes Scottish Borders Council should re-prioritise its spending.She told us: \"I am sure Borderers will be angry at the information coming to light from this given how clearly it demonstrates the councilrsquos deeply skewed priorities for its spending.ldquoTime and time again constituents have contacted me to complain about the frankly dangerous state of some roads in the Borders and I have repeatedly raised it with SBC.\"To now find out it has the third lowest spend per kilometre on roads in the country, and that the area has the second worst A roads and B roads is an unsuprising but damning indictment of the councilrsquos priorities.ldquoWhy is this Tory-led administration spending poundm on vanity projects like the purchase of the Lowood Estate for speculative development, whilst it underspends on our schools, tourism and helping people back to work  Why does it spends so little on economic development to bring down the  percent of shops that lie empty in our town centres ldquoThere are serious questions for SBC to answer here and I for one will certainly look to see them held to account.Investment in helping people back to work was the second lowest, at . percent, of all the  authorities in Scotland.Scottish Borders Council also spent less than half the national average when it came to economic development and tourism.Across Scotland authorities averaged pound, per , population on attracting tourists and improving the local economy, in the Borders the spend was just pound,.And the figures also show that there was a higher proportion of empty town centre propertiesin the Borders than the Scottish average .Elderly care was also ranked poorly with only  percent of council services rated as good or above - the fourth worst in all Scotland - compared to a national average of  percent.Ron Sutherland, who had a successful career in corporate governance, finance and management, has been a strong critic of spending at Newtown St Boswells in recent years.The retired consultant from Innerleithen told us: \"As those who have attempted in recent times to get to the heart of topical issues, transactions and dealings will already be aware, it is often dficult to ascertain what goes on at SBC, through the barrier of smoke and mirrors around the councils Newtown St Boswells nerve centre.\"It might be thought that senior officials - of which we evidently have many - and elected members prefer to inhabit those parts of Council HQ located away from the spotlight of public scrutiny and accountability!\"However, the Local Government Benchmarking Framework provides an excellent opportunity for outsiders to gain an insight into our local authoritys performance in comparison with other councils across the country, and indeed against those with similar characteristics to SBC.\"Revelations of shortcomings in expenditure, or investment of council taxpayers money last year in several key local authority areas of responsibility such as roads, schools and education, tourism, economic and social development, etc. are unsurprising.\"There are fewany bright spots - especially worrying when SBC allocates almost twice the national average funding to administration support, doing little to dispel impressions of a top-heavy, inefficient organisation.\"This resonates with the recent eye-wateringly costly and confused SB Cares debacle - indicative of poor planning and organisational management allied to woefully inept financial control and monitoring by those senior people charged with doing just that, and paid handsomely into the bargain.For the record in the year to March , its last full year of operation, provisional accounts for SB Cares LLP disclosed a net loss of over pound. million, with net current liabilities - effectively, accumulated insolvency - in excess of pound. million - plus an audit report casting material uncertainty and signicant doubt on the organisations viability as a going concern.,params: .push\"In most peoples book, that would read like mismanagement, which would be little short of a scandal.\"Moreover, in the four years of so of employment, the CEO of SB Cares took home more than half a million pounds for his efforts and he was also employed as an executive director of SBC, in clear contravention of relevant guidelines relating to conflict of interest.\"Will anyone be held accountable \"In a statement from Scottish Borders Council, bosses attempted to highlight the amount of money spent with local suppliers and contractors was signicantly higher than the national average.But it didnt mention that only  percent of invoices were paid on time - against a national average of  percent, making it the fth worst for paying bills in the country.Rather than being disappointed SBC Chief Executive Tracey Logan prefers to look at more locally sourced surveys.She said: ldquoThese statistics are just one element of how we regularly monitor and report the performance of the council.\"Many of these figures are not new, and in some areas we believe that some of the local data we collect, for example the Scottish Borders Household Survey and those undertaken with Live Borders customers, are more representative due to the volume of responses received.\"These show much higher levels of satisfaction with services.ldquoHowever, every piece of information on our service delivery is useful, and we will use the statistics and comparison data to look at how we can continue to change, improve and invest to provide the best possible services to the residents of the Scottish Borders.Scottish Borders Council did fare well in council tax collections and support offered for looked-after children.And it has the second highest spend of any authority, at pound, per , population, on parks and outdoor spaces, with the national average being pound,.The signicant spend is down to the investment in new parks and the additional cost of staff from other departments.Council leader Shona Haslam said: \"It is abundantly clear when you look at the full range of data released that council services are under pressure across the country, with average performance falling across many areas.ldquoIn some measures this follows long periods of improvement, suggesting that we may be reaching a tipping point in how council services are being affected by the need for us all to make savings due to the gap between the funding required to maintain and improve services and that actually available.ldquoScottish Borders Council continues to make and maintain progress in some key areas, but we have to be realistic and acknowledge that services, particularly non-statutory ones, are impacted by reductions in spending.\""},{"url":null,"title":"borders-holiday-inspires-authors-debut-novel","story":"A NEW author has set his debut novel

If the project does not go ahead on this site, it is very dficult to see it going ahead at all.\"The proposed site is on the Gilmerton estate, south of the current museum.Councillors questioned whether a field to the west of the Scheduled Monument had also been looked at and were told that Historic Environment Scotland had said it would not allow the hangar to be built there either.The planned removal of the trees had led to a public outcry, with an online petition against it gaining more than , signatures.The Woodland Trust told the council that replanting trees would not replace some of the ancient woodland which it said would be lostthe plans were given the go ahead.And Councillor Norman Hampshire, planning convenor, pointed out that East Lothian councillors had declared a climate emergency last year.The committee was told it was likely the new trees would take  years before they equalled the positive impact the felled woodland had on the countys carbon footprint.Fellow committee member Councillor Fiona ODonnell said: \"When this council took a decision about climate change we used the word emergency, not down the line, so we cant lose  years.\"I think the loss is not a price worth paying.\"Three councillors supported the plans, which were recommended for approval by planning officers, including Provost John McMillan, who is the administrations economic development spokesperson.He said: \"I believe in the round this will be doing something for public benefit.\"His views were supported by councillors Lachlan Bruce and Katie Mackie, who pointed to the jobs benefit of the new centre and increase in tourism.Councillor Mackie said: \"One of the things I love about East Lothian is its natural heritage but the introduction of  jobs and need for people not to have to commute to Edinburgh for work is really important.\"Councillor Colin McGinn told the committee that a young boy who attended the meeting with family told him when he came in to \"save the trees\".He said: \"This is about their future. If we make a decision to cut down  trees we are doing him a disservice.\"Councillor Jeremy Findlay refused to support the planning application, saying he was not convinced all other options had been considered.He said: \"I would encourage the Museum of Flight to go back to Historic Environment Scotland and have further discussions with them.\"I am not convinced they will turn round and say no, we have not seen any evidence they will.\"A National Museums Scotland spokeswoman said: \"We are disappointed by the outcome of the East Lothian Council planning committee meeting.\"This is an important project for East Lothian. It will ensure the preservation of historically important aircraft, it will also create jobs and play a transformative role within the local tourism economy.\"We will now take stock and review our next steps.The committee rejected the planning application on the grounds it would result in the loss of  trees, to the detriment of the climate of East Lothian and the councils climate policy, by eight votes to three.Councillors who voted against were Jeremy Findlay, Sue Kempson, Fiona ODonnell, Neil Gilbert, John Williamson, Kenny McLeod, Colin McGinn and Norman Hampshire.

After the session, as the children were heading for lunch, a girl from the class came up and said: ldquoI think the moral in that tale is that we should be kind, but that itrsquos often not easy to do.It was a traditional tale in which the tables are turned on a selfish rich man who had shown no compassion, but then hoped for kindness when he was the one in need. In the brief discussion with this young person, we agreed that itrsquos easier to show kindness to someone who we believe truly deserves it.She told me: ldquoI think the woman in the story did the right thing butIrsquom being honest,it had been me I donrsquot knowIrsquod have been able to be kind like her, because Irsquod have wanted revenge. Thatrsquos the problem, I think, we always think about revenge first. It can make us feel better for a short while but really makes things worse, well at least not better anyway. I try to be kind, sometimes it isnrsquot easy, but I try. Kindness is like a seed we have to plant.I shouldnrsquot have been bowled over by this, for I know a -year-old can have wisdom that many so called grown-ups have forgotten. But I was deeply impressed by her reflection on the storyrsquos message, and her honesty and integrity.This conversation also revealed the power of stories to raise moral dilemmas and human issues without finger pointing or being preachy.And she is right, it can often be very dficult to be kind. The world seems so full of stress, selfishness, anger and intolerance that there seems little space for kindness, except towards those we love and care about. On top of that, it seems increasingly dficult to survive, keep a roof above our heads and pay the bills. Kindness begins at home and often there is little energy, emotion or resources left to think or care about others we arenrsquot responsible for.There can even be a real fear thatwe show lsquotoo muchrsquo kindness we risk becoming a doormat, being used or treated unfairly. We can sometimes watch a child being kind to another and it not being reciprocated, and the temptation then is to suggest kindness isnrsquot shown next time.ldquoWe need to teach people a lesson, is often the mantra which derails our instinct to be kind another way of saying we want revenge. And letrsquos be honest: cruel, uncaring and selfish people can take advantage of someonersquos kindness and revenge does often make us feel better, in the short term anyway.But is the answer to allow unkind behaviour to frame the way we want to live and be treated  Do we respond to unkindness with more unkindness in   So consequently, cruelty with more cruelty, intolerance with more intolerance, selfishness with yet more selfishness  Doesnrsquot this mean that we allow lsquothe lessonrsquo to be that kindness doesnrsquot pay  As Gandhi is famously reported to have said: ldquoAn eye for an eye only ends up making the whole world blind.The truth is, kindness is not weakness but strength. It often isnrsquot easy and takes great courage. It doesnrsquot mean that people should not face consequences for their actions, or that people should be asked to forgive the unforgivable. But it does mean not allowing the unkindness of others to define how we are. We should not allow such acts to clip our butterfly wings.What do I mean by this  There is a theory called the lsquobutterfly effectrsquo. In this theory, it is said that the flapping of a butterflyrsquos wings could cause a chain reaction in which a hurricane could be caused on the other side of the planet. It is not meant to be taken literally, but to show that a very small act, although seemingly insignicant in itself, can have huge, unforeseen repercussions.In this way, kindness is a butterfly. Small acts of kindness may have a huge effect that touches people beyond the knowledge of the person who displayed the kindness. Acts of cruelty and hate also have the same power but all the more reason to flutter the wings of kindness so the wind more likely blows in the right direction.In this way, our behaviour is a butterfly. The way we flap its wings can have huge unforeseeable consequences, either for good or bad, both for ourselves and others. When we are kind, we actually makes ourselves happier too.So to make a real dference, we need only do tiny acts that are easily within our power, and as often as we can. A smile, a moment you truly listen to someone, a helping hand, holding the door open, trying to understand how someone feels, making a cup of tea, not meeting anger with anger, trying not to gain revenge but a change of heart and so on.This is what will truly make up the index of a healthy and happy society. And all of us can be players in this, and beneficiaries of our own kindness.David W Orr, a professor of environmental studies and politics, has said: ldquoThe plain fact is that the planet does not need more successful people. But it does desperately need more peacemakers, healers, restorers, storytellers and lovers of every kind.Great words, but that -year-old school girl already got this.

In the case of fully electric cars, those emissions are zero.There are plenty of electric cars to choose from. There are the self-charging hybrids. These use a combination of an engine with a battery and have the ability to run for a short while in zero emission mode. Such vehicles do not require charging by you.On the other hand, Plug-in Electric Hybrids - often abbreviated to PHEV - have an engine but feature a larger battery that can be charged from the mains or from a home charging unit. These have the ability to run emission-free for around - miles - enough for your daily commute.Finally electric cars - often called EVsor BEVs- only have a battery. They require charging from a home charging unit to run continuously in zero emission mode.Of course, technology is fast-moving. Where once a fully electric car had a range of barely  miles, todayrsquos electric cars offer in excess of  miles.So how do you stay ahead of technology without incurring huge costs and loss of value in a car One way is through car leasing.

Despite there being more than a quarter of a million electric cars registrations in the UK between  and , many prospective buyers remain cautious.The top concern of car-buyers is the range of EVs. Of course, itrsquos true that in some of the fledgling models, range was an issue, but technology has moved on. The Nissan Leaf, for example, will drive for  miles before needing a recharge. The range is clearly displayed on the dashboard, so therersquos no danger of getting caught short. And the reality is,  per cent of journeys in the UK are shorter than  miles, so there is a high likelihood that it will meet the needs of most people.Charge times are another concern. A full charge on the Leaf takes eight hours but a quick charge will provide  per cent capacity in only half an hour. And with more and more investment being ploughed into EV infrastructure and charging points around the country, filling up the tank is becoming easier and easier every day.Speed is a popular misconception too. If when you think about an electric car, golf buggies and dodgem cars spring to mind, it might be time to think again. Far from being sluggish, modern EVs have excellent acceleration. The new Leaf can go from -mph in . seconds and has a top speed of mph. And they produce instant torque, meaning the start-stop transition is slick and immediate.Fully electric vehicles are, of course, only the tip of the iceberg for the eco-conscious, eager to get ahead of the curve on green issues. Hybrid cars have batteries which are charged up on long motorway journeys, enabling them to power shorter trips about town, saving fuel without the need to schedule trips around charging points.Hybrids are a good compromise for those who arenrsquot necessarily ready to make the full leap to electric, combining some of the benefits of EVs like lower road tax, savings on fuels and reduced carbon footprint, without taking the plunge into completely new territory.Both Macklin Motors Nissan Glasgow Central and Macklin Motors Nissan Glasgow South have gained Electric Vehicle Approved Status , so the teams there are well-equipped to advise customers about changing to an electric or hybrid vehicle.Macklin Motors Nissan Glasgow South,  Welbeck Road, Darnley, Glasgow, G SDwww.macklinmotors find-a-dealer nissan-glasgow-south Macklin Motors Nissan Glasgow Central,  Port Dundas Road, Glasgow, G HZwww.macklinmotors find-a-dealer nissan-glasgow-central ------------------------------------------------------------------------Helensburgh Toyota For Toyota, hybrid really isnrsquot anything new as they first manufactured hybrid vehicles more than  years ago.

The cars are self-charging which means every moment you are driving, your battery is charging even when slowing down, so no need to plug anything in. Whether in the town or on the motorway, hybrids feel no dferent to drive than a petrol car, offering a quiet and relaxing ride and still delivers the power you need.Speaking about the increase in hybrid orders, Kirsteen McGuire, Helensburgh Toyota Sales Manager said: ldquoThe hybrid message across the car industry is finally hitting home. More and more people are making the switch to hybrid and in turn benefitting from lower tax and petrol costs. Where other car manufacturers are playing catch up, Toyota has been a trusted advocate of hybrid technology for many years. The reality is that manufacturers are moving to eventually producing only hybrid vehicles. I have worked for Helensburgh Toyota for  years and demand for hybrid has never been higher.If yoursquore new to Hybrid and are looking to experience Toyota Hybrid for yourself, why not book and appointment at the Helensburgh Hybrid Drive Event on Saturday  February.The team at Helensburgh Toyota are only too happy to give you more information and take you out on a test drive.www.facebook HelensburghToyota videos  sfnsmowww.facebook HelensburghToyota videos  sfnsmowww.helensburgh.toyota-------------------------------------------------------------------JorroIn  Jorro was created to be specialists in EV Charging for drivers and businesses across Scotland. Taking experience in renewable energy using Solar PV and a passion for zero emission transport, they decided that an independent company not linked to any manufacturer of cars, charge points or energy provider, would allow them to offer impartial advice to customers choosing to go electric for the first time.When plugging in the car at home, the smart charge point automatically decides when it is cheapest to charge. Paying just p per kWh overnight, which means you can travel up to , miles for just pound, compared to over pound in an efficient mpg petrol or diesel car. Even using typical electricity tarfs, customers are travelling over , miles per year for less than pound.To encourage EV drivers to charge safely at home rather than relying on the pin plug adaptor, the UK Government offers pound OLEV grant towards the cost of installing a home charge point. In Scotland, a further pound cash-back is available from Energy Saving Trust , reducing the cost further and in some installations covering the cost completely. To access the grants and extended three year warranty you must use an approved installer and check that like Jorro, they are approved by both OLEV and EST.The smallest fast charger on the market, which is smaller than an A piece of paper, EO Mini Pro is proving very popular for those looking for a discreet solution.Did you know Jorro offer charge points that can charge the car for free  If you have Solar Panels you can use the generated electricity to power the car with a Zappi Charge Point. Even in Scotland a typical Solar PV System can provide more than  miles of range per day.Some drivers may not have a convenient place to charge at home so installing charge points at work may be the solution with businesses able to claim up to pound, in grant funding to install charging for staff.

Sophy Ridge, meanwhile, spoke to Andy Burnham, the mayor of Manchester, Dawn Butler MP, another Labour deputy leadership candidate, former Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, and the Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick.Of the two line-ups, perhaps only Ambassador Liu was of direct relevance to viewers in Scotland.

It was the first topic in host Gordon Brewerrsquos review of the week with Jenni Davidson of Holyrood magazine and Peter Geoghegan, investigative journalist with the website openDemocracy.The main interview was a pre-recorded sit down between Brewer and Keith Brown, Depute Leader of the SNP.

Some % of people in Scotland were now paying more tax, said Brewer.

But when the block grant adjustment was taken into account the Scottish Government ended up with just poundm more.ldquoPeople in Scotland might be prepared to pay more taxthey thought the money was going somewhere useful, said Brewer.Brown said the money was going somewhere useful, public services, and that the majority of people in Scotland paid less tax than they would in the rest of the UK. ldquoScotlandrsquos got the lowest tax rate in the whole of the UK,\" he said.Mr Brown, a former Cabinet Secretary for the economy, did not move off the front foot.

The fact that she isnrsquot facing a court made it impossible to judge that issue, so instead I asked why the same offence ndash in this case, allegedly careless or reckless driving ndash should receive minor penalties when no harm ensues, and potentially a very serious one , when the worst happens.The conclusion must be that the law is pragmatic and worldly, rather than dealing with abstract ethical questions. The moral issue raised by careless driving is the same whether or not therersquos an accident, but real-world effects are hugely dferent. Butwe accept this compromise ndash and the very existence of diplomatic immunity is an example of putting practical interests above pure justice ndash wersquore at least entitled to an explanation of why the normal rule of law is being set aside.The allegation that Mrs Sacoolas is not only the we of an American diplomat, but herself a CIA agent, doesnrsquot change this basic dilemma but,true, goes some way to explaining why this should have been a thorny case in terms of Realpolitik and international relations. The case of Mike Lynch, a British businessman who is to be extradited to America on fraud charges, is a further example of what looks like political expediency winning out over justice.In , the Crown Prosecution Service found no grounds for prosecuting Dr Lynch, who was running a UK company listed on the London Stock Exchange, governed by English law and UK accounting practices. A subsequent civil case has finished hearing evidence but not yet produced a ruling.Yet under the US UK extradition arrangements introduced by Tony Blairrsquos government in , the Home Secretary ldquomust process the request, and no appeal is possible. Americans, by contrast, get to challenge such requests from the UK in their own courts, or, in the case of Mrs Sacoolas, ignore them altogether.This not only seems obviously unjust, it isnrsquot even very pragmatic in political terms. Eventhe UKis less powerful than the US, it cannot be remotely in our interests to allow such one-sided agreements. There may be an argument, evenitrsquos not very moral one, for compromises for the sake of some supposed greater good. There isnrsquot for just being kicked around.

And theyrsquod be right.But I have to admit my head has been in total agreement with Larryrsquos on the baldness issue. In fact, I had obsessed about hair loss over a -year period. From the age of  Irsquod watched my hair relocate from scalp to sink plug, and in the process Irsquod tried every hair loss lotion and potion available.Irsquod used alcohol rubs, snake oil, hot oil, scalp massage, every shampoo on the market ndash Irsquod even hung upside down for a few weeksndash and indeed Irsquod tried everything possible to regrow hair except castration, realising this was probably a step too far.And I knew it wasnrsquot just me and Larry who were devastated by the arrival at the door of the Grim Hair Reaper. Dr Pamela Wellsrsquo writing in the British Journal of Psychology summed up exactly how I was feeling, describing how balding men had ldquomarkedly lower self-esteem than those with good hair covering.She explained how confidence diminished in direct relation to the amount of hairs going down the shower plug hole.Dr Wells understood implicitly how hair loss equalled existentialist despair I comb, therefore I am. But then hope arrived one night while watching television. TV Dragon Duncan Bannatyne, boasting a good head of hair, said hersquod had a hair transplant and his re-forestation had come about at the hands of a Dr Farjo in Manchester.Now, I was excited. And I told my chum, John Reid, about my plans to investigate the hair doc. Yet, John didnrsquot share my delight at all. ldquoThey donrsquot last, he said. ldquoThe hair just falls out. And I knew that he knew what he was talking about. The Paisley-born pop managerrsquos most famous client was Elton John and hersquod held his starrsquos hand during Eltonrsquos ill-fated visits to the Parisian clinic where his hair was transplanted.Sadly, Eltonrsquos relationship with his new hair lasted about the sameof time as his first marriage. A decade of wearing hats resulted, before a very expensive wig system was purchased.Yet, I didnrsquot accept Johnrsquos argument. I studied up on Eltonrsquos failure. The bald truth was that Eltonrsquos treatment had failed because hair science in the early s wasnrsquot adequate. Transplantation involves hair being taken from the back or sides of the head ndash which is genetically programmed not to fall out ndash and moved to the top. However, Eltonrsquos hair had been transplanted in large chess board-sized squares. As such, the follicles were denied sufficient blood supply to grow.Pop star Gary Numan, I learned, had suffered a similar fate. Comedian Russ Abbotrsquos ldquodollrsquos hair plugs didnrsquot work either for the same reason. But now there were new micrograft transplant techniques availablewhich meant grafts were small and manageable. And single hair shafts could be inserted ndash which avoids the dollrsquos hair plug effect.With this info, I took off to see Dr Bessam Farjo in Manchester. Thankfully, amazingly, he did give me new hair. Or at least cleverly re-positioned hair. The process was painless. And just as importantly, I still have the hair  years later. I now carry a comb as a right. I no longer look at menrsquos hairlines with envy. I no longer dream of recapturing my teenage David Cassidy hair.Ironically, Cassidy later informed me hersquod had three transplants.But what of hair transplantation today  A decade ago, it was next to impossible to find someone whorsquod had a successful hair transplant to talk about the process.There was a huge stigma. One close female acquaintance even said it was, ldquonot something a man should have done. There were also high failure rates, heavy scarring involved, some very bad results in clinics in Britain and across the world. Is this still the case The hair transplantation business has grown massively. Worldwide, the industry was worth . billion in . Two years later it soared to . billion, a  per cent increase in market size. It is expected to reach an incredible . billion by , according to figures released by the International Society of Hair Restoration Surgeons.However, Brian Adams, of the Hair Loss Experiences web forum, explains that the success of the hair industry has created a new wave of hair problems. ldquoWith the development of follicular unit extraction [the process whereby a small drill unit takes small hair grafts from the back of the head ndash as opposed to the strip method, where aof scalp is removed and the follicles then separated and insterted] teams of lsquotecs are being sent in to cosmetic clinics, even dentist surgeries, to carry out the work.ldquoSome of these hair technicians will be good, but some are very, very bad, and this can result in really shoddy work, with infections resulting, or bad hairlines and bald patches.Dr Pauline McCluskey, of the Glasgow Clinic, echoes these concerns. ldquoLots of young people are being encouraged to have hair transplants by lsquoinfluencersrsquo, she explains. ldquoYouTube is full of them. The danger is that these youngsters have a transplant without really needing them, simply because theyrsquove seen someone famous having one. And, sadly, they view the procedure as similar to having their teeth whitened.ldquoBut itrsquos not. They donrsquot realise that by using under-experienced transplant lsquotechniciansrsquo they may have hair grafts taken from a part of the head where it is programmed to fall out. They donrsquot realise hair loss is a progressive condition.The transplant surgeon adds: ldquoWhat is also common is over-harvesting, which leaves the back of the head looking moth-ridden.There are problems with incredibly poor artistry, whereby hairlines look too square, creating a Thunderbird puppet effect. ldquoAnd itrsquos really sad to see some of the cases we have referred to us for repair. In fact, recently we even had to remove hair grafts from someonersquos forehead.This Frankenstein world of surgery is frighteningly common, says Brian Adams. But he adds a further concern that the likes of government agency Health Care Improvement Scotland donrsquot have the expertise to examine the hair work carried out in the detail he and reputable transplant surgeons would like.ldquoI also see a great deal of men having hair transplants being sold short they may have relatively fewer units transplanted than they could have had. And they may have a pluggy-looking forehead. But because they donrsquot know any better they donrsquot know the dference.Brian Adams adds: ldquoMy advice would always be to go to a surgeon who is registered with the International Society of Hair Restoration Surgeons. Go to a clinic where you can see accreditation and examples of the work.At least, says Brian Adams, the stigma for men has almost evaporated, that the procedure has ldquobecome normalised.Since footballer Wayne Rooney went public about his re-turfing, the industry has taken a huge bounce with the likes of fellow football figures Ryan Giggs, David Silva and Jurgen Klopp talking new hair. In Scotland, the likes of Kris Boyd and James McFadden were treated at the Glasgow Clinic.Meanwhile, at the Farjo Clinic the celebrity client list has soared and the institute can claim to have restored the locks of five Emmerdales, two Coronation Streets, an EastEnder and one Cold Feet star.Dr Farjo has also implanted follicles into the heads of actor and TV presenter Warwick Davis, and former Sunderland and Celtic player Micky Gray. More recently, the hair doctor has ed s pop star Martin Fryrsquos quf to its majesterial position.The ABC singer is vocal about what a hair transplant has meant to his well-being. ldquoIn the music business you are often standing in front of a mirror an awful lot, he explains. ldquoAnd then the audience becomes your mirror. When yoursquore losing your hair that becomes very dficult. And so over the years I tried all sorts of products to make the hair thicker, even a bit oftalcum powder. But it didnrsquot work, and being older and still in the public eye, when I hit  I knew it was time to do something.The Look of Love singer added: ldquoI looked at options across the world, but when I walked through the doors in Manchester it felt right. And the results are way better than my expectations. It has changed my confidence.He grins: ldquoAnd rock stars canrsquot go bald. Just ask Bruce Springsteen or Bono.Cold Feet star John Thomson echoes the pop starrsquos thoughts. He likened his old hairline to an ldquoapprentice monk. He said: ldquoIt looked really thin. I thought, lsquoDo you know what  Irsquom gonna do something about this.rsquoThomson, like Fry, has seen his self-confidence soar. ldquoThe new hair arrived and it was like a window box that had been watered. I donrsquot have the worry now.Career prospects, he argues, have also greatly improved. The actor would agree with the research carried out by the University of Pennsylvania that says those with hair look, on average,  years younger. ldquoIrsquom going to get cast younger than without hair, he maintains.John Thomsonrsquos Cold Feet co-star James Nesbitt believes that having had a hair transplant has extended his career. ldquoSeveral years ago, I began losing my hair and like a lot of men it was a major concern to me, in fact it was practically an obsession.ldquoBut, also Irsquom an actor so Irsquom in the public eye a lot and I really felt that my hair loss could affect my career prospects. So, after many agonies and a great amount of thought, I took the decision to visit Hair Restoration Blackrock in Dublin. Dr Maurice Collins who does it is a genius. But itrsquos not cheap, probably  grand.James Nesbittrsquos comments on cost raise a major question: how much do you need to pay to have new hair  Blackrock this week quoted me a price of k Euros,to have , grafts. Thatrsquos the same number I had with the Farjo Clinic, at a cost of under poundk.The Glasgow Clinic suggests a hair transplant can cost, and they stress this is a guide figure, around pound-k. ldquoBut we wonrsquot offer a fixed figure until we see the patient, says Dr McCluskey.ldquoWe need to look at the area to be covered, and the donor area, and consider whether one transplant will be enough to achieve a satisfactory result.Brian Adams says potential recipients should beware of paying over the odds. Wayne Rooney is said to have spent upwards of poundk and had several transplants. ldquoWhat you also have to look out for is the brokers, the middlemen who will set up websites suggesting they are a transplant clinic, but who will charge a fee for directing you to a hair transplant surgeon.He also warns of paying way too little. ldquoYou have to beware of the attraction of tourist transplants. You will see lots of ads for hair transplants in Turkey, for example, where you can have one and a holiday for pound. And you will see blokes post of how happy they are to have new hair. But they donrsquot realise theyrsquove had bad work done until it doesnrsquot grow properly, itrsquos patchy, or they have bad scarring.But why does our hair fall out in the first place  Woody Allen once declared: ldquoThe best thing to do is to behave in a manner befitting onersquos age. If you are  and under try not to go bald.Well, Allenrsquos joke works because the truth is we have no say on when we lose hair. Certainly, by the age of , most men are in the process of hair loss. By , two thirds will have checked into the Follicle Free Hotel as a result of DNA bad luck.Thatrsquos because every hair follicle is unique, a little hair factory made up of several dferent parts, including the hair shaft which is created, pigmented, assembled and oiled by sebaceous glands. But it is under attack from a by-product called dihydrotestosterone, .If scalp hair were Superman, DHT would be its kryptonite. It enters the cell of the hair follicles and hooks itselfonto a highly specic cell protein and commands the protein to destroy itself. And the hair follicles stop cycling. One tribe of South American Indians has no history of hair loss whatsoever they have no DHT in their blood.But, thankfully, follicles at the back of the head are kryptonite protected. Thatrsquos why hair transplantation can produce great results. Yet, not everyone can have oneyou donrsquot have a dense enough donor area, it wonrsquot happen.There is hope for those poor souls. Dr Farjo believes in the possibility of cell therapy with dermal papilla cloning. Located at the base of the hair follicles, the dermal papillae play a crucial role in hair growth cycle by inducing follicle development from the epidermis to produce hair fibre.And while John Reid had hair reservations  years ago, the procedure can produce even better results today, thanks to the new scientic techniques that give better yields higher magnication, better preservation solutionsand more teaching and learning ldquoin an ethical manner.And Dr Farjo says wigs can work. Elton self-deprecatingly says he looks like Shrek without his wig. Yet, the singer adds that the effect of wearing a wig is that the bald jokes have disappeared.Whatrsquos obvious in  is that there are many hair options. For most menitrsquos no longer a question of hair today, gone tomorrow.The worry suffered by Sir Larry is disappearing fast. But make sure you put your head in the right hands."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-human-traffickers-ordered-pay-back-100-000-profits","story":"Robert McPhee and son-in-law John Miller were jailed in  after being found guilty of a number of offences including abduction and holding workers in servitude.:Four charged with human trafficking offences after raids in Edinburgh and GlasgowA confiscation hearing was held at the High Court in Edinburgh on Monday, which estimated the pair ndash aged  and  ndash benefited by around pound,.Orders have been made totalling pound,, with pound, to be paid to their victims as compensation, while the rest will go to Cashback for Communities.Jenner Harrower, procurator fiscal for specialist casework, said: ldquoThe vulnerable men who were targeted and exploited were promised paid work, free food and board but McPhee and Miller did nothing but profit from their abuse.ldquoA proportion of the money recovered from McPhee and Miller will be paid to the victims, which itrsquos hoped will go some way to repairing the damage done to the workers.:Human trafficking action partnership at Glasgow Airport suspended lsquodue to BrexitrsquoldquoThe Crownrsquos role does not stop at prosecution.ldquoEven after a conviction is secured, we will use the Proceeds of Crime legislation to confiscate funds from those who do not deserve them."},{"url":null,"title":"comment-time-scottish-water-reflect-views-communities","story":"Water is essential to le, so arguably Scottish Water, our publicly owned water and sewerage company, is the most important public service. Certainly, it is one that most of us use every day, though usually without thinking about it.Its job might seem simple. Collect what falls from the skies, distribute it and then take away the waste. The reality is dferent. Water must be cleaned and made safe for drinking after it is taken from our lochs and rivers, then piped down every street to all homes and businesses. Wastewater must be collected from where we live and work, treated and safely ed to the environment, and surface water dealt with to prevent flooding.Read more: th century laws put Scottish hydro scheme in dispute with meditation retreatScottish Water has recognised that it needs to listen to its customers and their communities. To help it do that it supported the creation of an independent Customer Forum, in partnership with the Water Industry Commission for Scotland and Citizens Advice Scotland.Our role as the Customer Forum is to ensure peoplersquos views are understood and reflected in Scottish Waterrsquos plans. Over the past two years we have probed and challenged, suggested and encouraged actions in the interests of customers. In a business where infrastructure can last for centuries, a long-term strategic plan is needed.That is particularly important in the context of the single biggest challenge facing us all: the climate emergency. For the Scottish Water that poses a twin challenge: not only ending any contribution to causing climate change, but also ensuring it is still able to supply water and take away wastewater in the face of signicantly changing weather patterns.Customers are already seeing the impact of global heating on their water services. The dry summer of  came close to real water shortages, while intense rainfall last year caused flash flooding, impacting on sewer infrastructure, in many parts of Scotland.Read more: Climate change plan to safeguard Scotlands water supplyThe most dramatic sht in Scottish Waterrsquos approach we have helped secure over the last two years has been to take addressing climate change to the centre of future strategy. Our research shows customers want Scottish Water to tackle climate change issues, helping maintain the quality and reliability of their water services, and we are pleased that their new Strategic Plan, A Sustainable Future Together, seeks to embrace addressing these challenges.The magnitude of Scottish Waterrsquos task ndash to achieve net-zero emissions by  ndash comes in the year  world leaders are due to attend COP, the international climate change summit in Glasgow this November.Scottish Waterrsquos strategic plan addresses the needs and aspirations of customers in many areas. For the first time it sets a target to remove all remaining lead from the public water network. It commits to putting customers and communities at the heart of what it does, delivering wider public benefit, for example, increasing the availability of top-up taps and providing better access to its land. It recognises the need to use customersrsquo money efficiently, to provide value.We have fought hard on behalf of customers to ensure Scottish Water has committed to customers priorities in the three strategic outcomes set out in its plan published last week: service excellence going beyond net zero emissions and delivering great value.Delivering on the detail behind the headlines will be tough. The one thing we can be certain of is uncertainty. The development of solutions to achieve these outcomes is at an early stage. Scottish Water must develop a route-map to achieving net zero emissions, requiring new technology and new approaches to using water infrastructure to green our cities. It must increase its renewable energy generation from sewage, its assets and land.For Scottish Water the coming decades will be ones of necessary change and innovation. To succeed it will have to be open with its customers about the challenges ahead. It must help people to use water wisely and to avoid putting fats, oils and other materials that create fatbergs into the wastewater network. It needs stronger partnerships with customers, communities, developers and local authorities amongst others to manage surface water to prevent flooding.What is required needs to be an endeavour shared with customers and communities, from which there must be mutual benefits. That means that Scottish Water needs to continuously strive to understand its customers and communities, shaping the way it operates to meet their needs and aspirations. Having been remarkably open with and listened to the Customer Forum, Scottish Water must now forge a closer relationship with customers, sharing with them the challenges it faces in a national engagement programme.In the future this Strategic Plan may be considered the point at which Scottish Water evolved from being a core service delivery company, to one ever more focused on the big challenges of the future, delivering and supporting the widest possible public benefits for the charges customers pay.Peter Peacock, is the chair of the Customer Forum, which represents customers interests in the water sector in Scotland.

Unless that changes, Orkney will be left with the oldest fleet and the highest fares in the country — and that can only be described as blatant discrimination.”In a response to Councillor Stockan, the minister for energy, connectivity and the islands, Paul Wheelhouse, says Orkney Islands Council is “wholly responsible for the inter-island ferry services which they provide.”He says minsters understand the “signicant financial challenges that can fall on inidual local authorities with responsibility for ferries” and that the Government has “made clear our commitment to Orkney’s internal ferry services” with additional funding of £. million in total over the past two years.Councillor Stockan said: “I am extremely disappointed that the First Minister has chosen not to respond to our considerable concerns directly, or to meet with me to discuss an issue of fundamental importance to our community.“I can only describe the Government’s current position as irrefutable discrimination against the people of Orkney. The additional funding we received over the last two years was welcome, but fell far short of what is needed to fully fund our internal ferry service.“I call on the Government to address this when the budget is published this week — and I have asked the other parties at Holyrood to offer us their full support in securing full and fair funding for Orkney.“The running and replacement costs of Western Isles ferries are fully subsidised by the Government. It is only right and proper that we in Orkney should be treated in the same way.”In the letter, Councillor Stockan also criticises the Government for its continued failure to introduce Road Equivalent Tarf on routes linking Orkney to the Scottish Mainland.“The roll-out of RET began on West of Scotland ferry routes more than a decade ago, reducing fares for local people and visitors alike,” he added.“It is our firm belief that there is no impediment preventing RET being introduced on Orkney routes, and that any further delay is unfair and will result in signicant prejudice against local ferry users.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He played in bands in London, rubbing shoulders with the Rolling Stones, Eric Clapton and his jamming buddy, Ritchie Blackmore, who went on to form the legendary rock bands Deep Purple and Rainbow.He even jammed at a party with Cream bassist and vocalist, Jack Bruce.A visit from Screaming Lord Sutch, who wanted him to go to Germany with him as a bass playermade Jim think again about a career in rock music.His first passion was always art, and comic book art was his favourite genre.He declined Lord Sutch’s offer and after a few years ed to his beloved Orkney. Here he continued drawing for TV comics before working for AD. He was then head-hunted by the American giants, DC Comics and Marvel Comics.Sadly, Jim suffered with Parkinson’s Disease for over  years and passed away on December , .Despite the diagnosis he continued drawing, painting and writing original sci-fi stories for many years.This celebration of his le and art is dferent from other recent exhibitions, as it contains his le story, original artwork and artefacts relating to him.It also features many Orkney related pieces, rather than just sci-fi heroes like Judge Dredd and Batman.Local characters from the th century hang alongside paintings showing the story of St Magnus, wartime Hoy and illustrations from books, like The Bard of Ballarat and Willick o’ Pirliebraes.Jim’s we, Wendy, said: “I am delighted that the Orkney Museum is having an exhibition of my late husband Jim’s work.“The fact that a young boy from the small Orkney island of Hoy should become world famous in his chosen field of comic book illustration is an achievement in itself, but there were many other aspects to Jim’s le.“This exhibition gives an insight into his early le in Hoy, as well, as his time in the RAF and the excitement of being in the London music scene during the ‘swinging sixties’.“I think it is a true reflection of the times he lived in and I hope it will interest the folk who see it.”The Orkney Museum is open Monday to Saturday, .am-.pm, .pm-pm.

They have lost confidence in the main parties. I think the main parties have ignored people and their concerns.

And, just to be clear, it would be equally as seriousthe teenager in question had been a girl.It is likely there is cross-party agreement that the -year-old Mackay should now stand down as MSP for Renfrewshire North and West. However, Nicola Sturgeon was right when she said that “no matter how upset and shocked all of us are in these situations, there’s a need for due process”.Despite the scale of the justied outrage, the full facts need to be established in a calm and considered way. After all, there may be questions for others to answer.It has long been known that those in positions of power will sometimes abuse it, but the MeToo movement should have spelt out the full consequences to anyone failing to grasp them.Once such conduct might have been brushed under the carpet, but society has changed, considerably and for the better, in refusing to tolerate it.MSPs are the democratically elected leaders of this country and their actions must be beyond reproach. It is, or at least should be, part of their job to send a message to those in positions of power in wider society about what is and is not acceptable behaviour.And an MSP, let alone a Cabinet minister, sending scores of unsolicited messages of the type described to a -year-old is, in the words of the First Minister, “unacceptable”.

I already knew that the library held old copies of newspapers from previous research but I was unaware of the sheer volume of information available, and the fact that the library holds documents dating back to the early s.The open day allowed members of the public to come in, ask questions, get to know the department and find out how to use the resources to discover their family history and also the story of Ballymena‘ was like years ago’s growth as a town.The Heritage Collection will mean dferent things to dferent people. Some will have a purpose for their search, such as finding a long lost relative or tracing a map of their home area from years gone by. Others will simply visit and get lost in the vast records, pictures and resources on offer.As a bit of a history buff, I was transported back to my university and school days as Daniel Brown, the senior library assistant for the Heritage Department spoke of some of the hidden treasures within the library.He said past records of the old workhouse are available, giving an extraordinary insight into who was actually in the dreaded facility down through the years, and also into the meetings held by some of the officers.We have artefacts dating back hundreds of years. Some are very valuable to us today, such as a complete map of the original Adair estate from  as much can be learned from this. We also have lots of interesting memorabilia including war rationing books and images of the Queens visit to Ballymena after her coronation.Daniel, who has a personal interest in history, really enjoys showing people around the department, whether they be locals or from further afield.He told me: Weve had many tourists come in, especially Americans who are keen to learn more about their ancestry and research old family names. Its interesting looking back and helping people discover where they come from!You can also trace old church history through births, deaths and marriages, communion and membership rolls and even church offerings.It was down this path that I met Mary Carson and Anne McCaughey as they browsed through the pew rental records of Buckna Presbyterian Church dating back to .Both ladies are members of the Broughshane History Society and were looking through the old records searching for ious recognisable names, however their inidual interest in local and family history was not hard to see.Mary spoke about tracing her family tree and how her curiosity was fuelled by seeing two old pictures of her grandparents at her aunt’s house.She followed rthe trail to a local heritage collection where she was able to find out through old newspapers that her grandfather’s death had made front page news many years before.Her search also revealed that a family member she always believed to be her uncle actually turned out to be her cousin!Researching and delving into the past is so interesting in my opinion, and can also be rewarding, Mary told me. I have found out that Im related to, so many people I didnt know about.Anne agreed, and was full of praise for the resources available in the library. She recalled happy times of listening to older family members talk about the past but said it is often not like that today.Today the younger generation dont seem to be as interested. They are busy working on phones or listening to their earphones that they dont seem to care whats going on around them or what has went before, so they are going to have to depend on information and places like this library to trace their past.As I left them to their church history search, my eyes were drawn to the vast arrays of cases containing maps along a wall.Here there are ordnance survey maps from the s right up to the s. There are also Grfith valuation maps for Co. Antrim and Co. Londonderry as well as th century town plans and local government maps - it really is a local history lovers dream!There are far too many resources to list, but some that need a mention include the vast photograph collection from around Co. Antrim as well as multiple information packs on local schools, people and places all arranged by location and subject.Two of the special collections housed in Ballymena library is the Langford Lodge Collection and the  census for parishes in Co. Antrim.The Collection Officer for the library is Maria Diamond, who is always on hand to direct the public to what they are looking for.She was keen to point out the many online resources made available by the library, so as your search doesnt have to end when you go home!Family history and researching your ancestry has really taken off in the last few years, Maria told me.Therefore we have listed many online resources that can help people trace their history in their own time, or when the library may be closed.Maria enjoys her job, and said she has noticed an increase in the number of people using the department.We are generally a busy department, and we try to always be on hand to help guide people to their desired field of study.“We also enjoy welcoming groups and school classes to the Heritage Collection and tailor the activities to their age or field of study. We have lots of resources for children, and a wealth of information on the local area and how it was affected during major events in history, such as the two world wars or the famine. Teachers or groups just need to get in touch to arrange a visit.I was thoroughly impressed by my visit to the local studies department.Yes, I knew alot of information was available, however I was overwhelmed by the sheer volume of resources, how far back it dated and the way in which it was displayed.No matter what period you are interested in, or what local area there is sure to be some information that will aid your study.My visit to the Cultural heritage open day may have been for business, but my next visit to discover Ballymena of old will more than likely be for pleasure!

He attended St Mary’s Primary School in Portglenone and St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena.Speaking about his early involvement in music, he said: My parents didn’t play but they sent all of us to music and dancing for years and drove us to lessons and events every night of the week, I owe them a lot for that. They had a keen interest and were very supportive.I was sent to the local Comhaltas Ceoltoacuteiriacute Eacuteireannbranch in Portglenone when I was around .I started tin whistle classes with the late John Kennedy first, then progressed onto the button accordion with Tommy Doherty.My parents then started taking us to The Crosskey’s Inn every week for sessions and I also joined the Comahltas branch there too.That place had a huge effect on me, there were great musicians there of all ages and they really helped cultivate my interest growing up. I still go there when I can.As part of the Crosskeys Comhaltas we won many All-Irelands. We had a great gang at the time along with dedicated parents that were also passionate about the music.Going to the Fleadhs was as much about socialising with other kids in music as it was competing. We got up to all sorts of ilment that I won’t get into here!I started on the tin whistle, moved to button accordion then started to teach myself guitar when I was . I quickly became obsessed with the guitar.Its such a versatile instrument and one that you can literally play or learn any style of music on.From playing the guitar I was able to give a few other stringed instruments a go - bouzouki, tenor guitar, bass, electric guitar.Its not a big stretch to adapt the same skills on guitar over to other instruments, and its nice to have dferent colours available, especially when writing.Sometimes I write on the piano - because I’m not great at playing piano, you’re forced to think dferently and that can work in your favour.In terms of my influences, for the accordion it would be Mairtin OConnor or Dermot Byrne. For the guitar, its harder to narrow it down, but three that stand out are Arty Mc Glynn, Steve Cooney and John Doyle. My own style is probably some hybrid mix of those three.I have worked with Grammy nominated fiddler Liz Carroll, folk singer Karan Casey, Duke Special, Liam O’Maonlaiand Bela Fleck.I am involved with ‘Ulaid’ with John Mc Sherry and Donal O’Connor, and Scottish group ‘Fiddlers Bid’. As a guitar player I regularly work with a lot of other traditional bands including Lunasa, Flook, Buille, and the Mairtin O’Connor Band.BEOGABeoga was formed while Seaacuten was a pupil at St Louis Grammar School.He continued: At St Louis, I was involved with the Traditional Group the whole time I was there.Frank Cassidy directed it and was always very encouraging. We competed in ‘Slogadh’ competitionsand had great craic travelling around to the dferent competitions.Beoga was formed around this time and the teachers were very understanding about me missing days here and there to play gigs.I used to go to the States for these long weekends and be catching up on school work on the plane home.Whilst at St Louis I never actually studied music as an option. I didn’t have a classical background and for some reason never thought it would be a viable career option!Whilst studying for my A levels, I started to become really obsessed with music and decided that was it - I couldn’t even think about doing anything .Up until that point I was looking at careers in IT. I heard about a new course in University of Limerick offering a degree in Irish music, that didn’t require A level music, you just had to go for an interview and perform.I got in anyway and I met Niamh there. We were in the same class and became big pals and she ended up joining the band.She’s an amazing fiddle player and singer and I’m lucky to have found her!ED SHEERANBeoga have been together for around  years and they have been afforded the opportunity to travel the world doing what they love.Seaacuten said: We’ve toured a lot around Europe and North America but have also been lucky to tour in more exotic places like Japan, Australia and Russia. We’re travelling a bit less now, thankfully, but at one stage I was definitely seeing more of the band than my own family.One of the biggest audiences the band have performed to was a , strong crowd at the Glastonbury festival in  alongside Ed Sheeran.Sheeran, whose grandparents hail from the Emerald Isle, is well-known for his love of Irish traditional and folk music, even recording a version of The Parting Glass.He has said that one of his earliest musical memories is listening to the Irish Heartbeat album by Van Morrison and The Chieftains and he is also a fan of The Bothy Band and Planxty. Close friend of the band, Foy Vance, shares the same record label as Sheeran and had been supporting him on tour. They had listened to a few of Beogas tunes on the road, and Ed reached out to the band to help with his album.Seaacuten explained: We went to over to his house in Suffolk for a couple of days. It was all very relaxed, he made everyone feel completely at ease.The weather was amazing so we were outside in the garden a lot. We played on four tracks and two made it to the album so we’re delighted.One of them, ‘Galway Girl’, came about just jamming in the garden outside the studio. He was completely sound, we stayed in his house and had a few beers and even played a game of football at one stage.Working with Ed has presented a lot of new opportunities to play and write with other artists.Our friend Foy Vance was the guy responsible for introducing us to Ed. We’ve written a good few songs with Foy now and will hopefully keep creating more with him, he’s an amazing singer and an even more amazing songwriter and is finally being recognised as such.We’ve also worked with Johnny McDaid on the songwriting and production side of things, although he’s been crazy busy since Snow Patrol started touring again.Just recently we’ve been writing a bit with Cormac Neeson from ‘The Answer’. The collaborations are really exciting to me, you just don’t know whats going to come out of a writing session but that buzz of finishing the day with a song is a real high.Seaacuten believes there is a great local traditional music scene stating: I think traditional music is stronger than ever.He encourages all age groups to get involved and give it a try, commenting: If I had any advice, it would be to not to get too worked up about competitions and instead focus more on the social side of the music.While competitions can be good to focus on something, it can put a lot of unnecessary pressure on kids.In his rare free time, Seaacuten has a purpose built recording studio in Portglenone called Bannview Studios.He has been recording for about  years and recently moved into his current space about five years ago.He said:I regularly engineer and produce other artists here, so that keeps me busy outside of the bands schedule.Beoga will be releasing a new album in the Spring. It will include singles released over the last few months along with some new songs and instrumentals that the group have been working on over the last year.Beogas latest release is called ‘Make a Mark’ and features Co. Down singer Ryan Mc Mullan.

I’ve written about music and been to a lot of concerts over the years. The list below is typical of the tracks that stand out in my memory. I haven’t mentioned the Small Faces or Bruce Springsteen, SLF or other old favourites. I like to hear a lot of contemporary music too. Starchild and the New Romantic for example - a NY soulster I came across last week. Locally, Brand New Friend from Castlerock, are an outstanding punk pop sound. Anyway, here goes…!. Town Called Malice - The Jam. Laser eyed social poetry from Weller, tight Tamla baseline from Foxton and finger clicking rhythm from Buckler. Classic mod. . The Highest Apple - Runrig. Spiritual Scots Gaelic song. Our wedding dance, along with Van the Man of course,  years ago. . This Beautul Day - Levi Jackson. I used to be a Northern Soul DJ and had quite a collection of original vinyl singles. I love the genre still. This track has it all: dance, clear gospel uplt, a black civil rights cry for hope. It’s worth hundreds. I once tried to buy it on eBay behind my we’s back. Thankfully the bid didn’t make it. Confession is good for the soul. . Kennedy - The Wedding Present. Indie student guitar based noise. Great band live from the late s. Still going. Much the same as Copper Blue by Sugar - another favorite indie band.. Live Forever - Oasis. Slightly later and closer to the football culture of which I was a part in my youth. I interviewed them twice for music fanzines before they were famous. Influenced greatly by the Stone Roses - another favourite band. . At Least That’s What You Said - Wilco. Existential American alternative musings. Another great band live. Profound sentiments from Jeff Tweedy.. So Danco Samba - Stan Getz. Much into jazz as I’ve aged. I love Mile Davis up to the late s. This track is gentle samba. Relaxing.. Prelude to Cello Solo No.  in G Major- Pierre Fournier. One of the most moving pieces of music I’ve ever heard. I feel unworthy when I hear it. It touches the eternal. . In the Hours - Emily Deloach, Incredible Grace. I listen to Christian praise a lot, it comes with the calling. This track oozes gratitude for the Gospel. Always make me thankful. I love City Alight songs and a Presbyterian praise group called Red Mountain.. Dig a Little Deeper - The Watson Twins. Smoky, sultry, southern Americana. Played this song driving through mid State Tennessee last year. Right song in the right place. Something like Lucinda Williams or Gillian Welch.

The expectations in Holy Child are as high as anywhere  in Belfast and that has continued on.”Martin said that there were many moments throughout his career at Holy Child that stand out.“Our standards in literacy and numeracy, I’m very, very proud of those. We received an exceptionally good inspection report in  where there were no areas for improvement.“I took great pride in the whole business of ‘opening up the school’, so that the children could come in earlier for breakfast club, afterschools clubs. I’ve enjoyed working with our parents and the links our school has with the local post primaries in the area.“I think I’ve improved the fabric of the building. I fought to get the new windows installed and the final jigsaw of that project will be completed next month with the new windows in the foyer. We had a new roof, new heating system.“We won the big Gaelic Raffo Cup last year which was a great achievement, our shows, our choir, I’ve always been very proud of the strong links with St Agnes’ parish.”Martin spoke of the challenges he faced as school head.“The big challenge was finance. Budgetary constraints. Also the complexities of the special educational needs that children now encounter and the school having to meet those needs, was a massive challenge – all the while not getting enough funding. The big challenge of mental health within children and the influence of social media. We were three years without an Executive, with no direction from the department and that was a challenge for the school.”While not sailing around the world or taking up golf as part of his retirement plans, Martin explained that he will still be assisting and helping other schools through advisory work with CCMS.“I’ll be onhand to tell people to basically not make the same mistakes I’ve made, we all make mistakes what about trying this, try that and don’t be worrying about that too much.“I have a photo in my office from when I was here as a child, it has always reminded me to keep my feet on the ground and that the children are the most important thing.”When it comes to not pulling into the Holy Child car park next week, Martin said it will be a time of “mixed emotions”.“I will be very sad to leave the children, to leave the staff, the staff have been brilliant, the parents have been brilliant and I will miss that. I’ve done two ‘cycles of seven’,  years but I will be in and out of the school. I’m emotionally attached to this building, I’ve been here since I was four and I’m  now. I’ve loved every minute of it.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"queens uni supporting the spar craic","story":"QUEEN’S University are the latest institution to show their support to the annual SPAR Craic K taking place on St Patrick’s Day throughout the city.Starting at the gates of City Hall, the route will take in the Gaeltacht Quarter as well as the prestigious university, Botanic Avenue and Gardens before the finish line at Ormeau Park.

Bosses offered the workers a .% pay increase, which is barely enough to keep pace with the current rate of inflation as measured by the retail price index, the true measure of inflation experienced by workers.In reality, this pay offer represents a real-terms pay stagnation for workers who continue to produce a signicant profit for this company.Mr McKeever said the situation was untenable for workers and said the current pay offer from Allied Bakeries was an insult.We call on management at Allied Bakeries to make a pay offer that meets the workers# legitimate pay expectations. It is in their power to avoid an unnecessary and potentially hugely disruptive strike action, he added.A spokesperson for Allied Bakeries said: We are proud of our reputation as a long-term and stable employer in the community and are therefore disappointed that some of our employees have voted for industrial action over pay. All those involved within this ballot are paid at rates above the Living Wage Foundation#s recommended UK hourly rate and provided with a range of in-work benefits including le insurance and pension provision that, for some long-serving colleagues, is based upon their final salary. As in previous years, we have committed to increasing our annual rate of pay this year and our hope remains that we can resolve this situation without disruptive industrial action. Allied Bakeries is a subsidiary of Associated British Foods plc, which Unite the Union says has a turnover of £.bn and employs nearly , workers in  countries.The company produces Sunblest, Kingsmill, Burgen and Allison breads and pancakes for the UK market.Belfast ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadRoad closures and flooding as Storm Ciara continues to batter Northern IrelandAs Sinn Fein becomes most popular party in Ireland, Fianna Fail refuses to rule out coalitionPresbyterian minister Peter Lyle opens up on battle with depression and how adoption of two little girls has turned le aroundConor Murphy among mourners at funeral of Francie Brolly in DungivenSinn Fein#s Mary Lou McDonald hopes to lead Irish government without Fine Gael and Fianna Fail,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleTravelSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The latest plan suggests that this trench could be spanned by a bridge, which would then link to an underwater tunnel for the remainder of the distance to Larne.Costs are thought to be in the region of £bn for a combined road and rail link, the first to span the Irish Sea.The project has long been supported by the DUP.Last night party transport spokesman Paul Girvan MP said connectivity between the parts of the UK was vital. We must invest in local roads, but we must also build infrastructure for the next generation, he said.We first asked for a feasibility study into this project in . Let#s get the facts to seeit is feasible and what impact it would have on the economy. Whether it#s tunnel or bridge and what route it would take.I will continue to raise this in Westminster. Connectivity between the UK is key, and this could be a vital connection for the future.Critics of the idea have said it is to dficult and too expensive, and that the money would be better spent on other things.But Boris Johnson is known to be in favour of major infrastructure projects that he sees as helping unite the UK in the post-Brexit era, among them the HS rail project.Proposals for a physical link between Scotland and the north of Ireland date back to the th century.

However, negotiations are ongoing with the NI government to secure an additional poundm to match the total UK Governmentpackage of poundm towards a Derry City and Strabane Region Deal. With match funding and investment from private partners it was envisaged that the overall package would be in the region of poundm-poundm. By way of comparison, the Belfast Region City Deal will see the UKG invest poundm into the Belfast Region over the next  years. It is proposed that this figure will be matched by the NI Executive. googletag.cmd.push Bolstered by co-investment of upwards of poundm from Belfast Region City Deal partners and investment by the private sector is anticipated to bring the total Belfast investment package to over poundbn. Last May it was announced that Derry and Strabane will receive poundm in major new investment from the UKG. But match funding is necessary to fulfil ambitions laid out by the council in terms of Strabane town centre regeneration, as well as “key tourism, economic, and social projects and initiatives.” The current package, pound million for the City Deal and poundm for the new Inclusive Future Fund, aims to boost the economic potential of the city and support a more prosperous and united community. googletag.cmd.push The Derry City and Strabane City Deal investment will help strengthen innovation and the digital potential of the city region and unlock local partner funding. It will be bolstered by a poundm Inclusive Future Fund aimed at bringing greater prosperity and social benefits to the whole of the community. Ulster University will be granted poundm of the pound already committed. Official council documents suggest it may be given additional fundsit’s included as part of the poundm set aside for Queen’s Quay Riverfront projects. UU’s poundm will be invested in centres of innovation and excellence in data analyticsand robotics and automation , the Graduate Entry Medical Schooland Personalised Medicine Centre of Excellence . The Derry News asked Derry City  Strabane District Council whether it still has confidence in UU to deliver its projects given recent revelations about its huge overspend on the Belfast campus and a request for a poundm bailout from Stormont. That is coupled with the fact that a new business case has to be drafted for Magee expansion and a senior official at the Department for the Economy stated that new money would have to be found, adding “it’s hard to see that happening”. In response, a spokesperson for the council said it is working closely with UU to expand Magee but “continues to explore all avenues” to develop third level education provision in the city. Signicant progress has already been made, she said, and all project proposals have been submitted to government at this stage. As a result of this “positive work” council is hopeful that Heads of Terms can be signed in the coming weeks and continues to work with government and key partners in this regard. Much has already been achieved in terms of the scaling and prioritisation of projects, the proposed governance structures and the processes and timelines involved since the initial City Deal funding announcement, she explained. ‘Confident’ The spokesperson continued: “In terms of securing the required Northern Ireland government ‘match funding’ of poundm to the UKG poundm City Deal funding, it is assumed this will be finally confirmed at ‘Heads of Terms’ stage. “Discussions in relation to Northern Ireland Government ‘match funding’ to the UK Government poundm Future Fund element of the funding package are ongoing and we welcome the commitment set out in the New Decade New Approach report that ‘the Executive will make it a priority to realise the economic potential offered by City Deals for the Belfast Region and Derry Londonderry, including through ​match capital funding for infrastructure, regeneration and tourism projects’.” She added: “Since the restoration of devolved government at Stormont local political representatives have also been proactive at Executive level in amplying the campaign for university expansion here. “The delivery of the Graduate Entry Medical School for Magee has been highlighted as a key commitment amongst a raft of priority projects set out within the New Deal and Council is confident that this firm commitment to investing in the economic regeneration of the NW will be honoured by both the UK and Irish governments. “In terms of the delivery of the project, Council continues to explore all avenues with regards to successfully growing and developing third level education provision here in the city. “Ulster University is working closely with Council and its partners to realise the plans for the further expansion of the Magee campus, including the GEMS. “Council looks forward to welcoming the incoming Vice Chancellor once in post to hear more about those plans and to continue that work.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Creator, Tony McCourt, , said a similar Facebook page exists for the Brandywell area so he felt it was only right to set one up for Creggan.  Within a day it had , members and less than a week later it has amassed over ,. Built in the s, Creggan is one of Derry’s best-known estates. It has been home to an abundance of artistic and sporting talent, including Olympic athletes, a Eurovision winner, a Top Ten rock band and international footballers. googletag.cmd.push In the late s and early s, Creggan became a byword for political resistance all over the world. On the Memories of Creggan Facebook page, people have been sharing cherished photos of relatives, historically signicant portraits of the Troubles, images of friends playing on the street, tales of famed characters from the estate, all sorts of myths and legends true and untrue, and everything in between. Former Creggan residents who have emigrated all over the world, including those from America and Australia, have joined the page to reminisce and share old tales from their childhood. “Everybody is enjoying it,” Tony explained, “they’re all sharing old memories.” googletag.cmd.push Friends contacted Tony to tell him that they can’t get their mothers off the page, one of the ladies is -years-old and is “loving all the old photos so much”. He added: “They’ve said they’re getting no housework done and no wains are being watched because they’re all too busy on the page. People are talking about their schooldays and friends who haven’t been in touch for many years are reconnecting.”  Memories Tony spent most of his childhood in Creggan and lived there until he got married at the age of . His brother, Peggy, still lives in Creggan and Tony has happy memories of “great neighbours and friends”. “The page brings back good memories. Nobody had anything but everybody shared what they had with each other.” The Troubles were never far from peoples’ minds, and people had their own troubles, but Tony prefers to recall the joyful times. “There was a lot of heartbreak at that time. But I like to remember all the positive experiences I had growing up. Playing football in the street all day when there were barely any cars around. “I remember the first TV on the street, it was the Kennedy’s and we used to go in to watch the FA Cup final. I also remember watching Popeye and the Lone Ranger. “I had a bad leg at one time and I remember a friend of mines carrying me to Grianan Fort and back again.” Moving forward, Tony would simply like to see people use the page in a positive way. “There are no real rules, we’re just asking people to keep it clean and to refrain from any insults. “Everyone is finding it funny going through all the old photos and that’s what it’s all about.” With that said Tony was off to the attic to unearth a few more boxes of photographic treasures from his boyhood.  ‘Heroes’ Peggy McCourt has lived in Creggan Heights for sixty-two years, asked what the estate means to him, he proclaimed: “Creggan means community.” He explained: “It was tight-knit no one had very much but what they had they shared be it a cup of milk to a drop of sugar, or can you lend me ma three slices of bread. “We all grew up in the Creggan, most of the families came from the Springtown Camp so hardship was a way of le but they made sure their wains were fed and watered, even going without themselves. “Then came the civil rights movement, then a full-blown war on the streets but again the Creggan community rallied around those who were affected by the conflict. “So many young people were first interned just because they were Catholic, many were arrested, put though interrogation centres and ended up in prison.” Peggy continued: “The hunger strikes took their toll on many families but no matter what went on Creggan grew into the best estate in Derry – in the world. “Growing up was hard at the time we lost so many friends and family members but it was a fun place to grow up, friendships formed that still last to this day. The friends I had sixty odd years ago are as strong as when we first met.  “No video games, all street games, football, rounders, even cricket, hopscotch, all these plus many more sitting out till  or  telling ghost stories, then you ran home the living day lights scared out of you. “Creggan is more than a council estate, its a way of le, its in your blood, we don’t even have to look anywhere for heroes, Creggan is full of them they are called ma’s and da’s.”   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Born and raised in Derry until the age of , I always had a calling for adventure and opportunity, and it was at this stage in my le I took a huge leap of faith and went in chase of the American Dream. A little Irish girl lost in the big city of New York awaiting my immigration papers is where I learned so many le lessons and character building. At the age of  I stumbled upon a movie The Secret which would eventually change my le and my direction. googletag.cmd.push This movie for me was a beginning, an awakeningyou will. I had opened my eyes to a whole new world of self-belief, ambitions and possibilities. At the age of  I opened my first business which was a Health Care Call Centre. Alongside this I worked for a healthcare administration business which was family run and set up by my mother in New York. Whilst I found great business acumen and skillset in my work, it took its toll on me. The corporate pace and stress fuelled environment was not my fit so I sold my shares in the family business and sold my own business. googletag.cmd.push This was an important and pivotal moment for me in my le where I would embark on a journey of self-discovery and promise. From the beginning of le as I know it until now, I have never known fulfilment like being a mom. Being we to my husband, Dr Frank Dos Santos, and mother to our gorgeous and amazing children and brought me happiness like no other and for this I am eternally blessed and grateful. The le we share together is precious and I value this every day. There came a point for me personally, where I had reached that feeling of fulfilment and happiness and these feelings are what I embrace and evoke everyday in le. Drawing on my previous experiences and knowledge of The Secret as well as the process of le which had led me to this point, spurred me on to find my true passion in le. Helping others. I thought, whatI can pass on these feelings that I’m feeling  WhatI can help others to feel joy, hope and happiness whatever their environment or circumstance  So, in , alongside my business partner Chiara I set up a company Joy In The Workplace whose sole aim was to bring and implement productivity and joy into the workplace. This was my fit. The gratication and sense of fulfilment in helping others became a part of me. I knew I could do this, loved doing it and I did not want to stop here. I knew that feeling of being in a corporate environment and feeling stressed, overworked and unfulfilled and being able to approach and work with iniduals and groups who were in the same position and offer them a road to productivity and happiness in their role was le changing. I wanted to do more. In the Secret Bob Proctor was the clear definitive practitioner for me. I got in touch with the Proctor Gallagher Institute and trained in becoming a PGI Consultant The programmes set by Bob Proctor and Sandy Gallagher are some of the most effective and efficient I have ever seen and I was thrilled to become a part of it and be able to offer coaching to clients in both the U.S and Ireland. I recently was promoted within this company to Senior Coach and Account Executive which now enables me to offer some of the most elite personal development programmes PGI has to offer. Working alongside these esteemed colleagues has been a huge ambition of mine and I have learned so many invaluable skills and ideologies that I cannot wait to share with more and more clients whether personal or in a group setting. As my journey to date describes, I have achieved some great things and I am still achieving and believing every day. But there has been for quite some time, a feeling of wanting to offer something back home. I often would hear stories in the news, and reports from my hometown Derry in Ireland of the suicide epidemic which has been playing on my mind for quite some time. It is with such sadness and despair that I have felt the strong urge to help in some way. Derry is such a beautul town steeped in wonderful facts of history and monument but there is a huge cry for help and I simply cannot and will not ignore this. In understanding these facts, I have purchased a building in the city and will be hosting mindset workshops for both adults and children in the near future. It is never too early to implement positivity and to teach the importance of le and its value. In addition to this my foundation for suicide prevention is well underway as I have been working constructively with a team of like minded professionals from the city in order to structure and further develop and implement this project which I know in my heart will instil a new light of positivity and hope for those going through tough times and needing some guidance. My connection to Derry has been growing as of lately and I have found myself travelling back and forward trying to help in ious ways. Myself alongside Catrina Crillyhave set up “Bee Me LTD” which is the first children’s personal development company of its kind. We will be launching a child friendly app and host Bee Me Camps which will have a fun and friendly environment where children will learn about self-image, empowerment, positivity and how thoughts create things. We’re excited about this project and cannot wait to see it develop. My journey has come with its teachings, its blessings and its le changing moments and I for one would not change any of it. I am at this point in my le where I am seeing my dreams come to reality. I am helping others to see THEIR dreams and make them a reality. My work is not work for me anymore, it is my passion and I feel incredibly lucky to wake up everyday to the le I have and to be able to share my teachings that will help my clients achieve the le they too want. It is my pleasure and my honour. The world is ours and we can think it into whatever we want it to be. And together, we are making it happen.

Born and raised in Derry until the age of , I always had a calling for adventure and opportunity, and it was at this stage in my le I took a huge leap of faith and went in chase of the American Dream. A little Irish girl lost in the big city of New York awaiting my immigration papers is where I learned so many le lessons and character building. At the age of  I stumbled upon a movie The Secret which would eventually change my le and my direction. googletag.cmd.push This movie for me was a beginning, an awakeningyou will. I had opened my eyes to a whole new world of self-belief, ambitions and possibilities. At the age of  I opened my first business which was a Health Care Call Centre. Alongside this I worked for a healthcare administration business which was family run and set up by my mother in New York. Whilst I found great business acumen and skillset in my work, it took its toll on me. The corporate pace and stress fuelled environment was not my fit so I sold my shares in the family business and sold my own business. googletag.cmd.push This was an important and pivotal moment for me in my le where I would embark on a journey of self-discovery and promise. From the beginning of le as I know it until now, I have never known fulfilment like being a mom. Being we to my husband, Dr Frank Dos Santos, and mother to our gorgeous and amazing children and brought me happiness like no other and for this I am eternally blessed and grateful. The le we share together is precious and I value this every day. There came a point for me personally, where I had reached that feeling of fulfilment and happiness and these feelings are what I embrace and evoke everyday in le. Drawing on my previous experiences and knowledge of The Secret as well as the process of le which had led me to this point, spurred me on to find my true passion in le. Helping others. I thought, whatI can pass on these feelings that I’m feeling  WhatI can help others to feel joy, hope and happiness whatever their environment or circumstance  So, in , alongside my business partner Chiara I set up a company Joy In The Workplace whose sole aim was to bring and implement productivity and joy into the workplace. This was my fit. The gratication and sense of fulfilment in helping others became a part of me. I knew I could do this, loved doing it and I did not want to stop here. I knew that feeling of being in a corporate environment and feeling stressed, overworked and unfulfilled and being able to approach and work with iniduals and groups who were in the same position and offer them a road to productivity and happiness in their role was le changing. I wanted to do more. In the Secret Bob Proctor was the clear definitive practitioner for me. I got in touch with the Proctor Gallagher Institute and trained in becoming a PGI Consultant The programmes set by Bob Proctor and Sandy Gallagher are some of the most effective and efficient I have ever seen and I was thrilled to become a part of it and be able to offer coaching to clients in both the U.S and Ireland. I recently was promoted within this company to Senior Coach and Account Executive which now enables me to offer some of the most elite personal development programmes PGI has to offer. Working alongside these esteemed colleagues has been a huge ambition of mine and I have learned so many invaluable skills and ideologies that I cannot wait to share with more and more clients whether personal or in a group setting. As my journey to date describes, I have achieved some great things and I am still achieving and believing every day. But there has been for quite some time, a feeling of wanting to offer something back home. I often would hear stories in the news, and reports from my hometown Derry in Ireland of the suicide epidemic which has been playing on my mind for quite some time. It is with such sadness and despair that I have felt the strong urge to help in some way. Derry is such a beautul town steeped in wonderful facts of history and monument but there is a huge cry for help and I simply cannot and will not ignore this. In understanding these facts, I have purchased a building in the city and will be hosting mindset workshops for both adults and children in the near future. It is never too early to implement positivity and to teach the importance of le and its value. In addition to this my foundation for suicide prevention is well underway as I have been working constructively with a team of like minded professionals from the city in order to structure and further develop and implement this project which I know in my heart will instil a new light of positivity and hope for those going through tough times and needing some guidance. My connection to Derry has been growing as of lately and I have found myself travelling back and forward trying to help in ious ways. Myself alongside Catrina Crillyhave set up “Bee Me LTD” which is the first children’s personal development company of its kind. We will be launching a child friendly app and host Bee Me Camps which will have a fun and friendly environment where children will learn about self-image, empowerment, positivity and how thoughts create things. We’re excited about this project and cannot wait to see it develop. My journey has come with its teachings, its blessings and its le changing moments and I for one would not change any of it. I am at this point in my le where I am seeing my dreams come to reality. I am helping others to see THEIR dreams and make them a reality. My work is not work for me anymore, it is my passion and I feel incredibly lucky to wake up everyday to the le I have and to be able to share my teachings that will help my clients achieve the le they too want. It is my pleasure and my honour. The world is ours and we can think it into whatever we want it to be. And together, we are making it happen.

This year there’s an incredible line up for you to celebrate International Womens Day. On the bill there’s The Henry Girls, Blackbird and Crow, Reevah, Blood, Great White Lies and Tara Gi with comperes for the evening, Madonna Kebab and Thran Leeann. The night will end with some tunes from The Stray Kitten.Tara Gi is a singer songwriter from Donegal who honed her craft in New York playing with a range of musicians, including Damien Dempsey, fronting her own bands and perfecting her song writing skills. Since ing to Ireland, Tara has been living and working in Donegal and can be heard playing in Falcarragh. Mixing the indie rock sound with folk and traditional Irish music, she has created something truly unique, dealing with issues such as inequality between class structures and between the genders as well as more controversial subjects such as child abuse and sometimes the lighter side of le. Trust me, it isn’t all doom and gloom, her melodic grooves and punchy rhythm back up her ethereal voice. You can find her on iTunes and YouTube or buy one of her CDs when you see her Aoe Boyle describes Reevah’s ethereal singer-songwriter sound as Dreamy Folk. She’s gigged all over the country and played alongside acts such as Lisa Canny, Wyvern Lingo and Duke Special. googletag.cmd.push It takes something special to juggle a job and music motherhood must be the harder… “It’s definitely all about finding the right balance, I had Rosa when I was at university, so I became quite used to iding my time between work and home le. It’s similar to being a musician, I find that music is a release for me, it’s almost just part of my daily le andI didn’t have it, it would be very strange - it’s who I am now, a form of expression. “Having Rosa and Noah has definitely altered my le and me as a person, being a mother has been of huge influence on my music and the way that I approach writing.” googletag.cmd.push You took off quite quick, is that more daunting than being around for years  “Did I  Ha-ha... Maybe from other people’s perspective it might seem that way, but I feel like I’m only getting started. I suppose I’ve just been busy. My first gig as Reevah was exactly two years ago, it was the beginning of me taking music a bit more serious than I had before. In those two years I have played as much as possible and recorded in three dferent studios along with some brilliant producers and musicians throughout the North, I was also a part of the Scratch My Progress Programme run by the Oh Yeah Centre in Belfast which was an amazing learning opportunity. “I like to think I’ve been quite proactive so far, but it’s only the beginning of music for me.”Keep up with her on facebook reevahmusic and twitter reevahofficial and instagram reevahofficial.I’ve spoken to Great White Lies before, they’re a band that mixes a bit of everything and sounds like no one . They’re another example of sticking to your guns and going it alone. Siobhan Shiels once told me: “Great White Lies would be lucky to make more than € for a gig, thats five people rehearsing, travelling and spending up six hours in and around the venue. “That culminates in approximately € each after travel costs for six hours and work. Why is this so  Its not sustainable. Whereas a wedding band would get paid approx. € each for the same hours. Without people creating thered be no music for the cover bands to play yet we dont appreciate it.” That’s music now.Youve been an active participant in movements here… “Seeing the abortion rights campaigns pass in Northern Ireland and in the Republic has been amazing. Its demonstrated to me what people power can achieve. The movement to accept asylum seekers in Ireland has been a focus for me especially since Carndonagh has welcomed five new Syrian families. “Im eager to set up welcoming measures in my community with Inishowens first Middle Eastern Festival which we hosted in Moville mid last year with Global Kitchen which brought people form Direct provision currently living in Sligo to share their food with us and we fed approximately  people.”Is it more dficult for women to get taken seriously in the independent scene  “Ive always found it dficult to get noticed, could it be because Im woman with pesky female opinions that the male-dominated music hierarchy deem less than intriguing  Or could it be that my music is jazz-inspired genre-bending music without guitars “The tides are changing. Id like to give up on vying for attention in an oversaturated market where the only folk people want to elevate is more of the same old schitck where theres a ready audience generating money for the industry. “Im making music I like and sharing it with people with whom it resonates. “Luckily, theres a few stations and DJs around the country who appreciate what I do and Ive a sound bunch of folks who make great efforts to attend my gigs. Im making music for myself, them and anyone  who finds me along the way.” You can find them on Facebook, iTunes and greatwhiteliesmusic  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The bypass is the single biggest road scheme ever proposed for the district.Roads officials have previously insisted that the planned scheme will greatly benefit both strategic and local road users by reducing journey times and improving road safety. In addition, officials are confident that the schemersquos economic assessment demonstrates that the bypass would provide a good economic .Designed to alleviate chronic town centre congestion in Ballynahinch and along the main approach roads to the town, major new roundabouts are proposed at the Belfast Road junction with the Saintfield Road and at the Newcastle Road junction with the Downpatrick Road.Overtaking lanes stretching almost  metres are proposed at either end of the bypass where major new roundabouts are to be constructed, with the scheme also including a shared footpath and cycle lane.Cllr Walker argued that the Newry, Mourne and Down area has missed out on signicant roads funding for decades, with many major schemes constructed in other parts of the Province.ldquoI believe the time has come for this council to demand its fair share of infrastructure funding, he declared. ldquoI have been a councillor for over  years and the bypass issue has been raised during every one of them.ldquoThe government department has now moved to a position with all its ducks in this particular scheme now in a row. The public enquiry has been completed and the only thing delaying the scheme is funding.Cllr Walker said he believed that with the Assembly restored and a local minister at the helm of the Department for Infrastructure, the council needs to seek an urgent meeting with Ms Mallon to seek the immediate release of bypass funding to not only alleviate town centre congestion in Ballynahinch, but provide a major boost for the wider South Down area, in particular, tourism.Slieve Croob councillor, Cathy Mason, described the market town as the ldquogateway to the wider South Down area through which all traffic must pass, including HGVs.ldquoThis not only frustrates drivers who are part of the through traffic, but increases tension and danger for those living, shopping and working in the town. The proposed bypass will run round the eastern periphery of the town with a grade-separated junction at the Crossgar Road, she continued.ldquoHousing is also being permitted up to the line of the planned new road and includes the potential for a park and ride site. The bypass has been proposed since the s and for decades local community and political representatives from all parties have demanded this new road.Cllr Mason said the new infrastructure minister must signal the start of work on the multi-million pound road scheme as soon as possible.She said that in , the then Infrastructure Minister Chris Hazzard announced his decision to proceed with the bypass proposal and instructed officials to continue to prioritise this scheme until completion unless instructed otherwise by a new minister. Cllr Mason continued: ldquoWith the infrastructure minister now in place following the restoration of Stormont, funding should now be signed off and construction allowed to commence as soon as possible.She said the tender process for construction should begin as soon as possible, suggesting there is no reason why construction cannot commence this time next year, with the scheme complete and open to vehicles by .Rowallane councillor Robert Burgess is also keen to see work on the bypass get underway and hopes that the new infrastructure minister will also formally sign off the scheme to upgrade the final section of the A between Doranrsquos Rock and Rowallane Garden in Saintfield.ldquoThe bypass is critically important to the social and economic regeneration of not only Ballynahinch but the wider South Down area, he said.Cllr Burgess added: ldquoIn addition, the A is the main link between Downpatrick and Belfast and while there have been ious upgrades, the section between Doranrsquos Rock and Rowallane Garden is simply not suitable for the huge volume of traffic which uses this busy road. Itrsquos upgrade is also a priority..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th February 2020 Caroline.jpg","title":"Caroline’s love of Newcastle beach inspires St Patrick Centre exhibition  ","story":"A NEWCASTLE artistrsquos fascination with the townrsquos famous beach has inspired her latest exhibition.Caroline Williamson is showing over  pieces of her work throughout February at the St Patrickrsquos Centre in Downpatrick.Just opened this week, Caroline said that the exhibition is called lsquoShell Sounds from the Shorersquo.She said: ldquoOne of my fondest memories is walking down the Newcastle beach, collecting shells with my grandmother.

The ballot was ided into three sections, UK, Devolved and Local.In South Down, .% of over , young respondents said that protecting the environment was the most important UK issue, with almost % in favour of lowering the voting age to .Other key issues were tackling hate crime , welcoming refugeesand making UN Convention Rights of the Child law .Under devolved issues, .% of young people said mental health was the most important issue when compared to child poverty , ending kne crime , curriculum for leand stopping street harassment .Over , young people responded to this part of the ballot and % of responses were environmental issues mdash ranging from dealing with erosion at Ballyhornan to improving school eco-councils to introducing more recycling points.Overall, the top five biggest inidual local issues were stopping the amalgamation of St Patrickrsquos Grammar with St Maryrsquos and De La Salle High Schools in Downpatrick . Other local issues highlighted included tackling litter , mental health , drug misuseand protecting the local environment . These were followed by building a bridge between Strangford and Portaferry .The results were detailed in a report written by Cormac, who said he was ldquodelighted to have been able to recognise the dedication of young volunteers across South Down in helping their peers have their voices heard.He added: ldquoOrganising Make Your Mark for the past two years has been a challenge each time but one which I enjoy greatly and am privileged to be faced with.

He is an example to all of us of what a campaigner should be doing. ldquoIn many ways Cormac, you are the Greta Thunberg of South Down. You must be able to use that capacity to challenge your peers, government departments and even your teachers to improve the world we all live and recreate in.ldquoYou also need to challenge our communities to awaken and re-engage with ordinary politics in a way in which people have resonated with the problems presented by Brexit.Focusong on the local issues, Baroness Ritchie described these as ldquodominant topics that occupy young people, highlighting the need for investment of resources and the deployment of new and dferent policy directives to accommodate the challenges of the geographical area, given the myriad of problems facing our young people.Regarding the issues raised under the devolved government category, Baroness Ritchie said she wanted a copy of the findings sent to Ministers in the NI Executive and to the chairs of the relevant Assembly Committees ldquoto identy policy and spending priorities for them in the Programme for Government and Budget.Last weekrsquos event was also attended by local councillors Dermot Curran, Patrick Brown, Oonagh Hanlon and Harold McKee.Baroness Ritchie and Cllr Andrews presented the school awards to the teachers who co-ordinated the vote in their respective schools and they included Mrs Mairead Arkins ,Mrs Jackie Bogues , Miss Aine McMullanand Year  pupil Cloacutedagh Bogues who single-handedly co-ordinated the vote in her school, collected Ballynahinch Assumption Grammar Schoolrsquos award.Down High and De La Salle High schools also took part in the consultation, but representatives were unable to attend last weekrsquos event..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th February 2020 Destructive.jpg","title":"Destructive Natasha is too hot for Fermanagh  ","story":"DOWN Ladies made it two wins from two with a hard-fought victory over Ulster neighbours Fermanagh in Teconnaught on Sunday afternoon.Down began well, but struggled to turn lots of possession into scores, with Fermanagh getting plenty of bodies behind the ball, making it dficult for the home side to find space.Downrsquos superb work rate, defensive structure and high rate of turnovers, provided the  for a half time lead of - to -.With four of Fermanaghrsquos scores from frees, plus a missed penalty and disallowed goal by Down, clearly showed the superiority of the Mourne girls in the first half.It was Fermanagh, though, who began the second half the stronger side, keeping the majority of possession and getting back to within a point on the scoreboard.However, Down found another gear in the final quarter to power home as convincing winners on a scoreline of - to -.Many thanks to Teconnaught GAC for their superb hospitality and facilities.Also a very special mention is due to Teconnaughtrsquos Aimee Greene, who made herto county colours after a  month lay-off with a cruciate knee ligament injury.Next up is a trip to Sligo on Sunday.Down scorers: Natasha Ferris , Aoe Laverty , Anna McKee , Mary Adegbamiye , Lauren Cunningham ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th February 2020 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C February 5%2C 1980  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK mdash Plans for a major four-lane carriageway through the heart of Downpatrickrsquos town centre were unveiled this week by anxious Department of Environment officials.The scheme is the result of ten years of research into the townrsquos planning and environmental future mdash a future which has now become totally dependent on a traffic plan solution.The details of the new road proposals were given at a special two-hour press briefing on Friday afternoon and Department of Environmental officials admit they are anxiously awaiting public response.The speculation that the town was to get a lsquoring roadrsquo has been quashed by the proposal mdash in fact, say officials, it was never really on the cards mdash and the new system is simply a means of distributing the traffic inside the town rather than re-routing outside the town limits.Eleven separate routes for a new road were studied and the choice narrowed down to four. The pick of those four has now been decided after years of exploratory talks and detailed investigations. Ironically, the final choice is of a route which dfers only slightly from one suggested by the  Downpatrick Area Plan.The new road will begin, effectively, from the entrance to the Meadowlands housing estate in Church Street and will run behind existing Church Street premises on a widening parallel, into the town centre.It will emerge onto the lower part of Scotch Street, across the rear of the Town Hall building and into Irish Street. Use of the present entrance to the new Irish Street car park will probably be made to swing the road through the rear of Market Street into St Patrickrsquos Avenue and on into the Ballydugan Road.KILLYLEAGH mdash A row is brewing in Killyleagh over proposals to open a pool hall in the townrsquos High Street.Angry residents in the area have drawn up a petition objecting to it being opened because they say that area has already suffered severely at the hands of vandals.Local councillor, Mr Sam Osborne, explained that  objectors had signed the petition because they were concerned that the pool hall would bring with it a sinister element.He said people in the immediate vicinity of the empty premises to be turned into a pool room were afraid to go to bed at the weekends and they fear this could escalate.Mr Osborne stressed he did not object to the idea of the pool room, he hoped it would take young people off the street, but he felt it was being sited in the wrong area of town.BALLYHORNAN mdash Plannersrsquo refusal to allow a new caravan site at Ballyhornan will have a major effect on Down Councilrsquos development programmes for the area, it was claimed this week.The claim was made by Downpatrick councillor, Mr Eddie McGrady, who said planners were wrong to issue such a decision until a general development policy had been worked out.Mr McGrady also said he could not understand why there should not be potential for a new holiday location on the Lecale coast, where a number of such locations already existed.He stressed that in the absence of an Area Plan the council should have a policy on this.A planning spokesman confirmed there would be a policy on locations for caravan development when the area plan was published.BALLYNAHINCH mdash Mrs Margaret Atkins, we of the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr Humphrey Atkins, made a surprise visit to the Plessey Telecommunications factory in Ballynahinch on Tuesday morning.While her husband was at Stormont trying to thrash out the provincersquos problems in the round table talks, Mrs Atkins was having an extensive two-hour tour of the factory, under the guidance of senior Plessey officials.Mrs Atkins arrived shortly after .am and after a y talk with senior management, including Mr Harold Davies, regional director, and Mr Gerry OrsquoNeill, manager at Ballynahinch, she was shown around the factory.She met and spoke to many of the factoryrsquos -plus employees, sharing jokes and listening and enquiring about what kind of work was done.CROSSGAR mdash Sgt Matthew Cuffey, of st Crossgar Boysrsquo Brigade, has won the Northern Ireland Squad Commanderrsquos Shield at the annual squad drill finals in Omagh on Saturday.Matthew and the st Crossgar Company were representing Down Battalion at the finals, and although the squad finished third mdash three points behind hat-trick winners st Castlederg mdash there was some consolation in the squad commanderrsquos success.This very high honour for Down Battalion and indeed, has been won four times previously by Crossgar boys since the competitionrsquos inception in .Down Battalion officers were delighted at the results, and congratulations are extended to the companyrsquos captain, Mr R Dickson, and drill officers, Mr D Nesbitt, and to the boys themselves.DUNDRUM mdash The controversy over whether a section of lane way in Dundrum would remain open is almost over mdash and itrsquos now virtually certain that it will not be closed.Members of the Dundrum and District Community Committee were told of this at their monthly meeting in the Bay Inn on Tuesday night by the secretary, who read letters received from the estate agents and solicitors of the Lord Downshire Estate, who previously owned the lane.The controversy, highlighted by the Recorder last week, had flared up when local residents sensed Mr Albert Donnelly, the owner of the caravan sites on either side of the lane, which runs from Castle Hill to the junction with the Dromara Road, was preparing to close the lane.Pillars had been erected on the lane and residents were adamant gates would not be put up to block their right of way. The lane had been sold by Lord Downshirersquos estate to Mr Donnelly, but there had been some doubt whether a right of way clause had been ed.This has now been cleared up by the letters from Lord Downshirersquos estate agents and solicitors, who pointed out that the lane way had been sold but that the right of way was reserved. The letters added that they hoped this would allay the fears of villagers.The committee, however, have decided to seek legal assistance on the matter to clear it up permanently.ARDGLASS mdash Hopes are high this week that the EEC will grant aid a fish processing unit in Ardglass.Euro MP, Mr John Hume, has taken up the case in Brussels and yesterday he reported that the ECC Commission was ldquocarefully considering grant aiding the locally financed scheme.One of the biggest problems with the fishing industry at Ardglass has been the lack of fish processing facilities, despite the economic benefits from it.Mr Hume told the Recorder yesterday he was ldquofairly confident the EEC would give aid to a fish offal plant at the harbour.He has been in constant touch with local fishermen in the area and yesterday announced another major breakthrough in his battle to secure a better deal for them.In reply to a parliamentary question he tabled in Brussels, Mr Hume has been told a study of fishing industry in Northern Ireland to be undertaken.ldquoI regard this as a welcome first step and hope the study will concentrate on developing the potential of the fishing industry in Northern Ireland with a view to greater investment in its development, he said.Mr Hume is at present awaiting a reply from the European Commission on ldquothe scientic justication for its ban on barring fishermen off the Co Down coast..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th February 2020 Late.jpg","title":"Late points give Down huge boost  ","story":"FINGERNAILS were being bitten to the quick by worried Down fans in the main stand at Pairc Esler on Saturday night as this encounter hurtled to conclusion.The sides had been locked in a fierce battle for supremacy and with time almost up, nothing separated them at - apiece.However, Down had a sting in the tail and just when it looked asthey were heading for another draw, Barry OrsquoHagan, Jerome Johnston and Donal OrsquoHare plundered points to maintain their unbeaten start to the campaign.All Derry could manage in reply was a single point from Chris Bradley, leaving manager Rory Gallagher lots to ponder on after his side squandered a host of great scoring opportunities.Now for Division  favourites Cork away this weekend with a place in the new top tier of All-Ireland Championship very much at stake.Derry, who also fancy a place at the top table and who drew their opener with Leitrim, last weekend, opened well with Shane McGuigan taking a marvellous score in the first minute.Down responded well and Kilcoorsquos Jerome Johnston, who wasnrsquot expected to start, quickly brought the sides level.However, Derry re-established their lead with two well-taken scores from Benny Heron and Shea Downey.

Across the resort,  street lights are not working.Other district hot-spots include Ballynahinch where  street lights are currently out of order, with faults reported in Killyleagh and  brought to the government departmentrsquos attention in Castlewellan and Crossgar. In Saintfield,  faults have been reported.Elsewhere,  street lights are currently out of order in Ballygowan, with  and  faults reported in Ardglass and Killough respectively.Sixteen street lights are out of order in Dundrum with  faults reported in Drumaness. The figures for the Spa and Clough are  and nine respectively.Downpatrick area councillor, Dermot Curran, who hopes to meet with Ms Mallon to discuss the issue, said investment must be found to address the street lighting debacle.He said that repairs are generally limited to those that can be carried out by the government departmentrsquos internal street lighting workforce which only consists of five full and three part time electricians.Cllr Curran described the number of street lights not working across East Down and Lecale as ldquoalarming and hopes that the money to expedite much-needed repairs will be earmarked by the new Stormont Executive.ldquoFaulty street lights represent a health and safety issue for drivers and pedestrians and there is not one area in the district which is not affected, he continued.ldquoWhile the new infrastructure minister will be inundated with requests for meetings and investment in key projects, repairing faulty street lights has to be a priority. The fact that in the local area there are  broken lights beggars belief. I have no doubt that the number will increase before the government department can begin to get to grips with this issue.Cllr Curran said street lights which are not working in areas where elderly people and indeed young families live poses a major problem.He said a fully working street lighting system provides residents with a sense of security and helps deter would-be criminals.ldquoI recognise that the new minister will have an overflowing intray and will have to work with her officials to determine the priorities in the months ahead. It is my contention that repairing faulty street lights must be one of those priorities, said Cllr Curran.ldquoThe new ministerrsquos department faces budgetary challenges, but the resources required to deliver a full street lighting repair service must be made available..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th February 2020 Men.jpg","title":"Men form football team to help with grief of losing baby  ","story":"THE love of football is helping men deal with the grief of losing a baby before, during or after birth.Downpatrick man Pat Moore has teamed up with personal trainer John Fegan from Rostrevor to formthe first Sands United County Down team.The team plays its first match against County Down Masters at the end of the month.Sands is a Northern Ireland charity which provides support to bereaved parents who have lost a baby either through miscarriage, stillbirth or within days or weeks of birth.Both men were helped by Sands when they lost babies before birth and admit they have struggled to deal with their own loss while supporting their partners.By coming together to play the sport they love, Pat, whorsquos better known locally as chairman of Celtic Bhoys FC, hopes that it will help him and other men find support and understanding with other menwho are going dealing with the same thing.The  year-old father of two said that he and his partner lost a much wanted baby during pregnancy nearly two years ago.ldquoOnce we knew we were going to have our first baby together, we were so happy about it and immediately began to plan for its arrival, said Pat.ldquoI expect a lot of men are the same but at the time it happened I had to step up and do all the organising while supporting my partner who was just devastated. When your partner is lying in hospital like that, all you want to do is to take the pain away but, at the same time, you have to put on a brave face for everyone involved.While the team is about football, Pat hopes that the members will be able to socialise after matches and share their experiences.Pat and seven of his friends are also fundraising for Sands by running in the Carlingford half marathon in March and the Belfast Marathon in May.He connected with John Fegan, whose family used to live in Downpatrick, on Facebook after John announced his intention to create the football team.John and his fiancee Kathryn Cole lost their first baby, Faith, at around  weeks into the pregnancy three years ago, although they are now parents to two children, Jude and Matilda.Like Pat, the  year-old knows the importance of physical activity and sport to help with mensrsquo mental health and being able to cope with the loss of baby in this way.He said: ldquoI was encouraged to do this when I realised there were other Sands football teams in Northern Ireland but none for County Down.ldquoThis is for fathers, uncles, brothers, grandfathers, cousins, whatever men who have been affected by the loss of a child. We share that we are united by angels, which is our motto.John said that there are now over  men who have joined the club and he and Pat hope to welcome more throughout the year.The first match will be held at Assumption Grammar School, Ballynahinch on Friday, February  at pm.

But credit due to both Paddy and Alec for their performances against regular league players.Group four, headed up by Colin McKinty, always a dangerous competitor in competitions, but he had to contend with an equally talented player in Sean Poland, who has been in great form recently.John Campbell, another player who is in sight of a regular place in the Strangford C team and the affable Katy Rice, improving with every game she plays, completed the group.The first spot in this group was always going to be tight, but McKintyrsquos steady defence was the key factor in finishing top of this group with Poland second.Group four with Michael Carey having steered Strangford B to their third consecutive isional title, was the clear favourite to finish in first place, but would have to contend with the Drumaness No  Pat Mulholland, who has been in excellent form throughout the league campaign.Also in this five-man group were Michael Deery, team-mate Niall Houghan and Drumaness man Seamus McGivern, more at home on the snooker table, but still no stranger to the plastic ball.The games in this group were hotly contested, but in the final game of the group Mulholland and Carey would battle it out for the top place.The first game could have gone either way with Pat just edging home -.The next was equally close but, in the end, it was the Drumaness man who finished in top place with just five points the dference.The first quarter-final match was an all-Strangford clash between McKinty and McCusker.The first two games were shared, but the steady place of McCusker, mixed with well-judged attack, saw him take the next two games to progress to the semi-finals.The second match featured the Drumanessrsquo Pat Mulholland and Charlie Murray. This was easily the match of the round.Mulholland won the first two games, the next two went to Murray with a nip and tuck decider before Mulholland just edged it -. The third match of the round involved second seed Donald Campbell taking on his skipper Michael Carey.The games were all close, but the blistering attack of Campbell saw him progress in straight games. Vincey Poland had perhaps the easiest match of the round against new comer John Campbell.As expected, Poland had too much iation for his opponent and ran out a comfortable - winner.McCusker stated this competition a dark horse to a least reach the final.His opponent in the semi-finals was Donald Campbell and he started as favourite.This semi-final turned out to be the closest match of the competition. John won the first two games and looked confident to reach the final.Back came Campbell to even the score, but McCusker won the first four points of the game and held on win -, leaving Donald to reflect on a match he should have won when he held a game point in the first encounter of the match.The next match was a close affair, but Poland was always in control with Pat Mulholland delighted to have reached this stage of the competition.It was a gallant effort from the Drumaness man but, in the end, Poland booked his final place with a straight game victoryThe home crowd was pleased to see a local man in the final of the competition, but knew he needed to produce something special to beat a player of Polandrsquos stature.The games were close and John, encouraged by his supporters, did everything he could to stem the flow of winners from one of the leaguersquos best backhand exponent, but to no avail and lost in straight games.League secretary, Jim Ritchie, thanked the Strangford club for staging this event and providing refreshment throughout the evening and the competitors for their generous contribution to the charity fund.Competition referee, Peter Deeny, also acknowledged the friendly, competitive spirit in which this event was enjoyed by all participants..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/11004234.jpg","title":"bandstand paddy mulligan","story":"What genre genres do you consider your music to be How long have you been performing Where do you perform What is your favourite song to play and why What has been your biggest gig to date Any funny gig rehearsal stories Who are your major influences Do you write your own songs  What inspires your songwriting What would be your dream gig Best moment as a musician so far What is the most unusual venue you have played What is your lsquogo-torsquo encore song Whats the best thing about performing Do you always perform solo or do you also play with a band What does  hold for you Any last words This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It’s a conversational well that is unlikely to run dry given the numerous prompts that adorn the walls, the rails and the display counters.Northern Ireland might not be as big a force in world football as the likes of Germany, France and Brazil, but per capita the Province punches well above its weight in terms of a fanaticism for football, be it the Irish League, the national team or an adopted team in England or Scotland..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button The shop which was opened in August by Ryan Gilmore, , and his business partner Pete McDonald, , taps into the rich demand for memorabilia amongst the nation’s football mad population.It leans towards the local game, celebrating the old kits and legendary stars of the Irish league, and immortalising national heroes such as Best, Whiteside, Jennings and more latterly Evans, McAuley and Healy. A Linfield shirt from  Ryan explained how a friendship forged in football gave birth to what is believed to be the only dedicated retro football shop in Northern Ireland.He said: “Pete and I are both Bangor fans – that’s a real labour of love – but we didn’t know each other until we met through work. We worked together for years in Yell where we pretty much talked about football non-stop.“The idea to start selling shirts online came after I’d been over to watch the Frampton fightand I went to the Classic Football Shirts Shop in Manchester. It’s  times bigger than the shop we have here.“I was with my fiancee at the time, now my we, and I said to her I’m going to try and do something like this online. I know how to do marketing, I love football, social media is easy enough when you know what you’re doing so I thought, I’ll give it a go. She didn’t object so that was a good start.The Northern Ireland Subbeteo print is the top seller“I started doing the shirts online last December. I got a bit of traction so I applied for a stall at St George’s in December and again in August.“I was getting married in July so I probably should have only been concentrating on that and nothing , but then I found out this unit in Smithfield was available. “Just before I was getting married – I think it was only a couple of days – I signed for the unit. Just before we got married I had to break the news to my we that I now owned a shop.Considerable and costly damage done to hayshed roof after blaze started deliberately - police say result could have been more devastatingpeople injuredResidents escape injury as shots fired inside home by two masked men - police appeal for information Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“Around that time I spoke to Pete about coming on board. He said, ‘you don’t know what you’re doing, I don’t know what I’m doing, let’s see what we can do together’.”Some of retro kit coasters for saleAskedthe dynamic changes when something you love becomes your job, Pete said: “I could never see us getting bored of it, I think I’ll forever be in that bubble, it’s something I love. “People work in office jobs and talk about football all day, that’s what we were like. Now we’ve got a set up where we can talk about football to whoever comes in and it’s part of the job.”Ryan commented: “On the business side of things we’re talking to clubs, striking up partnerships with other companies. Everything revolves around a love of football.”Pete said: “It’s good getting into the business side of it. There’s a buzz that comes from speaking to commercial managers of football clubs, trying to strike up partnerships.“It’s really easy to speak to people over here, quite a few clubs have heard of us.”He continued: “We’ve four clubs from the Irish League we’re in partnership with – Portadown, Linfield, Glentoran and Cltonville – and we’re branching across into England too.”The interior of the shop in Smithfield marketAt the moment the NI Classic Shirt Co is a part time venture, with the shop open on Thursday afternoonsand Fridays and Saturdays from . to .pm.Pete said: “We’re hoping to get full time. We’re going after clubs in England, Scotland and the League of Ireland as well as more local clubs. If they put in orders of a lot of units that can allow us to get a regular income and go full time.“We want to do as much Irish League stuff as we can with every club, that’s including the Championship. It would be great to get everyone on board. We’ve got a concept that can work with any club in the world.”Some of the shop’s best selling items are art prints of Subbuteo players from the Irish League or national team in kits from the eras in which they played. Another popular line sees a selection of classic kits displayed on coasters, mugs, T-shirts and art prints.And for those who like memorabilia they can wear the shop has a great range of old shirts, some match-worn.The strike partners leading the retro football revolution in Northern Ireland talked about some of their key team mates in their bid to climb the commercial ladder.Ryan said: “Tom Woodsdoes the Subbuteo prints. I approached him way back in the summer. I saw what he was doing with teams all over the UK. I commissioned him to do the Northern Ireland one which is a fantastic seller for us. “It’s kits from ious eras worn by  of the best ever players – there’s nothing like this available anywhere .“For the Subbuteo designs the club sends us photos of the players, we send them onto Tom and he works his magic. “We’ve also got him to do some Irish Leagues teams that we’ve teamed up with.” Pete continued: “With Hally Designs, they produce artwork featuring classic kits and you can turn them into prints or coasters or mugs or T-shirts. “They also do art prints of classic moments like when we beat England -. “We persuaded them to branch into the Irish League.”Ryan said: “There’s always new ideas out there, new brands to team up with.”In one of the framed prints by Hally Designs I spot the dubious yellow Broomhill kit which Glenavon wore in . It’s a kit I still own, but can’t recall wearing this side of the millennium.“Some of the worst kits are the best loved,” commented Ryan. “Some of them are an acquired taste. The fans love the Cltonville Kit Kat kit, we keep selling out of that on the coasters.”As well as the bespoke printed items, the shop is home to an array of old football programmes and some rare football shirts.Pete, an Arsenal fan, is particularly proud the shop has recently acquired the club’s yellow and blue ‘bruised banana’ away kit from - as well as a ‘Bergkamp ’ Holland shirt from .He said: “Bergkamp was the top man for me. It’ll pain me to sell those shirts but that’s how a business works.”Ryan said: “When I say we get shirts from all over the world I’m not trying to be vague, they genuinely come from all over the world. “There’s a Linfield top in there I got from Hong Kong. We’ve worked with collectors in Thailand, we’ve got stuff from America. “We get stuff locally as well, for example we sold a ‘ Red Star Belgrade top that had belonged to a guy who lived just outside Belfast. It was bought by someone in Miami, Florida. That shirt has done some miles.“There’s a Rangers match-worn Alex Cleland in there with number two on the back. It came from a collector in Asia.“We do get requests from people looking for specic shirts. There’s a network of collectors you can put a message out to and see what people have.”Of the resurgence in the Irish League that has helped boost the sales of memorabilia, Pete said: “We’re finding a lot of people are coming back to Glentoran and there’s been a big cash injection at Larne. “Some matches are on BBC, some on Sky Sports. You are getting good crowds again, it’s coming back.“Just last week we sold a the Glentoran home kit from - by auction for £. I reckon it would have cost about £ to £ at the time.“The Irish League is our bread and butter, but we want to branch out into the lower leagues in England and Scotland. “We’d especially love to get our own club Bangor on board. There’s a big fanbase still there.”Ryan said: “We’ve spoken to a few Irish League players on Twitter – we’ve got feedback from Joe Gormley and Liam Boyce, they both like their versions on the Cltonville Subbuteo print.”Ryan continued: “We don’t come from a retail background, we’re just football fans.“Initially I was just emailing every address I could find, pitching to them and explaining what I was trying to do. Now we’re speaking to clubs on the phone.“Obviously George Best put Northern Ireland on the map but recently with us doing well in the Euros people are paying attention outside of here.”While the online shop is rising in prominence the lads are trying to spread the word that they have a physical shop in Smithfield as well. “So many people come in to the shop and say they didn’t know we were here,” said Ryan. “Now they’re coming once a month to see what new things we’ve got in. Word of mouth for us is massive, customers telling their friends.“In most sports shops in Northern Ireland you can only get the most recent kits from the main Premier League, European and Scottish teams. We’re trying to offer something a bit dferent.”try catch  TrendingMan killed partner before killing and raping her teenage daughter in Newry apartment, inquest hearsStorm Ciara: NI braced for most violent storm since  -danger to le alerts - frequent lightning strikes, heavy rain, snow and possibility of mobile phone signal and power outagesStorm Ciara to batter NI with mph gales - weather warning upgraded to amber - possible impact on travel and electricity supplyWar of words as Stephen Nolan and Cool FM Breakfast both claim to be lsquobiggest show in the countryrsquoCoronavirus NI: suspected case of deadly coronavirus in baby boy in NI hospital        v.. -  applyImgSrcs\" i sb  for   sb* sb u  o.dataset.srcu  u.replaceo.setAttributeo.setAttributedocumentwindowapplyImgSrcs JP  JP  JP  \"NA-BELFNEWS-\"JP  \"People\"      Follow Us On       Explore News Sport Irish League Football Whats On Lestyle   Farming Le   More from the Belfast News Letter  Announcements Buy a Photo  Directory Jobs Homes Cars Local Guide  Public Notices  Reader Shop Must Read Read This Events   Useful Links Contact Us   Place your Ad Advertise a Job Subscribe  Readers Charter        ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"politics","story":" getRequiredClientIdforjpiconsole.log requiredClientIdcatch]EV.Core.updateUserProfile]EV.Core.updateUserProfile....... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast News Letter and agreeing to JPIMedia Publishing Ltd#s standard Terms and Conditions.

This year, she will celebrate her ninety second birthday and she discusses a letime of activism across Europe.Veganuary is an annual event which encourages people to go vegan for a month. In last yearrsquos campaign, a quarter of a million people pledged to try a vegan diet.More NewsVale school pals brave the shave for animal charityPenarth father of four is recognised in New Year Honour list for services to cricketHouse prices increased in the Vale of Glamorgan, latest figures showOnce a fringe movement, veganism is quickly gaining a vast appeal, especially amongst the young, as the environmental benefits of a plant-based diet become clearer.According to a study by the Vegan Society, , people in the UK were vegan in  ndash  and a half times higher than in . Almost half of these were people aged below .Veganism has brought with it a lucrative trade in plant-based produce as businesses move to accommodate the concerns of their customers and promote ethical alternatives to meat.Long before veganism became a dietary and commercial trendsetter, however, June Holder, a -year-old woman from Penarth, had her eyes opened to the costly effects of meat consumption. After eating a vegan breakfast at a local cafeacute, she settled down to tell me her story.ldquoIrsquove been vegan for  years, she said. ldquoMy daughter had a stall at Camden Market, and she used to collect masses of money for animal rights there. It was her who first introduced me to the cause.ldquoLater on, I organized a charity coffee morning and sent the money I raised to Compassion in World Farming. In , they sent me a magazine which showed what happened to the animals. Well, I sat down that morning and read what theyrsquod sent me ndash and I was vegan!Whilst the public has become more receptive to veganism, June still encounters hostility: ldquoPeoplersquos reactions y when I tell them Irsquom vegan. They become hostile because theyrsquore guilty, I suppose.ldquoI remember that a vegan group had a stall in the market a few years ago. They were advertising parts of Alsatians to eat. People were horried. So, when they were angry, I had a chance to talk to them. lsquoYou accept that any animal can be treated like this except when it comes to your dogsrsquo, I told them. Well, they had to accept it. How could they not Originally from Penarth, June moved to Dinas Powys from Barry after her husband, Derrick, passed away  years ago.Derrick was the owner of Holders Menswear, a menrsquos fashion store which was once renowned throughout the Vale of Glamorgan and beyond.Junersquos decision to become vegan sparked  years of dedication to activism. She joined the Animal Welfare Party, and, in her sixties and seventies, she travelled across the UK and Europe to campaign for animal rights.ldquoI demonstrated in many places. I went to Brussels twice to protest against the exportation of live animals. The International Fund for Animal Welfare took us in a coach.ldquoI was in the front row of the crowd, up against these spikes and razor wire. If they had started to push from the back, I dread to think what would have happened.ldquoThe night before the protest I had this thought: lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo. I wrote it on a little board.ldquoPeople kept tapping me on the shoulder and passing the board around the crowd and eventually it made its way back to me.What does the message mean ldquoIt means that it is more dangerous not to protest against these injustices that are happening.June still has a copy of the placard. Later, at her home, she retrieved it from a trove of scattered paraphernalia accumulated after years of protest.She has written prolically throughout her le about events which have provoked and enthused her. One poem describes the day of protest in Brussels. It reflects Junersquos unceasing dedication to animal welfare but also her frustration at the pace of change:ldquoThe writer of these verses was, quite some time ago, in Brussels with a poster which now rings yet more true. lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo is what the message said.ldquoThen round it went to young and old for everyone to read.

The UKrsquos withdrawal from the EU will begin later this month and we have a Conservative Government in Westminster until at least .Regardless of the numbers in the Commons, the Labour Party still has to stand up for those we represent. I am confident that my colleague, Stephen Doughty MP will continue to do that.The Labour Party will now move to elect a new Leader and Deputy Leader, a chance to reunite the Party and hold the Prime Minister to account for his actions.I am truly glad to see that several MPs from across the Party have put their names forward to stand for both positions. This offers the membership and the country a broader choice.I am yet to decide who I will back in the forthcoming election but I know that I want to see a vision from each of the candidates. For me, that vision needs to be a realistic reflection of our last decade out of government in Westminster, but also a strategy for reconnecting with our voters and securing a Labour government which can deliver for those who need us most.Finally, I want to thank the staff across the NHS and wider public services for their hard work under increasing pressures, particularly during the winter period.Our public services work hard all year round and many take the sacrice of working over the Christmas and New Year period for which I, and many others, are extremely grateful.As everyou would like to speak with me, you can call my office on    or write to me at Vaughan.Gething@assembly.wales or Office of Vaughan Gething AM, Room C, National Assembly for Wales, CF NA. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Who they are will have a real influence on Welsh Labourrsquos prospects in  and beyond. We are the most successful part of the UK Labour family over the last decade in terms of winning elections and running a national government. However, that cannot be taken for granted. An unpopular UK leader could make our task much harder next May.The first and most important attribute the next UK leader must have is the ability to fulfil the mission of our party - to become a party of government again across the UK, not just a party of protest. I want someone who can implement our labour values in government, not just talk about them.That requires some honesty about why we took such a beating at the general election, together with the willingness and strength to do something about it. Offering more of the same would be a betrayal of people who need a UK Labour government and will condemn the UK [or what is left of it] to a further decade of the Tories.We didnrsquot get hammered in  for one reason alone - there were a number of them. Agreeing to the election in the first place when we plainly were not prepared. Agreeing to an election certain to be dominated by Brexit. Our vacillation on Brexit when people wanted certainty and leadership. The factional infighting. The demonisation of the last UK Labour government, asthat would encourage people to vote for us. I grew up with  Tory years in power and I know that things really did get better following Labourrsquos victory in .An overloaded manesto with some popular policies but without a key central message. A costed manesto that then had a huge extra spending pledge added to it, meaning that people didnrsquot believe that we were serious or credible one even the policies they liked. A staggeringly inept UK campaign that wasted the amazing dedication of our volunteers, prepared to go out in the cold and rain to campaign. Our abject failure on anti-Semitism. This and much more.Many people recognised that Boris Johnson is a dishonest man who is completely out of touch with most peoplersquos lives. Lots of people still voted for him or refused to vote Labour because they could not trust and support us. Our own people - long term Labour voters - struggled to support us. Our leader was undeniably part of the reason why. Blaming our defeat solely on the mainstream media or whichever side of the Brexit ide we favour isnt honest and will not help us to win in the future.I donrsquot much care whether someone claims they are from the left, soft left, centre or old right of the Labour Party. We all have a stake in our party and the countries of the UK. These are serious times and we need a serious figure who can nail the Tories and the clown in number ten.Irsquove been interested in what Lisa Nandy has to say and believe that Lisa and many other figures have a key role to play in rebuilding our party ndash first as a credible opposition, then as a credible alternative government at the next UK General Election.However, I think the person best placed to win the argument, and even more importantly to help us win an election, is Keir Starmer. Itrsquos not the protesting, or the taking part that counts. Itrsquos the winning and the decisions you get to make in government that can change peoplesrsquo lives and change the country for the better. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

But must also find a new UK Labour Leader who has what takes to unite, win, and ensure the UK Labour Party has a credible vision fit for the world of the s and s ndash and a Leader capable of speaking for and winning the confidence of the whole country.I was delighted to see so many talented and thoughtful colleagues putting themselves forward for election. There are things being said by many that we need to listen to.But, after speaking to many of the candidates personally, and asking them all tough questions - I am backing Keir Starmer for Leader. I think hersquos got what it takes to hold this government immediately and robustly to account to build a team of all the talents and crucially that he has the vision, ideas and credibility to win again.Keir joined me on the streets of Penarth speaking to voters and local businesses during the election campaign ndash and it was clear by the warmth of the reception he received that he is someone who has the immediate credibility and credentials to be our future prime minister, and would work in partnership with Welsh Labour.He has crucial experience of public service and confronting powerful vested interests for the good of the country. He acted to prosecute MPs who had abused expenses and Murdoch journalists in the phone-hacking scandal when he was Director of Public Prosecutions.We need to win back these voters that we lost in the last general election. It was heart-breaking on election night, to see Labour lose places like Wrexham and Bridgend.The UK Labour Party must get back to being a party that votersrsquo can trust. That means we cannot just have a ldquoone more heave approach. We need someone who can speak to the whole of our country, not just one region or subset of voters, with the values and vision to win. Keir fits the bill. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

constituencies where they had historically never had a representative.Due to the historic sht, focus has now turned to the question of a united Ireland, a long held aim of Sinn Fein, and the basis for their ldquoprogramme for government.Bertie Ahern, the former taoiseach and Fianna Fail leader said on Monday, as counting continued across the state: ldquoI think a border poll is inevitable.ldquoIf you ask me when that is, I think itrsquos probably five years off at least. vw,vw,px, px\"A Sinn Fein poster calling for Irish unity on the N road outside Co Cavan near the border with Northern Ireland ldquoI think the Sinn Fein position is it should be held within five years.ldquoSo letrsquos say we are talking about it being five years off, I do not think you are going to get the circumstances where it would become a condition of government that it has to be held in the short term.ldquoBut it will be inevitable over this decade.On BBC Radio rsquos World At One he warned against rushing towards a poll on reunication before extensive preparatory work had been completed.ldquoIt can only be done when the preparation is done, when the case is made, when it has been well explained, when people know the outcome, he said.ldquoTo try and push it or rush it, which some people will probably try to do, would be a grave mistake.Sinn Fein has gained the most first preference votes in Irelandrsquos  election held on Saturday, however a united Ireland and Brexit did not feature as major voting issues.Domestic crises in the health and housing sector are widely accepted as the two main drivers behind the sht in Irish politics.Northern Ireland Deputy First Minister Sinn Feinrsquos Michelle OrsquoNeill said on Monday it was a ldquogood day when asked about her partyrsquos electoral successes.ldquoWe have provided solutions in terms of the health crisis and the housing crisis so we will want to work with others to establish a programme for government that reflects how we can deliver upon those promises, she said. vw,vw,px, px\"People take part in an Irish unity march as they cross the Lford Bridge, from Donegal, which marks the border between Strabane in County Tyrone, Northern Ireland, and Lford in County Donegal in the Republic of Ireland ldquoBut obviously we are Irish republicans, there is no secret of that, and clearly we will have asks in terms of the republican project, clearly we will have asks in terms of the kind of society we want to build.ldquoAt the end of the day, we have said there should be a unity referendum within five years so thatrsquos the position we will take into negotiations.Ms OrsquoNeill added she ldquoabsolutely feels this election has pushed Irish reunication closer.ldquoWe have said things are going in this direction for some time, I think for a number of reasons not least the fact that the unionist majority, the very basis on which this northern state was founded, is gone and has been gone over the last number of elections.ldquoBut I think this is a seismic election sht in the  counties, Sinn Fein are the largest party in the  counties, I think that is signicant in itself.The Sinn Fein leader set about trying to form a left-coalition government on Monday, contacting smaller progressive parties and independents, however evenall were on board, she is likely to still fall shy of the  seats needed to form a government and could be forced to look to one of the traditional parties, Fine Gael or Fianna Fail, for assistance.Fianna Fail, likely to hold the most seats in the Irish parliament after the votes have been counted, has sent mixed messages over whether or not it would be willing to work with Sinn Fein, with some representatives saying the coalition is ldquoinevitable while others say

I think it is nice to see smaller parties coming into the fold again because after all, smaller parties could be potential kingmakers in the next government and I think it shows how versatile the Irish political system can get.ldquoThere is a need for change when it comes to delivering proper housing, healthcare and infrastructure and this need for change has really resonated with the public.ldquoTherersquos maybe a bit of a protest vote going on as well because Fianna Fail and Fine Gael may not have been there for people in the past  or  years.Mr Brady said Brexit was not an issue for him as a voter, citing the need for better public transport as his main wish.ldquoThere may be a bit of chaos going forward when it comes to forming the next government but overall, I think we will be better off for it.A flower seller on Grafton Street, who did not wish to be named, said she was delighted with Sinn Feinrsquos surge and said leader Mary Lou McDonaldrsquos popularity had been the key to its success.ldquoIrsquom just shocked they didnrsquot win more seats, she said.ldquoThe people want changehellip they see that the Government that has been in the past  years has done nothinghellip our country is meant to be blooming yet you have all these homeless kids on the streets and people waiting on hospital trolleys.ldquoI know Brexit affects the country and all but that comes secondhellip homelessness and hospitals should come first.ldquoYou had the two main parties saying they wouldnrsquot go in with Sinn Feinhellip well now itrsquos a dferent story and I hope to God she doesnrsquot go with them.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_MM-Photo-1.jpg","title":"manufacturing month ni to showcase strength of sector","story":"Posted on Tuesday  January  by Ulster Business Economy Minister Diane Doods with Manufacturing NIs Stephen Kelly Northern Ireland’s burgeoning manufacturing sector will be showcased as part of a major initiative to highlight the strength and excellence of the industry here.

From food processing and pharmaceuticals to aeronautical technology and new, emerging tech like AI and machine learning, Northern Ireland punches well above its weight when it comes to producing world-class products and services.” “This new initiative not only celebrates the people who make our manufacturing sector the world leader that it is but will create a legacy and a pathway for the next generation of sector leaders. A key feature of Manufacturing Month NI will be a major outreach and engagement programme with schools and regional colleges, focused on promoting the sector to young people, developing the crucial skills they need as they enter the industry.” “We hope to see as many companies as possible across theand breadth of Northern Ireland get involved with Manufacturing Month NI. We are keen to highlight new products, new initiatives, workplace tours, business expansion, and everything  in between to showcase the strength and quality of our local manufacturing sector.” And Economy Minister, Diane Dodds, said: “I commend Manufacturing NI for this new initiative which celebrates one of Northern Ireland’s most vital sectors.

The revamp is part of the Department of Finance’s Reval – which is a reassessment of the rates system which businesses pay. While still a draft schedule of values, each council will also have to apply its own regional rate, based on the new proposed figures.“The Cathedral Quarter isn’t just about eating and drinking,” Gareth Neill, BID manager, Destination CQ told Ulster Business.“We have a vibrant ecosystem of arts and culture and fantastic built heritage that makes this area stand out, hospitality plays an integral part to the quality of le in this part of Belfast – for a city to be striving to attract new residents, increase our tourism offer these are crucial to the city’s success. “We are concerned about that the potential knock-on effects to the affected business owners and there’s a very real possibility it will have an impact on the price of a pint to the people who come to socialise in Cathedral Quarter. The knock-on effect of outdated methodology for calculation of rates on licensed premiseshas a potentially crippling effect on jobs and character of this area.”A spokesman for Land  Property Services said: “In Northern Ireland, nearly % of pubs will have no change or a decrease in their Net Annual Value .“Any business rate payer who thinks their new valuation may be incorrect, can contact LPS to arrange an informal review and supply any relevant information before the new valuation list comes into force on  April .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mip1.jpg","title":"mipim taking belfast to the world","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Joe ONeill and Suzanne Wylie Belfast Harbour boss Joe O’Neill will help lead a private and public sector delegation to MIPIM – the world’s biggest commercial property event – as chairman of the taskforce. He chats to John Mulgrew about the big announcements, fighting off the competition and attracting a global giant to Northern Ireland For Joe O’Neill and the wider delegation heading to potentially warmer climates, the proposition of selling the city and wider region to major investors has gotten easier.In the five years since Belfast ed to MIPIM – an event which sees tens of thousands descend on Cannes in France for four days of real estate and development – the private and public team, and taskforce, have developed a “strong ” in which to sell the city and Northern Ireland, with hopes of attracting a big name insurance or tech firm on the list.“MIPIM is a great  for the promotion of city-wide initiatives, and demonstrating to investors and to occupiers the growth potential in the city, and the opportunities for them and that the key stakeholders are all aligned behind an appropriate growth agenda,” Joe says.“You see dferent sizes and scales of stands out there – you see some really ambitious stands and proposed developments, so Belfast has to see it’s entry point into that. Belfast first and foremost will be competing against peer group cities within the UK… but then it is a worldwide show, so you will be competing against other cities.”Belfast is leading a major delegation this year, and will also be joined by representatives from other Northern Ireland councils, including those that are part of the Belfast Region City Deal, such as Mid  East Antrim. That deal is also going to be a focus for announcements and development, during the event.This year’s delegation will be led by a host of top private sector developers in Northern Ireland, alongside Belfast City Council and organisations such as Belfast Harbour. That includes Bywater, Wirefox, Titanic Quarter, Tribeca, McAleer  Rushe and Graham Group, along with the two universities and others working within related fields from law, professional services and the supply chain.For Joe and the delegation, MIPIM represents an opportunity to announce some of Belfast and Northern Ireland’s wider major new infrastructure and commercial plans. Previous visits have included the announcement of major offices schemes, hotels and apartment developments.“We will have a series of announcements – some of those announcements will be new, and some will be progress, and demonstrating to investors or occupiers that progress has been madeit’s a multi-year scheme, to show we are delivering.“… we have new projects coming through the pipeline in ious sectors. This year we are looking at launching schemes around digital innovation. That aligns with one of the themes in the Belfast Region City Deal, for the city and councils in the deal. We have a particular focus on cyber-security as an investment and operating location – particular those from the US.”Joe says that would be in addition to the already well-established cyber-security development at Catalyst in the Titanic Quarter, and that new names are coming in to the marketplace creating a “cluster” around the sector, and setting up Belfast and beyond as a new global hub.“We are looking at announcing some details around the Belfast-Dublin-London corridor,” Joe says.“As an economic corridor, or triangle. Post-Brexit, there are clear synergies in developing a proposition where companies can avail of the three locationsthey are looking at a global footprint, and see advantages to locations in three cities.”The issue of increasing connectivity between Belfast and Dublin also remains high on the list – improving the speed and frequency, and making developers aware of the new Belfast Transport Hub, which will transform the city’s rail and bus connectivity when complete.For Belfast Harbour, it’s also bringing the expansion of its already successful film studios to MIPIM, amid further plans to grow and develop the hub to attract big names and become the largest of its kind outside London.“We will be revealing more of our expansion plans, which is being supported by NI Screen,” Joe said. Some of those delivering their own presentations to potential investors will include the Harbour, Belfast City Council, Catalyst and the universities. “We are out looking around, when we are there, at what dferent cities are doing – seeing whether something works well, and looking at our competitive advantage in that area.”As for the strengths and attraction for potential investors, Joe says: “Skills, talent and technology are very much at the fore. Agility as a small region and to be able to respond, and seeing that team Belfast is there and that we are aligned with a particular project. It doesn’t have to be taken back home and introduced to someone .“There is the emergence of Belfast as an attractive city – investment opening up, and people are always looking at new markets. “Part of the initial roll-out when I took on the chair of MIPIM, the role was to go around to ask those who were on board previously to ask about it,it had changed. Everyone noticed and recognised considerablechange over the last four years. “We were pioneering and establishing ourselves four years ago, now they felt we were very much a concerted and effective operating team… the collective was a powerful message, and having  or lunches involving all of the stakeholders at one time. It’s a really strong  to take on the next chapter.”So, for Joe and the rest of the MIPIM delegation, what would be considered a major goal or success on the back of the visit to the commercial property show in March  “A particular focus this year is to attract key institutional investors – the big insurance companies for example. That’s a chicken and egg situation… you need to have product, to have product you have to show that you have occupiers and a steady revenue stream. “What we have been able to say to the investment market is ‘we have product and we now have sustainable occupation coming through… now it feels like the right time for you as an investor, to come in, and to support further investment’.”Asked whether replicating the successes of our neighbours in Dublin in attracting tech giants such as Apple, Facebook and Google is also on the cards, Joe says: “Something like that, or a major investor. For them to do that – a technology or an investment company – they need to see that the public, private and third-tier sectors are all collaborating together to make an effective market, and I think we are good at doing that now.”And the timing couldn’t be better for the delegation – now able to go in with a clear mandate and message with the restoration of the Executive and ato day-to-day power-sharing politics.“The positive thing for us is with the government and secondly, somearound Brexit… it takes those two challenging issues off the table.” πView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/johnm1.jpg","title":"companies must act quickly on new ir legislation reforms","story":"Posted on Monday February  by Ulster Business At the start of this year the government launched a review into the changes to IR legislation which will affect medium and large private sector organisations and have far-reaching impacts on the way they engage with non-permanent workers, writes John Moore, managing director, Hays NI.The timeframe between the review and the reforms coming into effect in April is shorter than many would have liked but with the reforms now on the horizon, companies need to act, particularly those in sectors such as technology, construction and finance where use of contractors operating as personal services companiesis common. At a basic level, the reforms to IR legislation sht the responsibility of determining the tax status of personal services company workers to the company that engages them where previously they could self-certy. The original rules required the freelance contractor to determine their tax status, but HMRC believed non-compliance was common.Now,a person’s assignment falls outside of IR legislation, they are deemed to be self-employed, so gross payment will be made to the PSC. Butthe assignment falls inside of IR, the professional should be treated as an employee, applying PAYE and NIC deductions from their payment. In simple terms, the tax arrangements for contractors are changing so that they won’t get such a good dealthey can’t demonstrate their work is out of scope and employers will have to pay more for using and keeping what were previously non-payroll workers.This will have a big effect on how people choose to work and who they choose to work for, not to mention how organisations plan and budget. An organisation’s policy towards contractors will affect how attractive they are to freelancers. But on the other side we’ve already seen some risk averse companies adopt a blanket ban on freelancers just to be safe – meaning they are missing out on skilled professionals they need to deliver projects.In Northern Ireland, as where, it’s likely the IR reforms will hit technology hardest, but the effects could be wide ranging across roles in construction, project management and finance.We’ve heard anecdotal evidence of IT contractors leaving the big banks and starting to view early stage tech companies with less than  employees more favourably because they fall outside the scope of the legislation. When similar legislation was introduced in the public sector in , hundreds of highly skilled contractors left roles to join organisations who were prepared, often leading to projects being scrapped. Now the private sector is catching up, preparation is key and anyone who hasn’t done a review of what it means for their capacity should do so urgently. A Hays survey showed % of private sector firms expect cost increases when IR reforms come into effect, % expect to lose key talent and % think it will be harder to bring in non-permanent workers. A third of organisations surveyed were completely unaware of the reforms – a big concern given how tight the labour market is.So, first you need to determine whether assignments are inside or outside of IR. You need to have full visibility of all workers your organisation engages who are paid via agencies and consultancies as well as knowledge of how they are paid. You will also need to have the expertise to determine the tax status of each assignment. When you know that you can then start communicating with freelance workers, renegotiating working arrangements, standardising onboarding procedures and decidingany specialist skills need to be brought in house to get projects over the line.If you expect to use a high volume of temporary workers in , outsourcing your temporary worker provision through a managed services programme could be an option, as an expert would carry out accurate assessments for every temporary worker placed with you.Whatever stage you are at, don’t ignore IR. It’s coming and you need to understand it.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
