[{"url":null,"title":"Dame Judi Dench says theatres NEVER reopen lifetime amid coronavirus lockdown","story":"Share this article Boris Johnson and his Chancellor Rishi Sunak need to think hard about what is at stake here. One top forecasting firm projects that revenue from the creative industries will drop by an astonishing £74billion in 2020 thanks to the coronavirus lockdown. More than 400,000 jobs will be lost by year\u0027s end - simply a human tragedy - and the damage doesn\u0027t stop there. Countless more millions in revenue will be lost to the bars and restaurants that complement theatres and concert halls around the country. At the Theatre Royal, Plymouth, we earn 91 per cent of our annual turnover and take only a 9 per cent government subsidy. At a stroke, all our income except that small subsidy has been lost. Many regional theatres have a reputation for developing acting and writing talent. In Plymouth, I gave Michael Sheen his first directing job at our Drum theatre, while David Suchet and Ben Whishaw have also performed there and James Corden, Michael Ball - a Plymouth lad - and Sir Ian McKellen have played our Lyric stage.  It is a virtuous circle of British creative talent that now circulates around Hollywood and the globe. Now all of that is threatened. South Korea shows us what can be done. It may surprise some to learn that Phantom of the Opera is currently playing in Seoul to packed houses. Cast and patrons have their temperatures taken and apply sanitising gel. Masks are worn. But people sit side by side, with no social distancing. At the beginning of the reopening, only half those Koreans with booked seats were prepared to attend. But after a dozen or so performances, the figure shot up to above 90 per cent. This is the sort of bold thinking that will be necessary to save our industry. Large-scale theatres require attendances of 70 to 80 per cent to break even, so social distancing, even at one metre, is a non-starter. In the immediate term, we need a financial support scheme for the whole sector. But equally important is political leadership. The Prime Minister and his scientific advisers must get behind a new regime that will allow theatres to open again. We need to get back to the business of safely delighting people. Adrian Vinken is chief executive of the Theatre Royal, PlymouthTimes letters: Arts still in peril after the lockdown lifts | Comment | The Times"},{"url":null,"title":"Amber Heard called Elon Musk Rocketman texts","story":"Share this articleShare this articleAmber Heard called Elon Musk her \u0027Rocketman\u0027 in texts while married to Johnny Depp -

the one in Wallace\u0027s stall - according to NASCAR.com. It is not clear who tied the rope that way or when that person did so.  Before the FBI halted its investigation Tuesday and said it was not a hate crime, all 39 other NASCAR drivers rallied in support of Wallace at Monday\u0027s restart, collectively pushing his No. 43 car to the front of the grid in a show of solidarity. Wallace, an Alabama native, became overwhelmed with emotion and fought back tears as his car owner, NASCAR legend Richard Petty, gave him a hug in the moments before the race began. Some people have slammed the investigation over the rope a \u0027hoax\u0027 and saying NASCAR had somehow overreacted over the shocking incident.Wallace hit back at the accusations saying the whole experience was \u0027just short of pure hell\u0027 for him and that the \u0027common denominator is racism\u0027. "},{"url":null,"title":"Coronavirus testing carried parks churches sports grounds","story":"Share this article But latest data from the Office for National Statistics suggests there are up to 3,200 new infections a day or 22,400 a week, suggesting fewer than a third of people are being tested.To further increase uptake, the Department of Health is planning to double the number of mobile testing units from 117 to 236 by the end of July. Officials yesterday said 43,230 people had died after testing positive for coronavirus in the UK, up 149 from the day before.Dido Harding, executive chairman of the test and trace programme, said: ‘Our new walk-through testing sites will be set up in places that are easy for people to get to by foot or on a bike.’The Newcastle walk-in unit is close to an Asda supermarket, Slough’s is in a leisure centre, Rochdale’s is in a town hall car park and Newham’s is located in a community care centre.Officials at the Department of Health say the location of the new sites will be driven by where residents are most likely to use them rather than a ‘national diktat’.They hope the new units will improve the Government’s test and trace programme, which is meant to be playing a crucial role in the safe lifting of the lockdown. But figures from the scheme yesterday showed the numbers of patients handing over details of their close contacts had fallen compared to the previous week.A total of 70 per cent were asked to provide these details for the week to June 17, while the remaining 30 per cent could not be reached. This dropped from the 75 per cent who gave contact details for the week to June 10.Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents hospitals, said: ‘There are still many questions that need answering before we can be confident that we have a fit for purpose regime, let alone a world class one.’ The retreat of the pandemic has stalled in England and the number infected may even have gone up, figures suggested yesterday.Around one in 1,100 people were infected in the middle two weeks of this month – up from one in 1,700 in the first fortnight of June, findings published by the Office for National Statistics said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/68ca6b3b594fdbca56109b923a9e4e5954ca1c8a/0_320_5715_3429/master/5715.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=64ec5fc8cee6d27981a043504c67df9d","title":"splendid isolation in search of scotlands hermits","story":"Many isolated people have struggled in lockdown, but others enjoy solitude and choose it as a way of life. Here, Elliot Caunce portrays four modern hermits who live off the grid in ScotlandWilliams, 70, moved into his off-grid farmhouse in the 70s, with his then wife and his daughter, Ceilidh, after falling out with his landlord in Aberdeen. When the marriage ended, he stayed on alone, but he is philosophically optimistic about a future relationship: “I was once married and I may well be married again. It’s a big house to be rattling around in by myself.”Down a remote forestry track in Aberdeenshire, his house has no mains electricity, water or conventional sewage system. For a hermit, he is not averse to fame: he featured in the cinema documentary Two Years At Sea by Ben Rivers, appeared on a Frankie Boyle television show and plays folk music at open mic nights.Maitland, 70, is a successful author who writes books about religious fantasy and solitude, informed by her Roman Catholic faith. She spent increasing amounts of time alone when her marriage broke down in 1993. “I went to live in the country. It was here I started to practise solitude and it grew from there. I found I loved it.” She has lived in the remote moorlands of Galloway since 2006.She recognises that living alone in remote countryside could become difficult as she gets older, especially if she becomes unable to drive. She needs a car to fetch supplies and to remove rubbish, as there is no bin collection.McDonald, 65, moved into a tent in 2007, after he was diagnosed with a critical heart condition and told he needed a transplant. He decided to self-isolate on the edge of a loch, to the east of Fort William. “I thought: if I’ve only got a short life expectancy, I’m just going to come out and live in the wild, which is what I was going to do when I retired.” Living in an area without a phone signal or roads, and few hikers, he has become resilient and self-sufficient. Shopping for supplies involves a round trip of 10 miles walking and 50 miles by train.Smith, 74, is known as the Hermit of Loch Treig. He has lived alone in an isolated log cabin, lacking all modern amenities, since 1984. Once a month, he hikes along an active train track to his nearest station, then takes an hour’s ride to Fort William for food and medical supplies. His one concession to modern life is an emergency locator beacon, which he activated in February 2019 after becoming ill – the distress signal was routed via Houston, Texas, to the coastguard and then Lochaber Mountain Rescue he was airlifted to hospital by helicopter."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/847783d90c294a0d22e2f4c1c3eb87989a9205e1/0_114_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=07aa537b7bffd2fe48828b8a65c5a77f","title":"great british art quiz amgueddfydd sir gar carmarthenshire museums","story":"Carmarthenshire Museums set today’s quiz, which lets you explore the art collections of British museums closed due to Covid-19 – while answering some fiendish questions along the wayThis quiz is brought to you in collaboration with Art UK, the online home for the UK’s public art collections, showing art from more than 3,000 venues and by 45,000 artists.

I live in New York City, but I was working on a project in the rainforest in Madagascar when the government announced it was shutting its borders. I managed to get on the last flight out of the country to South Africa and I arrived in my childhood home, Johannesburg, a few days before a military-enforced lockdown grounded all international flights indefinitely.I had left Johannesburg over 10 years ago and I have spent these years looking outward, restlessly exploring this strange, complex world. But suddenly I was forced to sit still. The city seemed to have been turned off the sky cleared, the traffic stopped and we all went inside. I felt shipwrecked and trapped. As the military started rolling into the city in armoured vehicles, forcing people inside, and we believed the virus was stalking the streets, I felt a familiar unsettledness, similar to the anxious uncertainty of my early childhood growing up during apartheid.Apartheid loomed large over my childhood. Our phones were tapped by the security police, friends of my parents were killed by the government and many nights I would lie awake eavesdropping on anxious political discussions. My parents are both academics, teachers and political activists who have dedicated most of their lives trying to help build a more just and equal society. Now as the world entered a new uncertain time, I found myself stranded right where I had started, just a few minutes away from my first guides to surviving a world in turmoil, my parents.So I took my camera and spent the afternoons of the lockdown sitting with a mask on in their garden interviewing them about their lives before I was born, sifting through giant, chaotic, dusty piles of family photos, and skulking around their house with a portable projector and a bottle of disinfectant.This is an incomplete portrait of my parents. This story leaves out many of the most notable successes, heartbreaks and struggles that defined their lives. But it’s a small glimpse into the quiet violences and small triumphs of life, and the steps that led my parents to the moment that made me.(Left) Photographers Portrait Studio, Johannesburg, 1939. My mother, Luli Callinicos, at two years old sits with her parents, Thalia and Yannis Callinicos, who ran a small grocery store in the mining city of Boksburg, and her two uncles. The family had arrived in South Africa a few years before from a tiny village on a small Greek island.(Right) The family home, Fort Hare, 1947. My father, Eddie Webster, on the right with his parents, Enid and Lionel Webster, both schoolteachers, and his older brother, Trevor. My grandfather had recently returned home from the second world war after being away for four years.“I think that was possibly the most traumatic moment in my life although I have no recognisable conscious memory of it. What I know is what my mother told me … In the 1940s Cape Town experienced an epidemic of diphtheria, and diphtheria, like Covid-19, is highly infectious and it was believed at the time by the medical profession that it weakened the heart and that if someone moved quickly or jerked that could lead to the collapse of the heart and you’d die. I was two years old when I acquired the virus. The diagnosis once it was made was that I had to be locked down, I had to be tied down and put in a glass case to prevent the infection from spreading to others. My mother was only allowed to visit once or twice a week. I was there, tied down in a hospital bed, for six weeks.”“My generation was born in South Africa but our parents were immigrants. It was the height of colonialism and the Greek community, a vulnerable, newly arrived minority, was at that time quite closed and defensive. Some of my earliest memories of anyone outside of the Greek community are of my nanny, Tryphena, who lived in a room in the backyard of our house. My parents worked long hours at the cafe that my father ran so she would look after me when my mother was at work. She was so warm and affectionate and I really adored her. The only time off she had was on Thursday afternoons. One day I remember her preparing to leave in the afternoon and she was so beautifully dressed. I usually only knew her in her work clothes, an overall, an apron and a cap on her head. I remember this particular time though she had high heels on and a beautifully fitting red dress and she was so elegant and beautiful and sexy. She said sweetly, ‘Good bye Luli, see you tomorrow,’ and walked out the door. I couldn’t help myself, I followed her, I couldn’t bear to see her go. We must have walked about two blocks, I was behind her not saying a word. When she came to the bus stop she turned around and saw me and her whole face suddenly changed. She became angry and shouted, ‘What are you doing? Go back at once! I’m not going to take you with me. Just go back!’ I was devastated and felt so hurt, not at all understanding that this one afternoon was her very precious, only a few hours of freedom and escape from our house.”“At the age of 13 I was sent to boarding school. I was desperately homesick, separated from my mother and father in this totally alien world. It was rough and often violent. There was a system that was called ‘running the gauntlet’. You’d have five or six boys on each side, they’d line up and you had to run through and you could hit the guy with anything you had, a cricket bat, a stick, or even a brick and people would do that, especially if there was something different about the guy, then they could seriously hurt the person. There was a very violent masculinity there that in order to survive in a sense you had to become part of, either tacitly or actively. I found it deeply compromising and unsettling.”“One day, when I was 18 we went to a Greek dance in the city hall. A man came up to request a dance and I recognised him from a week before when I won a raffle at the Greek club. He was the pharmacist my mother had mentioned a few days before. We began to dance and he said: ‘I was so struck by you, I want to ask for your hand in marriage.’ I was a bit taken aback. This was my first time I was meeting him. ‘Actually I’m in love with someone else,’ I told him. We spent the rest of the dance in silence.”“My parents had heard from him what I had said and they were outraged. The young man I was in love with was a cafe owner like my father, whereas I was getting a university education and could be marrying a pharmacist. There was a huge confrontation that evening. I declared, outrageously for the Greek culture at that time, that I would either marry the man I loved or not marry at all. My father\u0026nbspdisappeared and came back with a revolver in his hand and said, ‘If you contemplate marrying him I’m going to kill him and then I’ll kill myself.’ A few days later I was allowed to go to the library where I met my love secretly. We had a tearful farewell. It was taken for granted that I would become engaged to the pharmacist. I had no other option unless I wanted to be exiled to Greece. I was married three months later at the age of 19.”“My big first shift in how I saw the world was going overseas and hitchhiking in Europe and the Middle East in 1960 when I was 17. That’s what transformed my life. Travelling on my own I had to adapt and observe. I noticed things that were new to me and distinctive. We were travelling on the edge of colonialism. Egypt was already independent. We travelled back down to South Africa via boat, stopping off at ports along the east African coast. In Mombasa I met a young Kenyan man that belonged to the Kenyan African National Union, who was telling me about his desire for independence from British colonial rule. When we arrived back in Durban, I remember driving back with my family and it was the height of a state of emergency there were soldiers everywhere. Suddenly I was looking at the country through different eyes. My consciousness had started to evolve, an awareness was emerging.”“I was 23 years old and had joined the ANC. After the 1960 state of emergency, which was declared after the killings of Sharpeville in which 69 people were shot dead during a peaceful protest, we met and decided to work in pairs, some at night and some in the daytime. We went up Anstey’s building, the tallest building in Johannesburg city centre, and because we were white we could just take the lift right to the top floor. We had packets of leaflets saying that this was the time now for whites to realise there must be change, the only solution was democracy for all. I had a whole packet of leaflets and I threw them all down over the streets from the top of the roof. Hundreds of them gently floated into the busy city streets below.”“After the massacre in\u0026nbspSharpeville in 1960, every week we would hear news of people being arrested, detained and tortured. Increasingly, there were reports of political activists who disappeared into apartheid’s dungeons, or had managed to escape the country. I was the secretary of the Defence and Aid Fund, and for a few years we had been secretly funnelling people to safe houses and then out of the country. But eventually the underground leadership was captured and sentenced to lifetime imprisonment on Robben Island. I was 27 years old when the special branch came to the school I was teaching at and asked me to go with them. I was held for two days in detention.”“For a few years after I orced my husband I taught history at King David high school. I really enjoyed teaching and wouldn’t teach the apartheid curriculum to the students. When my history co-teacher was forced to resign over a statement questioning the validity of Israel’s right to Palestine during the recent six-day war, I pleaded his case but the headmaster dismissed it. ‘I have a wonderful replacement: a captain of the rugby team at university, he’s got an honours degree in history and his name is Eddie Webster.” And of course that’s how I met your father, because of a political upheaval thousands of kilometres away.”“That photo was taken in 1969, the same day as they walked on the moon.”“1976 was a tough year. I was on bail after I had been arrested for calling for the release of Nelson Mandela.\u0026nbspI had to report to the police station twice a week and I was starting to teach a new class and a new course at the university. When they announced by name that these communists had been arrested, my mother had a very serious stroke and nearly died.”“A year later when we were eventually acquitted and I stood down from my evidence in the court, my father came up to me and said, ‘Eddie, when they arrested you I supported you because you are my son. Now I’ve heard you in the dock and I support you because what you did is right.’ What kept me going in this time was the support of my family and my wife, who was unshaken by this and fully supported me, but also it was the fact that I was intellectually now shaping a whole new political agenda that was to become my life’s work really.”“Through writing my book Gold and Workers I found a voice, one that I was deeply interested in. I was pregnant with you when I started writing my first book. I had forged a new sense of community through the city, and through the common beliefs and values I shared with people of the city. Johannesburg gave me an enormous sense of place and identity. And I got to understand and admire the incredible resilience and creativity and the inventiveness of people who were so crudely oppressed and hideously exploited. I came to understand Ubuntu, that ‘a person is a person through other people’.”“It’s interesting reflecting on the past now towards the end of my working life. During the anti-apartheid struggle we had a very clear idea of who the enemy was, it was the system of racial domination and the way in which it gave white people privileges and power at the expense of black people. The virus now is starting to raise questions that are quite fundamental and\u0026nbspdeeper than have ever been confronted before in this country. Namely that we are not in this together, we are actually experiencing this pandemic in a very different way. If you are rich and white or if you are black and poor. If you are rich you are living in a comfortable house with clean water and electricity, a regular income, access to a laptop and wifi. So for those around me it’s one kind of experience, loneliness yes, frustration at lack of human contact, yes, but for the majority of the population, particularly those who are in precarious employment, this is devastating. What it has revealed, this pandemic, is the deeply racialised nature of our inequality. There is\u0026nbspa wonderful saying by Warren Buffett, who I don’t particularly like, ‘When the tide goes out, you see who’s swimming naked.’ That’s what’s happened, the tide has gone out and we see who’s actually struggling and the deep inequalities that we have inherited from apartheid that haven’t been resolved.”\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspEddie, 78: “I think on the one hand I feel like I’ve had a rich, active life and quite a fulfilled one. In some ways I’ve added value to other people’s lives as a teacher, writer and an activist. On the other hand I feel the journey is not over and I haven’t quite finished my life’s project. I feel like I’m racing against time.”\u0026nbspLuli, 83: “As you get older you just adapt to the idea that there is less time, so there is more meaning. It may be the last time so you feel the good things more consciously.”• Prix Pictet was founded in 2008\u0026nbspby the Geneva-based Pictet Group, with the mandate to use photography to move beyond cliche and deliver powerful messages about sustainability to a global audience.

The company owns a total of 17 shopping centres across the UK.On Tuesday, Intu had warned that if talks with creditors broke down it was headed into administration and that it had appointed the accountancy firm KPMG to handle the process. The company’s complex finances meant the administrators would have to be paid upfront, the company said, and if it could not find the cash to do so said its malls might have to close for a short period.In a statement on Friday, the company said: “Since that update, discussions have continued with the Intu Group’s creditors in relation to the terms of standstill-based agreements.

This is likely to involve the appointment of administrators.” It promised a further announcement would be made “as soon as possible”.Any sale process will be complicated by the complex structure of the group and, if a buyer for the whole company is not forthcoming, its assets could end up being sold off separately.Intu owns nine of the top 20 shopping centres in the UK. Malls such as the Trafford Centre, Lakeside and Gateshead’s centre would probably attract potential buyers, although its smaller regional malls may prove less popular.The group, which also has two shopping centres in Spain, was struggling before the coronavirus pandemic as a result of its debt pile and the fact that some of its biggest tenants, including Debenhams, House of Fraser and Topshop, closed stores and demanded rent cuts so that they could stay in business."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2f770d026267cc8c961e53da5469a7991437b15/171_243_2228_1337/master/2228.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ee0baebd4ef2df4424c6ce2e3c7d08b5","title":"tesco sales soar as customers turn to deliveries in pandemic coronavirus","story":"Industry has changed ‘beyond imagination’ in last three months, says UK supermarketTesco sales soared during lockdown as shoppers switched to buying online, in local stores as well as returning to big weekly shops at the supermarkets.Retail profits for the year are expected to be in line with last year as the chief executive, Dave Lewis, said the cost of adapting to the coronavirus pandemic had been “very significant”, including new safety measures in stores, covering sick pay for vulnerable staff who have had to isolate at home and bringing in 47,000 new workers to help with increased demand.

Is Boris Johnson capable of following it?The colossal challenge facing human civilisation, of ending our reliance on fossil fuels in short order, has almost certainly been made harder by the pandemic. Ever since scientists discovered that the Earth was warming as a result of human activity, it has been a struggle to get people, governments and businesses to do anything about it. Even in those countries least resistant to the evidence of rapidly approaching danger, something else was usually seen as more important. In the past few months, once again, the climate emergency has been knocked off the top of world leaders’ to-do list by the more immediate threat of the virus.Recognising this, the environmental movement came up with the excellent idea of a green recovery. The annual report published on Thursday by the Committee on Climate Change, which provides official advice to the UK government, is a crucial, national component of that global effort. It sets out to tell Boris Johnson, his ministers and the British public how we can embed the lessons of Covid-19 in the next phase of carbon cuts.To what extent the overall reduction in greenhouse gas emissions can be sustained, either domestically or internationally, will depend on the policies pursued. The committee identifies post-pandemic stimulus spending on high-carbon infrastructure as a threat. Changing attitudes to public transport due to the risk of infection is another. On the other hand, the kind of transformation that will be required if we are to become a zero-carbon world has arguably been made easier by the pandemic. Once people see how fragile and interconnected we really are, pressure for rapid decarbonisation could be expected to grow.Beyond such practical indications of where action is needed, and highlighting of inconsistencies in areas from agriculture to aviation, the report makes a case for “fairness as a core principle”. This applies domestically, and requires ministers to think about the differential impact of any changes – for example to energy taxes. But it also has global implications, and entails a new way of counting emissions that includes consumption as well as production.Sound advice is one thing. The capacity to take it is another. Boris Johnson has only chaired one meeting of the cabinet committee on climate change set up last October. This fact on its own is dismal. But the opportunity remains. Next week he is expected to set out how the UK government will approach the recovery. Preparations for the postponed Cop26 climate talks are the ideal way to make this a global discussion. Can Mr Johnson show more effective leadership in the climate crisis than he has during the pandemic? For the UK in 2020 there are few more important questions."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8ebdbedd373062396943f5f241093618f8445c10/495_487_4689_2814/master/4689.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=58faed2da9aa7eff79d53f89b3a618f5","title":"uk arts sector coronavirus film television theatre design","story":"Our booming film, television, theatre and design industries can’t leap back to life if venues are bankrupt and talent has fledThe Treasury view is that paying for 9.2 million workers can’t last forever, so there’s no point in propping up businesses that won’t survive – so shake out zombies that were staggering even before the pandemic hit. If these so-called zombies employ people otherwise thrown into long-term joblessness, letting them go will be a bad mistake. But the most calamitous error is to impose a one-size-fits-all retreat from job support, where the Treasury makes no distinction between failing companies and highly profitable thriving sectors closed only by virus diktat.The performing arts, music of every kind, theatre, film studios and dance venues are dark only because they are banned. Otherwise they would leap back as one of the few genuinely “world-beating” high-earners for Treasury coffers, a tourist magnet and the heart of the nation’s cultural identity. Musicians, performers, directors, crew, designers, employees of all kinds are being sacked right now. Many are freelancers with no government support to sustain them, the industry warns.This week the Theatre Royal Plymouth announced that 100 jobs could be lost, its director talking of their “very painful but unavoidable conclusion”, as Newcastle’s Theatre Royal cast off half its staff, cancelling five months of shows.When even Cameron Mackintosh – the West End impresario of Hamilton, Mary Poppins and other blockbusters – cancels all of his moneyspinners until next year, warning he’s about to take “drastic steps” with mass layoffs, the government should take fright. When a host of stars and directors warned in a letter to the chancellor last week that theatre was “on the brink of ruin”, it wasn’t melodrama.Oxford Economics’ report warns of a “cultural catastrophe”, with 400,000 job losses and £74bn of lost earnings across the arts sector. The creative industries, including studio production and video gaming, contributed £111.7bn to the economy in 2018 – and infinitely more through the influence of soft power around the world. Hold hard to those few things where Britain really does excel, as this is the second fastest growing sector in a stagnant decade.The industry calls on Sunak to invest heavily, right now: it’s too late for some, the 11th hour for most. Oliver Dowden, the culture secretary, has made soothing noises – “I will not see our world-leading arts and culture destroyed” – but “intricate” discussions with the Treasury drag on. The Financial Times reports today that while Treasury officials met creative industry representatives any relief is “not imminent”. The industry is asking for a £1bn support package: Whitehall says any help would be “on a smaller scale”.The Theatre Royal Stratford East, made famous by Joan Littlewood, is shedding staff this week. This exceptional company specialises in erse drama drawing young black and Asian audiences from the local community. Like all regional theatres it relies on its pantomime, but dare not commission one. To stay alive until reopening, it wants to take a tiny company round local schools and perform for free in the open air – but that needs money it doesn’t have. It is now forced to cancel local apprenticeships for lighting, costume and design. Everything everywhere is in danger of being permanently lost.The industry needs the government to invest in it, to take shares and to give tax relief upfront, as well as grants. Above all, the government needs to force or to finance insurance companies to underwrite productions: to reopen and risk hiring people for a definite date is too risky without affordable insurance, in case social distancing or a sudden order to close in a new virus spike means cancellation.Calls to bring back Labour’s 2009 emergency car scrappage scheme should be heeded to save the jobs cascading out in the West Midlands and other areas, even if car-making may not look like the future. Scores more job-creating programmes are needed now to save the young in a no-vacancy market. But failure to back the arts is madness when the UK’s future is in its booming film, TV, theatre, music, gaming and design industries, only dark due to the virus. None of that can leap back to life if venues have been allowed to go bankrupt and talent has fled to seek livelihoods elsewhere."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/185f5d8db953310dfe67c12c02bb603aa52857d4/0_82_6016_3609/master/6016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=73324e3e9ce732d0ca334990b68f2a03","title":"tell us how do you feel about cinemas museums and galleries reopening","story":"We’d like to hear your thoughts about returning to cultural venues in England after the coronavirus lockdown Cinemas, museums and art galleries in England will be able to re-open on 4 July after the easing of lockdown rules.Theatres and concert halls can also open their doors again, but only to show previous works on a screen.

Nine in 10 were in favour of setting up long-term sixth-form provision for their pupils.Ellie Doyle, an associate senior leader at Mayesbrook Park school, which offers AP in Barking and Dagenham, east London, said: “Learners heard on the same day that school was shut and exams were cancelled. This was devastating.“A small minority are simply not yet ready for transition to post-16 they have had such gaps in their learning so far, and now they have lost these most important months during lockdown. They still feel so uncertain about what September holds.”Richard Cronin, the head of Everton Free school, another AP, said: “The legacy of the Covid-19 lockdown will be even more damaging for those learners who have already fallen through cracks in the school system.“These young people are at a critical point in their learning journeys which will impact on their future employment and life chances. Now more than ever there is a clear need for high quality, funded post-16 AP provision and pathways.”The Difference chief executive, Kiran Gill, said: “These are the most vulnerable children in the country – disproportionately living in extreme poverty, suffering mental health problems and at risk of exploitation.“These 16-year-olds need stability and to continue in education over the next six months, or they could be not only lost to the labour market but further caught up in criminal and sexual exploitation.”The survey was based on responses from school leaders representing 86 APs, of which 78 were state maintained, constituting a quarter of all state-maintained AP schools with provision for year 11s."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0234827557515366cc0c9b90242c1f31936d0f3b/0_357_1501_901/master/1501.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e3f42ed7270e76a42f40d9d0943bca44","title":"cloud cuckoo land how one birds epic migration stunned scientists onon aoe","story":"When Onon the common cuckoo took off from Mongolia last June no one expected him to make a 26,000km round trip to southern AfricaWhen Onon took off above the rolling hills of the Khurkh valley in Mongolia last June, researchers had no idea if they would see him alive again. Along with one oriental cuckoo and three other common cuckoos, each fitted with a tiny tracking device, he was about to embark on an epic journey to southern Africa.Last month, he was the only bird to return safely with his tracker intact.Onon has not only amazed conservationists, but gripped social media across the globe. As coronavirus lockdowns brought the world to a virtual standstill, fans followed online updates from the Mongolia Cuckoo Project, watching in awe as Onon cruised across oceans and made 27 border crossings in 16 countries.He returned on 27 May, having become a media celebrity in India, Kenya and Sweden. Back in Mongolia, he appeared on television and made newspaper headlines.Researchers are now studying data from his journey for clues about why cuckoos travel as far as they do, and how they might be affected by the climate crisis.Hewson, who worked on the project with the Wildlife Science and Conservation Center of Mongolia, admits he did not believe cuckoos were such proficient migrators. “Although they’ve got nice long wings, when they’re flying around the breeding site they look slightly ungainly compared to the other birds,” he says. In fact, cuckoos such as Onon, which migrate in search of caterpillars, their favourite food, travel remarkably fast, he adds. Using tailwinds, they can motor for more than 1,000km a day for a week.Caterpillars are most common in places that are sunny and wet and so, in summer, there are plenty in the Khurkh valley, in the south-east of the Khentii mountain range. As the weather changes they go to India for monsoon season, and then, as the wind changes, to east Africa.It’s not an easy journey. The four other birds that set off at the same time as Onon did not make it back. Their fate is unknown – their trackers may have failed or they may have died. One of them, Bayan, is thought to have died in Yunnan province, China, after flying 7,200km in just seven days from Somalia.As researchers compare the flight paths of cuckoos from across Asia, they are exploring why Onon and his peers choose such epic journeys. They could potentially winter in Asia or Australasia south of the equator, but they don’t, says Hewson. “Probably partly because the presence of a competitor species, the oriental cuckoo, makes this less profitable than it would otherwise be.” The very long journey is perhaps easier than it might appear because there’s such an abundant supply of caterpillars on route, he adds. “If you’re finding food when you get there, it’s not such a costly thing to do in terms of energy.” This raises questions over how the cuckoos might manage if global heating or other threats affect the availability of food.“If their stopover sites get lost they will be in big trouble,” says Nyambayar Batbayar, of the Wildlife Science and Conservation Center of Mongolia, who said the project had raised awareness of the need to protect key flyways and the areas where the birds rest and eat. In Mongolia, schools in Khentii province have taken part in the project, helping to name the birds and closely following their journeys.Onon, named after a local river, has also attracted lots of attention among social media users in India, said Terry Townshend, who documented the cuckoos’ journeys through the website and Twitter account Birding Beijing.Twitter followers bombarded the site with questions about the journeys: “Can the cuckoos stop on water?” (they can only pause during ocean crossings if there’s an island) and “How long do they stop for?”(anything from a few hours to a few days).Back in the lush hills and wheat fields of the Khurkh valley, Onon is getting on with life. “He has no time to waste as he needs to set up his territory, defend it from competing males and mate with as many females as possible!” the Mongolia Cuckoo Project has informed his fans.Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow bioersity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/78ede9980b8279a5f6316ff23c808d5e3bfd2e8c/0_134_5067_3039/master/5067.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=066c82f72a8ba03fb8664f5a1536bbf9","title":"from edible face masks to barettes this weeks fashion trends","story":"What’s hot and what’s not in fashion this weekThe Sea, The Sea Forget Albert Camus’ The Plague.

At one point early on, Hulej puts down her blowtorch and brushes and steps back to photograph her latest creation for Instagram, assigning the label “#guitarporn” – really, that could just as easily been a title for the whole film. It is 80 minutes of pure woodwork-musicianship-upcycling erotica for a very specialist but passionate market.If, like me, you love watching video footage of people making stuff, the you’ll probably swoon most over the bits where Hulej and her sensei Kelly saw and chisel or just talk about the objects they create: electric guitars carved from wood recovered from New York’s oldest buildings. They’ve been known to scrounge joists from burnt-down churches, reclaiming timber from the 19th century that Kelly describes as “the bones of old New York City”.Thanks to partly their craftsmanship and partly the crystallised resin in the material (impossible to replicate for guitars made from fresh-cut wood), the instruments have a uniquely beautiful tone. It also helps to hear them played by the various friends of the store who walk through the door for a jam, a natter, maybe even a purchase (this is shopping porn too). Musicians featured include Christine Bougie of Bahamas, the Fiery Furnaces’ Eleanor Friedberger, jazz greats Bill Frisell and Marc Ribot, Jamie Hince from the Kills, Lou Reed’s guitar tech Stewart Hurwood (who put on an installation in Brighton with guitars built by Kelly for Reed), Patti Smith’s guitarist Lenny Kaye, and longtime Bob Dylan collaborator Charlie Sexton.

Perhaps a moment on this scale deserved a little pause for thought. Time for the sheer disorienting size of the achievement to sink in. Time to reflect on the extreme weirdness of the circumstances in which it was achieved: 200 miles from Anfield, with none of the protagonists present.But history will not recall the fact that their first league title in 30 years was not sealed on their own turf in the Merseyside springtime, but on a baking summer’s night in west London courtesy of a Willian penalty. What it will recall is the scintillating, stupefying brilliance of Jürgen Klopp’s side from front to back. It will, just about, remember the party afterwards. Yes, it turns out a title shorn of all the usual trimmings – players on the field, a crowd in the stadium, a parade on the streets, hugs and high-fives all round – still feels just as sweet.One of English football’s almighty itches – one lasting almost a quarter of the club’s history – has been scratched. Since Kenny Dalglish’s team won Division One in 1990, the roll of honour contains 13 Manchester Uniteds, five Chelseas, four Arsenals, four Manchester Citys, a Leeds, a Blackburn and a Leicester. And now, 2019-20: Liverpool, a team that for six months have been champions-in-waiting, waiting for a rain that has finally fallen.This was a game that both embellished their achievement and explained it. What makes Liverpool’s achievement so formidable is the fact that they have had to clear a higher bar than any team before them has managed: the bar set by Pep Guardiola’s City from 2017 onwards. Yet over the course of the season City’s occasional glitches in concentration have cost them dearly, and here again they made the sort of errors that have finally seen them toppled from their plinth.It was with a certain doomed futility that at 8.15pm, the whistle blew and City’s tropical-yellow shirts set about trying to push back the hurricane with their bare hands. They had picked a near full-strength side, with Bernardo Silva slotting into a front three in the absence of Sergio Agüero, and an agreeable tempo being set by Rodri and Kevin De Bruyne in the centre. Chelsea, meanwhile, settled in for the long haul, Mason Mount and Andreas Christensen particularly effective. Resisting City is as much a test of nerve as technique: let them pin you back in your own third and it might be 10 minutes before they let you out again.Yet for all City’s possession and territory, Chelsea largely held out for half an hour, their only real chances coming from a Riyad Mahrez interception and a Fernandinho header: the first gifted by a slack Kepa Arrizabalaga clearance, the second brilliantly saved by him. Have three minutes ever encapsulated Arrizabalaga better?Meanwhile, every so often something strange would happen: Chelsea would finagle the ball up the field and fashion a decent opening. Ilkay Gündogan was forced into a desperate clearance. Ederson saved brilliantly from Christensen. That seemed to flick a switch in Chelsea: the moment they sprang from their traps, and realised the game was there for the seizing.Even so, as Antonio Rüdiger headed away a City corner on 35 minutes, little immediate danger portended itself. But as Gündogan and Benjamin Mendy casually left the ball for each other, Pulisic stole in and claimed it, galloping past Mendy and placing a low shot past Ederson. Jubilant teammates pursued him to the corner flag. “Brilliant, mate!” shouted Olivier Giroud in what appeared to be a perfect Cockney accent. On the touchline, Frank Lampard urged calm.”We go again,” he said.And they did, but so did City. Bernardo and Rodri made way for Gabriel Jesus and David Silva. Mendy, seeking instant expiation, smashed a shot into the top tier of the Shed. It took De Bruyne, with the help of a needless foul from N’Golo Kanté, to restore a little sanity to proceedings as only he knows how. There was an insouciance, even an indifference, to the way he stepped up from 25 yards and simply pinged the ball into the top corner, as if it were easier to score than miss.So, then, to the thrilling theatrical finish: a game that seemed to hollow out in the middle, as both sides realised the pointlessness of a draw. Raheem Sterling capped a brilliant counterattack by chipping against a post. Walker scraped the ball off the line after Pulisic had rounded the goalkeeper. And finally, the dramatic flourish: a goalmouth scramble ending with Fernandinho twice clearing off the line from Tammy Abraham, the second time – fatally – with his hand. A red card for Fernandinho, a fine penalty by Willian, and a party three decades in the making could finally begin in earnest."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f828348c7fe4e5f4fc059aad1ba745196176747/0_30_2970_1782/master/2970.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=159297867997752b9c604d3dbced10c9","title":"how liverpool became premier league champions","story":"This was an annihilation. From late summer into spring Klopp’s team seemed to be operating to a different set of physical laws to everyone elseNo asterisks. No caveats. And let’s face it, no contest. For the last few months a theory has been doing the rounds that the ersatz nature of the Premier League endgame, five weeks of press-ganged summerghost-ball, would drain the colour from Liverpool’s first league title in 30 years.Fat chance. Death, plague and economic collapse may have stalked the land, puncturing sport’s ability to pretend the rest of the world is simply a subplot. But sport has many functions beyond simply flag-waving and Liverpool’s success will be deeply felt at a club where, as with every other club, football has always been a bit more than just football.Not least for the players, a group of athletes who have achieved a kind of personal ultimacy in each other’s company, reaching out into the very limits of their own powers, and playing these last 18 months through a kind of fury.Make no mistake, this was an annihilation. Liverpool didn’t just outrun the rest of the field. From late summer into spring they seemed to be operating to a different set of physical laws, marching the Premier League around in a headlock, ruffling its hair, flicking its ears.The high point remains the 4-0 defeat of Leicester City on Boxing Day, one of those rare performances where each component part of a sporting machine appears to be operating with some intimate, shared knowledge of the other pieces. Either side of this there has at times been an air of double take about Liverpool’s run, of things happening that stretch credibility, that verge on some kind of sporting magic realism.Here’s a team that won 26 of 27 league games from August to 28 February that haven’t lost at home in the league in three years a group of world champions whose best player is an unfussy centre-back, whose centre-forward can’t score at home, whose most creative force is a junior right-back, who have spent £92m net on transfer fees in the last five years.This is not the standard version of annihilating success. How to explain it? Certainly, there has been a feeling that Liverpool are in some way cheating, floating above the waves, gaming the system.Which is in fact the case, albeit in plain sight. This is the culmination of a clear and deliberate process, a vision of an industry with its own historic margins of irrationality and incompetence removed.Let’s face it, at times watching English football has felt like a version of the sequence in Spinal Tap where the band perform on stage in front of an 18-inch model of Stonehenge. Tap’s manager blames this disaster on design instructions from lead guitarist Nigel Tufnel, which fatally confused inches and feet.At which point lead vocalist David St Hubbins points out, to general agreement: “But, you’re not as confused as Nigel are you? I mean, it’s not your job to be as confused as Nigel.”The point being in a dopey, daffy, largely irrational world, sometimes high-level competence can be enough. And English football has been run by Nigels, or dragged into a state of confusion by a sub-cast of Nigels for as long as you care to look back.Imagine a version where the industry norm is cut away, where a football club is run to the same standards as any other high-functioning global business, where no one is as confused as Nigel. This has been the brilliance of this Liverpool regime. Where are their idiots? And is this actually fair?In October it will be 10 years since Fenway Sports Group bought Liverpool, John Henry announcing: “We’re here to win,” from the steps of the high court as a deal was forced through. Oh yeah? Liverpool were £351m in debt. A team featuring Paul Konchesky, David N’Gog and Christian Poulsen were in the bottom three in the Premier League. Nobody knew what to do about Anfield.And yet Henry was attracted to Liverpool precisely because they were in this state. Here was a commodity bottoming out, a global brand that was all inefficiencies, all development potential. A club, an industry, a hard-won sporting heritage was ready to be money-balled.It took a while. There was still time to sign Andy Carroll and Charlie Adam, to churn through a cast of minor players, to fail to micro-manage the disastrous Luis Suárez race affair.Things have been steadily fixed. Two competent, sensible managers have been employed across eight years. A data-driven, non-emotive recruitment policy has registered more hits than misses. Players have been coached and improved rather than discarded or indulged.There has even been a disruptive element to Jürgen Klopp’s tactics. In this Liverpool team full-backs are attackers, midfielders are defenders, wingers are goalscorers, centre-forwards chase and counterpress.Physicality has also been key, another margin to be worked, a team where every player is supremely fit and strong, and where opponents have often simply dropped off, exhausted after 70 minutes.The final steps came in a rush from this powerful base. Two years ago Klopp’s Liverpool were still 25 points behind Manchester City. The current season, a title won with seven games still to play, is an achievement that will stand with any team raised in the modern era.But it also feels like a summit, something that, even now, will need regearing to sustain this level. No asterisks. No blind spots. No snags within the machine. And no standing still from here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82d35a1faea6f35352d52af98de19cee23a5510e/0_197_2917_1750/master/2917.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4da3994e1eddbdba86c4c351ed776ab6","title":"liverpool fans how does it feel to win the premier league","story":"We’d like to hear from Liverpool supporters about winning the Premier LeagueLiverpool win the Premier League title after Manchester City are beaten by Chelsea at Stamford Bridge.

A tearful Liverpool manager vowed there was more to come from his record-breaking team after Manchester City’s defeat at Chelsea returned the title to Anfield after 30 years, 58 days and a three-month interruption caused by a global pandemic.Klopp and his players gathered at Formby Hall golf club, not far from the German’s home on Merseyside, to watch Chelsea’s 2-1 win at Stamford Bridge and erupted in celebration on the final whistle. The scenes were recreated across Merseyside where, despite appeals from police, thousands of fans congregated outside Anfield and road blocks were set up around the stadium. Fireworks and car horns could be heard.“What can I say? It’s an incredible moment,” Klopp said in an interview with Sky. “I couldn’t be more proud of my coaching staff and all the people in Liverpool since we came in. It’s been a really exciting ride since the first day and it is not over yet. We watched it all together with the boys and it looks like there are still a good few more years left in their legs. It’s more than I ever dreamed of.“It is a big moment, I have no words. It is such a big moment and I’m completely overwhelmed. I never could have thought it would feel like this, I had no idea …” Klopp, filling up with tears, broke off the interview at this point with: “Sorry gentlemen, I’m sealed.”Liverpool’s captain, Jordan Henderson, was also emotional as the scale of the side’s achievement hit home. The new Premier League champions are 23 points clear of their nearest rivals and won the title with seven matches to spare, another record.“I didn’t want to talk about it until this moment,” Henderson said. “It is amazing to finally get over the line and I’m so happy for all the boys, the fans, the whole club, the city. I’m a little bit overwhelmed right now it’s an amazing feeling. I’m so proud of what we have achieved.“When we won the Champions league on the pitch there was a lot of emotion. It was a different experience watching the game tonight. When the final whistle went, being able to be with everyone – staff and everyone together – was amazing really. It is another moment in our lives we will never forget.”Henderson paid tribute to Klopp, the first Liverpool manager to win the title since Kenny Dalglish on 28 April 1990 (when Madonna was number one with Vogue), for his stunning transformation of a club that had endured several near-misses under previous regimes.The midfielder added: “After the Champions League final I said it wouldn’t be possible without the manager and it’s the same with this title. No disrespect to other managers but from day one he came in the door he changed everything, everyone followed him and believed him and so far it has been pretty special and I hope we can continue in this and stay hungry.“A lot of it you see – what you see is what you get – during his press conferences. On the sidelines he’s got a bit more of a personal side with the players. He’s so close with players, he’s got a perfect balance of that.Liverpool’s principal owner, John W Henry, paid tribute to the team’s “magnificent achievement” from Boston, where he has remained because of UK quarantine rules. “This was a season for the ages and for the faithful of Liverpool Football Club,” Henry tweeted. He added that the team’s achievements had “brought respite and joy to so many in a year filled with so much tragedy. LFC has made the beautiful game more beautiful than ever.”Klopp’s team have won the Premier League, Champions League, Club World Cup and Uefa Super Cup within 13 extraordinary months and are on course to demolish several domestic records this season, many held by City.Liverpool have won the Premier League with most games to spare, breaking the record of five held jointly by City (2017-18) and Manchester United (2000-01). They could end with a staggering 107 points, eclipsing the record of 100 set by City in 2017-18, the most victories in a Premier League season (usurping City’s 32 from 2017-18 and 2018-19), most home wins and the biggest title-winning points margin. City hold that distinction in the Premier League with 19 points in 2017-18 but the overall record of 23 belongs to Middlesbrough and West Ham when winning the second ision in 1974 and 1981 respectively.Henderson will have to wait until late July to lift the Premier League trophy and, while the ban on mass gatherings prevents a parade through Liverpool city centre, the club plan to hold a celebration with supporters when it is deemed safe.“It’s much more than I ever thought would be possible,” Klopp said. “Becoming champion with this club is absolutely incredible.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/427cb5658c79558f3c03dc060ea4d12194cc93b9/0_322_4825_2895/master/4825.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=17208955ebbd9ff9b12c692455be745e","title":"liverpool win the premier league title live reaction","story":"Pep Guardiola, ever the great sportsman, has congratulated Liverpool on their title. So did Frank Lampard, both men speaking after last night’s game at Stamford Bridge. We have video.Another paean to Liverpool? Why not. Time to revisit this evocative number from our very own Hannah Jane Parkinson.First he revived the Boston Red Sox, consigning the Curse of the Bambino to history. Now he’s ended one of the longest and most notorious title droughts in English football. That’s not a bad sporting one-two, so put your hands together for Liverpool’s principal owner John W Henry, folks! Here’s what he’s had to say on the Twitter.This was a season for the ages and for the faithful of Liverpool Football Club. It has been an incredible year of magnificent achievement culminating tonight in capturing the Premier League title.The world has watched the fierce determination of this club on the field for every single match – the preparation, the resolve and the talent of those who put together perhaps the greatest league performance ever in any country’s history.This in addition to winning a European championship, a Super Cup and a world championship -- the totality of this accomplishment has brought respite and joy to so many in a year filled with so much tragedy. LFC has made the beautiful game more beautiful than ever.It is said, “We are Liverpool.” You, the supporters are Liverpool in every sense and you continue to drive the club forward -- a historic club making history once again.In case you missed it, Jurgen Klopp got pretty emotional last night. This is such a sweet moment. You wouldn’t have him any other way. “If you do not cry while watching Klopp’s interview you are not human,” argues Chelsea fan Krish, and it’s very difficult to disagree. Especially if you’re two bottles in.In the interests of full transparency, other newspapers are freely available to read and enjoy. One of them, the Daily , carries the words of one of the heroes of Istanbul, Jamie Carragher. “It is the season of all seasons, the campaign of all campaigns,” he writes. “Klopp arrived at Anfield saying he wanted to turn doubters into believers. I was one of those who had given up hope. It gives me the greatest pleasure to admit these words now look misjudged. In my defence ... no one took me to task for the remarks at the time.”Like it or not, Chelsea repeatedly crop up on the long and winding road to Liverpool’s success, one way or another. There’s their victory last night over Manchester City. That match at Anfield in 2014. And arguably most vitally, one of their supporters, Martin Broughton, was instrumental in getting shot of these comedians. Another reminder for the kids that one should never give up on the old hope.This isn’t just about Liverpool. What about their vanquished rivals Manchester City, whose attempt to join the ranks of Huddersfield Town, Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester United as three-peat title-winners unravelled in the grand style? Jacob Steinberg has been looking into that, and here’s his verdict.Speaking of goals, here’s how Liverpool have spread them out this season:A message from Liverpool’s leading goalscorer this season ...♫ ♯ Thank you for the days, those endless days, those sacred days you gave me  I’m thinking of the days, I won’t forget a single day, believe me ♯ ♫ Less than ten years ago, this was happening. Never give up hope, kids. There’s always hope.Jordan Henderson has become the first Liverpool captain since Alan Hansen to lead his team to the championship. He’s been struggling to take it all in. Here’s what he told Liverpool’s official website:It’s hard to describe, to be honest. But after the final whistle it was just an amazing feeling, especially to spend it with all the lads and the staff.To finally get over the line is a relief but also an amazing feeling. It’s a unique feeling and one that I’m very proud of.I’ve been so honoured to be part of this football club right from the first moment that I came and to go on the journey to be with this manager, this group of players, these fans - it’s been so special.But we’ll enjoy this, we’ll celebrate, but then I know in the next few days they’ll be straight onto the next game, which is City, and finishing the season off as well as we can.We want to win every game and we want to finish off with the highest points record we can and give everything we’ve got and then we’ll go into next season and we’ll want even more.There were numerous games where I felt there were big results and big performances in certain stages of the season. But at the same time I never got carried away after a win or a performance - it was literally ‘job done, let’s pick it up next game and go again and keep doing that until we get to this point’.You never know what is going to happen in football.Liverpool have passed up some chances to win the Premier League before, of course. Think back to 1996-97, 2002-03 and last season. But none were as bitter as 2013-14. Let’s not rake over old coals, suffice to say that an old friend is very happy this morning.It was 30 years ago today ... give or take a couple of months. Here’s how the Observer reported on Liverpool’s slightly fortuitous deal-sealing victory over QPR at the business end of the 1989-90 season. Thanks to Jason Rodrigues for doing the digging. Aston Villa fans may enjoy the final paragraph, a harbinger of things to come. Player ratings. Our man on Merseyside, Andy Hunter, has run the rule over Liverpool’s first title-winning squad since the days ofNow’s as good a moment as any for some cheap triumphalism. As Mohamed Salah said the other day, it’s Liverpool’s time. So here’s a not-particularly-comprehensive list of most major trophies won by English clubs.Of course, United have 20 English titles to Liverpool’s shiny new total of 19, and as Bill Shankly was fond of saying, that’s the “bread and butter”. So it’s swings and roundabouts, depending on your allegiance  mood.And I will bid you farewell and hand over to my colleague in London, Scott Murray, with a few of the newspaper headlines Liverpool fans will be waking up to this morning (quite possibly with sore heads).CORONAVIRUS CHAOS ON THE BEACHES dominates most of the front pages, but “Kop Idols” is the headline in the Express, while the Daily Star goes for “On Klopp of the World”. “Kop Kings” is in the , while “The wait is over” appears in the Mirror. The back page of this esteemed publication goes with the headline from Barney Ronay’s excellent piece: A sporting machine at the peak of it power. Which you can read here. We’ve heard how police have warned of the Covid-19 risks associated with large gatherings such as the one seen around Anfield last night. Here are some more details of where other celebrations were going on, courtesy of Reuters:The celebrations took over the city centre, with the Cunard Building, by the Pier Head, lit up in red for the night. Elsewhere, St Luke’s Church, known locally as the bombed-out church, became a focal point for fans to congregate, let off fireworks and go through their repertoire of songs. Cars were kept out of the area by police but supporters around the city blared their horns in jubilation.The combination of flares, smoke and fans certainly made for some wonderful photographs though. Here’s a gallery with the pick of the bunch:I don’t think we’ve covered off the thoughts of these former players yet, so here they are.Luis Garcia: “... What a fantastic achievement. Congrats to all the players, staff and board member. I’m not forgetting the supporters. Enjoy the moment, it’s been a long time but finally is here!!”Fernando Torres: “... Unbelievable squad, magnificent manager, great staff but above all my sincere congrats to every single LFC supporter. You’ve been waiting so long and finally that desired trophy is yours. Very well deserved. YNWA.”Pepe Reina: “... Award more than deserved after an excellent season... 30 years later. Today I feel more than proud of having belonged to this great club.” And not a former player, but a pretty important figure, owner John Henry: “This was a season for the ages and for the faithful of Liverpool Football Club. It has been an incredible year of magnificent achievement culminating tonight in capturing the Premier League title.”This just in from my colleague, Martin Farrer, on the large numbers of fans who gathered at Anfield last night which prompted warnings from police concerned about people flouting social-distancing rules.Merseyside police Asst Chief Cons Rob Carden said the region had been “disproportionately affected” by the coronavirus pandemic and its residents had a responsibility to prevent further cases.Read the full story here:More reaction, if you can handle it, and perhaps some insight into why this team is so far ahead of others (Papa Klopp).Andy Robertson: “As a squad we’re so close. We love coming in to training every single day. If somebody is having a bad game, we dig them out of a hole and we stick together on the pitch, we stick together off the pitch – that’s why this squad is so special. I love being a part of it.“We’re all kind of brothers and we have a dad figure in the gaffer and he’s the one that leads us in the right direction. Him and his staff have been second to none, to be fair, since I’ve came here. This season they’ve been excellent to us going, keep us hungry, keep us motivated.Trent Alexander-Arnold: “Obviously things are not as we imagined probably a few months ago or even a year ago how we imagined to win the Premier League, but we are not going to complain and make a fuss of. It’s something we’ve always dreamed of. As fans I think it’s something that will always be remembered.”A “completely overwhelmed” Klopp has spoken of the countdown to the final whistle at Stamford Bridge, while watching on from afar. “In that moment it was a pure explosion... then pure... I cannot describe it. It was a really nice moment.”If this moment in history doesn’t call for peace and love from one of the Fab Four, I don’t know what does.Praise is flowing as freely as a bloated Mersey on a rainy day, and as you’d expect it’s a bit of a love-in. Several Liverpool greats have been queuing up to heap praise on Klopp’s side with Kenny Dalglish, Graeme Souness and Mark Lawrenson all acknowledging the job Klopp has done.Dalglish oversaw the club’s last triumph 30 years ago said he would never have expected to have waiting so long for another. “If you would have said that, you would have been arrested and sectioned,” Dalglish told BT Sport. “Sometimes things happen, but certainly the last two years and since Juergen has come in it’s been very positive. He’s been fantastic and epitomises everything Liverpool stand for, he appreciates and respects everyone that works at the club.“Whatever he gets he deserves. It’s not a one-off because last year they came within a point of it, this year they’ve only lost one, drawn two. They won a club world championship, they won the Champions League last year as well. Onward and upwards and I think we’ve got a lot more happy days to come as long as Jürgen’s there.”Souness told Sky: “It’s not just about this season. This is a special team. This is a team that nobody enjoys playing against... They give everything... when you combine that effort and the quality they have... they’re some team.”And Lawrenson was full of praise for Klopp in his column in the Times. “Jürgen has... embraced Liverpool’s past. After all, the past is why he came here. He knew what could be achieved and what is being achieved. It didn’t frighten him ... that the club had been without the title for so long.”You know what they say, “red sky in the morning, Liverpool won the title the night before”.More from Klopp now, courtesy of the club’s official website: the German has dedicated the victory to fans, and picked out several former players and managers. This is why he is loved by Liverpool fans, he gets the club.“The boys love being part of this club, they love being part of the story of this club and the history. It’s so nice how we learned how to deal with the history, how we learned to use the history in the last two years.”Klopp said he had made sure everyone watched the match together.“There was no alternative... we thought about it, shall we do something and then we thought maybe not compulsory, the boys have to drive a bit. Then I said, ‘no, we have to make it compulsory, everybody has to be there,’ because I’m more experienced... I know who will stay at home and watch it alone will regret it for the rest of his life.”And of course he wouldn’t forget his backroom staff, which so many past Liverpool dynasties have been built on. “Thirty years ago… 30 years ago… I was 23, so I didn’t think too much about winning a title with Liverpool, to be honest! I had no skills for that! Thirty years later I am here and because of the great staff I have, it is unbelievable.”Thanks Bryan in New York. The baton is now passed across to Sydney for continued coverage of this story, which has thoroughly global significance. For now though, let’s just enjoy some of the reaction on the streets of Liverpool, while trying to forget there’s still a pandemic raging for just a moment.Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson was at a loss for words on Thursday when prompted to express the feeling of ending the club’s three-decade hoodoo.“I could never in words describe the feeling of winning the Premier League, just like I couldn’t describe winning the Champions League,” the 30-year-old midfielder told the club’s website. “It’s a unique feeling and one that, again, I’m very proud of. I’ve been so honoured to be part of this football club right from the first moment that I came and to go on the journey to be with this manager, this group of players, these fans – it’s been so special. But we’ll enjoy this, we’ll celebrate, but then I know in the next few days they’ll be straight onto the next game, which is City, and finishing the season off as well as we can.“We want to win every game and we want to finish off with the highest points record we can and give that everything we’ve got and then we’ll go into next season and we’ll want even more. So it’s about just keeping that hunger and I’ve got no doubt that we’ve got that because we’ve proved that over the past couple of years.”Asked to describe Liverpool’s motivation to come back even stronger after last year’s historic, doomed title race with Man City, Henderson invoked the club’s hardened constitution while pointing to a future of limitless promise.“I think you can use that as a motivation and that as extra energy to keep going and to want to do it really, to want to get over the line and finish the job off,” he said. “Last season we played so well and were so unlucky, but City were amazing and they managed pip us in the end. We kept going right until the last day and that’s all we could ask for really. Obviously a few weeks later winning the Champions League helped, and then I think we’ve kicked on again and we’ve been unbelievable this season. “For now it’s about keeping on improving, keeping on doing the things we’ve been doing to get to this point but also keep improving, learning even more and if we do that then I’m pretty sure there’ll be more trophies available to us in the near future.”Thousands of Liverpool supporters descended on Anfield Road on Thursday night to revel in the club’s first top-flight title in three decades. While the celebrations were roundly peaceful, the social distancing guidelines in response to the coronavirus pandemic were in many cases all but ignored. That prompted the following statement from assistant chief constable Rob Carden of Merseyside Police early Friday morning:I would like to congratulate Liverpool FC on deservedly winning the Premier League title, and thank the thousands of Liverpool fans across Merseyside who celebrated at home, as they have for the previous games played behind closed doors.The overwhelming majority of fans have recognised the fact that now is not the time to gather together to celebrate, and chose to mark the event safely. They are a credit to this city.Unfortunately, as we have seen throughout the lockdown period, not everyone adhered to the regulations in place. Although the vast majority of celebrations were good natured, a large number of people chose to gather outside the stadium.In the days ahead, we urge supporters to do the right thing and celebrate safely with members of your household and in your social bubble. By doing this you keep yourself, your family, friends and neighbours safe.As we all know, Merseyside has been disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and we must all do what we can to prevent further cases and deaths in our communities.We understand people will feel jubilant that Liverpool has secured the league title for the first time in 30 years, and the time will come when fans can return to Anfield to applaud the team and to celebrate their achievement.Please follow the advice of the players, the manager and the club by putting safety first. The club is encouraging fans to share their experiences of watching future games at home with the hashtag #LFCAtHome on social media, and we all look forward to sharing your experiences of celebrating safely.My colleague Andy Hunter has followed up his match report with a sidebar on Liverpool manager Jürgen Klopp, who became overcome with emotion in the immediate aftermath of Thursday’s long-awaited 19th top-flight title.“It’s much more than I ever thought would be possible,” the 53-year-old said. “Becoming champion with this club is absolutely incredible.”Klopp and his players gathered at Formby Hall golf club, not far from the German’s home on Merseyside, to watch Chelsea’s 2-1 win at Stamford Bridge and erupted in celebration on the final whistle. The scenes were recreated across Merseyside where, despite appeals from police, thousands of fans congregated outside Anfield and road blocks were set up around the stadium. Fireworks and car horns could be heard.“What can I say?

It’s more than I ever dreamed of.“It is a big moment, I have no words. It is such a big moment and I’m completely overwhelmed. I never could have thought it would feel like this, I had no idea …” Klopp, filling up with tears, broke off the interview at this point with: “Sorry gentlemen, I’m sealed.”Champions of England, champions of Europe and champions of the world. The latter of which includes such far-flung locales as New Zealand, from where reader Catherine Downes writes in to say: “My husband Maciek playing the Liverpool anthem as we celebrate!”At the time, James’s piece of the team was valued at around $6.5m (£5.2). These days it’s reported to be worth at least five times that much. James, whose Lakers have sat at the top of the Western Conference for most of a NBA season that was postponed in March due to Covid-19, would be the last person to call himself a week-in-week-out Kopite. But the four-time Most Valuable Player, whom some have said is a better rebounder and passer than Michael Jordan, has been known to surface at Anfield over the years for the prestige fixtures.The sun is just going down in New York but Reds throughout the city are raging on into the night. Typically the center of the party would be the 11th Street Pub in the East Village, which is the headquarters of the Liverpool FC Supporter’s Club of NYC, in addition to the six other bars across the city LFCNY works with to accommodate overflow crowd. But the coronavirus pandemic mostly left the group’s 750-strong membership, which Wells estimates are half Americans and half expats, watching today’s match separately while keeping in touch via Zoom and WhatsApp.“Due to Covid most people watched at home, but a few of our bars with outdoor space were able to host small crowds,” LFCNY president Justin Wells tells the . “We’re planning some sort of party at 11th Street when it’s safe.”David Rose, 46, was among the Liverpool natives who took in Thursday’s long-awaited title clincher a long way from home.“We were two wins away from glory when the lockdown happened and I’d been planning on being back in Liverpool for what would surely be a homecoming parade with the trophy, which I watched as an almost annual event as a kid stood on Queen’s Drive,” Rose says. “I wanted to see that so bad. Today watching two teams that weren’t mine, on a janky monitor in my sweaty back room, on the other side of the world, and with only a Stella to keep me company ... I think it was the greatest league victory of them all. Liverpool or Brownsville, it feels like the greatest thing that could happen has happened, and a virus can’t take that away. “You see, there’s this lad from Liverpool called Trent, and he’s only gone and got himself a Premier League champion’s medal.”Liverpool’s dominant season in chart form:It’s 1am in the UK, and I suspecthope the Liverpool players are very, very drunk. I’m going to hand over to Bryan Armen Graham in the US. Thanks for your company and emails on an iconic date in English football history. In 1990, you’d have got seriously long odds on Liverpool winning their next title on 25 June 2020.You’ll all have your favourite memory of the season. There were many more spectacular moments, but I still think this second goal exemplifies the exhilarating brilliance and leadpipe cruelty of this Liverpool side.A bit more from the wiresSteven Gerrard hailed Liverpool’s “incredible achievement” in being crowned champions for the first time in the Premier League era.The Reds were handed the crown on Thursday night as Manchester City’s loss to Chelsea left them 23 points behind the leaders with seven games left to play.Among those marking the achievement was former skipper Gerrard, who won two FA Cups and a Champions League with the club but never claimed a league title.Gerrard, now manager of Rangers, wrote on Instagram: “Congratulations to all liverpoolfc on winning the premier league. Incredible achievement from a fantastic squad of top players.“Lead by a world class manager and coaching team also a special mention for the backing from FSG. And lastly and most importantly the fans who have waited 30 years. Let the party begin.”One of Gerrard’s former team-mates, Michael Owen, tweeted: “Congratulations LFC What an unbelievable season and the best team by a mile!”Liverpool’s current players were also tweeting as they watched events unfold at Stamford Bridge, as footage circulated around social media which appeared to show many of them watching the game together.Full-back Trent Alexander-Arnold wrote on Twitter: “Championssss!!!!” Midfielder James Milner wrote: “30 years Reds! Let’s enjoy it! Honoured to be part of this team \u0026amp this club” Referencing those who died in the Hillsborough disaster in 1989, defender Dejan Lovren wrote: “96 - Dream came true” And posting a screenshot from his phone showing four missed calls from Alexander-Arnold, Andy Robertson joked: “Wonder what he wants” Luis Garcia, a Champions League winner with the Reds in 2005, tweeted: “Congratulations to LFC!! What a fantastic achievement. “Congrats to all the players, staff and board member. I’m not forgetting the Supporters. Enjoy the moment, it’s been a long time but finally is here !!” Another member of that Champions League winning team, Djimi Traore, wrote: “Congratulations to LFC for winning premier league 2019-20. Well deserve trophy for klopp and his team.fantastic achievement for LFC YNWA”Former Liverpool striker John Aldridge posted a video of himself celebrating with an inflatable trophy. Aldridge, who won the league with the Reds in 1987-88, tweeted: “What a wonderful feeling for all LFC fans across the globe!Love it,Absolutely smashed the league to bits”Another past Liverpool striker, Fernando Torres, wrote: “Huge congrats to everyone at LFC on winning the premierleague. Unbelievable squad, magnificent manager, great staff but above all my sincere congrats to every single LFC supporter. You’ve been waiting so long and finally that desired trophy is yours. Very well deservedYNWA”Former Liverpool goalkeeper Pepe Reina wrote: “CHAMPIONS!! Congratulations LFC!!

To you all YNWA” From the news wiresLiverpool and Manchester City have set the benchmark for the rest of the Premier League to follow, Chelsea boss Frank Lampard said after masterminding the 2-1 win over City that handed the Reds their first league title in 30 years on Thursday.Lampard, who won three Premier League titles as a player at Chelsea, congratulated Liverpool in a news conference and said it was up to other clubs to match them and Pep Guardiola’s City.“I think for the last three seasons, themselves (Liverpool) and City have been out on their own pretty much, and that’s a lot of work,” he said.“It’s a gap that we want to try and breach, we want to move up towards - they are two of the best teams in the world. Again, credit to Liverpool for what they’ve done,” Lampard added.I’ve been thinking a lot about two people tonight, my colleagues Gregg Bakowski and Scott Murray. Two of the finer blokes and journalists you’ll ever meet, who had to put up with me luxuriating in Manchester United’s title wins of the 2000s, so it’s lovely to see Gregg’s name pop up in my inbox:This is Klopp’s title Rob. He’s made good players into incredible ones and I don’t think they would be so effective under another manager in a different system. His impact at the club has been immense. With apologies to talented people at  Towers, I’d love him to be my boss.A reminder that, though comments aren’t open on this blog, you can have your say below the line on Barney Ronay’s brilliant tribute to the champions.“Hey Rob,” says Tony Barr. “Moved to England from Glasgow in 1977 when my dad needed a job. Who else was I going to support but the new team of my boyhood hero? Things were easy and fun for many years, but Heysel and Hillsborough proved an uncomfortable background to my coming of age.  “I don’t need to tell you about the intervening 30 years, but I will say that it’s not just the fact we’ve won the league, but the manner in which it’s been done that moves me to write. The character of the manager and the team and their perfect relationship with their home city is something you can’t manufacture. Not least of all the stories that make up the success. That Andy Robertson retweet never fails to get me filling up. “I’ve got plenty to do tomorrow but I’m not done reading and watching the highlights yet.” Yeah, that’s a very good point. The background of the players is interesting, and the clubs from which they were signed: Southampton, Roma, Schalke, Newcastle, Monaco, Charlton, Hull, Hoffenheim, Lille, Stoke, Leipzig. They became superstars together. I’m no Liverpool fan but you’d have to be a bit odd not to find them thoroughly admirable.“I used to live Liverpool’s victories from the late seventies through the eighties with my brother and it defined our childhood,” says Ian Copestake. “But life brings amazing changes and I am glad this comes in a different time because it is just as sweet and I have so many other people to share it with including the best  MBMers and MBMees!”We should all meet up sometime. I’ll be on the Kerguelen Islands for the next few years if you’re passing that way.In the 13 years up to May 2019, Liverpool won only one trophy, the Carling Cup or whatever it was called in 2011-12. In the last 13 months, they’ve won the Champions League, the Super Club, the World Club Cup and now the Premier League.“Hi Rob,” says Chris Kempshall. “So I was only six years old in 1990. I understood the natureexistence of football and having watched a Liverpool game previously and been amazed by John Barnes (my hero before I understood heroes) I was a fan, but I didn’t really understand. I watched the VHS of the 8990 season to death but going through the school years as Liverpool withered away was not a great deal of fun.“Looking back on it tonight, it’s amazing just how long it all feels. We’ve had more complete collapses and rebuilds than title challenges. After the 201314 season I did genuinely wonder if it was ever going to happen. Tonight is, therefore, something I’ve basically waited my whole life for. Those 30 years did not fly by...” “Hi Rob,” says Peter Oh. “I don’t know anything about Rockstar by Dababy ft. Roddy Ricch but this is the tune that I’ll remember this day by.”Andy Hunter has a round-up of the reaction to Liverpool’s triumph, including Jurgen Klopp’s emotional interview“I was nineteen back in 1990: fresh-faced and carefree,” says Madge Stapleton. “Never did l think l’d have to wait thirty years to see success again. I have fifteen red shirts (and one yellow David James one) to remind me of the heartache and the near misses and the absolute despair at times. None of it matters now. Klopp is crying, Virg is dancing and I’m nineteen (19!) again.”And Jack Charlton’s Ireland are in the World Cup quarter-finals!Liverpool clinched the title because of Manchester City’s eighth league defeat of the season. That’s a scandal for a team of their quality, and Pep Guardiola surely won’t let it happen next season.“It’s mad how few near misses we’ve had over 30 years,” says Niall Mullen. “1990-91, when we started like a train, is often forgotten, I guess because it happened before modern football. But between losing at home to Coventry in 1997 and Andrei Arshavin scoring four in 2009 we never really got close. 2014 was a bit of an aberration, like the time the beautiful girl goes out with you for a few months before coming to her senses. It’s almost an achievement to have been out of contention for so long.” There’s a bit of a police presence at Anfield, though it doesn’t sound like they are doing much. That particular horse has long since done one.“Got the crisps,” says Ian Copestake.Here’s Barney Ronay on Liverpool’s title triumphMake no mistake, this was an annihilation. Liverpool didn’t just outrun the rest of the field. From late summer into spring they seemed to be operating to a different set of physical laws, marching the Premier League around in a headlock, ruffling its hair, flicking its ears."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b61b30d4f2544353f24d4fd17af92c945a2e3186/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=8d086610f546edafe3cb302c5e2a08e5","title":"pandemic epiphany fitness working out","story":"Ammar Kalia reflects on his transformation after years spent seeing his body as a receptacle for beer and cigarettes In this new series,  writers reflect on what they’ve learned in lockdown. Share your experience in the comment sectionEver since my gym teacher stood, arms folded, laughing at my inability as a four-year-old to tuck myself into a ball and perform a somersault, exercise has been a foreign concept.Team sports were an orgy of disappointment – of realizing I was the weak link leading us to yet another defeat – while inidual endeavors were equally dispiriting. Running made me feel like my lungs were about to explode, I never learned to ride a bike, and swimming made me realize you could sweat underwater and almost drown in the shallow end of the pool.Pre-lockdown, my body was a willing receptacle for pints of beer, cigarettes and sandwiches. My body had become this doughy thing I carried around with me. The only interaction I had with my physical self was the realization that my skin is brown - a fact that set me apart from my largely white social circle. It was something I came to define myself by.When the coronavirus pandemic hit and we were all placed in lockdown, I thought it would be business as usual hours sat at my desk, punctuated by eating, with the added bonus of working from my kitchen where my fridge was in reach. Living alone, though, the lack of human contact soon became punishingly apparent, especially when it came to seeing my best friend.Normally we would see each other at least once a week but now I didn’t know when that would happen again. For him, the outside world had become truly treacherous because he is immunocompromised. Perhaps due to his powerlessness against an invisible threat, he started exercising from home, and the results were immediately apparent. On our weekly video calls I could see him bulking up, filling the picture frame increasingly each time. Each time he would try and convince me to workout with him.Eventually I relented, mainly out of boredom. I balanced my phone on the kitchen table and we started doing pushups, sit-ups and jumping jacks over video call. It was excruciating. Those familiar feelings of exhaustion and inadequacy bubbled to the surface, telling me to quit. Yet, glancing up at the screen and seeing my friend, miles away, sweating with me and cheering me on, it was just enough to keep me going.Soon we were having video call workout sessions at least every other day. I thought I was doing a selfless act, giving him a sense of structure while he was stuck at home, yet a month into our regime I realized I was the one looking forward to the workouts. I was starting to notice myself in the mirror and not feel apathetic about what I saw – I was even enjoying the process that had gotten me there. On one particularly humid afternoon we dragged ourselves through an hour of 1,000 reps, and that familiar exhaustion became something to savor – a badge of honor rather than an aftertaste of failure.Working out had become a vital lifeline to my friend, empowering him in the face of an anxiety-inducing virus. But it had also allowed me to feel embodied for the first time in my life. Exercise had stopped being a vain activity I had condescendingly convinced myself I was above. It was an enlivening reminder of the very stuff of my existence. This brown skin had become a nice place to live in.Now, just to tackle that somersault once and for all."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b935081dddc3c77a35b4a5b5fc24c13a615722b9/546_258_5172_3103/master/5172.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ae894656b5f9567c4b131adc3781a29e","title":"with or without trickling water features a massage makes the world seem lighter","story":"In this time of uncertainty, I have missed something that pummels away pressure and works out worriesIt sounds indulgent and that’s because it is, especially in the present time of national uncertainty, but I adore a massage, and it is something I have mightily missed. I worry that they have been tainted in popular consciousness by creepy co-workers lurking over interns, or sepia memories of adverts in phone boxes promising “happy endings”, or perhaps villains in films casually issuing directives for genocide while face down wearing a towel.Really, though, is there anything better than a massage that hits the spot, or multiple spots? That kneads knots and soothes skin, pummels away pressure and works out worries?One has to learn how to be the subject of a good massage. The most important aspect is matching with a good masseur or masseuse (it is similar to finding a suitable psychotherapist). Do you want a talker and, if not, is this person someone you feel comfortable with in silence? I have a habit of filling silences out of awkwardness, even in situations where it is perfectly acceptable not to speak – and if you are filling a silence out of awkwardness, that is not relaxing. Also, will your therapist bring up truly out-there alternative medicines that verge on conspiracy theory? Again, not relaxing.Deciding on the type of massage (Swedish, sports or deep tissue?) and location (home or parlour?) is another consideration. I would never enjoy a massage in my home because I know I’d end up noticing a flaking skirting board or books wearing coats of dust. Plus a folding table would remind me of an ironing board which, again, is not relaxing.I much prefer the trickling water features and being offered tea on arrival, despite the fact that there is never time to drink it I like statues of Buddha that seem offended at their environs. My massage place is next door to my hairdresser, so I make a double trip (massage first, otherwise the oil greases up my haircut).The final thing is becoming comfortable with one’s body. I have learned not to care if I have a blemish where a bra strap has rubbed or my legs aren’t shaved, or the underwear I am wearing is practical.Massage is thousands of years old, and crosses cultures and continents, so there must be something in it. I’m no fan of its grand medicinal claims but there is also no peer-reviewed paper on why an almond Magnum makes me feel good, and I don’t question that it does. After a good massage, the world always seems lighter, as do I. I hope to feel that again someday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d3eab4723d10ba78b826c1611af7cb1b0b5aaadf/0_89_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=a1c736e5d530c3d229fb24faa448de36","title":"bbc television centre 60 years of history in pictures","story":"As the BBC’s west London complex approaches its 60th anniversary, the corporation has released a new archive of images, many previously unseen.

I was totally inspired. Jean and I had just fallen in love and we were all loved up, among all those bands and millions of people … I’d never seen a hippy in my life before – the boys and girls all looked the same! From that, I was determined to do an event of my own. I had a better site, facing Glastonbury Tor in the vale of Avalon – it was all a bit romantic.“So I phoned the Kinks and booked them for £500. My favourite band coming to the farm! It was an amazing feeling. Then there was a story in Melody Maker that said: ‘Kinks for mini-festival’. The band didn’t like that: they were No 1 across the world, why were they doing a “mini festival”? So they pulled out. I’d already sold 100 tickets, so I felt very guilty. But the same agent said his mates had got T.Rex going down to Minehead Butlins, which is on the route. They did it for the same 500 quid. So I was saved by Marc Bolan, really.”“I attracted quite a lot of trendy hippies,” Eavis says. Two of them were Arabella Churchill and Andrew Kerr, who had read John Michell’s 1969 book The New View Over Atlantis, “which had Glastonbury as the new Jerusalem – he wrote about leylines and all sorts of silly things. A lovely fellow: an Etonian, old-school British with a stiff upper lip, but also a hippy. Andrew and Arabella put the two together: Michell’s book and my farm.” They worked together on a free festival, with David Bowie, Joan Baez and more. “Arabella and Andrew ran out of money so I had to carry the can for it in the end. I was getting more and more worse off.”Eavis hosted free festivals on the farm throughout the 1970s. “The police were bringing all the waifs and strays off the side of the road and into my place as somewhere to dump them, and I didn’t seem to mind, so we had a party every year.” He started the festival up officially again in 1979. “We ran out of money and had to go to the bank to get £15,000 to see that one through,” he says. The bank now had the deeds to the farm, and it would be theirs if he kept losing money. “But I was keen to carry on.”Eavis steadied the ship by joining forces with the anti-nuclear campaigners CND, initially naming the festival after the organisation. “They picked up 300,000 posters and stuffed them into envelopes, so people suddenly knew who we were. We took the costs, CND took the balance, and they ended up with £20,000, a fortune in those days.”Eavis calls this one of his favourite years, for the performances by Jackson Browne and Van Morrison, but also for the growing scale. “Sixty thousand people turned up to that – we were looking at fives and 10s before. The CND thing helped, and I attracted a lot of people who were anti-Thatcher, so I’ve got Maggie to thank for our success in a way. We had out-of-work miners working on the security fence, from Maggie closing down the mines.”The NME’s review of Glasto 83 is wonderfully snooty – the crowd are regarded as “sun-soaking slabs of human tripe” – but even they were entranced by Mayfield: “It took one song from this wondrous man to discover the unearthed treasures of the Pyramid.” One of the most incongruous fashion choices in Glastonbury history came when Paul Weller performed with the Style Council amid mud in a bright white suit. “It seemed a bit at odds anyway, a band like us doing Glasto,” Weller tells me. “There was a post-apocalyptic fashion look, a lot of anarchists. It was just a mudbath, like something out of the first world war, and I had to resort to wellies. We felt out of our depth, so we got straight on the Pernod. By the time we went on I was completely gone. I realised I couldn’t play properly, so I put my guitar down and just sang instead. All the anarchists down the front were chucking mud, but because I was even more out of it than the audience was, I think we won them over. We played Long Hot Summer, which was really taking the piss – it was pouring down with rain – but everyone seemed to see the funny side of it, and it ended up all right. The suit was fucked up, though.”Dedicated to esoteric therapies, the healing fields opened in the mid-80s and are still going strong. In 2019, the  spoke to a couple of gong bath practitioners who had managed to see just one music performance in 15 years.Backed by the then home secretary Michael Heseltine, the police cracked down violently on travellers who organised a free festival each year at Stonehenge, in a confrontation that was later called the Battle of the Beanfield. Eavis gave the travellers refuge as they fled west. “I put them in the field next door and they ran their own thing, with their own music. And it was free, even though I was doing a paying event on my farm. You had all these lovely posh girls from Hampstead coming down, and they all ploughed off to the hippy festival next door.“I quite enjoyed the hippies’ music and they did make me laugh,” he says. “I was just a dairy farmer, but I thought of them as friends. Being a dairy farmer in Somerset, milking and calving cows, some people do get depressed and kill themselves – it’s quite a lonely life, really. So this was an excitement that I’d imported, and they came on board and added a bit of extra spice to it. I was doing the Cure, Elvis Costello and stuff – and they came up with a new dimension in their music.”Those hippies turned out to be extraordinarily creative, and have come to define Glastonbury’s aesthetic. You can see it in the flame-belching creations of Arcadia or the cyberpunk shanty town of Shangri-La, but a large part is down to Mutoid Waste Company, who kicked off in 1987 with their Carhenge installation.Named by Rolling Stone as one of the 50 greatest concerts of the past 50 years, this headline show featured just two songs: CBB and Teacher Don’t Teach Me Nonsense. But what songs. Fela delivered solos on percussion, soprano sax and organ between statesmanlike vocal addresses, all over that inimitably tripping, rolling beat.The cordiality with the crusties dissolved in spectacular fashion. “They were selling too many drugs for my liking,” Eavis says. “I got a security firm from Wolverhampton who were all judo gold medallists, and they confiscated all their drugs. It got nasty in the end.” His daughter and now co-organiser Emily Eavis tells me she remembers “people running past the window with molotov cocktails and burning telegraph poles and blowing up Land Rovers. The fact we’re still here is miraculous.”“But all those people still work for me now, you know,” Michael continues. “They’re a very clever, creative crowd – never got proper jobs – and the things they build every year are unbelievable. And they get paid now – they weren’t paid in the mid-80s. So they’re a lot happier.”Every Glastonbury-goer will find themselves suddenly agog at a daredevil circus act, and the peak for this kind of eccentric performance was the French troupe Archaos in 1990. While they weren’t allowed to do some of their more outré material involving chainsaws and motorbikes, they still wowed with high-wire and trapeze from their base high up at the apex of the Pyramid stage.This festival-friendly addition to the megalithic structures that dot this part of the west of England is technically called the Swan Circle. Its designer, Ivan McBeth, conceived it while living on the Glastonbury site in a portable geodesic dome. “As the full moon rose over King’s Hill, my inspiration arrived,” he writes. “I was to build a stone temple whose prominent stones represented the major stars of the constellation Cygnus, the Swan. I experimented with my star map. It was not possible to make a circle of stones given the positions of the stars, but an egg would fit.” Anyone visiting his ovoid temple, “consciously or unconsciously, will be irrevocably changed by their interaction with spirit. Every year tens of thousands of people – pilgrims all – enter the Swan stone circle and fly on her back through Dreamtime, and experience transformation. Yo!” To be honest, flying on a swan through Dreamtime is positively vanilla compared with some of the stuff that goes on here at 5am on Monday morning.Rave culture reached Glastonbury with this epic dance happening. “It was the first dance field, where Shangri-La is now,” remembers Underworld’s Karl Hyde. “We set up on a two-storey tower in the middle of the field surrounded by a quadraphonic Funktion-One sound system – over two nights, DJs, live musicians and visual artists jammed, only stopping at the point we got taken over by a hardcore rave crew who, thankfully, got booed off by our crowd. Eight thousand people turned up to the last night, when we collectively played for 18 hours straight. By the time they asked us back, we were headlining the Other Stage.”The hippy-heavy crowd at Glastonbury were in thrall to the Levellers: swelled by gatecrashers, this is possibly the biggest-ever Glastonbury headliner crowd, estimated at 300,000 people. “Because it’s dark, you can’t actually see the crowd,” singer Mark Chadwick later said. “Except when they put the lights up between songs, and they look like a field of ploughed potatoes.”The BBC has long had the TV rights to Glastonbury, but it was Channel 4 that first broadcast from the festival, helping it go from hippy curiosity to British cultural heavyweight. An enterprising YouTuber has uploaded VHS-taped coverage, complete with sax-backed Tampax ads.“Hello, I’m Johnny Cash.” With those words, as ever, Cash launched into Folsom Prison Blues and cemented the Glastonbury tradition for legends to play on a Sunday afternoon. “I’ve seen a lot of people who are not like me,” he said in an on-site interview. “That’s all right. Everybody’s got the God-given right to be who they wanna be.” As good a maxim for Glastonbury as any.Having recently left Take That, Robbie Williams turned up to the festival with Oasis for the year that Britpop reached its zenith. Emily had just done her GCSEs and, in typical teenager fashion, was camping out in the fields well away from her parents. “We’d never really had a pop star here before, and there was such a buzz about Oasis too. It felt like a turning point in the festival’s history we captured what was happening in the outside world, culturally and musically.”Drafted into a headline slot after the Stone Roses pulled out due to John Squire breaking his collarbone, Pulp seized their moment and became pop stars with a common touch. “If a lanky get like me can do it, you can do it too,” Jarvis Cocker told the crowd. Emily calls it “one of my real musical turning points – when you’re 15 and standing in a field and watching those bands that mean so much to you, that was Pulp for me. It was a storming, incredible set.”Thanks to what was diplomatically described as “an unfortunate operational error”, the dance tent was flooded in gallons of excrement after the machine that was meant to be sucking up excess water did exactly the opposite. In perhaps the worst year for mud and rain ever, Radiohead hoisted the audience off the soaking ground. “A moment of transcendence: when it becomes something greater than a gig in a field, and turns into something that people talk about for a long time after,” Emily says. “It had this almighty resonance. People were probably feeling a bit stranded – it was Friday night and they had two more days of these extreme conditions tents were already sliding downhill. But this band came on and spoke to them.” Their monitors stopped working, so while it sounded great in the crowd, they couldn’t hear themselves playing. “There was a deep connection with the crowd, because both sides were vulnerable,” Emily says.Guitarist Ed O’Brien recalls: “It was the biggest gig we had ever done and would ever do for years. We were in flight-or-fight mode during the show itself as the monitors weren’t working. It was so emotionally charged up on stage that night and it wasn’t until Thom asked Andi our lighting director, to switch on the lights that we were finally able to get an idea of the sheer size of it. That was the only moment of euphoria. We thought we’d blown it when we walked offstage. But something happened that night.”Just one month before the festival, Jean Eavis died of cancer, aged 60. Michael and Emily led a memorial event during the festival, where a phoenix was burned with a brass acorn inside, and an oak tree was planted where it fell. “We were in a very delicate state,” she says. “But even though it was a sad year it was a real celebration of her life. The festival was due to end in 2000, but the amount of support we had made us think we could keep it going.“In the early days of the festival, it was very unpredictable and wild – every time you walked out there might be a pagan on the doorstep who’d had some kind of brainwave. A melting pot of people, and my mum was the anchor. She even held my dad down – he needed a bit of grounding because he got overexcited, running away with things. Back in the 80s, there were a lot of drug casualties because there were a lot more dealers on site, so after welfare had gone home, my mum would look after them. There would often be people there when I got home from school – she’d be giving them sweet tea, and wrapping them up in blankets. And then parents would call and ask us if we had their children – she would drop them off back to where they needed to go.”“Bowie’s agent, John Giddings, phoned me and said David wanted to play,” Michael says. “So I said: ‘What’s he doing now, can we listen to the stuff he’s playing?’ He was doing a show in Manchester Arena, so I took the kids up. We walked into the box in the arena, and people started cheering below, and I thought: ‘My God, how do they know who we are?’ Turns out Eric Cantona was just behind me. I didn’t really like the show – it was a very experimental stage in his life and he was all over the place. We didn’t know a single song. I thought: ‘What’s the point of going with this?’ I phoned John back and said: ‘Can’t he play some songs we know?’ So he said: ‘We’ll do another show in London for you, then, of all his hits.’ And we loved it – it was so good. I told John I could afford £90,000. John said: ‘Is that all? How are we going to tell David?’ Well, that’s your job, John. And it was a done deal. The whole crowd went crazy on it – it was a wonderful show.”This was a truly feral year, with gatecrashers in record numbers. “I wasn’t prepared,” Michael says. “The fence wasn’t good enough, the security was crap. So I was hauled over the coals by the police, who said: ‘You’ve got to get someone to organise your show. You’re a nice bloke and all that, but you couldn’t arrange something in a brewery, you know the saying?’ I said: ‘Fair enough. At least I can be guaranteed to get 150,000 people at the drop of a hat – I did get the knack of that!’” He hired Reading and Leeds promoter Melvin Benn to sort the operational side. “He used to work for me in the 80s I’d trained him up, in a way. Bless his heart, he convinced the police he could make it a lot better.”“I then had their agents saying the band weren’t ready for it: ‘Can’t they go on in the middle of the afternoon?’ No, they’re headlining. I thought these people were controlling his life, saying they weren’t fit for it. And they were fit for it, and did a wonderful job. And they went from strength to strength after that.”By pairing Hunter wellies with tiny shorts, Kate Moss invents the definitive British festival look – even for men – that is still going strong today.One of the hottest, most enthusiastically queued-for experiences in Glastonbury opens, an ultra-sweaty den of drag, disco and debauchery. “I was there at 5am last year, and I had never seen scenes like this in my life,” Emily says. “An incredible club in New York full of drag queens dancing all night: can this really be happening on Worthy Farm?”Glastonbury already had a Mad-Max-on-perry vibe about it, but was massively enhanced by the arrival of Arcadia. The collective’s Afterburner installation made it debut in 2007 and gradually grew legs and became a 50-tonne spider. “Anatomically, it was very incorrect – real spiders don’t have built-in fire cannons,” its creator, Pip Rush, brother of Mutoid Waste Company’s Joe, told the  last year. In 2019, it was replaced by a fire-breathing crane rescued from Bristol’s docks.The best views, the best secret sets – the Park stage is now a much-cherished gem. “We got a licence for 15,000 more people, so we asked a farmer if we could use a bit more of his land and start a new area,” Emily says. “I wanted the Park to be really random, musically – stuff which you wouldn’t see anywhere else. It’s got its own feel.”“I’m not having hip-hop at Glastonbury. It’s wrong.” This blinkered view from Noel Gallagher teed up one of the funniest moments in Glastonbury history: Jay-Z opening his headline performance with a sarcastic version of Wonderwall. When it segued into 99 Problems and onward, the energy levels never dipped.Under a blue sky turning pink, Leonard Cohen’s Hallelujah was a beautiful moment of secular communion. He took his hat off and held it to his chest, a gesture of awed respect for a Glastonbury crowd that always does singalongs better than any other festival.Emily calls this “a very emotional end to the weekend”, and how: Damon Albarn cried as he led his reunited band into a climatic This Is a Low. “That’s what we dreamed of, that sense of commune – we’d done it,” Albarn later said.“We can get Bob Dylan, and Johnny Cash why can’t we get Neil Young?” Emily thought. “And Springsteen as well. As it happened, they both said yes the same year. Although Jay-Z helped get Springsteen, to some degree, because the festival was a talking point in the US, which it hadn’t been before.“Neil Young walked on stage and looked like he was thinking, ‘Am I going to enjoy this?’ But by the end he was really smiling. It was such an amazing gig, definitely one of our best moments. Springsteen opened with Coma Girl, which is a song Joe Strummer wrote about Glastonbury. Playing that song, it personalised the set, made it different to a stadium show and made people feel like he really understood it. The power of Bruce when he goes for it is like nothing else – we were all blown away.”“We wanted to have a bigger area for late-night entertainment,” Emily says, “instead of just dancing outside a blanket stall.” This was the south-east “naughty” corner and Shangri-La, a kind of post-apocalyptic walk-through rave-cum-art-gallery, turned it into an otherworldly destination. Emily came up with the name because “my dad always called the farm Shangri-La. He didn’t really like going on holiday, and whenever we got back he always be like: ‘Aaah, Shangri-La, the best place on Earth!’”The Park has hosted plenty of big secret gigs, from Pulp to Foals, although the biggest coup of all was an acoustic set from Thom Yorke, with Johnny Greenwood turning up to play piano on Karma Police. The festival had changed enormously in the 10 years since Eavis was hauled up in front of the police – and Benn’s contribution was no longer needed. “Melvin was a marvellous chap but he was a control freak,” Michael says, picking this out as a key, if not strictly great, moment. “We didn’t need him any more, because we knew what we were doing. It was my show, and yet he was doing all the donkey work – he didn’t like that combination and said he didn’t enjoy coming down. I said, well, can we call it a day then? He was unhappy to go – we probably did fall out. But two jockeys on a horse doesn’t really work, does it? We’re best of friends now, though.”Beyoncé’s Vegas-style revue of a set, straddling power ballads, Prince and Etta James covers, a six-song Destiny’s Child medley and a version of Kings of Leon’s Sex on Fire, saw her make sure every single person in the 100,000-strong audience was having a good time. They responded with remarkable vocal dexterity in a raucous rendition of Irreplaceable.“Kate Moss and all those fashion icons were saying: ‘You want to get U2, they want to do it,’” Michael says. “Eventually I had a phone call to my kitchen from their agent, saying the band want to play. I picked the wrong day for the weather it did rain, but they did a wonderful set. Incredibly well-mannered, that lot.”In terms of crowd-pleasing headliners, the Rolling Stones have arguably never been topped. Read Mick Jagger’s memories of the performance here. If Johnny Cash set the trend for the Sunday-afternoon slot, Dolly supercharged it. “She’s the ultimate teatime legend,” Emily says. “So many different tribes came to see her. She talked about her upbringing on a farm and how she had this love for mud, and everyone warmed to her. In person, she was lovely, warm, friendly, and my kids were completely transfixed. Everything about her oozes perfection and grace, with her voice, and accent, and songs – it was like this magical person had arrived.”“The Dalai Lama was turning 80 that year, so we asked him to come,” Emily says. “We were thinking: who could give him a birthday cake? Patti Smith. Her gig was incredible – when she tripped over and said: “I’m a fucking animal!”, the crowd’s reaction was so good. Obviously I was on stage going, who put that lead there? But the energy was so high, she got the audience into a bit of a trance. I was thinking, we’ve got to bring on a birthday cake and the Dalai Lama now ... It was quite a contrast, but it worked really well. I enjoy bringing people in who people wouldn’t necessarily expect to see and giving them platforms to speak. Like David Attenborough, or Pussy Riot when they brought a tank in.”With Dave Grohl doing a Stone Roses and breaking his leg, forcing Foo Fighters to pull out of their headline slot, Florence Welch got called up to the biggest gig of her life. By keeping it percussion-free, and backed by brass and acoustic guitar, her cover of the Foos’ Times Like These kept the Pyramid crowd in a kind of suspended animation.At 78, Paul McCartney was set to be the oldest Pyramid stage headliner ever this year, although that’s still nearly a decade off the oldest person ever to play the stage: Burt Bacharach, aged 87. “To walk on to that Pyramid stage, at the 5pm slot, had to be one of the most exhilarating and nerve-wracking moments of my life,” the now 92-year-old tells me. “Daylight, where faces of so many people just seemed to stretch to foreverland. I’m so grateful for the experience.”On an afternoon battling some of Somerset’s most stinking weather, Mary J Blige gave life back to the Pyramid audience with a performance of physical and spiritual indefatigability, screaming in defiance and doing repeated jumping squats in high heels. It is raining? We hadn’t noticed.“Adele grew up coming to the festival. She’s a proper child of Glastonbury,” Emily says, picking the moment she persuaded the singer to headline as one of her greatest festival moments. “But if she wanted to do 20 stadiums, they would sell out. Some people need a headline slot – she just didn’t need to do it, and doing Glastonbury is a challenge, because of the size, and you’re not playing to your own audience. We looked at the crowd for Kanye from the side of the stage, and it was pretty incredible. I’d gone through a lot of shit to get there, it was stressful it was probably one of the most isive sets we’ve done, but I’m really glad we did it. There was a huge turnout and this really charged atmosphere. The excitement and energy you could feel in the field climbed all over your body – that feeling when you’re in a crowd waiting for something magnificent to happen. I said: ‘Are you gonna do this next year? You’ve got to do this!’ And she said yes, and we shook on it.”There was a dumbstruck mood on the morning after the Brexit vote, though once the music started up, it seemed to be quickly swept away. More than ever, Glastonbury felt like a cocoon from reality, one that people sealed themselves inside with even more determination. (Perhaps there were more Brexiteers than you might expect, too.) But the issue was addressed head on with grace and stunning power by PJ Harvey, who read John Donne’s 1624 poem No Man Is an Island: “Every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main … any man’s death diminishes me, because I am involved in mankind.”At a snap general election earlier in the month, the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, chomped into the Tory majority and forced them into a minority government. He took his victory lap at Glastonbury, drawing a vast crowd and telling them: “The elites got it wrong – politics is about the lives of all of us.” The “Oh, Jeremy Corbyn” chant sprang up throughout, and it felt like real change was in the air. Of course, it wasn’t to be, but the feeling endures that a whole swathe of young people had a political awakening here.One of the emotional high points of last year was Kylie, who had been forced to cancel in 2005 due to her breast cancer diagnosis. She finally got her moment. Chris Martin and Nick Cave guested, but Kylie’s joy – “I’ll never get you out of my head!” she told the crowd – is what really lingers.“It was such an overwhelming experience,” she says now. “I’ve never seen that many people in my life, let alone had the honour, and nerves, of performing for them. It was sensory overload, in the best way. All of the ‘experienced’ people who had advice for me before the show, they were all right: try to enjoy, feel the love, it will feel like for ever and then be over in a minute. It was, in short, one of the best experiences of my life. To feel that I had done enough in my career to be there in that moment. Also, to have the chance again, finally, after missing my headline opportunity in 2005, made it all the more emotional and a small personal triumph.”Emily offered Stormzy the headline slot back in 2017, after he blew her away on the Other Stage. “I’d never seen a live show like that before. This guy had so much talent and energy: everything we need right now on the Pyramid stage. His agent was like, really? And we said, yeah, definitely.“The 2019 set was a universal, incredible moment. Not only was it his performance, his delivery and how he was connecting to the audience, but the production stakes were high – I’ve never seen so many BMXs at the side of the stage before. It makes it worthwhile running a festival when you can have moments like that.“I walked off to tell him this was incredible – and he had had a different experience. He couldn’t hear himself on stage. People were saying no one could go in and see him. I said: ‘I need to tell him I’ve seen all sorts of gigs at Glastonbury, but I’ve never seen anything like that please let me in, I don’t want him leaving thinking that was a disaster.’ I literally held him, and told him how fucking brilliant it was, and he had to realise that. He wasn’t angry, he was just spinning. But he watched it back, and realised, and started smiling.“Despite all the criticism you get for doing things differently, all the negative stuff from other parts of the industry saying: ‘That’s ridiculous, he’s only got one album, he’s not ready’ – you’ve just got to create moments like that, otherwise it’s pointless, the whole thing. It would dissolve. But it made Glastonbury more exciting than it’s ever been.”• Kylie interview by Laura Snapes"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88dd9de764b2d82530b028c52af1a10619425a90/212_162_3487_2093/master/3487.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=44398ad5ca3e4727e0d966e22978c577","title":"mulatu astatke black jesus experience to know without knowing review","story":"(Agogo)The Melbourne collective and 76-year-old Astatke play wedding songs, political rap and cross-continental fusionsLike many great jazz originals liberated by the idiom’s openness to all manner of borrowings and hybrids, the Ethiopian multi-instrumentalist and composer Mulatu Astatke created a new sound by unlikely alchemy – between the Latin grooves and jazz-rock wah-wah guitars he heard as a student in the States in the 60s, and the wide-interval modes and fluid rhythms of his homeland’s ancient traditions. Astatke’s seductive “Ethio-jazz” fusions have made him a global-jazz star since his rediscovery after midlife obscurity by French producer Francis Falceto in the late 1990s.Astatke’s partners since have unexpectedly included some of the UK’s most original free-jazz players, but in recent years the band best attuned to his ancient-to-modern sensibility has been Melbourne’s Black Jesus Experience, a collective of singers, rappers, and jazz improvisers of Moroccan, Zimbabwean, Maori, Ethiopian and Australian origins. On an old classic, Mulatu, the composer segues his glowing vibraphone sound into a bright trumpet theme and a floating drumskeyswah-wah groove, before MC Mr Monk’s driving political rap. Ambassa Lemdi, an Ethiopian traditional song that mesmerising vocalist Enushu Taye learned from her grandmother, is delivered by her in Amharic with tone bends and drifting lines of solemn wonderment. The headlong wedding song Kulun Mankwaleshi is rammed with more rhythm-stretching melody than its groove ought to have room for, the polemical 10-minute Living on Stolen Land is a highlight, while Astatke’s racing Mascaram Setaba has a beguiling Afrobeat bounce. The set feels like the band’s more than the veteran master’s, and the magnificent Taye’s singing balances better with the music than Mr Monk’s delivery, but To Know Without Knowing nonetheless confirms how brightly Mulatu Astatke’s Ethio-jazz vision burns on.Polish pianist Marcin Wasilewski’s imaginative trio meet US sax giant Joe Lovano on Arctic Riff (ECM), an ethereal, tonally luxurious meeting of hearts and minds including two accounts – one dreamy, one free-rhythmically restless – of the Carla Bley classic Vashkar. New York-based saxophonist Ingrid Laubrock and pianist Kris Davis commune together on Blood Moon (Intakt), on subtly sinewy originals and free improv. Brad Mehldau’s Suite: April 2020 (Nonesuch) is an unaccompanied lockdown meditation of pensive and restrainedly playful originals, and understated covers of Billy Joel, Neil Young and Jerome Kern classics.

I really wanted to make a difference.”Then Covid-19 struck, oil prices crashed, new projects were cancelled and Scotland was laid off. He is now working as a team member at the KFC restaurant in the Haudagain retail park, where he earns the minimum wage.“I earn in a week what I would have made in a day on the rig, but I can support my family and that is the main thing,” said Scotland, whose fiancee is expecting their second child in July. “I appreciate I have a job. Many don’t.”Since the start of the crisis, thousands of workers have been laid off in Aberdeen, which is the centre of the oil and gas industry in Europe. The town was already struggling to recover from a sharp fall in crude prices five years ago, as well as increasing social pressure to rein back on fossil fuels that are destabilising the climate.The pandemic looks likely to accelerate the shift towards renewable energy, but while this raises hopes for a greener future, it also throws up huge concerns about intergenerational injustice. Without government intervention, the young look set to take a double hit from the post-lockdown economic downturn and the energy transition.No age group is immune to the shift, but those closer to retirement are more likely to have a nest egg saved up from the golden era of North Sea oil.Timothy Robinson, 62, a petroleum geologist, has decided to retire early as a result of the coronavirus downturn, which he believes is likely to choke the revival of the oil industry in AberdeenIn terms of the economic fallout from Covid-19, Aberdeen is likely to be among the worst-affected cities in Britain. This is partly because it has so much to lose. The city has grown affluent thanks to its offshore expertise, which is in demand around the world. The population here are highly globalised, and many technicians and consultants fly off for several months of the year to do lucrative contract work on oil fields in Africa, South America or Asia.But a  callout to readers about the impact of coronavirus revealed a huge number of job losses that some say are barely covered in the media.Nicola Gardiner, an Aberdeen resident whose husband works in the oil and gas industry, explained how her once-prosperous home city had been affected. Chatting on wicker chairs in the spacious garden outside her traditional granite house, she said house prices had slumped, people were stuck in negative equity and there were no jobs. Efforts to ersify the local economy by attracting more tourists have been hit by delays to the £350m harbour development. Restaurants and hotels are empty.“It’s a domino effect here as ‘Aber-dream’ turns to ‘Aber-nightmare’,” she said. “There are bleak times ahead. That’s what happens when an industry is dying and a pandemic arrives.”On the seafront, seagulls circle noisily over roads and beaches that are considerably emptier than those along the coastline south of the border. A helicopter buzzes overhead, taking workers out to oil and gas platforms in the North Sea, but the number of such flights is far lower than six months ago. Andrew Duncan (not his real name) used to be a frequent passenger because he specialises in maintenance of drilling equipment. Last week he was laid off after more than five years’ employment at a major oil service company.He believes the Covid-19 crisis is being used by some firms as an excuse to accelerate restructuring plans. “I’m absolutely gutted. They went about it in an underhand, sneaky way,” he said. “I was treated as if I was just another asset, like a piece of equipment.”He asked for his name to be changed because a public complaint could undermine his chances of getting a new job in the close-knit oil town, but he is seething at his experience.He is worried about how he can provide for his wife and child. “This is just the beginning. The oil industry faces a perfect storm of lockdown, low prices and climate change,” he said. Now he is applying for jobs in the wind turbine industry and oil rig decommissioning. “That is the future,” he said. He is encouraged by the Scottish government’s plans to support workers left adrift in the shift from fossil fuels to renewables. “If they could help me with training as a wind turbine technician, that would give me an extra chance.”The Scottish government has gone further than the rest of the UK in preparing its economy and workforce for a shift to renewables. Rachel McEwen is part of the Just Transition commission, which has been advising the Scottish government on ways to shift from high-carbon to low-carbon industry with minimum social disruption. “The opportunities for injustice are endless. We must think where bad things will happen and get ahead of them,” she said.She is also chief sustainability officer in one of Scotland’s leading companies, SSE, which last month announced a £3bn investment in a new windfarm off the Angus coast, just south of Aberdeen. The 1,075MW facility will be the country’s biggest ever privately funded project. McEwen said the numbers would mean little unless there was a positive social impact. “Companies like us have pinned our whole being on finding profitable solutions to climate change. If that transition is unfair, you delegitimise it. So we have an interest in ensuring it is done in a thoughtful and just way.”The potential for wind energy is evident at the Balmedie sand dunes, a short drive outside town. Gusts off the North Sea billow through the marram grass, allow kite-surfers to soar above the breakers and spin the giant turbine blades of a windfarm that sits a short distance away from the coastline. Locals joke that these giant structures were built as close as possible to the Trump golf course to infuriate the US president. But they are part of a broader trend. Aberdeenshire is said to be the largest windfarm in Europe in terms of the number of on- and offshore turbines. This is a major reason why wind is now the cheapest form of energy in the UK and has provided a substantial portion of our electricity during lockdown.Colette Cohen, the chief executiveof the Oil and Gas Technology Centre in Aberdeen, is optimistic there will be more support for energy transition in Scotland.“From industry perspective and from government connections, I would say the only recovery is a green recovery. A lot of people have seen a better world and want a change,” she said. “It’s very exciting. It’s an amazing time to be involved in energy and technology.”Among the likely future developments are more offshore wind in the West Shetlands and the UK’s first hydrogen plant, which is expected within two years.But she warned there was likely to be a dip for between 18 months to three years, as the investment shifted direction. “That is the difficult time. That’s the worry. It is hard to see how we will navigate that effectively.”One element will be managing a generational shift: as boom-era oil workers retire and old rigs are decommissioned, opportunities for the young may be hard to find. Coronavirus has made that challenge even harder because it has shut down the service sector.This week Scotland’s advisory group of economic recovery recommended that the government provide a two-year job lifeline and training scheme for young people as part of £6bn in stimulus spending. “If we don’t intervene radically to transform our economy, inequalities will drastically widen, with long-term scarring for communities across the country and for our young people in particular,” said the chair of the group, Benny Higgins.It is a sensible step in keeping with Scotland’s more cautious – and successful – approach to dealing with the virus itself. The country, which continues with tighter lockdown restrictions than England, has fewer cases relative to its population and a faster falling rate of infections.This prudent approach of acknowledging risk and alleviating adversity may explain why even the worst-affected workers find reasons for hope. Mike Scotland said he was throwing himself full-hearted into his new job at KFC, as well as continuing work on the mental health and environmental charities he founded.“I get it when people say they are having a bad time, but that is not an excuse to give up. I am looking at this as a life lesson, a step outside my comfort zone,” he said. In the long run, he said, he believed his generation would get more opportunities because they were more familiar with technology and more open to new ideas than those who had come before them.“I think there are a lot of people who want to change and are ready to change. But others who are not ready. I guess Covid could speed it up. People have had more time to be at home and to think,” he said. “We have to expect the worst and hope for the best.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ec8e9ef84d2aacbe3922b5e7d6007d8e6adf0b2/0_214_2048_1228/master/2048.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=e2a85df2f6e14f88ec992b15177b0288","title":"uk coronavirus live visitors social distancing beaches covid 19 politics latest updates","story":"Major incident declared as crowds flocked to Dorset coast police injured breaking up unlicensed music event in west LondonLockdown restrictions will not be eased if large parties and fights at beaches continue in Wales, the first minister has warned.There were violent clashes in Wales on Thursday evening, after large crowds went to Ogmore-by-Sea, Vale of Glamorgan.Here is some footage from social media:Current travel restrictions in Wales are set to be lifted on 6 July, but Mark Drakeford said if behaviour continued his government would “not be able to continue easing restrictions”.South Wales Police said two men in their twenties had been detained following the incident at Ogmore-by-Sea at approximately 8pm on Thursday.Attacks on police officers who are breaking up illegal parties as lockdown eases have been condemned as “completely utterly unacceptable” by politan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick.She said that officers right across London were on the lookout for unlicensed music events on Thursday night, and had “closed down several before they even got going”.There was “quite a large gathering” which was shut down “very firmly and clearly” along with another event in Mitcham.The commissioner said violence broke out at a gathering in Notting Hill “where some missiles were thrown and some aggression shown to the officers which is completely utterly acceptable”.The archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, has told the Today programme that some statues in Canterbury Cathedral “will have to come down” and the names on others will have to change.All of the cathedral’s statues are going to be looked at “very carefully” to see if they all should be there, he said. Welby was asked if people should forgive the “trespasses” of people immortalised in the form of statues, rather than tearing them down.We can only do that if we’ve got justice, which means the statue needs to be put in context. Some will have to come down.Some names will have to change.I mean, the church, goodness me, you know, you just go around Canterbury Cathedral, there’s monuments everywhere, or Westminster Abbey, and we’re looking at all that, and some will have to come down.But yes, there can be forgiveness, I hope and pray as we come together, but only if there’s justice.If we change the way we behave now, and say this was then and we learned from that, and change how we’re going to be in the future, internationally, as well.Welby did seem to contradict himself somewhat, when pressed on whether he was saying statues will be torn down in the cathedral, Welby said: “No I didn’t say that. I very carefully didn’t say that.”He added that ultimately, it would not be his decision if statues came down:We’re going to be looking very carefully and putting them in context and seeing if they all should be there.The question arises. Of course it does.And it’s a good thing, but there has to be, for forgiveness, there has to be this turning round, this conversion, the Pope called it.The change of heart that says we learned from them not to be like that, and to change the way we are in the future.There are worries that beaches will fill again today, despite weather warnings for storms this afternoonLocal MP Tobias Ellwood has been speaking from Bournemouth beach this morning to BBC Breakfast and said the beach should have been closed yesterday:This place was deluged and social distancing went out the window and that’s why a major incident was declared, because the local authority and indeed the police couldn’t cope.The beach should have been closed down, or at least shut down to prevent further people from entering it.We need to learn from this and recognise that if we’re going to be serious about tackling this pandemic then we need to be swifter in being able to provide support to local authorities who are unable to cope.Ellwood asked for local authorities to be given more help to deal with incidents as lockdown measures are lifted and called for the establishment of a national situation centre that could monitor events across the country. He expressed his fears about the opening of pubs on July 4. Don’t forget on July 4 we’re going to add alcohol to this equation as well, and I would hate to see Bournemouth or any seaside resort become that place where the second spike is the first to appear.That can only be avoided if local authorities are given the necessary and swift support.That means in an emergency being able to respond to requests for help, that didn’t happen yesterday.Tesco sales have surged over the past three months, after rapidly expanding its online business amid increased demand for grocery deliveries in the face of coronavirus.Tesco said it doubled its online capacity over a five-week period to help support vulnerable customers unable to go to its stores due to the outbreak.At least 2,500 volunteers are being recruited to test the reliability of Covid-19 home-based antibody testing kits, the government has said. The Department of Health and Social Care, Public Health England (PHE) and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) are recruiting people from the NHS and other key workers to test a finger-prick blood test.We are working with Public Health England and the MHRA to recruit volunteers from the NHS and wider public service for a study exploring the potential of home-based antibody tests.No reliable home test has yet been found, and we do not know whether antibodies indicate immunity from reinfection or transmission.This research is part of our ongoing surveillance work to increase our understanding of how to tackle this virus.Volunteers will be recruited who have tested positive for the virus previously, alongside those who have tested negative.The government said it was “essential that we understand exactly how effective these home kits are when used by the public, and how easy they are to use”.A number of the rapid response kits are to be studied.There has been a strong focus on the scenes from the beaches of England, but there is plenty of condemnation of bad behaviour in Scotland too. This from my colleague Libby Brooks:The environment secretary, George Eustice, has been speaking on the BBC this morning, and has said that Britain is working on an a plan to relax its quarantine for international travellers with some countries where there is a lower risk of contracting the coronavirus. Speaking to BBC Breakfast he said:I know that Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, is giving this a lot of consideration so that the quarantine provisions that we have got in place can perhaps start to be relaxed with certain countries where the risk is low. I don’t know exactly when further information will be announced but I know that it is something the government is working on. I know it is being considered.Asked about crowds gathering on beaches or in celebration of Liverpool’s Premier League win, Eustice said: I think we have to recognise that some time ago now, well over a month, we said that in outdoor environments the risk of transmission was lower so we said that it was OK for people to go to the beach provided that they observed social distancing.Generally, people have done that.Eustice suggested the weather had a role and things could change as temperatures cool off. The minister added: We just have to recognise, yesterday was the hottest day of the year, incredibly hot, a lot of people had the same idea, they all went to the beach, and yes, of course, those scenes at Bournemouth are a matter for concern.The British weather being what it is, maybe that will be short lived and people will return to the type of social distancing they’ve actually demonstrated quite well.Dr David Nabarro, a World Health Organization Covid-19 special envoy, said it is “touch and go” that local virus outbreaks can be controlled.Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, he said: I’m pretty confident that most European countries are going to do well.We’ve seen for example in Poland, Germany, Spain, a really effective response to these kinds of resurgences but it is touch and go.So let’s hope that we are able to prevent these small clusters and little outbreaks from becoming overwhelming as we had earlier this year.Nabarro said there was “a real reluctance among some British people” to cooperate with contact tracers.When I saw the early figures I thought ‘this is a great start but there’s more to be done’. Then I’ve seen actually the numbers have stayed pretty static for the last three weeks.And if I was in charge of the contact-tracing system I would be really asking myself: why is it proving so hard to find all those who have got the disease and to get to their contacts?It does appear there is still a real reluctance among some British people to be open about their contacts and perhaps they feel it’s an intrusion into their privacy.And I say here and now when you’re trying to get rid of this virus, contact tracing is absolutely critical. It’s the only way to do it. And we have that information now from all over the world.So if you’re in any doubt please do cooperate on this contact-tracing issue because it is key to getting down to the low levels that we need for life to recover and people to go about their lives as they wish to.This story from my colleague Hannah Devlin is very much worth a (troubling) read. According to a preliminary study of patients hospitalised with Covid-19 the disease can damage the brain, causing complications such as stroke, inflammation, psychosis and dementia-like symptoms in some severe cases.Brain complications, including stroke and psychosis, have been linked to Covid-19 in a study that raises concerns about the potentially extensive impact of the disease in some patients.The study is small and based on doctors’ observations, so cannot provide a clear overall picture about the rate of such complications. However, medical experts say the findings highlight the need to investigate the possible effects of Covid-19 in the brain and studies to explore potential treatments.Here is the full story:The row over the sacking of Rebecca Long-Bailey by Labour leader Keir Starmer continues to rumble on today.You can read the whole story here:Jon Lansman, chair of the leftwing grassroots group Momentum, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that Starmer had made the wrong decision because sacking Long-Bailey had undermined party unity. He argued “factionalism promoted antisemitism” because “it led people to reach for tropes when they were angry”. Keir wanted to include the other candidates from the leadership election ... which was quite right, but what he’s now done is sacked the leading left opponent in that election.And in order to unite the party he’s got to build trust, across the party, trust from the left.That’s one of the ingredients necessary if you are going to reunite the party and from what he’s done he’s made it much harder for himself.But he did add that he thought other left-wingers in the shadow cabinet should remain, and strive for unity and conflict resolution. Yesterday, Lansman argued that Maxine Peake’s comments were not antisemitic. The Today programme also spoke to Marie van der Zyl, president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, who welcomed Starmer’s sacking of Rebecca Long-Bailey.I think it’s an awful situation and Rebecca Long-Bailey’s response was pathetic.As someone who aspired to be an education secretary she would be expected to read and understand materials – and that doesn’t make Maxine Peake’s position acceptable or not – she should be fully aware as well of what she was saying.Keir Starmer has made a very good start, we said, on tackling antisemitism in the party.We had a meeting with him only last Friday and we have made it clear that we judge what he does, what his actions are.And in this case, he’s absolutely acted decisively and has taken very swift action and it’s very reassuring to the Jewish community."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b7f395586547da441e4671d1f8081585df77940f/196_299_1869_1122/master/1869.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d967c7071d7e435751de35073a362884","title":"bluetooth or wifi a jargon free guide to connecting your audio to your smart devices","story":"Technology writer Holly Brockwell explains how to make the most of headphone-free listeningIn the streaming age, it’s easier than ever to connect up your tech so you can listen to all the best music and podcasts wherever you want, without wires trailing everywhere. If you’re one of Spotify’s 286 million monthly users, you’ve probably noticed an icon on your mobile app that looks like a computer monitor behind a speaker – that’s your portal to Spotify Connect, a super-simple way to play music on all your home tech devices, from your smart fridge to your laptop. But how does it work – and how does it stack up against other wireless streaming methods?Since 2018, Spotify Connect has been available for all users, however to be able to connect to every compatible device out there, you’ll need a Spotify Premium subscription. You can use it on your tablet, phone or computer as a kind of remote control to play what you want, where you want it – Spotify offers podcasts in addition to its extensive library of music. And unlike using a Bluetooth speaker, the music won’t stop if you receive a call.Using Spotify Connect is really easy. From the mobile app, choose something to play, then tap “devices available” underneath the song name. Next, tap the icon of a screen and a speaker, and you’ll get a list of all the Connect-compatible smart devices on your home network. You don’t have to add them, they appear automatically if they’re connected to wifi.The process on a computer is pretty similar: play something, then click the icon of a screen and a speaker in the bottom right of the app and choose your preferred device.There’s a vast range of compatible gadgets, so chances are that the device you want to play music on is on the list, but you can check here just in case.Once you’re streaming, you can use your phone or computer as normal: the audio comes directly from Spotify, not your device, so you can take calls and keep the music going. It doesn’t run your battery down, either.Moving the sound around is really straightforward: just tap a different device on the list and the music instantly continues there. This is especially handy when you’re moving rooms, or you need to switch away from the soundbar because someone wants to watch TV, for instance.And when it’s party time (after the pandemic, we might add!), use Spotify Connect to start a group session so that everyone can contribute to the playlist – another feature you can’t get with just Bluetooth or wifi. You’ll see the option to “Start a group session” at the bottom of your Spotify Connect device list, which gives you a code to share with friends so they can add their favourites.Bluetooth is an easy, near-universal wireless method of connecting one smart thing to another. That connection is called “pairing” and is usually simple to do – for instance, on many speakers, there’s a little button with the Bluetooth symbol (a stylised B that looks like a sideways pair of scissors) that you press to start sending out signals. Then, turn on Bluetooth via your phone, or whichever device you’re trying to connect to, scan for nearby Bluetooth gadgets and select your speaker from the list. The instructions vary slightly by device, so check the help files for yours if you’re stuck.Pairing is usually straightforward and only has to be done once – from then on it should work automatically. But Bluetooth does have its downsides too, the more distance there is between the music device and the speaker, the more chance there is for interference and sound drop out – something you don’t need to worry about with Spotify Connect. Thick walls can really mess up the connection too, as you’ll notice if you wander around the house with wireless headphones on.Bluetooth is the best choice for listening to music outside your home, because you can use it for portable speakers, car stereos and so on without needing to be close to a power socket or wifi router. However, it’s a real drain on the battery life of whatever device you’re streaming from.The connection can also be temperamental, varying on some devices more than others. If one of the gadgets you like to listen on often drops out, it’s worth trying a different method.Most devices that can play music, such as speakers, TVs, games consoles and even smartwatches have an app that helps you connect them to your home wifi network, and from there you can link up your streaming source.For instance, a smart speaker such as Google Home gets connected to wifi during setup, using its app. Once it’s ready, you just open the app settings and choose your preferred service for streaming music and podcasts, then start issuing voice commands – such as “OK Google, play Spotify”.The benefit of using wifi rather than Bluetooth is that you don’t have to worry about keeping your devices close together. As long as whatever’s playing the music is connected to wifi, you’re good – and you can use your phone for calls without cutting off the tunes.Spotify Connect runs on wifi, so you’ll see all these benefits, plus the added bonus that it will automatically seek out and connect with compatible devices. So if you are going to connect over wifi, it makes sense to do it via Spotify Connect.Spotify Premium gives you music without the interruptions.

The Banbury shop is an art lover’s paradise, full of watercolour brushes, lino sets, calligraphy pens and more. Upstairs there is a classroom where owner Barry Whitehouse delivers art classes for up to eight students.“My customers range from complete beginners to professional artists and my passion is to make art accessible and affordable to everyone,” says Whitehouse. “I know all my customers by name and many are retired or ‘recycled teenagers’ as I like to call them. It is wonderful to see the positive effects learning art has, such as mindfulness, confidence building and creating communities.”In January this year, The Artery celebrated its 10th year of trading and had been going from strength to strength. Forty different classes were available in the studio space at £12 each, plus there were strong sales from the shop. Whitehouse was also heavily involved in organising community events such as the Banbury art festival.But then Covid-19 hit and by late February he was seeing the effects.“Revenue dropped and so did footfall. My older students started cancelling classes due to health concerns. I needed a new business plan and fast because at that stage I didn’t even have an online shop,” he says.In March, he was forced to close his beloved shop and put his two part-time staff on furlough. Stuck at home like everyone else, Whitehouse started experimenting with streaming his classes online direct from his dining room via closed Facebook groups. The camera was trained on his easel and he offered step-by-step instructions just as he did in the real-life classes.“Those first few weeks were about getting my older students used to new technology,” he says. “For some, my classes were the only outside contact they got all week. It became a special time where they could connect and switch off from the stress of Covid-19 for a couple of hours.”Whitehouse charged a flat rate of £5 a class and by April had seven weekly classes available, covering watercolour, acrylics, drawing, and calligraphy. Initially the clientele were mostly current students but then he started to up his social media presence.He began by offering the occasional free paint-along sessions on the Artery Facebook page. To date those six sessions have now had more than 12,000 views, with his class on painting a bluebell wood in watercolour proving particularly popular. This resulted in new students signing up to his online classes from all across the UK as well as the US, South Africa, Australia and Canada.“I have gone from around 50 students pre-lockdown to several hundred now,” he says. “Some classes have 40-plus people in them. The students have created their own community by sharing their work and words of encouragement.”Whitehouse has also brought his shop online for the first time via a ShopAppy account. You can buy both art supplies and classes here. He is now sending parcels across the UK and sales are especially strong for products such as the watercolour brushes that students need for classes.“I personally deliver all local orders either on foot or in my car and often have a socially distanced chat,” says Whitehouse. “My customers love buying from a small local shop. Support from brands like Visa has been invaluable in raising awareness on shopping local and falling in love with our town centres again.”But now it’s all change again with government news that shops can reopen from 15 June. For Whitehouse though, while he will open up the shutters, it will be far from business as usual.“As the shop is so small, you can only safely have one person in there at a time. We’re opening for click and collect to begin with to keep everyone safe.”And as for the classes, Whitehouse says he will offer them face-to-face again once he is allowed, but they will also always be streamed online too.“The students see the same image and get the same instructions. It has made the classes so much more accessible, plus the recordings can be watched whenever and as many times as needed.”So an unexpected bonus of Covid-19 is that The Artery is actually busier than ever.“I always thought I’d need a bigger bricks and mortar classroom to grow my business. But the online world means my classes have opened up to so many more people across the world. They have become a crucial support lifeline,” says Whitehouse.“It is so wonderful that people are turning to creativity to help them get through this difficult period the world is currently facing and to see my small business grow at the same time has been incredibly rewarding.”Shop local.

Each hospital admission means the virus has already broken through.The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has promised the NHS will have everything it needs to tackle coronavirus, but what it really needs is an effective public health response to keep it at bay. By failing to face up to its failures, the government risks unleashing a second wave.The experiences of countries with an impressive record in controlling the pandemic, such as Germany, New Zealand and South Korea, show that even the best prepared systems can experience major flare-ups  that are difficult to control. But still the UK government has not put in place the systems to identify local outbreaks quickly and come down on them hard.A joint statement in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) signed by healthcare leaders including the presidents of 11 royal colleges and the Faculty of Public Health articulates widespread concern that England simply isn’t ready. Areas of weakness it identifies include coordination of national, regional and local bodies – such as councils and Public Health England’s regional health protection teams, the bedrock of any communicable disease response.Even after more than 50,000 deaths and a daily infection rate that still far exceeds countries such as Spain, Germany, France and Italy, the government is failing to ensure local public health teams have everything they need to keep their communities safe.There have been improvements in recent weeks. Evidence to the housing, communities and local government select committee shows councils are finally being listened to and their concerns understood.But, as the  has revealed, the government’s failure to share full details of who has caught the disease with local public health teams risks wrecking their ability to contain an outbreak.The entire edifice of the test and trace system – our bulwark against a second wave of the pandemic – begins to collapse without this vital local intelligence. If council teams don’t know where the infections are they can’t control them.This highlights the chasm between government rhetoric and its ability to deliver. A week ago, Hancock promised the Commons that data-sharing rules would not be allowed to get in the way of saving lives. No 10 adviser Dominic Cummings, meanwhile, has routinely touted his own supposed brilliance with data, writing excitedly about cognitive technologies and superforecasting. But faced with the first real-world data challenge of his reign, he has failed.Public health teams don’t need a superforecast or cutting edge AI. They just need to know where people with infections live and work and where they have been.At the heart of the government’s data operation is the new Joint Biosecurity Centre. At the beginning of June, Hancock admitted that it did not yet exist, but it is already on its second leader. It will be responsible for getting information to councils, but there is confusion about how it will work with both local government and Public Health England.One of the most baffling aspects of the government’s response to the pandemic is its obsession with setting up new structures from scratch rather than working with what they already have. It caused confusion and has wasted effort and, above all, precious time, in setting up testing centres, laboratories, supply chains and contact tracing, all orced from existing local government and NHS operations and dependent on a maze of private sector contracts. The Joint Biosecurity Centre looks set to continue this folly. It won’t be fully operational until at least the end of the summer, and it seems foolhardy to insert a new, untested body into the pandemic machinery at precisely the time when a potential increase in infections from the relaxation of restrictions and the return of schools will put the system under huge stress.Meanwhile, councils are preparing their local outbreak management plans. Trading standards, environmental health, social care and many more people besides are collaborating with the public health teams to ensure their response to any flare-ups is quick and robust. But they need the data."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c5d27169235858917188a34a2f4ebecea7612f3/0_40_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=1fb7b5b24036fe8a32078b89ee1f5026","title":"enes kanter ergodan interivew","story":"The Boston Celtics center has not backed down in his fight against the Erdoğan regime: ‘Because I talk about democracy, human rights and freedom, the Turkish government calls me a terrorist’Enes Kanter is no stranger to fighting for human rights. On 31 May, the Boston Celtics center attended a Black Lives Matter protest, where he joined demonstrators in protesting the death of George Floyd. Floyd was killed after a white Minneapolis police officer kneeled on his neck for nearly eight minutes until he suffocated. Kanter, who stands nearly 7ft tall, was seen wearing his No 11 jersey and chanting “I can’t breathe!” – Floyd’s final words – along with the protestors gathered at Boston Common near the Massachusetts State House. The NBA star later posted a video of his appearance with the caption “Be on the right side of history”, which is also a mantra for how Kanter lives his life: at time at the expense of his his own wellbeing.Over the past few years, Kanter has used his substantial platform as an international star athlete to condemn Turkey’s pivot towards authoritarianism under president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. Kanter has been an outspoken critic against Erdoğan and the deepening human rights crisis taking place under his regime. “There is no freedom of speech in that country,” Kanter told the  during a phone interview. “It’s heartbreaking.”Kanter’s interest in political activism began in 2013, the year when Erdoğan’s Justice and Development Party (AKP) was hit by a corruption scandal that led to 52 people being detained on charges such as fraud, bribery, money laundering, corruption, and gold smuggling. Erdoğan, then prime minister, blamed the scandal on an international conspiracy fronted by the Islamic community and Pennsylvania-based preacher Fethullah Gülen. The 28-year-old NBA star remained vocal in his criticisms against Erdoğan, especially following the failed 2016 coup d’état in Turkey. More than 300 people were killed in the struggle, which was followed by mass arrests with at least 40,000 people being detained, including soldiers, judges, teachers, and government workers. The extensive purge of Turkish civil service was viewed as an attempt to suppress dissent and consolidate Erdoğan’s power.As one of Erdoğan’s most vocal critics, Kanter has had to endure the wrath of the Turkish government. Authorities have targeted his entire family, raiding the family home in 2016 and shunning them from participating in civil society, all in an attempt to silence the basketball player. “The last time I saw my family was back in 2015,” Kanter said. “My dad was a genetics professor and he got fired from his job. My sister went to medical school for six years and she cannot find a job right now because of her last name. One of the saddest things is that my little brother’s dream was to be an NBA player but he literally got kicked out of every team in Turkey.”Kanter also revealed that his family was pressured to publicly disown him, and they eventually asked him to change his family name, which he refused to do. He has not spoken to his parents or siblings in years. “I can’t even remember the last time I spoke to my family,” he added.Despite the intense pressure on himself and his family, Kanter refused to be silent. The Turkish government revoked his passport in 2017, rendering him stateless, while prosecutors sought an international arrest warrant from Interpol after accusing him of being a member in a terror organization. The prosecutors cited Kanter’s ties to Gülen, whom the Turkish government blamed for the failed coup in 2016. Gülen has denied any involvement in the coup attempt.“In 2017, the Turkish government revoked my passport. It is tough, actually, because when people ask me where I am from, I have no idea what to tell them anymore. So I applied for a green card and got it. I’m actually less than a year away from becoming an American citizen.”Kanter learned about his invalidated passport after being detained at a Romanian airport on his 25th birthday. He used his social media presence to post videos calling Erdoğan a dictator and the “Hitler of our century,” which resulted in the trending hashtag #FreeEnes. When Kanter returned to the United States, he remained steadfast in his criticisms of Erdoğan, citing countless atrocities taking place in his homeland. He admitted to the  that over the years, many of his teammates have questioned his decision to embrace his role as a high-profile political activist, even going so far as to tell him to “keep your mouth shut and make your millions”. “All I am trying to do is help the people who are suffering in Turkey.” Despite the worsening political situation in Turkey, Kanter is emboldened by the support he has received from world leaders, politicians and NBA fans around the world. Kanter even cited the public pressure and attention as part of the reason why his father, Dr Mehmet Kanter, was acquitted on terrorism charges by a Turkish court last week. “Wow! I could cry … Today I found out that 7 years after arresting my dad, taking him through a Kangaroo court and accusing him of being a criminal just because he is my dad, my dad has been released,” Enes tweeted last Thursday. Much like former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who was the first player to kneel during the national anthem to protest police brutality in 2016, Kanter believes that athletes should use their platform for good and to inspire the next generation of youth who look up to them. “Our future is in our hands,” Kanter said. “Those young kids right now watching us, they’re going to be our future. If you going to talk about things that matter like democracy, freedom of speech or religion, when they grow up, they will be the same.” Kanter’s activism is not limited to Turkish politics. He sees similarities between the ongoing unrest in the United States and the human rights situation in Turkey – “Everyone is living in fear” – while his presence at the Black Lives Matter protest in Boston last month highlighted his views on global oppression beyond borders. As he told the , “I know what it is like to fight against injustice. This is not black against white. This is everybody against racism. We need to use our platforms to spread good, and to spread the truth.”Though less than a year away from becoming a US citizen, Kanter has no intention of abandoning Turkey. Instead, he plans to continue to fight to ensure that democracy is achieved in both his native land and his chosen home. “Turkey could have been the bridge between Islam and the West but because of all the stuff happening now, that is almost impossible. I love my country and I love my people. That’s why I want things to change. And just because I talk about democracy, human rights and freedom, the Turkish government calls me a terrorist.

From 26 June it will be performed to an empty auditorium and livestreamed to a paying online audience. The theatre, which does not get public subsidy, has described its financial situation as “seriously perilous”.The third stage of the roadmap is allowing “performances outdoors with an audience plus pilots for indoor performances with a limited distance audience”.Stage four is “performances allowed indoorsoutdoors (but with a limited distance audience)”.Julian Bird, chief executive of the Society of London TheatreUK Theatre, welcomed the roadmap but said “it is essential that government gives indicative ‘no earlier’ than dates for stages 3 to 5 now so that the sector can plan for the future”.With no information, theatres and producers “will have to assume a worst-case scenario and plan to be shut for long period. With the rest of the economy reopening quickly, we firmly believe that with the right safety processes in place, we can get back to full audiences in theatres within months. We now need government to confirm this.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a6f8d64d549feb4f21587e4896f1a8df9e2e1382/0_0_6439_3864/master/6439.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=35cc5ecdd571e663dfaeb1f62e8244f8 1400w","title":"us coronavirus cases count cdc","story":"New estimate from CDC indicates many without symptoms have or had the disease, senior administration officials saidUS government experts believe more than 20 million Americans could have contracted coronavirus – 10 times more than official counts, as cases are now rising in more than half of states and a new warning came of the risk of “apocalyptic” infection in major cities.The new estimated numbers from the federal agency the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) indicate that many people without symptoms have or have had the disease, senior administration officials said on Thursday.The news came as Texas, one of the most populous US states, has seen a surge in Covid-19 cases and the governor on Thursday announced that he would have to pause the next phases in what has been a rapid reopening of business. Cases are now rising in 27 US states, up from 22 earlier this week.The CDC’s new estimate that for every diagnosis of coronavirus in the US it is likely that 10 more people are or have been infected is based on serology testing used to determine the presence of antibodies that show whether an inidual has had the disease, the officials said.The officials, speaking to a small group of reporters on Wednesday night, said the estimate was based on the number of known cases, currently nearing 2.4m in the US, multiplied by the average rate of antibodies seen from the serology tests, about an average of 10 to one.“If you multiply the cases by that ratio, that’s where you get that 20 million figure,” said one official.If true, the estimate would suggest the percentage of US deaths from the disease is lower than thought. More than 122,000 Americans have died from the disease since the pandemic erupted earlier this year.The estimate comes as government officials note that many new cases are showing up in young people who do not exhibit symptoms and may not know they have it.Officials said young people with no symptoms, but who are in regular contact with vulnerable populations, should proactively get tested to make sure they do not spread it.“We have heard from Florida and Texas that roughly half of the new cases that are reporting are people under the age of 35, and many of them are asymptomatic,” one official said.The CDC has sent 40 response teams to help deal with the outbreaks, they said.More than 36,000 new cases of Covid-19 were recorded nationwide on Wednesday, just shy of the record 36,426 on 24 April, at the height of the first wave of the pandemic. The rises are concentrated on states that were spared the brunt of the initial outbreak or which moved early to lift restrictions aimed at curbing the virus’ spread.Heavily populated Florida, Texas and California have seen dramatic rises in cases this month.The state has witnessed an alarming jump in cases as communities reopen from lockdown restrictions. Los Angeles county now leads the nation with more than 88,500 cases, according to Johns Hopkins University.Numbers have shot upward in recent days, rising from 4,230 on Sunday to 7,149 by Tuesday, according to public health data. Last week Newsom announced Californians must wear masks in most public settings to curb the spread of the virusMeanwhile as of Thursday morning, Texas is pausing all additional reopening, as the state grapples with a surge of infections.“As we experience an increase in both positive Covid-19 cases and hospitalizations, we are focused on strategies that slow the spread of this virus while also allowing Texans to continue earning a paycheck to support their families,” the Republican governor, Greg Abbott, said in a statement.“The last thing we want to do as a state is go backwards and close down businesses. This temporary pause will help our state corral the spread until we can safely enter the next phase of opening our state for business.”Abbott announced earlier today that all hospitals in Harris, Travis, Bexar and Dallas counties must also stop elective surgeries, as many hospitals report their intensive care units are nearing full capacity.If the current Texas infection rate continues, Houston could become the hardest-hit city in the US, CNN reported. Infection numbers are also rising in Dallas, Austin and San Antonio, Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, told CNN.“The big metro areas seem to be rising very quickly and some of the models are on the verge of being apocalyptic,” he said.Texas officials reported yesterday that they had confirmed 5,551 new cases of coronavirus in the past 24 hours, setting a new single-day record.In contrast, New York state, previously the world’s worst coronavirus hotspot, has kept tight restrictions in place and seen its hospitalization and death rates decline steadily in recent weeks.Meanwhile officials across the US have reacted with alarm to the Trump administration’s plan to end federal support for some Covid-19 testing sites, warning it could cause further spread of a disease and calling the move “irresponsible”.The White House confirmed on Wednesday it will no longer fund 13 testing sites, including seven in Texas and sites in Illinois, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Colorado, at the end of June.Joe Biden, speaking in Pennsylvania, accused Trump of mishandling the US response to the pandemic. “He’s like a child who can’t believe this has happened to him,” Biden said on Thursday. “All his whining and self-pity. Well, this pandemic didn’t happen to him it happened to all of us. And his job isn’t to whine about it. His job is to do something about it.”Biden criticized Trump for continuing to attack the Affordable Care Act as the country grapples with this crisis. The administration, for example, is still part of a lawsuit aimed at overturning the ACA, also known as Obamacare.“If Donald Trump refuses to end his senseless crusade against health coverage, I look forward to ending it for him,” the former vice-president said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/62a1b9bbbb233188b1d8b847f008e130db6cbda8/0_0_4992_2995/master/4992.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=264f56faa2dce3c8943fe69ae0b59062","title":"running drinking water poverty us cities","story":"For many Americans across the US, water bills are becoming unaffordable. That poses a threat to health, housing and familiesWater is essential to life. Yet running water is becoming unaffordable across the US, in cities large and small. Water bills weigh heavily on many Americans as utilities hike up prices to pay for environmental clean-ups, infrastructure upgrades and climate emergency defenses to deal with floods and droughts. Federal funding for America’s ageing water system has plummeted, and as a result a growing number of households are unable to afford to pay their bills millions of homes are being disconnected or put into foreclosure every year.As we’ve seen during the coronavirus pandemic, unaffordable water poses a threat to inidual and public health, housing and families. It also poses a threat to water quality: if people can’t afford to pay their bills, utility companies can’t raise the money needed for clean-ups.“The affordability question is not a question of how high the bill is, but rather how great of a burden does the bill impose on a customer as a percentage of income,” said analyst Roger Colton, a lawyer and economist with 40 years experience working on the affordability of utilities.\u0026nbspWe considered the breadth of the problem: what percentage of residents in each income group live in neighbourhoods where the average water bill is unaffordable. And we examined depth: how unaffordable were these bills? In other words, what proportion of household income does the water bill represent? The analysis included every year from 2010 to 2018, and forecasts for 2030.Overall, bills are rising nationwide, resulting in a growing number of households facing unaffordable expenses. Inevitably this is hitting low-income residents hardest. Water bills are almost universally unaffordable for the poorest – and have been for several years. But each city is also different.Sources:  investigation Roger Colton Circle of Blue Ohio environmental protection agency US census data American Water Works Association."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ce8bd775c1daa4581679412cbc544c716662bf1/0_41_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a974ee098ad913b17eb8999de05a38fc","title":"texas oil industry layoffs shutdown economy","story":"Oil and gas producers are trying to reopen after a ‘devastating’ halt, but pessimism about an economic recovery is widespreadJeffrey Lattea finally got his first unemployment check this week, a whole month after he was laid off again. The 34-year-old resorted to government assistance to cover his bills after losing his second job in the Texas oil and gas industry just six weeks into it.“My first company laid us off to stabilize their balance sheet,” the oil worker said, matter-of-factly. “I was able to secure a temporary position with another inspection company in Pasadena with a turnaround. They started doing layoffs after the first week, so I knew it was coming – but not that fast.”Lattea is among tens of thousands of workers across Texas – America’s largest oil-producing state – who have lost their jobs since coronavirus shutdowns dried up demand. The shutdowns have led to apocalyptic headlines proclaiming that the state could lose 1 million jobs, and at least $24bn by the end of the year. Oil and gas companies have paused or curtailed production and halted capital expenditures to conserve cash leading to mass layoffs as the world shut down.In April alone, the industry shed a historic 26,300 jobs in Texas.New coronavirus cases are increasing to record numbers and the state has paused its reopening plans. But the oil and gas industry cannot afford another shutdown as it smarts from one of its worst years in decades.“The demand for diesel, aviation fuel, gasoline and propane is not going to pick up until the economy starts to grow at a healthy pace again,” said Patrick Jankowski, senior vice-president of research at Greater Houston Partnership. “We’ve reopened, but there’s a difference between opening and growing again, and now we’re just not there yet.”Another epicenter of the collapse in oil activity in Texas is Houston, often called the “energy capital of the world”. The Greater Houston Partnership tracks about 5,000 oil and gas businesses in the city, giving it more major oil jobs than anywhere else in the world. “A job in a plant manufacturing equipment like drilling rigs and pumps or valves can easily pay $100,000 a year. An office worker such as a geologist or a petroleum engineer probably earns $200,00 a year – quadruple typical compensation in Houston,” says Jankowski.Covid-19 exacerbated a crisis which had been developing from as far back as the end of 2018, when some analysts expected oil prices to rally out to $100 a barrel. The opposite happened.“Rig counts, which are potential proxy for oilfield activity, fell starting around January 2019 leading to overcapacity, and lower prices,” says Kunal Patel, a business economist with the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. In the second quarter of 2020, business activity in the sector hit its lowest level since the Dallas Fed started its survey four years ago.“There’s a lot of stress in the industry,” says Patel. “There’s been a major pullback in drilling and completing wells.” The outlook of the 168 energy firms in Texas, northern Louisiana and southern New Mexico collated in the Dallas Fed’s Energy Survey has improved but is still negative. Output has fallen for both oil and natural gas and the employment index is significantly down as firms continue to cut headcount. “We reached the bottom, and now we’re trying to climb up. It will be quite a while to get back up the hole to the pre-Covid level of activity and service pricing,” one insider says in the survey.Like Perryman, Jankowski and the energy leaders in the report, Lattea also expects a longer recovery period, so he’s preparing to pivot after 12 years in oil and gas. “I’m working on a business plan to try and increase efficiency in my industry and help these small inspection companies reduce their payroll. I can serve multiple companies and earn almost as much money as I was making before.”The oil price has rebounded to hover around $40 a barrel – high enough to cover the cost of existing wells but not yet high enough to dig new ones. In the meantime, the heart of America’s oil country considers the prospect of virus-driven economic collapse."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/31bb4a39a7f491ff17d9ad4d7179745bf28444e7/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=24bc9dbecf8c6aff4f908fd0e4fb9b79","title":"major incident declared as people flock to england south coast","story":"Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole council says services are ‘completely overstretched’ as visitors defy advice to stay awayA major incident was declared after tens of thousands of people defied pleas to stay away and descended in their droves on beaches in Bournemouth and other stretches of the Dorset coast.The local authority, BCP council – covering Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole – said it was forced to instigate a multi-agency emergency response to tackle issues ranging from overcrowding on the beaches, traffic gridlock and violence. Security guards had to be used to protect refuse collection teams.Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said on TalkRadio that he had the power to close the beaches if people did not respect social-distancing rules.He said he was “reluctant” to go down that route as “people have had a pretty tough lockdown”. But he added that if there was a spike in the number of coronavirus cases “then we will take action”.The Bournemouth East MP, Tobias Ellwood, said half a million people had flocked to the beaches and said the situation was so overwhelming that the UK government should step in to help the council deal with the crisis.He said: “A lot of people have chosen to be not just irresponsible but dangerous. We’ve made such progress tackling this pandemic. I’d hate to see Bournemouth be the one place in Britain that gets that second spike.”“The irresponsible behaviour and actions of so many people is just shocking and our services are stretched to the absolute hilt trying to keep everyone safe. We have had no choice but to declare a major incident and initiate an emergency response.“The numbers of people descending down here are like those seen on a bank holiday. We are not in a position to welcome visitors in these numbers now. Please do not come.”The council said services were left “completely overstretched” as visitors arrived in huge volumes resulting in widespread illegal parking, gridlock on roads, excessive waste, antisocial behaviour including excessive drinking and fights and prohibited overnight camping.The health secretary, Matt Hancock, threatened to close beaches if physical distancing laws were not adhered to.“We do have that power,’ he told Talk Radio. “I am reluctant to use it because people have had a pretty tough lockdown and I want everybody to be able to enjoy the sunshine.“But the key is to do it with respect for the rules – stay with your household, stay a good distance from other households.“But we do have those powers and if we see a spike in the number of cases then we will take action.”The chief medical officer for England, Prof Chris Whitty, urged people to follow physical distancing rules in the hot weather or risk causing a spike in coronavirus.He wrote on Twitter: “If we do not follow social distancing guidance then cases will rise again. Naturally people will want to enjoy the sun but we need to do so in a way that is safe for all.”Some motorists had to queue for two hours to get into Bournemouth and car parks were full by 9am on Thursday. BCP council issued 558 parking enforcement fines within a few hours – the highest ever. Families had travelled from as far afield as London and Birmingham to the beaches in Dorset.People queued for 30 minutes at ice-cream vans and refreshment stalls on the promenade as a police helicopter hovered overhead. At one point a dozen police officers and security guards stepped in as tempers briefly flared between two sets of teenagers.Phil Horton, 57, from Bournemouth, who works in the timber trade, said: “The number of people here makes me very nervous, and there’s absolutely no respect for social distancing. It seems like everyone has forgotten we are living in a pandemic.“What can the police do about it? There’s thousands and thousands of people here so they’re massively outnumbered. Good luck telling them to go home.”Rickie Inskip, a sports therapist, unfurled a banner reading: “Don’t be mean, keep the beach clean.” He used a siren and megaphone to get the attention of the beach and told them: “We love the fact you come to our beach but please don’t leave your rubbish because it was in a disgusting state last night. We urge you to keep the beach clean.”The council said refuse crews suffered abuse and intimidation as they attempted to empty overflowing bins on the seafront. Security was put in place to protect them as they collected more than 40 tonnes of rubbish.Extra police patrols were put on. Sam de Reya, Dorset police assistant chief constable, said: “These are unprecedented times and we are urging people to stay away from the area of Bournemouth beach and other Dorset beaches.“The declaration of a major incident allows us to bring agencies together so we can take actions available to us to safeguard the public as much as possible.“We are also reliant on people taking personal responsibility and strongly advise members of the public to think twice before heading to the area. Clearly we are still in a public health crisis and such a significant volume of people heading to one area places a further strain on emergency services resources.”Ellwood said it was a pity the government’s daily Covid-19 briefings had been halted as these could be a way of getting out quick, clear messages when issues like this crop up. He also said warning signs should be set up on the main roads and railway stations to warn people that the resort was already full.He said: “Bournemouth is deluged with visitors and the local authority cannot cope. We have the perfect storm of incredible weather and a liberation of some Covid-19 guidelines and given the wider consequences of a second spike, the government needs to offer assistance and respond to this dangerous event.“When you have mass demonstrations in London the politan police can call on other forces to help and I think this is what needs to happen here. The police locally are overwhelmed, they cannot be everywhere.”Stephen Allen, a resident of Sandbanks, said: “It is the illegal camping that gets us. You see people coming out of their tents in their pyjamas and head off into the sand tunes with toilet roll. It is very unpleasant.“There has been illegal parking happening all over the place. Cars have parked on cycle lanes, double yellow lines and on the pavements. They would happily take a £35 parking fine rather than queue for hours on end.”Along the Dorset coast at Lulworth, Cllr Laura Miller told of the abuse she received when she tried to turn people away. She said: “I have been shouted and sworn at and one guy spat at me.“These are people who have travelled three or four hours in their car, they are hot and grumpy and then they are turned away. Some drivers have ignored our barriers and just knocked them over and driven through.”Police officers also seized music equipment and arrested five people at Formby beach on Wednesday afternoon after young people collected on the sand dunes.Merseyside police said five people were arrested for various offences including drunk and disorderly behaviour and possession of drugs, and a speaker and music equipment were seized.Police remained at Formby beach, as well as Ainsdale and Crosby beaches, parks and beauty spots including Formby nature reserve, on foot, in vehicles and on quad bikes.Ch Insp Andy Rankine said: “While we want everyone to enjoy themselves, antisocial behaviour and criminality will not be tolerated and Merseyside police will take action where necessary.”The local authority and police in Southend-on-Sea, Essex, continued to monitor the numbers at its beach.Cllr Ian Gilbert, leader of the borough council, said: “We are aware of the situation in Bournemouth. Although we are very busy and have our own challenges to deal with including antisocial behaviour and littering, we are not currently at a stage where we need to announce a major incident. However, we are keeping everything under constant review, and liaising regularly with our partners in emergency services.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8439c431e29d773304ad1d250fff4e05c8089f92/0_33_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0c4a50e7264932ea1372f6dcca943181","title":"fourth time lucky denmark pm mette frederiksen postpones wedding third time","story":"EU summit intervenes to thwart Mette Frederiksen’s plan to marry her very patient ‘fantastic man’Denmark’s prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, thought she had finally found a date for her wedding, but has now had to postpone it for a third time due to an EU summit, she said on Thursday.Many a wedding plan has been upended by the Covid-19 pandemic and it seems not even world leaders are immune.“I am really looking forward to marrying this fantastic man,” Frederiksen wrote in a Facebook post alongside a photo of herself and her fiance, Bo Tengberg.“But obviously it can’t be that easy, and now there is a council meeting in Brussels called, exactly on that Saturday in July when we had planned to marry,” she wrote.“But I have to do my work and take care of Denmark’s interests.

While the players did not have to break sweat to become top flight champions for the first time since 1990 thanks to Manchester City’s defeat at Chelsea, the club’s supporters more than made up for it with a night marked by singing, fireworks and flag-waving. However, police expressed concern that thousands of fans had ignored social-distancing rules by descending on the club’s ground, Anfield, to celebrate en masse. Asst Chief Const Rob Carden of Merseyside police said that while most had “recognised the fact that now is not the time to gather together”, not all had done so and urged people to celebrate safely.

The huge influx of people, many of whom were not abiding by social distancing rules, prompted the local council for Bournemouth, Poole and Christchurch to declare a major incident because emergency services were “completely overstretched”. Hancock told TalkRadio that he was reluctant to take drastic action but if there was a spike in the number of coronavirus cases “then we will take action”. He also announced new “walk through” testing centres for Covid-19, although hopes for more antibody testing might be dampened by a study of results in Asia that shows they have far lower accuracy if used within the first fortnight of coronavirus symptoms rather than a week or two later. Brain complications, including stroke and psychosis, have been linked to Covid-19 in another study that raises concerns about the lasting impact on some victims.In the United States, it is estimated that 20 million people have contracted the virus – 10 times more than the official count – according to the country’s disease control agency. On Thursday, 27 states reported a rise in new cases while Texas has paused the next phase of its reopening from lockdown. The famously Covid-sceptic Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, says that although he has tested negative multiple times he may have had the disease after all. The country recorded almost 40,000 new cases yesterday. Swedes are losing confidence in their government’s handling of the crisis.

The leader’s swift move against the shadow education secretary came after she sent an approving tweet about an interview in which the actor Maxine Peake said the US police tactic of kneeling on someone’s neck was taught by the Israeli secret service. The claim was denied by Israel and Peake withdrew the claim but by then Starmer had fired the woman he defeated in the leadership ballot earlier this year, saying she had shared an antisemitic “conspiracy theory”. There were reports last night that Starmer would meet left-leaning MPs on Friday to address their concerns. The sacking reopens the party’s wounds over the issue and comes after an internal report found that “hyperfactional” hostility to former leader Jeremy Corbyn hampered the party’s efforts to tackle the problem.Met inquiry – Two politan police officers have been arrested after an “inappropriate” photograph taken at the scene of the murder of two sisters in a London park was allegedly sent to a group of people that included members of the public.

A criminal inquiry is under way into the conduct of the officers.Jenrick questions – Links to wealthy Tory donors continue to dog housing secretary Robert Jenrick after it emerged he met an Israeli businessman who had an interest in the future of a multibillion-pound project that the minister was overseeing. Whitehall records from March 2018 reveal that Jenrick, who was then exchequer secretary to the Treasury, met Idan Ofer, the ultimate owner of the mining company Cleveland Potash. Jenrick was assessing whether to offer state support for a new potash mine being built by a rival company, Sirius Minerals.London clashes – Police officers have been attacked by revellers after attempting to disperse crowds at an unlicensed music event in Notting Hill in west London. Scotland Yard said objects were thrown at officers dispersing the crowd at an event at Colville Gardens.

This season, writes Barney Ronay, Liverpool were simply operating on a different level.

Thirty new cases were reported after what premier Daniel Andrews called a “suburban testing blitz” in hotspot suburbs, involving ambulances and mobile test centres.In response to panic buying, which earlier in the pandemic saw shelves emptied of toilet paper, pasta, disinfectant and other staples, the Woolworths grocery store chain announced it would reintroduce countrywide buying limits on toilet paper.Woolworths initially brought in limits in Victoria alone on Wednesday. Customers were restricted to just two items of toilet paper, hand sanitiser, paper towel, flour, sugar, pasta, mince, long-life milk, eggs and rice. Coles, another supermarket chain, also brought in limits on buying hand sanitiser, flour, eggs, other groceries and toilet paper.Despite the spike in infections, Australia’s prime minister Scott Morrison said on Friday he would stick with plans to further ease coronavirus restrictions.“There will be outbreaks and what matters is that we continue to build our capability to deal with those outbreaks,” Morrison told a media briefing in Canberra.Meanwhile, new cases continue to surge above 30,000 a day in Brazil and the United States. Brazil confirmed 39,483 coronavirus cases on Thursday, bringing the national total to 1,228,114 known infections. The number of deaths in the country is nearing 55,000, with 54,971 fatalities confirmed.In the US, at least 27 states reported increases in the number of daily cases being recorded. Texas confirmed a record 5,996 new coronavirus cases on Thursday, just one day after beating its previous record with Wednesday’s 5,551 cases, causing Texas Republican Governor Greg Abbott to put a hold on any further steps to reopen. Abbott also reimposed a ban on elective surgeries in some areas to preserve hospital space, after the number of patients statewide more than doubled in two weeks.The US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) warned that they believe the US actually has had 10 times the number of known infections over the course of the pandemic so far, or 20 million cases. The CDC warned that there was a risk of “apocalyptic” infection in major cities.In the US, 124,355 people have died so far.

The advice comes not from doctors or nutritionists, but from a former wrestler who weighed more than any other man in the sport’s long history.“It’s never easy to stay healthy as long as you’re living the life of a sumo wrestler,” Ōrora, a retired professional wrestler, or rikishi, said in a recent interview with the Asahi Shimbun, soon after a young wrestler died after contracting coronavirus. “You are the only person that can take care of yourself. Nobody in your sumo stable cares about you.”The Russian wrestler, who now uses his “civilian” name, Anatoly Mikhakhanov, said the sumo route to gaining weight – two gargantuan meals a day separated by an afternoon nap – was putting wrestlers’ health at risk.The dangers of a lifestyle that combines intense physicality and bulk-building food intake were underlined last month when Shobushi, a wrestler in one of the lower professional ranks, died from Covid-19. Doctors who treated the 28-year-old said he had several chronic health conditions.The sumo diet staple chanko nabe – a stew packed with meat, fish and vegetables – is high in protein and low in fat. But Mikhakhanov, who retired in 2018, knows to his cost how pressure to pile on the pounds can tempt wrestlers into consuming more than the 4,000 calories they need to refuel after gruelling early-morning training sessions.Weighing an already hefty 190kg when he turned professional, Mikhakhanov saw his weight increase to 292.6kg shortly before he retired. In 2017, he became the heaviest professional rikishi ever at 288kg, beating the record previously held by the Hawaii-born Konishiki, who tipped the scales at 285kg.Mikhakhanov would routinely polish off 200 pieces of sushi and a crate of beer, and found it impossible to refuse offers of extra bowls of rice from senior stablemates. As a result, he suffered from hypertension and struggled to fight off fatigue.“I would lie down right after eating, which wasn’t good,” he told the newspaper. “Just walking or moving was really troublesome.”The 37-year-old has since swapped his two huge meals a day for five smaller meals, and regular walks and gym sessions have helped him shed more than 100kg. “Of course, you can’t train unless you eat, but there’s no point in making yourself ill,” he said.Mikhakhanov was not alone in struggling to keep his eating habits in check. “Wrestlers in the highest makuuchi ision weigh and average of 160.2kg – 15kg heavier than three decades ago, and have an average body mass index of more than 47, while medical professionals warn that a BMI of 30 or higher indicates obesity.“Some are extremely diligent about what they eat some aren’t,” says Gunning, whose weight doubled to 120kg within two years of making his debut in 2004. “The bigger and heavier you are the better you’ll be. This is not an aerobic sport. If you want to be good you have to get big, and that can come at the expense of your health.”While other intense contact sports such as rugby and American football have adopted new approaches to training and nutrition, Japan’s de facto national sport is anchored to tradition.“There is pressure on wrestlers to get bigger and stronger, but there has been no significant change in training methods or nutrition,” says Gunning, who represented Ireland three times at the sumo world championships. “They’re doing the same exercise routines, eating the same things and living the same lifestyle as 20 years ago … or 200 years ago.”The Japan Sumo Association has published 10 health guidelines that include eating fish and vegetables, in addition to meat, chewing food properly and avoiding crisps, cakes and other snacks. The association conducts regular health checks on wrestlers, but enforcing good eating habits is practically impossible among stables with contrasting attitudes towards nutrition and health.“Most wrestlers are in their late teens and early 20s in a testosterone-fuelled support. They’re fighting every day and they don’t have much freedom,” says Gunning. “The pressure builds but there’s no way to release it. Overeating relieves stress and gets you big. I did it myself.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e066c47163e66ee19067b2569ff23981add8473/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1abbb10fc0737ede5061eef515ac6ace","title":"swedes rapidly losing trust in covid 19 strategy poll finds","story":"Political parties demand Sweden’s strategy be reviewed before next election in 2022Swedes are losing trust in authorities’ handling of the coronavirus, as the man behind the country’s light-touch approach called lockdowns a form of madness and political parties demanded the Swedish strategy be reviewed before the next election in 2022.“The differences are big enough that we can say with certainty that there has been a real change,” an Ipsos analyst, Nicklas Källebring, told the paper. “The view of authorities’ capabilities has taken a clear negative turn.”Unlike most EU countries, Sweden did not try to shut society down. It closed schools for the over-16s and banned gatherings of more than 50 people, but otherwise relied on Swedes’ sense of civic responsibility to observe physical distancing and home working guidelines. Shops, restaurants and gyms remained open.Authorities argued that public health should be viewed in the broadest sense, saying the kind of strict mandatory lockdowns imposed elsewhere were both unsustainable over the long run and could have serious secondary impacts including increased unemployment and mental health problems.“It was as if the world had gone mad and everything we had discussed was forgotten,” Anders Tegnell, Sweden’s chief epidemiologist and the man behind the strategy, told a Swedish Radio podcast on Wednesday. “The case became too many, and the political pressure got too great. And then Sweden stood there somewhat alone.”But while broadly supported by most Swedes, the policy, which Tegnell has said was aimed not at achieving herd immunity but at slowing the spread of the virus enough for health services to cope, was heavily criticised by many experts as the country’s death toll increased.Sweden’s 5,230 deaths translates to a toll per million inhabitants of 511, many times higher than the corresponding totals in neighbouring Denmark (104), Finland (59) and Norway (47), all of which imposed strict confinements – but lower than the 650 registered in the UK, Spain’s 606 and Italy’s 573.Sweden has also been slow to get its testing programme off the ground, with per capita rates significantly lower than many European countries – although the number of people tested for Covid-19 nearly doubled in June, hitting 60,000 last week.As a result, many European countries now opening up to tourism have barred Swedes from entry until 30 June, while to its considerable annoyance the county’s neighbours have also excluded it from a Nordic travel bubble.Tegnell conceded earlier this month that the country has had too many deaths – particularly in care homes – from Covid-19, should have done more to curb the spread of the virus, and would “do something in between what Sweden did and what the rest of the world has done” if confronted with the disease now.But he has also insisted that “the basic strategy worked well” and “based on the knowledge we had then, we feel we made the appropriate decisions”. Löfven has said the country’s overall approach was right but it had failed to protect care homes, where half of all Sweden’s Covid-19 deaths have occurred.Under opposition pressure, Löfven in May promised a wide-ranging independent review of Sweden’s coronavirus strategy looking into specific failings such as testing and care homes, as well as the general approach and subsequent decision-making.After a meeting of party leaders, the government has now undertaken to ensure the review is completed by early 2022, partly on the grounds that any lessons should be learned fast but also to make sure there was full accountability before the next parliamentary election due in September that year.“The government did the only thing reasonable. There were several parties demanding that this must absolutely be clear before the next election,” said the Moderate party leader, Ulf Kristersson."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af4201478abe45f333400a189a57ccd7d1c5c04e/0_78_2333_1400/master/2333.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=8c1ebc4ab4d14785d5a3a127bd3acb88","title":"coronavirus live news cases rise in 27 us states as cdc estimates 20m americans may have been infected","story":"More than 20m Americans could have contracted Covid-19, as Mike Pence to hold first taskforce briefing in weeks on FridayThe French health authorities will carry out 1.3 million coronavirus tests in the Ile-de-France (greater Paris) region in an experimental scheme aimed at establishing if there are “hidden clusters”. France’s Health Minister Olivier Véran says the scheme involving residents of 30 districts who have been invited to take a diagnostic virology test, could be extended to the rest of France if it proves useful. The virology tests, as opposed to blood antibody tests,are usually done by taking a swab from the patient’s nose to check for the presence of the virus’s genetic material (RNA) and are considered extremely accurate.The aim is to test people who have no coronavirus symptoms but are in proximity to identified clusters, so may be transmitting the virus without knowing. The 1.3m people are to be sent an “invitation” to have a test at any health laboratory in the region.“The peak (of infections) of MarchApril is behind us, but we haven’t finished with the virus,” Véran said. “We have to avoid large gatherings and risky behaviour”.Véran’s comments came after the annual Fête de la Musique last weekend saw crowds in Paris drinking and dancing in close proximity without masks, causing another controversy about people’s sense of responsibility.However, more than six weeks after the strict two month lockdown ended and more than three weeks after most restrictions were lifted in the Paris area, the coronavirus figures show no sign of a surge or second wave. The number of patients admitted to hospital with the virus and in intensive care, continues to fall and the number of deaths in the previous 24 hours in French hospitals dropped to +21, bringing the total number of reported deaths from Covid-19 in France to 29,752.Indonesia reported 1,240 new coronavirus infections on Friday, taking the total number of cases to 51,427. There were 63 more deaths recorded, with total fatalities now at 2,683, said health ministry official Achmad Yurianto.The death toll from Covid-19 in Indonesia is the highest in east Asia, outside of China.Markets showed signs of optimism on Friday, with European shares opening higher and oil prices rising despite a record number of new Covid-19 infections in the United States. They rose across the US by at least 39,818 on Thursday, the largest one-day increase of the pandemic. The governor of Texas temporarily stopped the state’s reopening on Thursday as infections and hospitalisations surged. “Even though we continue to see some pretty scary virus numbers coming out of the U.S., it’s not really dented sentiment * not to any sustained degree at least,” said Timothy Graf, head of EMEA macro strategy at State Street Global Advisors. Graf said that recent temporary downward corrections of market optimism have had very little follow-through. The possibility of a second coronavirus wave and renewed lockdowns has limited market impact because if lockdown measures resume then markets expect this to raise the likelihood of more fiscal support for economies. “There is a disconnect between what you feel should be the case looking at virus numbers and equities and riskier currencies holding up relatively well and volatility receding, but at the same time we’ve never seen a policy response like this, not in the last 80 years at least,” Graf said. Having risen between 0500 and 0700 GMT, the dollar fell in early London trading to 97.317 against a basket of currencies by 0745 GMT. Vietnam warned Friday the virus pandemic had swept away years of economic gains as south-east Asian leaders met online for a summit also dominated by anxiety over Beijing’s moves in the flashpoint South China Sea.The chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) also wants to use the summit to inject momentum into talks on a sprawling China-backed trade pact. The immediate focus for the 10-member bloc is the crippling cost of the coronavirus, which has ravaged the economies of tourism and export-reliant countries such as Thailand and Vietnam.“It has swept away the successes of recent years ... threatening the lives of millions of people,” Vietnam’s prime minister, Nguyễn Xuân Phúc, said in a sobering opening address.Hello everyone.

The country’s coronavirus response centre said 176 people died of the virus in the last 24 hours, bringing the death toll to 8,781.British shopping centre firm Intu, whose properties have been ravaged by the coronavirus lockdown, warned on Friday it was likely to collapse after talks failed to restructure its finances.Intu, which owns shopping malls including Centre and the Trafford Centre in northern England and Lakeside in the south-east, had been seeking to progress talks with creditors ahead of a midnight deadline.Shopping centres were forced to close for three months after the government imposed a nationwide lockdown on 23 March in a bid to halt the Covid-19 outbreak. Restrictions began to be eased this month.In a statement on Friday, Intu announced that “insufficient alignment and agreement has been achieved” with its creditors.“The board is therefore considering the position of Intu with a view to protecting the interests of its stakeholders,” it added.Activity tracker maker Fitbit Inc said on Friday that young adults in the US are lagging behind older age groups in returning to the same number of steps as before the coronavirus outbreak. Women and men under 29 years old took fewer steps in June than the same period a year ago, according to data aggregated from Fitbit users, as the novel coronavirus prompted people to stay at home. People over 30 years old were closer to last year’s levels, and women ages 50 years old to 64 years old even took more steps in mid-June than a year ago. Officials in some states have expressed concern this week that the reopening of restaurants, bars and other businesses could draw young adults, in particular, from their homes and lead to infections among a group so far less affected by the virus. Many infected young people do not exhibit symptoms but may be transmitters. Total sales surged to $16.6bn (£13.4bn) in the company’s first quarter – the 13 weeks to the end of May – compared with a year earlier, the nation’s biggest retailer said in a trading update.The bumper performance came after the government imposed a lockdown on 23 March in a bid to halt the Covid-19 outbreak. Restrictions began to be eased this month.Britain is working on an a plan to relax its quarantine for international travellers with some countries where there is a lower risk of contracting the novel coronavirus, environment secretary George Eustice said on Friday. “I know that Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, is giving this a lot of consideration so that the quarantine provisions that we have got in place can perhaps start to be relaxed with certain countries where the risk is low,” he told BBC TV. “I don’t know exactly when further information will be announced but I know that it is something the government is working on,” he said. “I know it is being considered.”Facing ruin as orders from Western brands collapsed in the coronavirus pandemic, many Bangladeshi garment factories have been given a lifeline with orders to make protective masks, gloves and gowns for export.Nonetheless, hundreds of thousands of workers who used to work in export-oriented apparel factories in the South Asian country remain jobless despite the new orders and some recovery in Western markets.At factories in the industrial town of Savar just north of Dhaka, thousands of workers are now working eight-hour shifts, six days a week, making personal protective equipment (PPE).On the factory floor, sewing machines operated by hundreds of workers whirled loudly beside huge stacks of white and light-blue gowns.“We saw the opportunity in February and immediately we switched to PPE manufacturing,” said Syed Naved Husain, chief executive of Beximco, a major supplier to the owners of brands like Zara, Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger.Beximco last month exported 6.5 million medical gowns to US brand Hanes and it expects to export some $250 million worth of protective gear this year.“Now some 60 percent of our 40,000 workers are engaged in PPE making,” he told AFP. “Coronavirus has changed the world.”Sumaiya Akter and Rubel Miah, who lost their jobs making apparel for Western retailers, were among the workers making final amendments to the robes.“I feel lucky for getting work in this factory while many others lost jobs and are now facing difficulties,” 34-year-old mother Akhter told AFP.“At least I can feed my family and parents.”Japan’s Covid-19 contact-tracing app has been downloaded more than 4 million times since its launch a week ago as the government seeks to head off a second wave of infections now that businesses and schools have reopened. Health ministry official Yasuyuki Sahara said while there was no target number for downloads, “we want to make as many people as possible to use this app”. Japan lifted a state of emergency in late May. It has weathered the epidemic better than most developed countries, with almost 18,000 infections and 969 deaths. The app, named COCOA for Contact-Confirming Application, was designed by Microsoft Corp and is available for Apple Inc’s iPhone and devices using Google’s Android software. It uses Bluetooth signals to detect contact with nearby users lasting 15 minutes or more. If a user later tests positive for the virus, their contacts can be traced and notified through the programme. Numerous countries have rolled out contact-tracing apps, including Australia, Malaysia, Britain, India, Germany and Italy. Singapore was among the first with its TraceTogether app launched in March, but privacy concerns hampered its uptake, prompting a switch to wearable devices. The new coronavirus, which was first detected in China in late 2019, has infected more than 9.62 million people globally and 488,467* have died, according to a Reuters tally.Some of the headlines this morning:A preliminary study of 125 patients hospitalised with COVID-19 across the United Kingdom has found the disease can damage the brain, causing complications such as stroke, inflammation, psychosis and dementia-like symptoms in some severe cases. The findings, published in the Lancet Psychiatry journal on Thursday, are the first detailed look at a range of neurological complications of COVID-19, the researchers said, and underline a need for larger studies to find the mechanisms behind them and assist the search for treatments. The most common brain complication seen was stroke, which was reported in 77 of 125 patients. Of these, most were in patients over 60, and most were caused by a blood clot in the brain, known as an ischaemic stroke. Formula One teams will operate in groups of people mostly kept separated from each other when the F1 season starts behind closed doors in Austria next week after being stalled since March. “The Formula One paddock will be a bubble,” said Ferrari sporting director Laurent Mekies. “But inside ... you will have an inidual bubble for each team with pretty much no or minimum interaction between a bubble or a team and another. “Inside the team bubble, which is inside the F1 bubble, we will also do more bubbles,” added the Frenchman. “So you will have probably the car 16 (Charles Leclerc) bubble and the car 5 (Sebastian Vettel) bubble and inside them probably engineers and mechanics and so forth.” The separation means anyone who tests positive will have had limited contact with others, with tested stand-ins ready to be slotted in if needed.

The survey – the largest of its kind ever conducted – focused on the social experiences of lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans and intersex people in 30 European countries, and found that little progress has been made over the past seven years. Before the anniversary of the Stonewall riots, at the end of a Pride month marked by the cancellation of public events in light of the Covid-19 pandemic, we take a look at what the results reveal about the issues facing LGBTQ+ people in the UK.The European averages hide significant differences between the countries, and an increase in overall negative statistics appears to be linked to the adoption of actively discriminatory policies introduced in recent years across the continent. The study shows that trans and intersex respondents face even higher levels of prejudice than other categories: since 2012 they have experienced a disproportionate rise in discrimination and violence in all areas of daily life. In the UK, discrimination in the workplace in particular remains significantly high.Miltos Pavlou, the survey’s programme manager at the FRA, told the  that the results hinted at “a strong claim of trans people to participate in the labour market and in everyday life, and to be protected from discrimination”, as well as more openness by trans people about their gender identity.Like most respondents across Europe, people in the UK who say the situation has deteriorated blame “negative public discourse by politicians andor political parties”, as well as “lack of enforcement of existing law and policies” as the main contributing factors.New legislation introducing compulsory relationships education for primary school pupils and relationships and sex education for secondary pupils is due to come into force in England from September 2020.Bradlow hailed the introduction of the new regulations as a historic moment: “A whole generation will attend schools that not only accept LGBTQ people and same-sex relationships, but also celebrate and offer support on issues that young LGBTQ people face. Just think of the change that inclusive education will bring to the lives of so many young people.”The FRA survey’s full results can be accessed through their online data explorer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ffa8f952ea7bbc5bb58ce2825b15dbffe5ba0f5a/0_0_12000_7204/master/12000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2e97e3f288efc213f8e4d19d5fcb0218","title":"podcasting to blogging five tips to help marginalised voices find their platform","story":"In a world where everyone has an opinion, how do you make sure your views see the limelight, especially when it seems that no one is listening? Here, three people who found their voices explain how you can do itIt should, these days, be easier than ever to make a point in public. If you want to tell your story there are places to blog and host videos, there is social media to help you find an audience, and free software and ever cheaper hardware to get you online.But in practice, not everyone finds it easy to push their ideas into a public space. So where do you begin, particularly if you feel as if you’re on the margins? As part of Levi’s Your Voice. Your Way campaign,  Labs talked to three young people who, driven by a burning desire to be heard, found their voices through blogging, podcasts and zines.This is their advice to others who are bubbling with ideas and opinions, who know they have something valuable to say, but may feel unchampioned or underestimated. These are the first steps to getting your voice heard ...1. Stay true to yourselfYou might admire a particular columnist or an influencer, but the world doesn’t need an exact copy of someone else. The world needs you.“I tried lots of voices on for size, but they weren’t really me,” says Jessica Riches, a social media and content specialist. She found her real voice and honed her social media skills during the student protests of 2010 when she became the clearest online voice of the group who occupied University College London in protest at increases in fees.“Politics was where I found myself,” she says. “I was able to learn and explore that side of myself and I found a community of people.”For Raifa Rafiq, a shared interest in books led her to create the Mostly Lit podcast with her friend Alex Reads. “The response we got was phenomenal,” she says of the podcast, which ran for four years, won awards and partnered with Waterstones. “We did something we enjoyed and ended up putting a different face on culture and arts criticism: you don’t have to be an old white man or a middle class white woman to love books or to talk about them.”2. Consider your platform carefullyWho do you want to reach and what are you trying to say? Both of these questions will have an effect on where and how you publish your work. “In terms of social media, this is key,” says Riches. “If you are telling a story that is text based, about news or opinion, then head to Twitter. If you want to draw people in with visuals, use Instagram. This sounds really obvious, but the mistake people often make at the beginning is over-committing. Pick the most appropriate platform and start there, that way you won’t end up disappointing yourself. You can always expand later.”Kirsty Fife has published her work on blogs and also created physical fanzines. “I started out blogging, I ran a fat-fashion blog, Fatty Unbound,” she says. “Blogging did create a space that wasn’t there at the time.” Digitally, she honed her writing and found a community, but decided to begin putting out fanzines when her work became more personal.3. Start creating“Think about what you engage with, what stops your thumb in its endless scroll,” says Riches. “Then think about what’s missing. Write down – privately – what you want your content principles to be. What topics are you going to cover, what are your boundaries? What will you enjoy creating? It sounds limiting, but it’s very freeing it stops you trying to talk about everything at once.”Creating a fanzine, says Fife: “Is still very lo-fi. It’s a Sharpie, sketchbooks, pieces of paper. Although these days I scan everything into my computer and create PDFs to print and distribute. I don’t want any more incidents with things getting stuck in work photocopiers.”The DIY approach has also worked for Rafiq, whose new podcast This Thing Changed My Life launched this month. “Buy equipment and teach yourself,” she says. “Some editing software is free and it might seem scary, but it’s not. YouTube taught me everything, and I started recording in a day. It’s saved me so much time and money.”4. Believe in yourselfThe biggest barriers, however, often aren’t the practical ones. Why, you might think, would anyone want to hear from you?“It’s hard to put something out into the world,” says Fife. “I used to think that anything I made had to be perfectly finished and polished. It will never be perfect, so push through those feelings of anxiety. Put whatever you can out there, don’t wait for validation to start.”“There will always be someone for whom your work is meaningful.”5. Build your communityFife, Rafiq and Riches all agree they have found communities through their creative work. “I found both friends and collaborators,” says Fife.But it’s worth remembering that an audience won’t appear overnight. “It’s a marathon, not a sprint,” says Riches. “And you need to put the work in. Start where you feel comfortable, ask your close friends to like what you’re doing, then expand to other friends. Build.”Riches also points out that finding a community and finding an audience are very closely linked. “Don’t forget that social media is supposed to be social,” she says. “Support other people in your field. Collaborate. Share. Showcase others and make connections.”Before starting to produce her own, Fife bought zines created by others. She recommends looking at zine distros – places that sell and distribute a number of different fanzines. “I go to Pen Fight Distro, Synchronise Witches Press and Vampire Hag. There will be a voice you enjoy out there.”Rafiq proved there was an audience for her work that had been ignored or discounted by much of the culture industry. “Young people do love the arts,” she says. “Arts criticism isn’t just an endeavour for Oxbridge grads. You can be from the inner city, you can be BAME and want this.”The effort is worth it, Fife says. “I’ve had a lot of people reach out to me over the years because they listened to my voice. I don’t have a professional background in writing, art or design, but I made things that meant something to others.”Use Your Voice ...At the heart of the Your Voice.

Graphic: The Paul Scott How does the voting process work in each party?The ratification processes in Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Greens for the draft programme for government are coming to an end.Votes will be counted on Friday.Fine Gael requires the approval of its internal electoral college, rather than every party member, and only has 700 votes to count.It is expected that its count will begin after lunchtime on Friday and will be relatively short.The Greens’ count will start at noon with a result expected between 6pm and 7pm.The Greens and Fianna Fáil are running one member, one vote ballot and will take longer to count than Fine Gael.Fianna Fáil expects its own count to be concluded around tea time.Just under 2,000 people - 1,962 - are eligible to vote in the Greens’ contest, with around 14,500 in Fianna Fáil. Of those registered to vote for the Greens, 195 are from Northern Ireland.With a large number of Green Party elected representatives from Northern Ireland against the deal, it is expected most of the 195 northern members could oppose the deal.However, the number of those who registered to vote from Northern Ireland was relatively low - giving hope to those in favour of a deal.The Greens initially allowed telephone voting only for members outside the the Republic and Northern Ireland, but this week widened the eligibility to allow anyone who has not received their ballot paper to vote over the phone.Those wishing to do so must email the Green Party headquarters with their name, email, phone number, address, and a suitable time to vote by phone. Party officials will then check that person is eligible to vote.A special code which the voter will need to vote by phone will then be sent by email, and this code must be quoted over the phone when the vote is cast. Postal votes for those who vote by phone will be cancelled.A degree of co-ordination in the announcement of the three parties’ results on Friday is expected but has not yet been finalised.If the three parties approve the deal, what happens next?There will be a full sitting of the Dáil in the Convention Centre, Dublin, on Saturday morning to elect Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin as Taoiseach.The Dáil cannot sit in Leinster House due to the need for social distancing if all TDs are present.The sitting will begin at 10.30am and the proposer and seconder for each nominee for the position of taoiseach will get five minutes speaking time each.This will be followed by ten minutes of speeches from each party or group that has not put forward a nomination for Taoiseach.Votes will then be taken and, when, as expected, Mr Martin is elected, he will then be invited by the Ceann Comhairle to make a brief statement.The House will then adjourn to allow Mr Martin receive his seal of office from President Micheal D Higgins in Áras an Uachtaráin, which is expected to happen at around 12.30pm.The details of how this ceremony - and the later ceremony where the new Cabinet receive their seals of office from Mr Higgins - will operate with social distancing have not yet been finalised.When will the Cabinet be picked?Upon receiving his seal from the President, it is expected Mr Martin would then travel to his new office in Government Buildings where he will appoint the new Cabinet.Fianna Fáil will have six full Cabinet posts, as will Fine Gael, and the Greens three. Leo Varadkar will choose the Fine Gael nominees and Eamon Ryan will choose the Green nominees.The three leaders are expected to meet on Thursday to decide how to configure government departments and allocate inidual portfolios to each party.Each leader, however, will choose their own people for their allocated portfolios without the need to consult the other leaders.When will the Dáil sit again?The House is expected to reconvene at 4.30pm on Saturday when the members of the new cabinet will be nominated for approval by the Dáil. The Taoiseach will make a ten minute speech, as will the leaders of all parties and groups, with 100 minutes in total set aside for speeches on the nominations of new ministers.However, this stage of the process can drag on and could stretch on longer than expected. Votes will be taken at the conclusion of speeches and the new cabinet will travel to Áras an Uachtaráin to receive their seals of office and hold their first meeting.What about the Taoiseach’s nominees to the Seanad?The Government believes a new taoiseach must nominate 11 members of the Upper House in order for crucial legislation to be passed through the Oireachtas, such as the renewal of the Offences Against the State Act.The Government says this cannot be done by Mr Varadkar as acting taoiseach.Of the 11, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael will each choose four and the Greens will get two. The remaining one will be an Independent nominee, most likely from Northern Ireland.The Programme for Government says at least half of those nominated should be women.Mr Martin is expected to nominate the 11 on Saturday, with the fully constituted Seanad then expected to sit on Monday to deal with outstanding legislation.And if one of the three does not ratify coalition?The political system will be thrown into crisis. There are several scenarios that could play out. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar could try to dissolve the Dáil. He has said consistently that his party is interested only in a stable government involving three parties and not Independents. That is borne from past experience where governments that relied on Independent TDs became increasingly unstable as iniduals withdrew support, either over a constituency or national decision that affected their policy areas.Would that mean an election?Not necessarily. The State is still in the middle of arguably the worst crisis in its history and the question arises as to the advisability of holding an election when the pandemic is still live. Besides, the decision of the Taoiseach would not be final. One of the few executive powers the President has is conferred under Article 13 of the Constitution. He may “in his absolute discretion refuse to dissolve the Dáil”. If he refused, it would mean that parties would have to re-engage to see if an alternative administration could be agreed. If an election is held, it must be held within 30 days of the Dáil being dissolved.The best news and analysis from the campaign trailStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4289217.1593151007!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"lifting the lockdown what can i do from this monday","story":"Shane Curran who owns the Kings Head Barber Shop on Sandwith Street Upper in Dublin has to had to make significant changes to his premises ahead of next week’s reopening as Covid-19 restrictions ease.

Photograph: PAForeign travel restrictions will be eased from July 9th with travellers permitted to move between countries with similar levels of coronavirus infection.A green list will be compiled before that date detailing which countries people can travel between without having to undergo a 14-day quarantine - but it will not include Britain if current Covid-19 trends continue.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar also said checks and controls would be stepped up in airports and ports and there will be an expanded list of exceptional personnel who don’t have to abide by quarantine measures.Mr Varadkar said the list of accepted countries could change every two weeks.“If a country ends up having a second wave, they may be taken off the list.”He also raised the prospect of a future inquiry into how Ireland handled the coronavirus pandemic.The country will, from next Monday, move to phase three in the easing of the lockdown, Mr Varadkar confirmed.This will see the vast majority of the economy and society reopen.Under the plan, gatherings are to be limited to 50 people indoors and 200 people outdoors until July 20th. At this point the limit will rise to 100 people indoors and 500 people outdoors.But churches and places of worship will be exempt from the 50-person indoor limit, Mr Varadkar said.“The Cabinet agreed that we would make an exception for places of worship. However the specific protocol is going to be worked out with churches and religious bodies to allow more people to attend religious ceremonies. It will be very much policed by them.”He said the move was to acknowledge the fact that there are some large churches that can accommodate more than 50 people with social distancing.Catholic Archbishop of Dublin Diarmuid Martin earlier this week described the limit of 50 people attending churches as “strange” and “disappointing”.Mr Varadkar also said he has been Taoiseach for three years and “it has been the greatest honour”.He said the country owed a “profound debt” to chief medical officer Tony Holohan. He also thanked assistant Secretary General at the Department of Taoiseach Liz Canavan and the members of the National Public Health Emergency Team.Mr Varadkar also said he believed it would be appropriate to hold a “memorial day” in honour of those who have lost their lives to Covid-19 and frontline workers but that the discussion was premature as the pandemic is ongoing.The Government also agreed to make it mandatory to wear face masks on public transport.Minister for Health Simon Harris said there will be sanction for a breach of the rules which will be enacted in the next seven to ten days.Mr Harris also said that Ireland has seen the biggest drop in new cases across the European Union.“From Monday we will lift travel restrictions right across this country and reunite with desperately missed friends and family.”“It will be a week of immense emotion and joy.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4279871.1592249606!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"making a cabinet eamon ryan set to head up new department of climate action and transport","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGreen Party leader Eamon Ryan before government-formation talks at Government Buildings, Dublin. Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsThe Green Party is set to have four TDs at the cabinet table if the party approves the programme for government today and the coalition is formed over the weekend.The Greens will have three full cabinet ministries, and also a “super junior” , a junior minister who does not have responsibility for a full government department but who sits at the cabinet table.The three Green TDs to hold full cabinet rank are expected to be party leader Eamon Ryan, who is expected to take over a new department of climate action and transport, deputy leader Catherine Martin, who may take a new department with responsibility for communications and culture, and the Dublin West TD Roderic O’Gorman who is tipped take a new department with responsibility for equality, integration and children. The Greens are expected to have four junior ministers, including the super junior at cabinet.Planning continuesWhile the outcome of the vote in the Green Party remains uncertain, planning continues for the construction of the new government. The three party leaders met yesterday to discuss the organisation of departments, but sources say that a number of issues are not yet resolved. It is expected that the three men will meet again today.There is feverish speculation about the Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil nominees for the cabinet. The two parties will have six cabinet members each, plus one super-junior each, and seven other junior ministers, it is expected.Within Fine Gael, four current Cabinet members are viewed as certainties - Leo Varadkar, Paschal Donohoe, Simon Coveney and Heather Humphreys. After that, Helen McEntee is tipped for promotion from the junior ranks to a full cabinet job, which leaves one full cabinet job and the super junior role – with several outgoing ministers seeking each.The EurogroupMr Donohoe’s nomination on Thursday to be the head of the Eurogroup council of finance ministers suggests that he will remain in the Department of Finance. It is also expected that Mr Coveney will remain in the Department of Foreign Affairs, though sources say that there is no agreement from the other parties yet.Minister for Health Simon Harris is widely credited with an effective handling of the Covid-19 crisis, especially in its early stages, and a demotion from Cabinet would be seen as extremely harsh. However, his inclusion would mean there is no place for Minister for Housing Eoghan Murphy, a close personal and political ally of Mr Varadkar, and someone who is seen in Fine Gael as having taking a lot of flak for the Taoiseach on the housing issue. Other party sources say that Hildegard Naughten, the Galway West TD who was part of the negotiating team, has a strong case for inclusion and she will be helped by both gender and geography.Either way, if the Government is formed tomorrow, Mr Varadkar will have no option but to end the cabinet careers of several long-standing Fine Gael ministers, with Michael Ring, Joe McHugh, Charlie Flanagan, Paul Kehoe, Josepha Madigan and Richard Bruton all thought by their colleagues to be unlikely to make cabinet, though some sources speculate that a role will be found for Mr Bruton, and others may fill junior minister roles.In Fianna Fáil, as the party anticipates a return to government for the first time in almost a decade, the situation is more fluid. With Micheál Martin poised to become taoiseach, it is considered certain that Michael McGrath will take the role of Minister for Public Expenditure. Barry Cowen, Jack Chambers and Dara Colleary are also tipped for cabinet or super-junior roles, while Darragh O’Brien, Anne Rabbitte, Thomas Byrne or new Kerry TD Norma Foley could also figure.The fate of justice spokesman Jim O’Callaghan is much discussed in party circles. While he is one of the party’s more prominent TDs, his relations with party leader Mr Martin have not been easy in recent months.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Many were struck as they were planting seeds across Bihar state in east of countryThe decades-long project sees a constellation of 35 satellites circling the Earth to rival the US-owned Global Positioning System (GPS)Regime rows back on threat to deploy troops near border amid rising tensionsOfficials prepare \u0026lsquoretaliatory punishment\u0026rsquo after anti-North balloons arrived from SouthBan on cruise ships extended beyond June 30th cases increase as more citizens return homeCovid-19 outbreak in staff at Tyson foods in Arkansas sparks Beijing U-turn on policyChina says draft law is aimed at separatist activity, subversion, terrorism and collusion abroadChina may have shut down its controversial re-education camps, but minorities are still persecutedSamira Imin\u0026rsquos father was incarcerated for three years in XinjiangDelhi says Chinese dammed a river and lay in wait for clash in which 20 Indians diedCases widely seen as Chinese \u0026lsquohostage diplomacy\u0026rsquo following arrest of Huawei\u0026rsquos chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou in VancouverInvestigators say they have found gun and are talking to two \u0026lsquopeople of interest\u0026rsquoTensions remain high despite two governments agreeing to de-escalate confrontationAustralia says it will not name country responsibleKim Yo-jong\u0026rsquos criticism of Seoul illustrates her seniority and potential to become rulerBatons wrapped in barbed wire used in high-altitude brawl in which 20 Indian soldiers diedNZ officials tracing 320 people regarded as \u0026lsquoclose contacts\u0026rsquo of pair who returned from UKClash on Himalayan border is the most serious since 1967, why now and what next?Any moves to invalidate peace deals posemajor setback to Moon\u0026rsquos efforts for more lasting reconciliation with NorthFirst loss of life in area for decades as \u0026lsquoviolent face-off\u0026rsquo between troops elevates disputeStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Only under-65s can take part and pilgrims will be quarantined before and after pilgrimageWorld community urged to reject move to intensify \u0026lsquoprofound human rights violations\u0026rsquoAmple evidence uncovered of movement\u0026rsquos widespread persecution of Yazidi minority and other ethnic minoritiesSarah Hegazi\u0026rsquos simple gesture at a concert led to outrage, persecution and heartbreakDemonstrations against prices and wages erupt in Sweida and spread to DeraaAnnexation would be incompatible with international law, Maas warnsTerror group ramps up attacks as crises including coronavirus provide opportunityGovernment pressed to speed up talks with IMF and donors to secure funds and halt slideBritish-Iranian woman seeking release after first furlough from jail in Iran since 2016Police and security force officers killed in roadside bomb and gun battleHealth authorities confirm more than 3,000 new cases on two consecutive daysOpponents warn that US-backed plan would lead to independent Palestinian stateWar and coronavirus-ravaged country to get $1.35bn from UN and Saudi ArabiaTension rises in region with Israel planning to extend sovereignty to Jewish settlementsGiven lack of other options, authorities used restrictions as main tool to fight pandemicFormer cabinet minister Saad al-Jabri was strategic architect of Saudi counter-terrorism effortsPrime minister claims allegations are a \u0026lsquodeep-state\u0026rsquo, left-wing political witch-huntLong-serving politician will become first sitting prime minister in Israel\u0026rsquos history to stand trialPA president cites imminent threat of Israeli annexation of parts of the West BankFirebomb attack on home claimed the lives of a couple and their 18-month-old sonStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com\"/polopoly_fs/1.4192672!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_940/image.jpg","title":"us democratic","story":"The process to choose the Democratic nominee to take on Donald Trump in November’s US presidential election is well under way.States across the country are in the process of choosing\u0026nbsptheir preferred candidate, either through a primary contest or a caucus. A primary is a traditional election where eligible voters select their candidate privately through a ballot system. A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states. Though Vermont senator Bernie Sanders finished first in four states, including delegate-rich California, Super Tuesday checked the Sanders momentum after a strong opening to the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and\u0026nbspNevada.On March 10th\u0026nbspsix more states vote, with most of the remaining primaries taking place throughout March and April. The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role.

Martyred him,” Mr Khan said. “What happened after that, the whole world abused us. Our ally came here and killed Osama bin Laden without telling us.”Khawaja Asif, a former foreign minister, immediately accused the prime minister of fiddling with history for declaring a man who was once the world\u0027s most wanted terrorist to be a martyr.Mr Khan\u0027s remarks are also likely to anger Pakistani leaders who are desperate to reset the country\u0027s damaging reputation as a hotbed of terrorism and extremism.His remarks are not the first time he has run into trouble discussing Pakistan\u0027s role in the war on terror. While still remembered in the UK as a liberal, cricketing playboy, in Pakistan, his opponents have accused him of a soft stance on militants and given him the moniker \u0027Taliban Khan\u0027.Last year Mr Khan said Pakistan\u0027s army and military spy agency trained al-Qaeda and then maintained links with the militants afterwards. Turning against the militants to back America after the 911 attacks was one of his country\u0027s biggest blunders, he said.Bin Laden was found hiding in Pakistan\u0027s city of Abbottabad in 2011, though the country\u0027s authorities deny they knew he was there.“Imran Khan\u0027s description of Osama Bin Laden as a martyr badly undermines Pakistan\u0027s narrative that it no longer supports terrorists,” said Michael Kugelman, deputy director of the Asia Program at the Washington-based Wilson Centre.“If he just misspoke, one would expect a clarification.  I don\u0027t think there\u0027s been one issued yet. It\u0027s not a good look, no matter how you slice it.”Mr Khan\u0027s special adviser on communications later defended the comments, saying the prime minister had twice said bin Laden had been killed. He accused political opponents of whipping up controversy.Mr Khan made his comments as a new US terrorism assessment said Pakistan had helped America during negotiations with the Taliban, but still hosts the militants in safe havens as they wage war in Afghanistan.The annual State Department evaluation said Pakistan allowed groups targeting both Afghanistan and India to operate from its soil during 2019.The acknowledgement that Pakistan had “played a constructive role” in Washington\u0027s attempts to talk with the insurgents comes after years of complaints Islamabad has played a double game supporting the militants against US troops while receiving US aid.Yet the assessment said Pakistan “continued to serve as a safe haven for certain regionally focused terrorist groups”.The Afghan Taliban and its Haqqani Network faction, as well as groups targeting India including Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) still operate from its territory, the report said.The assessment drew a testy rebuttal from Islamabad, which said it rejected “ any insinuation about any safe haven. Pakistan will not allow any group or entity to use its territory against any country.”The US report echoed a recent Pentagon assessment concluding that Pakistan “has encouraged the Afghan Taliban to participate in peace talks, but refrained from applying coercive pressure that would seriously threaten its relationship with the Afghan Taliban”.Pakistan has for decades been accused of fostering and hosting militants to use as foreign policy tools in its neighbours and the issue has poisoned relations with Delhi.The report said Islamabad had made “modest” steps against anti-India groups on its territory after the neighbours nearly went to war in February 2019 when 40 paramilitary police were killed by a Pakistan-based group.Terrorist leaders like the JeM founder Masood Azhar had still not been brought to justice even though they are “widely believed to reside in Pakistan under the protection of the state, despite government denials”.Pakistan\u0027s foreign ministry said the assessment was “self-contradictory and selective” and did not give the country credit for its role in February\u0027s America\u0027s troop withdraw agreement with the Taliban.“ Pakistan hopes that future US reports will fully acknowledge the entire spectrum of Pakistan’s counter-terrorism efforts and present a fair and correct perspective of this global threat,” a spokeswoman said.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"watch resurgence coronavirus cases us stifling progress","story":"Hospital administrators and health experts warned on Wednesday that parts of the US are on the verge of becoming overwhelmed by a resurgence of the coronavirus.The experts lamented that politicians and a tired-of-being-cooped-up public are letting a disaster unfold.The US recorded a one-day total of 34,700 new COVID-19 cases, the highest in two months, according to the count kept by Johns Hopkins University.

The play is being produced by Bill Kenwright and directed by Sean Mathias in his inaugural season leading the Theatre Royal Windsor.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesStrict measures around social distancing, screening, PPE and hygiene will be implemented throughout the rehearsal period.The role of Hamlet is typically given to young actors. The last time that McKellen played the Danish prince was almost 50 years ago.Reading about racism won’t make you an ally – but it’s a step forwardHugh Grant’s 1995 arrest changed the way celebrities say sorryWhy the Avatar saga might never be completedMcKellen said: “I feel lucky to be working again, thanks to Bill Kenwright’s inspiring optimism and Sean Mathias’s invitation to re-examine Hamlet, 50 years on from my first go. So now we will meet again. Don’t know when, but do know where – Theatre Royal Windsor!”Writing about the role on his website, he said: “I’m always doubtful when an actor is dubbed ‘The Hamlet of his generation’, particularly as no-one ever wrote it about mine! Mind you, the competition was considerable: there were 10 British Princes of Denmark in 1971.”“I was 31, the same age as Hamlet by the end of the play. Robert Chetwyn (the director who had got me to whisper Henry V at Ipswich) persuaded me that we shouldn’t tell the Olivier story of a man who couldn’t make up his mind. Our Hamlet was a boy who knows exactly what has to be done but lacks the manly resources to do it.He continued: “I wore pants tucked into boots and a sweater under a fringed leather jacket. We had a psychedelic, multi-faceted Ghost, reflected in the mirrors of the set. This modern-looking Hamlet didn’t much appeal to the critics...”The question of Hamlet\u0027s age has been the subject of considerable debate over the years. Academics have questioned whether he is 30, as stated at one point during the play, or much younger, as his behaviour seems to suggest.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Two of the stores – in Ross-on-Wye and Leominster – reopened on Monday 15 June.“Being able to shop in person, especially at smaller independents, is a joy,” owner Andy Rossiter, pictured above, says. “I think lockdown made a lot of people realise that they don’t want all their shopping to just land at their door, but booksellers also know they need to work hard for their audience. It’s not simply a case of just opening your doors.”Rossiter has been busy preparing the stores, moving fixtures and checkouts so that staff and customers can socially distance while browsing for books.Carry out a risk assessment: employers will need to carry out Covid-19 risk assessments in consultation with their workers or trade unions.Maintain social distancing: employers should redesign workspaces to maintain social distancing between people and stagger start times.Manage transmission risk:\u0026nbspemployers should look into putting barriers in shared spaces, creating workplace shift patterns or fixed teams.Reinforcing cleaning processes: workplaces should be cleaned more frequently, paying close attention to\u0026nbspdoor handles and keyboards.“We have installed Perspex screens at till points, bought hand sanitiser stations for the entrances to our stores and placed tape and signage throughout so we can clearly indicate the social distancing rules within our stores,” he says.The bookshops have reopened with less members of staff and they have limited their opening hours from their pre-lockdown seven days to just five. Rossiter has also been consulting staff and getting their input on the UK Government’s coronavirus advice.“Our trade body, the Booksellers Association, has been brilliant at reading and interpreting this advice to make it bookshop-specific and releasing it in digestible and accessible weekly bulletins, he says.“Booksellers love serving customers, and we’ve been serving our local community for a decade, so seeing those regulars again and having that relationship start to return to normal will be fantastic.Surinder Josan, owner of All Seasons DIY, a family-run shop, explains how he has used strict safe workplace measures to keep his shop doors open and his businesses afloat.“All Seasons DIY is a family-run shop which was established over 40 years ago, run by myself, my wife, and my mother. My son and daughter work in the shop around their university studies as well,” Josan, below, says.The family decided to shut the shop when school closures were announced. But after just a week they decided to reopen the business in order to serve the local community, who relied on the store for essential food and other items.“In order to reopen, we had to reassess how we both serve and interact with our customers,” Josan explains. “We adopted several new measures to comply with social distancing to keep both ourselves and our customers safe.”These new measures they adopted included safe distance markers outside the shop, to limit the number of people in store at any one time, installing screens at the checkout areas, encouraging contactless payments, lowering the minimum card spend to £1, and offering hand wipes to customers.“The number of customers who have come in and complimented us for it is unbelievable. They say when they come here they feel really safe,” Josan adds.Blend Coffee Co is an independent coffee shop based in Portslade, East Sussex, near Brighton. The two directors behind the business, Oli Crawley and Tom Jennion, have introduced a range of measures so they could confidently reopen for staff and customers.“Our primary concern is to keep people safe, so to make sure our coffee shop was ready to be reopened we implemented a number of safer working measures,” says Crawley.These new measures included a deep clean of the shop prior to reopening, implementation of a new ordering layout and adopting a new policy which stipulates that no customers are allowed inside the store.Working alongside Crawley and Jennion are a further three members of staff.“Only the directors returned to work to alleviate any pressure on our barista team feeling they need to work,” says Crawley. “This also allows an operational analysis of all our new protocols to ensure they are efficient and safe.”The checkout system has now been moved to the front of the shop, Blend now only accepts card payments and there is a new waiting area outside the shop.This plan was developed after we undertook a risk assessment and analysis of the premises to ensure that customer-staff interaction could be maintained and sustained in a safe manner. We ran a test prior to reopening to ensure that our new measures would work and allow us and our customers to stay safe,” adds Crawley.For further information from the UK Government on how employers, employees and the self-employed can return to work safely, click hereThis is Government advice for EnglandWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Unfortunately, not long after her return, jobs began to get cancelled because of the intensifying Covid-19 crisis.She started looking for something else right away – and is currently living and working on New Moor Farm in Southminster, Essex, working with asparagus, having swapped fashion for food.Though a far cry from a usual career, Philip is enjoying her new setting. “Right now, I live on site on the farm, in one of the caravans in the orchard. It’s nice,” she explains. “The community is amazing. There are so many different characters on the farm. Everyone is really friendly and we’re all here for the same reasons: to help and to work.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHer day-to-day routine varies. “Most days I’m up at five, start working at six on the farm, in the packhouse,” she says. “Generally, I’m doing a little bit of everything, so I’m helping on the line, bundling, helping customers, grading – just helping out wherever I can.”Philip is among Brits across the country working on farms in order to help the industry continue despite the many obstacles presented by the Covid-19 pandemic.The temporary closure of much of the food and hospitality industry has left huge quantities of fresh produce at risk of going to waste. The pubs and restaurants that would usually purchase large amounts of vegetables remain shut and travel restrictions have prevented pickers from overseas working on the farms.Join the Pick For BritainThat’s why the Government is urging fit and healthy people looking for work across the country to get involved. The Pick For Britain initiative is helping to bring workers and employers together to ensure the farming industry can continue.From furloughed employees whose contracts allow them to work during this time, to university students on their summer breaks, it’s a great opportunity to earn money and meet new people – while helping Britain’s food industry during these unprecedented times.The growing season is only just getting started, so from now until September, bringing in the harvest requires a major effort. Visit pickforbritain.org.uk to find out moreEat seasonal and local vegBut that’s not the only way to support the industry right now. Simply eating more in-season local produce will help to prevent wastage.A wide range of vegetables are currently being harvested in the UK. These include asparagus, cucumbers, mushrooms, courgettes, spinach, summer squash, radishes, beetroot and tomatoes – and buying and cooking with this seasonal veg is a great way to contribute to the farming industry.​In need of some recipe inspo?

You can get involved too: share your recipes using #SeasonalVeg on social mediaTry different types of fishSimilarly, the UK\u0027s fishing industry has suffered during the current coronavirus pandemic.While higher-end produce is currently not being purchased by restaurants, much of the catch from UK waters that would usually be exported hasn’t been, so boats across the country have struggled to sell their fish and seafood. That’s why there\u0027s never been a better time to try something new.Among the wide range of different species found in UK waters are mussels, crab, mackerel, herring, rainbow trout, hake and coley (or saithe).

Residents on the southwest coast, in Plymouth, Devon, also woke to find the detritus left behind in the city’s popular Barbican area overnight – where hundreds of people packed onto the waterfront, ignoring coronavirus social distancing rules.The streets were covered in rubbish this morning, including tampons and used condoms, Plymouth Live reports.Residents were also reportedly faced with people having sex in public, as well as urinating and defecating in back streets.

Today there was also evidence of drug use.  “Thank you to the park rangers who are also working tirelessly to clear the mess around the ground and park generally.”A suitcase, parasol and fridge were among items abandoned on beaches in Durdle Door, Dorset, where volunteers filled more than 30 bags with rubbish. Dorset councillor Laura Miller tweeted: “Is it still ‘iconic’? Just in from volunteer litter picking. 30 bin bags and counting. Nearly in tears at the state of our home.”She also shared an image of what she described as human faeces on pebbles near where her children swim at Lulworth Cove. The Conservative councillor said she was spat at by someone while directing traffic on Wednesday as the roads to Durdle Door and West Lulworth were closed off after car parks quickly filled up. Police imposed a dispersal order at Hove Lawns, in Sussex, after a fight reportedly broke out as hundreds of, mostly young, people gathered on Wednesday evening.Jo Shiner, temporary Chief Constable of Sussex Police, described the incident as “shocking behaviour impacting upon everyone trying to be responsible in challenging times”. She warned: “Sussex Police will take positive action but I would urge young people to think about their behaviour. A criminal record will not help you get a job in the future.” Video journalist Eddie Mitchell shared footage on Twitter showing several police cars lined up along the seafront as uniformed officers herded crowds away.Police in Merseyside also imposed a 48-hour dispersal order lasting until Friday after large crowds turned up at Formby Beach, on the Sefton coastline. Former Love Island contestant Joshua Ritchie, who was allegedly among those who turned up at the beach, was seen carrying a large speaker with friends in a video.Boris Johnson’s official spokesman declined to comment on particular scenes on beaches, but told reporters: “The prime minister and the government’s scientific and medical advisers have stressed the great importance of the public continuing to adhere to social distancing advice.“It is only due to the public’s hard work that we have been able to bring the virus under control, and if the rules don’t continue to be followed and the virus starts to spread exponentially again, we will have to look at having to reverse some of the easements that have been put in place and I don’t think anyone in the British public would want that to happen.”There were hundreds of kids grouped up on the Roath Park Rec earlier this evening. They left A LOT of rubbish and were only dispersed about 10 minutes ago.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Viruferrin has been scientifically proven to block 98 per cent of similar viruses to Covid-19, including influenza and Sars.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe snood-like coverings can be worn for up to 50 hours before they need washing, and their effectiveness only drops to 96 per cent after over 200 hours of wear.The face coverings are cut and sewn together by Cookson \u0026amp Clegg in Blackburn, which is run by Patrick Grant, star of the Great British Sewing Bee. He is also behind a campaign to get Britons making their own coverings, The Great Community Sew.How to support our campaignThe coverings, which retail at £20, are different to medical grade PPE used by NHS workers. However, due to the protein coverings they are more effective than standard face masks at protecting wearers from viruses.There was a buzz at the Royal Park Felix Project depot when boxes of Virustatic Shield coverings arrived.David Clark, who has been volunteering for three years, said: “I think it is important to wear these face coverings when you’re delivering to members of the public who potentially come into contact with vulnerable people.”Mr Clark dropped off some coverings to Ian Breen, centre manager at Acton Homeless Concern, which serves hot meals five days a week to those in temporary accommodation or on the streets. Mr Breen said: “It is fantastic to have a delivery of some masks for free.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Our Help The Hungry appeal today passed the £7m mark, enabling our appeal partner, The Felix Project, to deliver the equivalent of 4.3 million meals to hungry schoolchildren and vulnerable Londoners in the 12 weeks since lockdown began.The milestone was reached thanks to more significant corporate donations, including an additional £100,000 from online grocer Ocado, taking its total donation to £390,000, and a further £90,000 from banking group Citi boosting their aggregate give to £250,000.It comes as the charity Feeding Britain warns that 3 million children face the prospect of hunger during the upcoming school holidays. Of these, it cautions, only 1 million are eligible for the government’s free school meal summer holiday voucher of £15 a week, with the remaining 2 million living with parents who narrowly do not qualify but cannot always afford food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHelen Barnard, of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, confirmed that the summer voucher scheme – agreed by the prime minister after being forced into a U-turn by footballer Marcus Rashford – only covers a minority of children in poverty. She said: “Soaring numbers of families are being pulled under and having to rely on food banks to get through the current crisis, even with the voucher scheme in place.”The harsh reality is that an astounding 66 per cent of food-insecure families – amounting to almost 200,000 children in London – cannot access government help and are forced to rely on food parcels from charities such as The Felix Project.Food and 10,000 face coverings donated to charities and vulnerableWhich star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day At the start of lockdown, The Felix Project faced an existential crisis with a total collapse of its fundraising. Thanks to The Independent’s campaign, it has not only been able to survive but has operated at twice its normal capacity, delivering up to 40 tons of nutritious produce a day and supplying 86 schools and 400 charities and community hubs across the capital over the course of a week.The Independent shareholder Evgeny Lebedev said: “These generous new donations take us 70 per cent of the way towards our goal to secure £10m to combat food poverty in London over the next three years. Our pledge is given added urgency by the release of worrying economic data, including that the number of people out of work and claiming benefits jumped 23 per cent to 2.8 million last month.”Jo West, of Ocado Retail, said most of its donation had been raised from Ocado and their customers via their “you give, we give” scheme. She added: “We’re extremely grateful to our customers for their generosity which enables groups like The Felix Project to bring food to people in desperate need.” James Murray, chair of the Bridgepoint Charitable Trust, which donated £50,000, said: “We are delighted to contribute to the work of The Felix Project in feeding vulnerable communities.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.In the end, perhaps, this wasn’t exactly as Liverpool fans would have dreamed it: with the city’s pubs closed, with the stadium shut up, with their team not even playing.The club won its first football league title in 30 years on Thursday night after rivals Man City lost to Chelsea.But, if it was a slightly surreal climax to a wholly surreal season, it did little to dampen celebrations here.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAn estimated 2,000 supporters turned up at Anfield bearing flags, fireworks and flares, while hundreds more piled into city centre parks and squares. Cars could be heard beeping all across the city. A cardboard cutout of manager Jurgen Klopp was doing a roaring trade in being hugged.They knew, fans said, they were stretching coronavirus lockdown rules to their absolute limits. They knew they were ignoring the calls of both manager Jurgen Klopp and local authorities to toast the success at home. But this was a moment in their city’s history, they argued, that was simply too big to be experienced on the sofa.Watch Liverpool’s players celebrate the moment they won the title“Pandemic or not, mate, I’m 21 and this is the first time I’ve seen Liverpool win the title – so no way am I staying at home,” said Michael Pinnington, a 21-year-old railway worker, four pints in and preparing for a long and loud night. “It’s dampened it a little bit, what’s happened. But ... we’ve won the league. Nothing can spoil that. It means everything to me. I’ve been waiting for it my whole life.”He himself was out with five or six mates. “Can you imagine if this was normal times?” asked one, Jo Stewart, also 21 and a railway worker. “The whole city would be here.”“Fair play, mate,” came the instant reply. “Three quarters of the city.”It was not just Anfield where people gathered. The city’s famously lively Concert Square got so busy as the night progressed that police moved in to move people on – something they did not do later at Anfield – while crowds also took over Sefton Park and Chavasse Park.At the latter, located by the city’s waterfront, groups sat in pre-chalked out socially distanced circles, listening to radios, refreshing Internet feeds, and watching on buffeting mobile screens. Once or twice, they burst into a rendition of ‘You’ll Never Walk Alone’. Drinks were sprayed into the air as at news of Chelsea goals.“It’s not exactly the normal, but there’s nowhere else I’d rather be right now,” said Mo Abdul, a 25-year-old research and development scientist. “I took the afternoon off work today just to spend time in the city and soak it up. Days like this don’t come along very often.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Back then, they were the most successful club in English football history and had finished in the top two every year, bar one, since 1973. Safe to say, no one here – indeed, no one anywhere – saw a sudden 30-year hiatus happening.“It’s been a burden,” said builder Andy Boylett. “I was six when we won that last title. I remember it but only just. And the city has been in the shadow of that ever since.”How so? “Because Liverpool is famous for football – other things too but football – and for having this great club. And, for most of those 30 years, we haven’t been great. That’s hard to deal with. It’s hard to be in the shadow of the past.”The moment, now it had come, he said, was strange, nonetheless.“Obviously, the gap in the season and games being played behind closed doors, it’s not exactly how you’d want it, is it?” he said. “But it doesn’t matter in the end. We’ve won it, that’s the most important thing. It won’t say anything about coronavirus in the history books. It will just say champions.”More to the point, says Adam Lally, with just the hint of a wink, fans got to celebrate more traditionally last year after the club won the Champions League.“Everyone was getting good and bendy in the pubs then,” the 19-year-old apprentice remembers. “The bus parade, brilliant. So, we’ve done that. Tonight, fine, we’ll do it all outside. Glorious weather anyway.”He was, he said, as happy as he could ever remember being. “Mate, I want to say it’s better than giving birth but I’ve never done that. So, until I do, I reckon this might be as good as it gets. It’s boss. Absolutely boss.”His friend, student Aiysha Griffiths agreed. “I can’t put it into word, really. I’m speechless. I’ve had my dad talking about the old glory days all my life. Now, at last, I know how it feels.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safelyNeither will Platform 3 in Surrey, a tiny pub next to a train station which claims to be the smallest in the UK.“We wouldn’t be able to have people social distancing inside the pub. We could probably have about 10 to 15 people sitting outside,” Alex Coomes, founder of Brightwater Brewery – whose brewery tap is the Claygate micropub – says. “For us, that is not profitable,” he tells The Independent. “So we have decided not to open for sales.”Pubs were ordered shut in late March due to the coronavirus outbreak, with the government saying earlier this week English establishments can open their doors again in early July as long as they follow certain precautions.Up until now, pubs have been finding other ways to survive, such as by doing takeout service – like The Globe – or door-to-door service. Coomes from Platform 3 says he has been driving around his local area dropping beer at houses – sometimes getting an emotional welcome. “When this all kicked off, I was delivering beers to people and they would burst into tears because they hadn’t seen anybody all week,” he tells The Independent.

Meanwhile in Suffolk, The Nutshell, another tiny pub, is hoping to be get permission to sell drinks to people standing outside. Until then, one of the landlords tells The Independent it is ”not really feasible” for his establishment – with an inside space of 15ft by 7ft – to reopen, even with the relaxed rules in early July. “We wouldn’t be able to serve a pint on the bar very easily,” Geoff Page from the Bury St Edmunds pub explains.“The member of staff would have to step back from the bar for the customer to get up from the seat on the edge of the pub to collect the pint.”He estimates the pub would be able to fit five single people inside – all sitting on their on their own – under the social distancing rules, which say people must stay at least one metre apart as a preventative measure against Covid-19. “Our unique selling point – the size of us – happens to be the Achilles heel in this particular situation,” Page says. Martin says they have been told they can serve people outside between 10am to 5pm. “Which is great,” she tells The Independent,” but that’s not when I have any business. I have business in the evening.” Outdoor space has been key for The Rake, a small pub in central London, to plan its reopening on 4 July. The establishment in Borough Market has been open as an off-licence throughout lockdown, with people queueing up in their gardens for takeaway beer – with draught beer poured into an open can, then sealed using a machine on the bar, as an option. When will pubs, cinemas, restaurants and hairdressers be open from?Pubs to offer al fresco dining and takeaway pints under new billOne of Britain’s smallest pubs on reopening during coronavirus“Our small garden is going to be used for customers,” manager George Aldridge tells The Independent. ”We are going to be introducing table service and table bookings – which we have never done before.” Mike Hill, the founder of Utobeer which runs the London pub, tells The Independent: “I think if we didn’t have outside space, and somebody told us we couldn’t use outside space, I would probably seriously consider not opening.”The small size of the pub means customers will not be allowed to drink inside, he adds. While some pubs will be planning to welcome back people in a socially-distanced environment on 4 July, others – including smaller ones – have decided to wait a bit longer. Coomes from Platform 3 in Claygate says his tiny pub – which can fit just one person inside – cannot afford the extra costs that would come with reopening during the pandemic, such as having a person manning the toilets. “I can’t justify having someone do that in my micropub,” he says. ”The figures don’t add up for us.”Speaking about pubs being able to reopen on new conditions, the landlord of The Nutshell – which is thought to be one of the smallest pubs in the UK – tells The Independent: “It is not going to change really very much at all for ourselves at all.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Independent Premium.David Frost stamps on idea that\u0026nbspUK could have ability to break free from EU rules – in return for tariff punishment if it takes that pathA proposal seen as the best chance of avoiding a disastrous no-deal Brexit at the end of the year has been rejected by the UK’s chief negotiator.With the talks deadlocked, it was thought the EU could agree to give the UK the ability to break free from its rules – in return for the right to impose tariffs if it chose to do so.The arrangement would have avoided the feared cliff-edge on 31 December, when the UK will crash out of the single market and customs union unless an agreement is struck.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut, in a series of tweets, David Frost, Boris Johnson’s negotiator, announced: “I want to be clear that the government will not agree to ideas like the one currently circulating giving the EU a new right to retaliate with tariffs if we chose to make laws suiting our interests.“We could not leave ourselves open to such unforeseeable economic risk.”Minister won’t comment on chlorinated chicken, claiming US listeningBritish officials had suggested Boris Johnson would consider the compromise, under which the UK would secure the right to deviate from Brussels’ standards in areas such as state aid.The EU was thought to be sceptical – preferring to strike a firm deal, rather than set a path for future conflict in the relationship – but had welcomed what it viewed as new-found flexibility in London.After clashes following recent remote negotiations, optimism had crept up that an agreement could be reached when face-to-face talks resume next week.But, without the proposed fudge – kicking key decisions into the future – the two sides remain at odds over access to UK fishing waters and ‘level playing field rules’ to protect the EU from unfair competition.Created with Sketch.Brexit day: UK says goodbye to EU  Show all 66Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with

The Cygnus Wall, a term for the Mexico and Central America part of the North America Nebula, exhibits the most concentrated star formations in the nebula. - Dave WatsonA safety pin is connected to a high tension AC generator. The pin ionizes the air around it. When the electrons fall back on an atom, the excess energy is emitted as a photon, which generate the corona glow around the pin. The fuzziness of the pin is because the camera did not actually capture light reflected on the pin but rather the light emitted by the ionized light around it. - Richard Germain69 Calmness of EternityHimalayas mountains, Nepal.

Here are some of the measures that schools are implementing to make the transition easier for pupils, staff and parentsIn association with the UK GovernmentHinchingbrooke School is an academy school in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, with more than 1,900 pupils and 200 staff. Teachers started welcoming back A-level students last week.“We’ve only had the Year 12s in so far, but for them it was really clear they were delighted to be back,” says Mark Patterson, school principal, pictured above. “You could see it on their faces. It’s getting back to some sense of routine, structure and normality.He continues: “I think a lot of them have been surprised by how much they’ve missed school. I think if you’d asked them before lockdown ‘Would you like a week off?’, they’d have said ‘Please!’. I bet if you asked them now, they’d say ‘Can I come back?’. I think the parents and students now realise how important school is.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesPrior to the return, teachers organised a virtual assembly for Year 10 and 12 pupils, and sent a booklet home detailing the new guidelines which would be in place.5 back-to-school tips for parents\u0026nbsp“Don\u0027t give them a lot of small instructions – recognise your child would have had an enormous amount of\u0026nbspinstructions during the course of the day.”“If you are rewarding your child\u0027s behaviour, it\u0027s very important to do it every time.”“For a child who\u0027s been finding it tough,\u0026nbsptalking to another child who\u0027s been in the same situation is by far the best way of letting it out.”“It\u0027s important to encourage a child to work for themselves and get on with their own inner task.”New measures include red circles marked on the ground that are two metres apart and one-way systems throughout the school.“We’ve reorganised all the classrooms that we’re using so the desks and chairs are two metres apart,” Patterson explains. “We’ve got designated areas set aside at break and lunchtime for each group to go to, and we’ve got signage around the school reminding everybody of the importance of hygiene, frequent hand washing and keeping their distance.”Implementing new measuresRheeya Makwana is one of the Year 12 students who has returned to Hinchingbrooke. “We’ve been having online lessons and voiceover PowerPoints, but it’s not really the same as being in a classroom,” she says. “The structure was really good and I felt like I learned a lot more being back at school. I came home in such a good mood.”Rheeya’s father Yogesh Makwana did have some initial worries about his daughter returning to school: “There’s always some concern, but all the communication from school has been excellent in the build up to it and all the measures that have been put in place have reassured us. If you offered our 13-year-old the chance to go back to school tomorrow, he’d do it in a heartbeat. He misses his classes the social interaction. He loves PE and he does so much at school that he misses.Year 10 pupils Vahine and Lucia will also be returning to the school this week. “The twins are really looking forward to it,” says their mother, Alesia Dickinson. “They’ve been messaging all their friends to find out what group they’re in. Less than a week after we said yes to going back we found out what bubbles they were in and we had clear guidelines about times, rooms and what they can expect when they go back to school. They’re raring to go.”Both Makwana and Dickinson agree that their children have missed the structure of school lessons and that the transition back to the classroom has been easier than expected. “I think it’s a positive thing,” says Dickinson. “I think it’s a step in the right direction. We need to let the children start that process.”Going back to Embark schoolsTrust leader at Embark Matthew Crawford, pictured below, has been welcoming back primary pupils to the Federation’s schools across Derbyshire.“The feedback we have had so far from all the schools across the Trust is that it’s going really well in terms of welcoming the children back,” he says. “It’s not a one-size-fits-all. Each school has done a risk assessment based on what they can do.”Most Embark schools are now back at around 25-30 per cent capacity, Crawford says. It\u0027s up from around two per cent when lockdown began, when it was just key workers’ children and more vulnerable pupils in the classroom.“It’s lovely to hear the children playing and see schools becoming vibrant again,” he adds. “As soon as lockdown began, we started work on our Reconnection to Recovery and Resilience programme, a nine-stage support package to welcome children back safely.”Keyworker Vicki Ellis has two children who have returned to one of Embark\u0027s schools Richardson Endowed Primary - Amelia in Year 3 and Darcey in Year 1, pictured below.The first day the girls were back I was wondering how they were all day. I knew the school had done everything possible to welcome the children back in a happy, positive way but I worried whether Amelia and Darcey were enjoying themselves. But when they came home they were so happy to have had that day at school – and eager to go back next day. Crawford explains that the school has tried to make the transition back to the classroom as fun as possible for the children: “We’re following the guidelines but in a way that’s fun for the children. We aren’t marking big Xs on the floor. Some of our schools, for example, are painting snakes in bright colours to show the way.”Embark has also shared its programme with schools as far as Devon, Durham, South Gloucestershire and Wales.“It’s a suite of resources and activities that schools can adapt to their own settings, taking the bits that work for them,” explains Crawford. “It’s lovely that the brilliant work of our staff is making a difference and impacting the lives of millions of children across the country, not just the 3,000 within our Trust.”Information in this article applies to schools in England only.

There have been more than 170 new cases of Covid-19 since last week, marking the biggest increase since the virus\u0027s spread was close to being eliminated in April.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Voting has begun across Russia on proposed constitutional reforms that would allow Vladimir Putin to rule until at least 2036.The vote is being brought to Russians via impromptu polling booths on park benches, on buses, in the boots of cars, in theatres and factories, and even in “hot zones” of Covid-19 hospitals. Voting will continue for an unprecedented seven days, and every day will see a lottery draw, raffling anything from supermarket vouchers to cars and apartments. Authorities insist that such creativity is a necessary response to the challenges posed in the era of the coronavirus. Opponents say the extraordinary measures to increase turnout demonstrate the unpopularity of Mr Putin’s decision to prioritise a power grab during a pandemic. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe vote, which was originally planned for 22 April before being rescheduled to this week, will ask Russians for a yes or no answer on over 200 new amendments to the country’s constitution.The most important of these proposed changes – the resetting of presidential term limits – has been routinely under-emphasised in voting literature, and in one case was even omitted. Official messages have concentrated instead on populist measures such as cementing marriage as a union of man and woman, emphasising the role of God, and guaranteeing indexation of pensions and other social payments. The vote is not a referendum per se the amendments have, in fact, already been passed by both parliaments. Pro-democracy groups say that the unclear classification of the vote is no accident. In a referendum, both sides are officially allowed to agitate for and against, and are entitled to airtime and finance. Not so in this campaign.  “The vote was specially set up to avoid any debate,” says Grigory Melkonyants, co-chairman of the independent Golos election monitoring group. “The government can de facto agitate for a yes vote with their campaign literature, but activists campaigning for a no vote are being arrested as we speak.” There have been several early reports of manipulations. Some of the claims related to age-old techniques: for example, evidence of forced voting at large enterprises, where vulnerable, low-paid workers are asked to vote under management supervision. But there were examples of newer tricks too. Earlier this month, a reporter at the liberal Dozhd television network exposed a fraudulent scheme that registered the details of pensioners on electronic voting websites, with the aim of then voting on their behalf. The reporter was summoned by state investigators for his trouble. In the early hours of Thursday morning, another reporter for the same channel managed to vote twice — electronically and in person. That reporter would be fined 30,000 roubles (£350), election authorities confirmed. No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe wide array of voting methods being employed during the week-long vote will make assessing its fairness difficult. Not only is electronic voting possible in two cities – Moscow and Niznny Novgorod – but mobile voting at home and at work is being allowed without extenuating circumstances for the first time. There will be limited scope for independent oversight monitors will only be permitted from regional isions of the Public Chamber, a quasi-governmental organisation. “The vote is deliberately being held in the grey zone,” says Mr Melkonyants. “Those who want to cheat have a huge number of options, and it will be impossible to catch them.” Authorities at all levels, and across Russia’s 11 time zones, understand the importance of securing good numbers for the president. Acceptable figures vary “according to the levels of cynicism” of inidual actors, says Tatyana Stanovaya, director of political analysis firm RPolitik. For some, like Moscow’s mayor, Sergei Sobyanin, the target for yes votes is likely 70 per cent. For others, like Chechen president, Ramzan Kadyrov, the target will be nearer 100 per cent. “Overall, there is a sense that any result below 65 per cent would be a bad result,” Ms Stanovaya suggests.It seems a stretch to believe that the president would reach those figures in an entirely free election. A recent poll by the independent Levada Centre indicated that of those who were sure they would vote, 55 per cent would support the presidential amendments. But that figure drops below 50 per cent when it takes in all voters. Another poll by the same organisation suggested that just 25 per cent of Russians would vote for the amendments if they had a chance to vote for alternatives. Levada Centre is not the only polling organisation to register a haemorrhaging of support away from Russia’s president over recent years. How 20 years of Putin has shaped Russia and the worldAt the peak of his ratings, a year after the annexation of Crimea in June 2015, Mr Putin was supported by nine out of every 10 Russians. The same “closed” question elicits a positive answer from only 59 per cent today, and just 8 per cent of youngsters. In open polling, where respondents are asked to name the politicians they most trust for themselves – in what is considered most indicative of a free choice – Mr Putin was named by just 29 per cent of Russians. Sociologists at Levada registered the biggest falls following Mr Putin’s decision to push through unpopular pension reforms in 2018. Ms Stanovaya, however, traces the roots of an erosion of trust to 2017, when focus groups began to indicate growing disillusionment with the Kremlin’s focus on foreign campaigns in Syria and Ukraine.“The new challenges of the pandemic, low oil prices, and the constitution are catalysts for a process of erosion that began much earlier,” she says. Judging by the rush to get the vote done in the face of the pandemic, the fear among many in power would seem to be that the position is about to get even worse. “This is essentially a special operation from Putin, and special operations are all about reducing risks and mobilising quickly,” says Ms Stanovaya. “Waiting until the autumn would have meant inviting instability, the risk of a second coronavirus wave and social unrest that no one really knows how to deal with.” Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

You can now at last be within ft in of someone outside your immediate household! What’s more, from July , you will be able to eat in restaurants, have a drink and, of course, continue shopping.⚠️ Read our coronavirus live blog for the latest news  updatesWhat you won’t be able to do, unless you are very fortunate, is to get your children into school, which says something about our national priorities. Make no mistake about it, this is a “national emergency”. Education should have the upfront priority that we rightly give the NHS and saving our economy. The failure since the beginning of March to plan ahead for getting all schools and all youngsters back into the classroom has been reprehensible.I say all schools because the majority have been open for the children of key workers and for children designated as vulnerable.Many teachers have been doing a first-class job trying to keep in touch with children at home, providing them with online tuition, homework and marking. But there is still time to mobilise all the necessary resources to make it possible to get children back to school for at least a couple of weeks before the end of this term.Yes, it would involve finding extra premises for schools with inadequate space. Yes, we would have to appeal to teachers who have recently retired to come back for perhaps a few hours a week. Yes, we would need to employ supply teachers.In addition we could use university students, who won’t be finding summer jobs any time soon, to assist.Of course, we don’t have that reliable summer weather that will allow teaching outside on a regular basis, butDenmark can place many lessons in an outside setting, we can.If the French, Lord help us, can get their schools mobilised and back to full operation, we can. Their trade unions are far more bolshy than ours, and teachers regrettably much less well paid.So we need a combination of creativity, imagination and drive to get pupils back. We need to rebuild the confidence of parents and staff that they are highly unlikely to contract the virus from the children, or of the children passing it on to each other.That way, we can have ironed out the glitches and be ready in September to be absolutely on the ball. Small group tutoring for recovery programmes, mentoring not just organised centrally, but co-ordinated locally.For anyone who doesn’t believe that two or three weeks matter in terms of education, when children have been out of school since the middle of March, then think again. This is about equality, narrowing the gap between the haves and have-nots, and opening a window on the world. But it is also more than that. It’s a place of social interaction, of well-being and of safety. Don’t take my word for it. Take the word of the Royal College of Paediatricians, the people whose whole le is spent on the well-being of children. They are very clear: Schools must , children need each other as well as their teachers.The recognition of the importance of schools was something I was proud to oversee in , when the incoming government’s priority slogan was, “education, education, education”.Don’t get me wrong. The belated announcement last week of a one per cent uplt for all schools and a £million pot for an online recovery programme is extremely welcome. A pity, therefore, that in making a really great announcement, the Government managed not to put any money aside for the  to -year-olds in further education, who are surely the target group we would want to be helping the most.So, thank you to all those who have done everything they can to keep the wheels on the cart over the past dficult three and a half months. But now we need both national leadership and local organisation. To use an old adage, we need to think national but we need to act local. Education trusts, local authorities, teachers’ unions and all those committed to the future of this nation should want to come together to make it work.In the next ten days, while the Government thinks about its advice, others can get on with the job. Take what is working best and spread it.What can work in France or Denmark or Germany can certainly work here. We are not out of the woods yet, but we can take logical, rational and brave decisions. That is what leadership is all about.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But it’s never quite the same.And therein lies the rub when you marry someone from another country.At first your initial attraction and then love for each other transcends geographical or cultural dferences.But when children come along and you’re required to stay in one place, inevitably one of you has to give up more than the other.Meghan tried it, albeit for a very short time, and now Harry is the one living thousands of miles away from his family and the only le he’s ever known.He made the decision to step down as a senior royal and decamp to the US for the sake of his new family — Meghan and Archie — but that doesn’t make it any less tough to see the old one ticking over nicely without him.A couple of years ago, I was in a central London restaurant with a group of other married couples and, much to the annoyance of we wives, the husbands couldn’t take their eyes off a woman sitting at the bar.Wearing the shortest of dresses, her legs were encircled around the object of her affections and her tongue made frequent visits to his ear.I recognised the man as actor Stephen Campbell Moore, ex-husband of The Crown star Claire Foy, and his obviously smitten companion as Sophie Cookson, who played Christine Keeler in last year’s BBC drama about the Profumo scandal.Fast forward to lockdown and this photo, suggests the couple may now be expecting their first child.The fond arrival of which will mean a heavy-hearted goodbye to those late-night, lust-filled liaisons that had the rest of us drooling with envy.Kaiser Chiefs frontman Ricky Wilson says he amuses himself by lying in interviews then changing his Wikipedia page to match his inventions.It reminds me of my stint as a royal correspondent when, after days of being on the road together, we would challenge each other to use silly names in stories.Hence, “Toby Lerone” was quoted in an article filed from the royals’ favourite ski resort in Switzerland, and in another story to do with Italy, “Sam Buca” made an appearance.Daft, I know, but it amused usno one .Mr Pendragon, who refuses to pay to park, says they stopped him from leaving his car on nearby roads.Shouldn’t he have been on horseback Bored by St Tropez, billionaires are reportedly snapping up “expedition yachts” that will take them to more adventurous corners of the globe.The one owned by US billionaire Ray Dalio has three deep-ing submersibles, and converted former Soviet spy boat Olivia is currently on the market for £million.Back home, lock-down quarantine rules have forced a  per cent rise in multi-millionaire Brits splashing their cash on vast private pools.Meanwhile, the rest of us will make do with a boat in the bath and a paddling pool.Sarah Ferguson – aka Prince Andrew’s ex we – is building up quite a following on her YouTube channel, where she reads children’s books such as The Wonky Donkey and Little Red Riding Hood while wearing fancy dress.Her success is no surprise, because on the many occasions I’ve seen her at charity events, she always connects brilliantly with the children in attendance.But personally, I can’t wait for her to get round to the critically acclaimed Idan Hadari book about a boy who wants to be famous.It’s called Andrew’s Claim To Fame.Or, in the Duke of York’s case, should that be infamy Yep. She now looks about .When -year-old Khairi Saadallah started his alleged kne rampage in a Reading park, a young, off-duty police officer ran towards the danger and rugby tackled him to the ground.It was a selfless act of bravery that, according to sources, saved “many more people dying”.Meanwhile, a judge has praised the bravery of PC Andrew Harper, who died after being dragged along by a car as he chased some thieves.Both of these are salutary reminders that, while every police force in the world has a few bad apples, the majority of those working in law enforcement are undeniably courageous people doing a tough job that most of us would shy away from.The latest money-making exercise candle from Gwyneth Paltrow is called This Smells Like My Orgasm.Which, as you ask, is “tart grapefruit, neroli, and ripe cassis berries blended with gunpowder tea and Turkish rose absolutes”. Er, right.Like its highly successful predecessor This Smells Like My Vagina candle – which, for the blissfully unaware, is “geranium, citrusy bergamot, and cedar absolutes juxtaposed with Damask rose and ambrette seed” – it costs£.Clearly, she’s a sales genius who could flog underwear to a nudist, but one suspects any attempt to branch out with a, to put it politely, Smells Like My Winkle range might prove a tougher sell.Hmmm.

The Prime Minister announced that we were at last allowed out of our Great British Hibernation.We can go to the pub, buy useless tat in shops and queue up for plaster lawn ornaments from garden centres. We can have the in-laws round to visit! Yoot!⚠️ Read our coronavirus live blog for the latest news  updatesBoris says that his decision was made on good scientic advice. Hmm, maybe. It is true that the infection rate for Covid has been dropping rapidly for some time. But it’s still there, still hanging around with mischief on its mind. All it takes is one person in a gathering of  or  at some pizza joint and that infection rate will be up again quickly enough.In some of the countries that have released their people from lockdown, a second spike has occurred.In Germany the famous “R” rate for infection is well above the dreaded one. South Korea and Spain have seen new outbreaks, too.But the truth is Boris didn’t have much of an option. The public is bored stf and the economy is wrecked.I suspect the decision was arrived at on those grounds, rather than strictly on the science. Everyone wants to go out and spend money. I am not sure why they do.  There were good things about lockdown — and it taught us one or two truths about ourselves.It was a pleasure to hear the birds singing, for example. A real delight to see the roads free from traffic. The skies are full of swts and swallows instead of the incessant airline flights. The quality of the air we breathe improved hugely as a result. So did the water quality of rivers and streams.We went out much, much less. As a consequence, many people saved an awful lot of money because they weren’t wasting it on buying rubbish from shops.People learned to cook — and ate home-prepared meals with their families. The truth is, in normal times, we eat out far more often than is good for us, financially or otherwise. And we shopped locally — the corner stores did a roaring trade — and less often, thus saving carbon emissions.Employers discovered that people could work from home perfectly well. Hopefully this will persuade some to scale back their offices and give people the chance to work from home.Imagine how many homes could be created from disused offices! We wouldn’t have to pave over half the country to sort out our housing crisis. Imagine cutting out the daily commute for ever!We didn’t have to hug people. Indeed, we were barred by law from hugging people. Or kissing them on the bloody cheek, like everyone in the media world does. That, by itself, was a huge bonus for me.My wish is that we take some of that stuff from lockdown and make it the new normal. Live at a quieter, gentler pace. Continue to eat at home — and support our local corner shops. Use the car less. Spend less money on a whole load of b******s we don’t really need. Use aeroplanes not at all, preferably. Right now, the Government has given us licence to go out and do stuff.Here’s my plea. Let’s do a bit less stuff than we used to. Let’s remain kind of half in and half out of lockdown. Whether Covid is still around or not. We’ll end up happier as a result.ONE thing Captain Tom showed us, as he walked around his garden as he approached the age of , is that it’s never too late to make a dference.Bob Dylan is just a young whippersnapper by Tom’s standards.But at the age of  he has just made his finest album in at least three decades, and probably more. Rough And Rowdy Ways is a joy to listen to – and I’d given up on the bloke in the s.If I ever reach  I intend to make a grime album with Rihanna. Get your orders in now.The United Nations has decided to give them to Mauritius. That’s because the islands are nearer Mauritius than they are to the UK. On that basis we could have a good claim to owning Belgium. The islands are important to the UK militarily. And we should keep them. The UN has given us deadlines to hand them over to a country that never owned them. What we should do instead is leave the crooked UN.EXCLUDED from the Government’s loosening of lockdown are Britain’s vibrant community of werewolves and vampires.“It is all very well biting someone’s neck, or ripping their lungs out while howling loudly,” a scientist advising the Government probably said. “But when they do this there is the risk that the virus could be passed on via droplets from the creature’s mouth. Or indeed paws – werewolves do not have a good record of using hand-sanitiser.”By contrast, zombies were praised for their social-distancing technique. “Whenever you see them they are always walking two metres apart with their hands outstretched and bits of flesh falling off their faces,” the same scientist probably added.A spokesman for the National Association of Lycanthropescommented: “This is typical of the prejudice we werewolves face and amounts to discrimination. Actually, I thought I had the virus a few weeks ago. Nasty cough and so on.“But I’m all right nooooowwwwwwooooo.”THE day after the woke ninnies at Warners withdrew the great Hollywood film Gone With The Wind because of “race issues”, guess what happened  Yup, it became the No bestselling film on Amazon. Better still, it reached No in the AppleiTunes chart for TV and film. Not bad for a movie made more than  years ago, huh I suppose it could have been “progressives” buying the film so that they would have something to be outraged about. Or maybe the Ku Klux Klan Film Club has a bigger membership than we thought.More likely though is that people loathe censorship. They don’t like being told what they can and can’t watch. Truth be told it hasn’t been for a good  years. And the process accelerated under Magic Grandpa and his front bench of mouth-breathing dingbats. Now it’s the well-orf who support Labour. And the poor who vote Conservative. But there aren’t enough people called Olly and Poppy in the country, which is why Labour hasn’t won an election for  years. Unless it reconnects with the people it was set up to support, the working class, it won’t win one for another few decades either.A SOCIAL media site had a big hit when it asked people to reveal things they regretted about getting married. The site, Whisper, was inundated with replies. Most were kind of: “I just wish I hadn’t married the fat bastard, full stop.”But some wished they’d had a fling with someone of the same sex first, or felt aggrieved they hadn’t checked out the in-laws first. That was quite a big issue.

The Seventies brought Led Zeppelin and countless rock bands, it gave us heavy metal and punk and Joy Division pretty much all at the same time.The biggest-selling album of the Eighties, Michael Jackson’s Thriller, was actually written by a bloke from Hull, while British greats as erse as Duran Duran and The Smiths ruled the waves.In the Cool Britannia of the Nineties, when Britpop was ringing out of radio networks worldwide, even American stars such as Madonna sought help from British producers such as Nellee Hooper and William Orbit.Then there were the Spice Girls. And Coldplay. Now we’ve got Ed Sheeran and Adele. And it doesn’t stop with artists. Love him or hate him, Simon Cowell’s TV programmes are another British global music phenomenon.But it’s live music where Britain really dominates today. Glastonbury should be taking place this weekend.I’ve played at just about every major festival on the planet, from Coachella in the US to Fuji Rock in Japan, but there is nowhere to touch Glastonbury.It is, quite simply, the greatest show on earth There is a massive ripple effect from Glastonbury. It sets a very high bar for the other  — that’s  — festivals that happen throughout the UK every single summer.And the same crews who build the stages, operate the sound systems, put up the fences and supply the bogs for Glasto are busy for the rest of the summer at other events.Now the independent festival sector is at risk of collapse thanks to the Covid shutdown.Last month, the Association of Independent Festivals , which represents  festivals in the UK, reported that  per cent of its members were facing costs that could ruin their businesses and . per cent were uninsured for Covid- related cancellations.Most of my time these days is spent planning and organising The Big Feastival, which was due to take place here on my farm in Oxfordshire this August Bank Holiday weekend.Of course I’m devastated it won’t be going ahead, but the really sad thing is that it looks like no one is going to hear any live music, new or old this summer.That’s a tragedy for the musicians who rely on gigging to make a living — as well as all the other people whose income relies on live music.The Musicians’ Union says its members have lost more than £million in income during the lockdown. Remember, that most musicians just scrape by at the best of times.Big stars are bigger than ever before, but they are the exception not the rule. When Adele releases another record there is a danger she will become so massive she will collapse into a black hole.But now bands need an audience to play to and also financial support, which used to come from record companies but now is hard to find.Records, or downloads, are basically free these days, so live shows are the only real way to make money.In the same way restaurants were already struggling before lockdown, many of Britain’s smaller live music venues were struggling too.So most of the places I played in the early days with Blur have already dis- appeared. They need to be able to open their doors again, as do festivals.It has to be possible to find a way. Just as with pubs, restaurants and cinemas, you could limit the number of people allowed into a venue.Perhaps more gigs could be seated to ensure social distancing. Not quite the same, but better than nothing.As far as the rest of the planet is concerned, Britain is represented pretty much by the Royal Family, football and music.We must keep our festival circuit alive and nurture new artists.That means we urgently have to find a way for music to be played to a live audience, evenit’s only a small one — so that we can keep meaning something to the rest of the world.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But his determination to do what is right by the children made the real dference.Contrast that with the union militants and council leaders of the Left.

But this is the Government’s vision for our summer as it tries to save businesses while keeping us safe.To which we say: Well, good luck with that. We understand the reasoning.

Wildle department officers plan to lure the creatures into cages and take them to a clinic, where they will be sedated, sterilised and left with a tattoo to mark their neutering. They aim to neuter  of them by Friday.It is thought there may be some pushback from residents who have grown accustomed to the monkeys, despite the problems they have caused recently.

He said: Im used to seeing them walking around, playing on the street.If theyre all gone, Id definitely be lonely.Narongporn Daudduem from the wildle department acknowledges locals will have to give their consent.

We are pretty sure he was knocked unconscious under the water and he didn’t come back up again. “Ralph and I saw what was happening and we climbed over and started trying to pull him out. “His friend also climbed over and tried to pull him out, he was unconscious. “We were telling them to pull his head out of the water, and Ralph was trying to do that and had a hold of him and was swimming alongside him. “His friend then lost his grip on him and he started getting pushed down the river because of the current. “A fisherman jumped in and helped us to grab him and pull him out to put him on the side of the river. “That was when someone  started to perform CPR on him, the ambulance service were telling them what to do on the phone. “I tried to do CPR but I wasn’t strong enough so I asked for help. “After all of this another one of his friends had tried to save him by grabbing the leguard ring and ing in. “We were all focusing on the first man we didn’t realise the second one had been swept away.“Because my friends and I go there quite a lot we know to avoid the middle of the river because of the hotspots. “But these guys didn’t know where they shouldn’t jump and got sucked into the current.“I’ve been going there for a long time and nothing like this has ever happened before.”Ralph added: “A group of us were at the weir and suddenly I heard the guys screaming, three of them were in the water and one was unconscious. “They were trying to get him out, and when I heard the screaming I jumped in and climbed down the weir and tried to help them pull him out. “His head was really under the water, his friend seemed to lose his grip on him and he went even further under the water. “As he went down the river someone helped us to get him on the bank and then an older guy performed CPR on him. “I’m glad he’s alive, I know he’s in the hospital but I hope he is okay. There was a lot going on at that moment. “The part that they jumped into was probably the most dangerous part of the weir, we did try to find his friend but we didn’t want to risk it when we know what the currents are like. “It’s generally a pretty safe place to go and swim but I don’t think we will be going back there again.”Both boys jumped back in to try to save Syrian refugee Eyad after he had also tried to save his pal. Other members of the Syrian community in West London also travelled to the riverbank after learning their friend, , who lives in Uxbridge, had gone missing.Jacks mum Nicola Thomas said: “It’s heartbreaking for the boys to see all of this, and for the family of the man that it’s happened to. “I didn’t know whether to shout at Jack or hug him at first, because he’s put himself in danger jumping in but I am proud of him. “They definitely saved his le, there is no doubt about that.”The tragedy came as temperatures soared to around C on Tuesday as Britains heatwave continues.Officials from the Royal Berkshire Fire and Rescue Service said crews were at the riverside for almost three-and-a-half hours.A spokesman said: We are urging residents across Berkshire to take care near water.As the warm weather continues, it may be tempting to swim in open water, but there are many dangers involved.One of the main risks when entering the water is cold water shock, eventhe weather is warm.You also do not know what is beneath the surface – there could be unseen currents and reeds, which could pull you under.”LPA Commander for Windsor  Maidenhead, Superintendent Colin Hudson, said: “Officers have been working tirelessly with our partners to locate the man who entered the water yesterday, and have now tragically found a body.“We are grateful for the support we received from both Berkshire and Buckinghamshire Fire and Rescue Services, South Central Ambulance Service, and Berkshire Lowland Search and Rescue.“I would also like to thank members of the public who provided information as well as assistance to my officers.“I would like to thank them for their patience while officers investigated this incident, and we will be leaving the scene shortly.“I am very sorry to have to bring this sad news.“Our thoughts are with both men’s families during this very upsetting time.”GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I mean, I’ve only been able to see Dear Evan Hansen  times so far.And Christmas won’t be the same without the uniquely British tradition of the winter panto. How will all those former boyband stars fund their showbiz lestyles for another year Sadly, post-Covid restrictions look particularly cruel to the arts.Those dastardly droplets mean singing is banned and the idea of packing out a historic theatre where the tiny seats mean you are virtually sitting on top of your neighbour just won’t cut it.But in the middle of an international health emergency it’s all too easy to dismiss the importance of stage shows, movies, the TV industry, festivals and concerts.The attitude seems to be: “We’re dying, goddammit, the economy is cratering, don’t talk to me about the bloody theatre!”But that approach will mean Britain is cakewalking into a cultural catastrophe that could wipe off decades of creative progress, end our modern domination of the arts and entertainment and see the closure of most historic theatres before the end of the year.If that is yet another horrid consequence of Covid-, a disease most likely spread because of a despicable Chinese wet market, I will be fuming.Dame Judi Denchs warning that theatres may not open again in her letime is as stark as it is horrying.It would wipe out £.billion of annual ticket sales, see , good folk lose their jobs and damage tourism.While the pressure is building by the day on the Government to launch yet another unprecedented rescue package, I think that’s only part of the answer.Entertainment is a big-money industry dominated by super-wealthy moguls who have a responsibility to look after as many of their loyal staff and young creatives as humanly possible.Now is the time for other celebrities and businesspeople who have earned a small fortune from the creative industries to give back.Where are all those Hollywood stars, with hundreds of millions in the bank, who rush to perform on the West End stage to be seen as a real actor, dahling Surely they could donate a tiny portion of their wealth to set up a private rescue fund for theatres For example, Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the South Park creators who are behind The Book Of Mormon, are worth a billion bucks.JK Rowling, whose Harry Potter play The Cursed Child is at the Palace Theatre, has a £million fortune.We Will Rock You producer Robert de Niro has £million in the bank, Sister Act producer and star Whoopi Goldberg £million, and West End favourite Dame Helen Mirren £million.I could name a hundred other multi-millionaire stars who have used the West End to enhance their careers who owe it to the backroom staff on the breadline to be part of the solution.Thankfully, the king of theatre — Lord Lloyd-Webber — has, as ever, proved inspirational and innovative.Without being asked, he is putting his money where his mouth is to PROVE to the Government that it is possible to safely reopen theatres WITHOUT ANY social distancing by using enhanced precautions such as temperature checks on the door and face masks for all audience members.The Government must listen to him and embrace his case study of Phantom Of The Opera, which has remained open in South Korea throughout the pandemic with no issues.Otherwise, we risk the curtain coming down for good.BACKING down so quickly on extending Sunday trading hours was a disappointing move forced by Tory backbenchers.While on first glance the idea of allowing supermarkets and other shops to stay open longer on our day of rest sounds unappealing to many workers, the reality is that this change would have probably saved many jobs in the long run.It’s nonsensical that on one day of the week most Tescos can only open for six hours, while international delivery services such as Amazon continue to decimate their business, especially now with social-distancing measures making it even more unappealing to spend time lining up outside.By contrast, the other night I was able to order an Amazon Prime Now delivery to arrive at my house at pm on a Sunday night.I’d ordered an Uber Eats takeaway from McDonald’s two hours earlier.The archaic current trading hours laws were introduced in , the year Jeff Bezos created a fledgling online book store called Amazon.Like it or not, that business has created a dferent world of consumerism.Compromises to allow workers the option not to take on more Sunday work, leaving the additional hours to those who want to earn extra cash, could make the necessary move more palatable.But let’s not avoid having the debate.THE Culture Secretary has so much on his plate that Shirley Ballas used an innovative approach to attract his attention this week – and it worked.Launching an impassioned plea to Oliver Dowden to “safely open” ballroom dance studios on my talkRADIO Drivetime show, the Strictly Come Dancing judge teased: “If Oliver is out there, I don’t even mind having a cha-cha-cha with him to show him it is possible to social distance.”Clearly the power of the Queen of Latin remains undiminished.Within hours, Oliver had tweeted: “Shirley, as a Strictly fan, I’m happy to talk about how we can get dancing going safely again. Great offer on the cha-cha-cha – I’ll get practising.”Expect dance studios to be back in business imminently, then.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Being from the UK, it’s one of those gigs I think everyone wants to do. Hopefully next year.“But no f***ing way am I camping. No way. I’d have to build a house for it to work.“I’ve been to so many festivals with my mates but I’ve not done any camping stuff.“I’ve got the worst OCD so I wouldn’t be camping at all. That’s probably why I don’t have crazy stories from festivals.”Essex-born Jonas, whose real name is Guy James Robin, has cemented himself as one of the biggest names in dance music in the past five years, selling more than million records.Today he’s back with summer anthem Naked, featuring US singer MAX, but it won’t be part of a bigger collection after he decided releasing full albums is no longer for him.Jonas said: “I’m not going to be doing an album any time soon. I really enjoy doing singles. I can move quickly with them, especially in the world that I’m in, because the trends are forever changing.“I’m not planning to saturate the market with loads of records, it’s just about putting Naked out and that being my biggest record to date, I hope.”Jonas hopes the song will be “uplting” for people as we come out of lockdown. But as someone who knows nightclubs better than anyone , he insisted there is no chance they can reopen anytime soon.He explained: “Clubs will not work, how can you tell , drunk people to stand a metre or two metres apart  It’s never going to f***ing work.“It wouldn’t work with meI’d had a few drinks. I wouldn’t even know what two metres is at that point.”SHE is usually a Glasto regular and it’s a good bet you will find her partying into the early hours, but Rita Ora will have to make do with her back garden this weekend.The How To Be Lonely singer shared this photo on Instagram while sunbathing at home in her bra in the scorching temperatures.But she didn’t put as much thought into what she’d be wearing as she would have doneshe was heading to Somerset.She captioned the snap: “Can’t find my bikini.”It must have been a welcome relief for her to get outside though, having spent lockdown working hard on new music.She posted another photo of her home studio, where it was C, and wrote: “Hope you are all having fun outside enjoying the sun, meanwhile we’re cutting vocals with no air con.”Just think about all the tunes you’ll have to perform by the time you hit Worthy Farm next year, Rita.The superstar had said her album would be coming in September but her manager has now confirmed it is being pushed back, partly because the coronavirus crisis prevented her from finishing it.Jonathan Dickins said: “It isn’t coming in September. It’ll be ready when it’s ready.“We’re all in the same boat. You’re doing stuff and then suddenly the world stops.“It’ll come when it’s ready. We have music but we’re still working.”It’s been five years since her third album  was released, while January will mark a decade since her breakthrough record  which sold million copies to become one of the biggest records of all time.If Adele has taught us anything with her music, it’s that it will certainly be worth the wait.LITTLE MIX’s Jesy Nelson probably wouldn’t get very far across Worthy Farm in these shoes.She showed off slippers made to look like her pet pooches on Instagram, amid hopes the girl group could be signed up for next year’s festival.They are expected to have released their sixth album by then and could be a perfect signing for a team eager for more female artists.Jesy said in : “We would love to do Glastonbury, it would be incredible for us to do that. I think we’d be able to get a new audience that maybe we don’t have, people who aren’t too sure about Little Mix. We could prove them wrong, change their mind.”The singer, whose song Blue Jumper is out today, was picked up while supporting the band on tour but almost didn’t get to play for a music boss in the crowd.She said: “I’d gone over a little bit on my set. I was about to do my one hit and the stage director said, ‘You need to finish now’.“The head of Universal had just arrived. Richard ran over and was like, ‘No, let her play another’.”FOO FIGHTERS’ incredible  headline set is among a load of performances stream-ing through iPlayer over the weekend. You can also see Beyonce, David Bowie, Blur, George Ezra, Arctic Monkeys and more.THIS year’s festival was due to be the biggest yet but organiser Emily Eavis has insisted ticket holders are in for a bumper event when it s next year.She said they are hoping to roll over much of this year’s line-up, but had already booked loads of acts for , which may even mean making the festival longer.Emily said: “We’re rolling two festivals together for . We’ve got a hell of a lot of surprises and things that we were planning for the thand we’re going to try to get those things going for next year.“Logistically it’s a little bit complicated because we’d already pencilled in many of the acts for . It was one of those very unusual years where you’re quite far ahead, two years ahead, on the line-up. So we’re trying to work out how much we can fit into next year.“We’ve had lots of amazing letters from people with ideas of how we could make it into like a two-week holiday or run over three weekends. There’s lots of ideas going.”Taylor Swt Kendrick Lamar and Sir Paul McCartney were due to headline this weekend and Emily is hoping they will all be back, especially Beatles legend Paul.She said on BBC  Music: “I really hope he’ll be back next year singing it from the Pyramid and we’ll all be in tears, going, ‘It’s happened, we’re back’.”Me too.SIMON BOYLE - COLDPLAY : THEIR fourth time as headline act and they proved to be one of the greatest ever. CHRIS MARTIN and co won over even the most sceptical festivalgoer and had people in tears with their performance, complete with confetti, light-up bracelets and fireworks.JOE KASPER - DAVE : IT wasn’t just his fantastic performance but meeting his fan Alex Mann, who he got up from the crowd to rap his song Thiago Silva. It was enough to convert workmates I had dragged along to become fans of the Mercury Prize winner and, dare I say, grime.HOWELL DAVIES - LORDE : AT only , she proved to be a cut above when she delivered a standout set, partly from within a huge glass box suspended on stage. The Kiwi’s rousing tracks were lapped up and her visuals included dancers, lasers and clouds of smoke.ELLIE HENMAN - LEWIS CAPALDI : THE moment he swaggered on dressed as Noel Gallagher, I knew this set would be my highlight. At the end he told the massive crowd: “If you haven’t enjoyed it keep it to your f***ing self.” Safe to say, everyone loved it.KESHA has released a tribute to Marc Bolan of T.Rex, who headlined the first Glasto in .

Gradually build up time spent apart.Animals have sensitive noses and using pet-specic cleaning products in the home can be helpful to reduce their anxiety.Making sure there are no harsh smells will lower tension levels and allows your pet to relax. .Keep cat litter trays clean, and for very attached pets, especially puppies, leaving something with your scent on, like a T-shirt or old towel, can be soothing.Playing gentle music at a low volume can help to distract from any unfamiliar noises that may worry them.There are even pet podcasts available.Pets who knew le before lockdown should slip back into previous family routines eventually.Cats are already more solitary creatures, and dogs should cope wellyou prepare them properly.However, puppies that have only ever known lockdown, or dogs that have become too used to your company, may find it more challenging.A good way to help them adjust is by pretending to go back to work. Put on office clothes or a school unorm and act out your pre-lockdown morning routines.Go through the motions of leaving for work. Pick up your car keys, settle your pet, then close the door and leave them, evenyou only go and sit in the garden or take a walk.You might feel silly, but this can be really helpful for your pet, especiallythey have only ever seen you in your “off-duty”, stay-home outfits.When you come back in it’s vital that you wait until your pet is calm before greeting them, whether that takes five minutes or five hours.Don’t join in OTT celebrations or encourage reunion “zoomies”, as long- term this can enhance anxious behaviour and increase stress levels.By taking things slowly your pet won’t find the transition back to post-lockdown le too dficult.However,furry friends don’t seem to be settling well and you encounter signs of anxiety, such as toilet issues, high heart rates, constant chewing or scratching, it’s worth seeking advice from a qualied animal behaviourist apbc.org.uk or your vet.A remote camera can give clues to situations you might not be aware of, such as noises, that could be troubling your pet in your absence.With everyone at home constantly during lockdown, our pets may have struggled to rest properly.Cats famously like to snooze but dogs also need up to  hours of sleep a day and may have found lockdown exhausting.Sometimes pets are actually anxious because our constant company means they are over-tired and over-stimulated and now can’t think straight.For all pets it is up to us to ensure they are not disturbed when they are taking time out.Cats are generally good at taking themselves off to cat nap so just leave them to rest, but dogs often need a bit more help to switch off.Don’t fuss over them while they catch some sleep and help children to understand that when their best friend is snoozing, they need to be left in peace.For dogs in particular, lockdown may have changed their exercise routines dramatically, with some getting more frequent or far longer walks than previously.Start to readjust this now, to correlate daily timetables with your regular routines ing.If you normally walk your dog at specic times of the day, such as before and after work, then resume going for walkies on this schedule.Oryou normally use a dog walker or have help from another person during the day, make the effort to introduce them now, especiallyyou have a pet who hasn’t met them yet.If you are one of the many new pet owners who got a puppy or kitten during lockdown you’ve had a lovely honeymoon period to bond with your new buddy.However, it also means it’s likely your pet has never spent any time home alone.Before leaving you new addition solo, you must do sufficient training to ensure your puppy or kitten understands that being separated from you is OK.With puppies, build up slowly to ensure they are happy and get used to the idea of being handled by other people and socialising with other dogs.You can stay with your pupthey are more confident with you around but don’t allow them to be clingy and always reward positive, confident behaviour.For cats, six months is the ideal age to start training with a cat flapyou plan to use one.Professional help with training is now permitted again under government rules and is strongly advised.A bored pet can be an anxious pet. If they are under-stimulated their minds wander and your home can suffer the consequences – so keep them busy.For dogs, toys stuffed with treats, or scattering snacks into their bed to hunt, will give them something to do.There are also tutorials online for making home-made games and toys.For cats, include circuits and teasers to prevent your furniture being damaged.Rotate dferent ones daily, so there is always something new for your pet to investigate and play with.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Asked whether she still supported her predecessor John McDonnell’s plan to raise taxes for the top % of earners, she admitted: “I certainly think we need to have a more progressive tax system. “We’ve just gone through a situation where so many people have made enormous sacrices. “After that kind of a situation we do need to make sure that those who are making a contribution are those with the broadest shoulders. “Some of those suggestions that have been swirling around about generalised tax increases should not be what Government should be aiming at.” She added: “We’ve seen lots of cuts to taxation for the very best off people and I think right now those who can make that bigger contribution, should do.”  The Oxford East MP also suggested Labour could increase corporation tax - saying cuts had “not delivered” the additional investment promised. Calling for a thorough review, she that most small businesses were more concerned about business rates. She suggested sticking to some elements of the controversial re-nationalistation pledge - saying it had become “increasingly evident” that the broadband system wasn’t working. “We don’t have that provision across the country at the level it needs to be. The Government really needs to get a grip on that.”Ms Dodds warned that Boris Johnson ’s Government was in danger of acting too late in its handling of the next stage of the crisis, which has claimed at least , lives and tipped the country towards recession.“If we look at other countries, we have been quite slow with the health response. I’m concerned that we might be too slow with the economic response as well,” she said. She called for the furlough job support scheme, which starts to wrap up from July, to be extended for targeted sectors including pubs and leisure that are unable to reopen fully. “We shouldn’t be having the same approach adopted across the economy... we are going to see additional waves of unemployment unfortunately so Government needs to change that.” she said. There should be more support for those who had already lost their jobs and a nationwide programme to create new ones, which would “not necessarily” cost more but should be aimed at those who need it most. In the interview in Stevenage town centre which she visited with Mr Starmer, Ms Dodds backed the Mirror’s ‘Shop for Britain’ campaign which urges people to support local businesses. “High streets are really critical to communities. You can feel a little bit of the buzz coming back here but where people can be shopping locally it makes such a dference because that means the value stays in our communities,” she said.Brexit trade deal “I’m concerned about no deal because lots of businesses have been through such a dficult period during this crisis. If they have yet another disruption at the end of the year that would be very dficult. The Government has promised it will get that deal so we’re saying please make sure you do, the success of British business depends on it. We need to see what comes out of their negotiations. If they don’t reach that agreement then obviously we’ll try to make sure we don’t end up in a situation where business is harmed further, where more jobs are lost. We accept that our policy around Brexit was not one that persuaded the country.” Black Lives Matter “We’ve seen so many dferent reviews which have shown there is inequality, there is discrimination, so many recommendations about what needs to change and yet what has actually changed  Very little. The Government has announced yet another review but we know what isn’t working. Let’s just get on and fix it. There are big inequalities in the health and economic impact of this crisis. We need to do something about that. People felt that honouring certain iniduals in the way a statue does was deeply offensive, particularlythat suggested some of the practices around slavery were acceptable. I can fully understand that concern. There’s been a long argument around Cecil Rhodes in my own city for a very long time. It’s very clear that there’s an overwhelming consensus in favour of Rhodes not being honoured in that way.” Women in politics “There seems to be a big gap when it comes to engagement in economic questions. Sometimes I’d be sitting in the Commons when we’re talking about financial matters, and it’s not like these issues don’t affect women. What’s critical to me is whether we have leadership that wants to hear from women and represent women - ultimately a leader who is a feminist and I know that Keir is. Social media can be a wonderful thing but because it’s easy to be anonymous the kind of abuse that women can get is really concerning. It really shouldn’t be a barrier to people becoming engaged.” Climate change “We’ve learnt during this crisis that there can be theoretical risks which suddenly affect us very deeply. With the climate crisis we know we’re having record-breaking temperatures with increased frequency. Just last year the heatwaves we had were associated with quite a large number of people dying. I’m an optimist, there’s lots we can do to reduce carbon in our economy which will create highly skilled jobs at the same time. We’ve had a frustrating situation with on-shore windfarms because regulation has been completely choked off by regulation. There has got to be substantial change in aviation but we’ve got to do it in a planned way. It’s so dficult to get around dferent parts of the UK.” The Tories “I’d never focus on inidual personalities but Rishi Sunak has a big challenge now because there’s a very critical question about how we have an exit strategy which works for the country. I‘m appalled by the fact that we’ve had  years where people’s living standards are constrained in the UK. So many people who are working are really struggling.

Robert Jenrick faces questions over his decision to approve a £bn housing development in London against the advice of a planning inspector. He gave Westferry Printworks, planned by billionaire Tory donor Richard Desmond, the green light on January  - hours before a council levy kicked in that would have cost the developer around £m. Itaposs since emerged Mr Desmond showed the minister a video of the scheme on his phone at a Tory fundraising dinner in November, and texted him asking him to approve it before the deadline. The new messages show that on November , Mr Desmond told him we donapost want to give Marxists in Tower Hamlets council loads of doe for nothing. In an e-mail dated January , a government official then said Mr Jenrick was insistent that decision issued this week ie tomorrow - as next week the viability of the scheme is impacted by the levy. Mr Desmond is not accused of wrongdoing, and Mr Jenrick has insisted that while there could have been an appearance of bias, there was no actual bias. Even so, the minister cancelled his approval to avoid a perception of bias in favour of the scheme. Downing Street today said the Prime Minister still had full confidence in Mr Jenrick, even though Mr Johnson spoke to the minister in recent days.

About half as big as the Sun, GJ  is just  light years away. Red dwarfs like GJ  have low surface temperatures, which makes them less luminous and often hard to detect. But stars like these are cooler than the Sun, which means the habitable zone - the orbital band where temperatures are mild enough to allow liquid surface water on orbiting planets - is much closer to GJ  in comparison with the Earthaposs distance from the Sun. The new planets, called GJ b and GJ c, were found using a high-precision, planet-finding instrument on the European Southern Observatoryaposs .-metre telescope at La Silla in Chile. Both are believed to be super-Earths - planets which have a mass higher than Earth but substantially below those of local ice giants Uranus and Neptune. The discovery was made by an international team of astronomers, including researchers from the University of Hertfordshire, The Open University and Queen Mary University of London. The scientists used a technique known as Doppler wobble, which enabled them to find the planets by measuring their gravitational interaction with GJ . As a planet orbits, it causes its parent star to wobble by a tiny degree. Astronomers can see the signature of this effect in the light emitted by the star. The researchers believe both GJ b and GJ c lie close to the inner edge of habitable zone and may be too hot to maintain liquid water on their surfaces. They estimate the surface temperature of GJ c, which takes . days to circle its host star, to be around C. GJ b, meanwhile, is much closer to the star, with an orbital period of . days. But the researchers say GJ  is less active than other red dwarfs, so the newly discovered worlds may be spared from strong stellar winds - outflowing material from the star which can erode a planetaposs atmosphere. Hence, the team are keen to learn more about this super-Earth system. Dr John Barnes, an astrophysicist at the Open University and one of the authors on the study published in the journal Science, said: Close orbiting planets like these have a high chance of being tidally locked to their host star. This means that as the planet orbits its star, the same hemisphere always faces the star. For the planets orbiting GJ , half of the planets would be in perpetual daytime and the other half in perpetual night time. So, it could be much cooler on some parts of the planets than others. The researchers also detected an unconfirmed signal, raising hopes of a third planet with a more temperate orbit. But Dr Barnes is cautious about this finding, saying: If the signal is a planet, it would orbit every  days.

But, says Phyllis Taylor, the ­moment she walked into the room, ­everything suddenly changed. The -year-old ethical fashion company founder says: “I had an ­incident where I got an email from a well-known high street brand to come in for a meeting, but the energy changed the minute she saw me.” London-based Phyllis, who launched Ghanaian-influenced Sika Designs  years ago, adds: “It’s not clear from my name where I’m from. “But I felt like the minute I entered the room the energy changed, and it just went downhill from there.” The fashion industry has long had a problem with a lack of inclusion for black models and designers, and it is the same for stylists, photographers, writers and art directors. The appointment of Edward Enninful, the first black editor-in-chief at the helm of British Vogue in  was widely welcomed. Andyou’re talking make-up, Pat McGrath, a black Brit from Northampton of Jamaican heritage, is the world’s most in-demand and influential artist, as well as the founder of luxury cosmetic brand Pat McGrath Labs, worth a reported billion. Black designers including Princess Diana favourite Bruce Oldfield, Ozwald Boateng, the first black designer to open on London’s Savile Row, and the late Joe Casely-Hayford who dressed rock stars and prime ministers, have blazed trails in the UK since the s.  And a new crop of talented contemporary black British designers, among them Martine Rose, Grace Wales Bonner and Samuel Ross, is emerging. But the high cost of further education, and accusations that top fashion schools such as Central Saint Martins are elitist, may explain why there aren’t more.In the wake of the Black Lives Matter protests following the death of George Floyd at the hands of the police, the spotlight has been shone on the systemic racism that affects the lives of black people globally – and fashion has been caught in its glare. In an internal memo to Conde Nast staff, Dame Anna Wintour, American Vogue’s editor-in-chief, apologised to the company’s staff for not finding “enough ways to elevate and give space to black editors, writers, photographers, designers and other creators”. Arguments over cultural appropriation, earnings disparities and a lack of visibility in fashion magazines means being black and working in fashion means fighting for a seat at the table – or having to create your own. Jermaine R Robinson, a music stylist and image consultant from London, says: “I feel like at the moment there’s a huge focus for black brands. “I know a lot of people who want to invest in that but didn’t know what brands are out there.”  Jermaine, , who has worked with American designer Telfar Clemens and recently shared a list of  black designers on social media, adds: “I put a call out on Insta and got flooded with all dferent kinds of brands. I even found a black-led gothic brand.” On the fashion industry having a problem with racism, he says: “Tokenism is highly active. I feel like there is a glass ceiling to how far we can go, I know many black people who are super talented but they just haven’t been given the time of day.” Activewear designer Dami Howells launched DAMIHOWtwo years ago after seeing that there was very little representation of black women in fitness. She says: “I foundyou wanted to buy gym wear that was comfortable, that makes you look nice and motivated to go to the gym to do any type of workout, it wasn’t very stylish.” While she is getting great feedback from her customers about the quality of her products and the company’s customer service, getting exposure has been a challenge. She adds: “When you reach out to non-black influencers to partner with, you don’t get a response.  “We need more support because everyone is used to buying from the brands they already know and they trust.  “But at the same time it’s refreshing for the community to see themselves being represented in a way that hasn’t happened before.” Fashion lover Emma Mathurine, , often feels uninspired by the offerings on the high street, and unrepresented. Emma, an accountant who also designs carnival costumes for Bel Dyes Massays: “A lot of fashion does come from street culture, of ying ethnicities. If you look at London it’s that ersity that gives it colour but that’s not reflected in the mainstream. There’s a massive underrepresentation of people that look like me as a black Caribbean person.

Temperatures reached in excess of  degrees in some areas for the second day in a row  with a surging crowd at Bournemouth Beach prompting the local council to declare a major incident.

In these unrelenting days, the poet trusted to speak for Manchester in the hours after the Arena bomb attack, once again has given us a place to pause. Three years ago, the writer Jeanette Winterson said Walsh had found “words where there are no words” through his poem This Is the Place, which he read in Albert Square the day after the bombing. Liam Gallagher said it was “the best thing to come out of any Mancunian’s mouth, ever”.Now, in the time of coronavirus, we are lost for words once more, shattered and struggling to make sense of where we are. And Walsh does it again, finding the common thread of humanity in all our vastly dfering experiences.“Some of us are sewing scrubs and some are sowing seeds   Some are stitching fragments into plans   Some are holding Zoom meetings with babies on our knees   Some are holding only lonely hands.” Being Tony Walsh, this isn’t a ­sentimental place to rest. “So some of us are wealthy, healthy some of us are poor,” he writes. “Some of us will… buy a magic pill   But some of us know ‘some of us’ won’t cut it anymore  If some of us are sick, we all are ill.” Speaking to him on the phone at home in Manchester, where he is locked down with his we and mother-in-law, who has Alzheimer’s, Walsh is full of the same passion with which he told Manchester “Choose Love”. “We’ve pressed pause on the world,” he says, “we don’t just have to press play again.” Later, the former council officer and factory worker says: “We can’t carry on how we were. Austerity, inequality, this is part of how we’ve got where we are. UK, Brazil, USA – what’s the common thread between the worst affected countries  “Could it be the right-wing nature of those governments  Yet it’s the opposite ideas – community, socialism, working together, internationalism – that have got us through.” The third anniversary of the Arena bombing on May  has recently passed, taking away none of the pain for bereaved or survivors, or the conflicted sense Walsh feels of forever being associated with that horric moment. ‘Tony Walsh’ was trending across the globe on social media, as his city was still clearing up the broken glass and surgeons were operating. “Three years on, there’s not one day that goes by that it isn’t in front of me,” he says. “I get letters, emails every day about it. I took that responsibility very seriously. It weighed heavily on me. But I know what an absolute privilege it was to be there on the square that day. As a writer you are in the business of conveying truths and creating connections.”  His latest poem was a commission from New Writing North, which supports writing in the north of England. “It started from wordplay – some of us are doing this, some are doing that, that became the Sum of Us, collectively,” Walsh says. “It started from thank you, but it needed to be more. The understanding that as long as the virus exists in the world, we’ve all got it.” As the father of a  and a  year old, Walsh worries particularly about the future for young people. “It’s like when I was , working at the sausage factory after  months on the dole, and we used to greet each other with ‘are you working ’,” he says. “No one was working then. I fear we are heading back to those days.”  As Walsh says: “Everything I work in – theatre, events, conferences, education, all are closed down. All I’ve got left is the scribbling business.” The last few weeks have seen some extraordinary responses from poets. A video of Hollow by Vanessa Kisuule, the Bristol City Poet for -, about the toppling of the Edward Colston statue in Bristol as part of #BlackLivesMatter, has been shared over half a million times. When we have no words, it’s poetry that can speak for us – yet arts organisations are now the drowning ones, without enough le support systems to go around. Walsh has written movingly about this in his poem, Arts and Minds, which will shortly be released as a video. The terrorist attack on Manchester Arena, as Winterson wrote back then, was a public event “as well as a heart-breaking series of private losses”.

Figures show , confirmed cases from May  to June  that were transferred to the call centre-based scheme – still missing its vital app – were not reached. Shadow Health Minister Justin Madders said the revelation raises “major concerns”.Prime Minister Boris Johnson had vowed a “world-beating” test and trace system would be in place by the beginning of this month.And Health Secretary Matt Hancock promised an app essential to the scheme would be in action by the middle of May. But the original version of the NHSX app, which £million had been poured into, was scrapped last week after flunking a trial. Mr Madders said: “To have a quarter of those who test positive not contacted three weeks into the ‘world-beating’ system is not good enough and needs to be addressed. “Expert opinion shows to defeat this virus we need a fully ing test and trace system, so these figures raise major concerns the week before lockdown measures are eased further – ­especially without a working app.” The % includes people the service could not reach as there was no response to text, email and call reminders. It also takes in those reached but who refused to give details of close contacts. Another , % of the total, did not provide contact details when tested.  In total, , people who tested positive in England had their case transferred to the system during the first three weeks of its operation, Department of Health figures show. Of these, ,were reached and asked to give details of contacts. Ian Hudspeth, chairman of the Local Government Association’s Community Wellbeing Board, also branded the figures “concerning”. He said: “Those testing positive have a responsibility to help halt its transmission and protect those most at risk.” Mr Hancock has refused to put a date on when a working app will be available. He said on Wednesday: “The app is progressing and we will launch it when the time is right.”  The SAGE advisory group was urging an increase in test and trace using a call centre system similar to the one in place now as early as February. In a development on testing, six walk-in centres will be trialled in Newcastle, Rochdale, Leeds, Slough, and Brent and Newham in London. Sites are not confirmed – but one is understood to be at a basketball court. And there are reports they will use empty shops and car parks. The PM’s spokesman said: “We want to ensure testing is available in places which are accessible and work for the public.” It comes as surgeons called for access to same-day testing. The Royal College of Surgeons of England said a million people were waiting more than  weeks for hospital treatment.

She was born in Jamaica in  before moving to the UK with her family when she was nine years old, where they settled in south London. Relations between the police and Britain’s black community were extremely tense as Morris grew up in the s. The tense relations were epitomised by the ‘sus’ laws where officers could stop and search people purely because they suspected someone intended to commit a crime. This came to a head for a -year-old Morris on November  .That day a Nigerian diplomat parked his Mercedes in Brixton. Leaving his family in the car, he went to buy some records. However, police suspected the diplomat of stealing the car and, according to witnesses, arrested him and beat him. A crowd gathered as the diplomat was taken away, before officers hit out at those protesting against their actions. When she saw her friend being dragged by four police officers, screaming “I’ve done nothing” as he went, Morris tried to help him, an action which resulted in her being brutally beaten and arrested. Morris recalled being grabbed by the neck, thrown, slapped, kicked in the chest by officers who later racially abused and made sexualised threats to her - including stripping her and threatening her with rape - at the police station. By this time she’d helped found the British Black Panther Movement - later the British Black Panthers, which fought for equal housing, employment and education rights and against racial discrimination. The group swelled to more than , members as it helped expose racism in schools, the police and government. Its most famous campaign was defending the Mangrove Restaurant, a Caribbean restaurant in Notting Hill, which became subject to frequent police raids by officers claiming to be looking for drugs. In  a march calling on police to leave the restaurant alone resulted in nine people being arrested and put on trial. The nine defendants were eventually acquitted and forced the judicial acknowledgment of evidence of racial hatred in the politan police. After the movement disbanded in , Morris went on to co-found the Brixton Black Women’s Group and the Organisation of Women of Asian and Afrcian Descent.  There, she campaigned for better access to education, decent living conditions for Britain’s black communities. As well as this she was heavily involved in the squatters’ campaign of the s, opening the squat in Brixton’s Railton Road in , a place which quickly became a hub of community groups and political activism. It also housed one of the black community’s first bookshops, the Sabarr Bookshop. The Railton Road site eventually became the  Centre, continuing to house campaign and community groups until all squatters were evicted in . In the mid-s Morris studied for a degree in social sciences at Manchester University and became involved in some of the city’s groups, such as the Manchester Black Women’s Cooperative. With the plight of black women close to her heart, Morris travelled extensively.

The family looked happy and relaxed as they waved and chatted to well-wishers, but Lady Colin Campbell claimed it was a very dferent story behind the scenes. Extracts from the book leaked online claimed Meghan told Harry she was bored and wanted to leave, with other people claiming the pair had been escorted out of the celebrations. But now a professional lip reader has revealed what Charles actually said to his youngest son moments before they left, and has stressed that there definitely wasnapost any angst. In the clip, Meghan and Harry can be seen chatting to guests and the Duchess can be heard admiring one womanaposs necklace. They are then approached by a member of staff, who appears to tell Harry that Charles wants to chat to him. Harry then steps aside and his dad says something quietly to him, placing his hand on his arm. Harry nods and gestures ahead of him before patting his dad on the back and ing to Meghan. Camilla then walks over and kisses both Harry and Meghan goodbye before ing to the waiting crowds. The Sussexes say their goodbyes to the group they were chatting to, telling them to enjoy the rest of the afternoon, and walk back towards the palace with their staff. Debunking the clip, the lip reader told Mail Online that the staff member told Harry that he had been called for.

Kalynn Wangle, , claims to have seen the mythical creature on June  and her sighting has since been confirmed by the Official Loch Ness Monster register.However Kaylnn didnapost see Nessie in real le she said she was watching Urquhart Bay via webcam, the Daily Record reports.The Loch Ness monster enthusiast, from Oregon, US, said Nessie appeared for around  minutes. Exciting footage shows a black dot floating near the surface of the water.  It begins to move left across the bay, occasionally ducking under the waves. Kalynn said this is her second sighting with her first being recorded on  April and lasting around seven minutes.A video taken from the webcam on this occasion apparently shows Nessie submerging and re-merging as it nears Urquhart Bay.Posting about the footage, Kalynn said: “Why is this sighting super epic you ask  Well, this object surfaces for more than seven minutes. “It moves closer to the shore, it constantly changes shape and splashes about and is not a boat as it just shows up in the middle of the loch. It also appears to be quite large.“This second sighting clearly shows a black object moving across the Loch from right to left.“The object changes shape and goes under the water and comes back up again.Splashing also seems to be visible.”Speaking today, Kalynn said: “Every time I see something unusual on the Nessie cam, I get really excited.It feels unreal every time.I always watch the whole encounter before I go back and record it just to make sure Iaposm seeing what I think Iaposm seeing.“When I first started watching, I was honestly never sureI would ever see anything, so the fact that I have seen and recorded it as many times as I have actually blows my mind.While the black objects I have recorded seem to change speed and shape and will sometimes disappear from view as though it has gone back under the water before it shows up again.“Given the distance of the camera from the water, for something to be that visible from that far away, I would imagine it would have to be quite large.Ruling out the possibility of it being an otter, or seal or even a log really.“Unfortunately, I have not been to Scotland yet, so I have yet to see Nessie in person.I hope to visit Loch Ness one day, as I have always wanted to go there ever since I learned about it and Nessie.Itaposs number one on my list of places to visit."},{"url":null,"title":"man filmed jumping 200ft durdle","story":"NewsMan filmed jumping ft off Durdle Door just weeks after three seriously injuredFootage shows a man flinging himself off Durdle Door before landing in the water below.

Officers fear that strict social distancing rules will cause tensions to flare up as boozers gear up to open their doors for the first time in nearly four months. July  - or Super Saturday - will see pubs across England welcoming customers back with new safety measures as the coronavirus lockdown is gradually relaxed. These include no dancing, staying at least a metre apart from other customers, keeping voices down and ordering drinks through table service or mobile phone apps rather than heading to the bar.Punters will also be asked to leave their name at the door to help with contract tracing in the event of a coronavirus flare-up.For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, read our liveblog here Amid fears that disputes could break out as staff try to ensure customers stick to the new rules, officers have argued that pubs should have been re-opened on a weekday.According to Steve Kent, the chair of South Yorkshireaposs Police Federation, the combination of hot, sunny weather and weekend crowds could create a perfect storm of disorderly behaviour.I think we’re going to have a couple of weeks of New Year’s Eves, he told the Independent. Meanwhile John Apter, chair of the Police Federation, which represents rank-and-file officers, has warned that Super Saturday will without doubt add to pressure on already-stretched police, paramedic and wider NHS services. He added that although the economy must get moving after months of lockdown, some were seeing July  as a countdown to party time. “There are worries about alcohol consumption leading to drunken and irresponsible behaviour, and there’s also the concern that people who can’t get into pubs because of restrictions that are still in place may cause conflict, he said. The public have shown support for their key workers during lockdown they can continue to give support by behaving sensibly now that the restrictions are easing.” Lockdown measures in England are set to be signicantly relaxed on July . Pubs, restaurants, hotels and hairdressers will be allowed to re-open and people will be able to gather in slightly larger groups.  For the first time, two households of any size will be able to gather inside - with social distancing. The two-metre rule will also be cut to one metre plus mitigations like face coverings, where two metres canapost be maintained. It comes as Bournemouth council was forced to declare a major incident today after thousands flocked to the seaside town. Overwhelmed police urged day-­trippers to stay away from beaches after the scenes of sunseekers flocking to resorts in the C heat sparked fears of a second coronavirus wave.

Storms are expected to bring heavy rain, lightning and hail - a big dference from yesterdayaposs weather. Two yellow weather warnings for thunderstorms are in place for much of the UK from Thursday to Saturday, warning of disruption due to flooding, lightning strikes, hail and wind. It comes after a heatwave hit the country earlier this week, with highs of C registered in parts of the UK. Yesterday was the hottest day recorded so far in . Under eased lockdown restrictions, Britons can enjoy the heat and visit parks, beaches and, when adhering to social distancing measures, see friends and family. Speaking about the reasons behind the hot spell, Met Office Chief Meteorologist, Dan Suri said: “We quite often see warm, southerly air from the continent bringing these high temperatures to the UK in summer, however this week, the air across the UK has arrived from the Atlantic. This Atlantic air will descend and warm up as it moves across the UK and this in combination with clear skies and strong late-June sunshine, we’re seeing temperatures rise.”  However this could change soon as temperatures are set to drop by about C in some areas of the country. Met Officer forecaster Alex Burkill told : Friday will be another hot day, but less hot than yesterday in many places.The Met Office has two thunderstorm warnings out which cover pretty much all of the UK because of a risk of torrential downpours - with hail, frequent lightning and heavy rain expected. Mr Burkill said: This marks the transition to something more changeable as we go into the weekend.  We are going to see spells of rain, stronger winds and temperatures are going to be less hot. The forecaster said some places will see temperatures dropping by C - remaining mainly in the low-s.  Today: Early showers and thunderstorms in western and southern parts extending north and east with some torrential downpours, lightning and a chance of hail. Sunshine between. Remaining very warm in the west but still hot and humid across much of England.

A trip to the seaside was all the more appealing after three months of lockdown. The vast majority behaved responsibly and continued to observe social distancing rules. Unfortunately, a thoughtless minority let the sun go to their heads. Bournemouth had to declare a major incident after being overwhelmed by visitors.Other resorts saw staff abused and their beaches strewn with litter and detritus. Photographs showed there were frequent breaches of the two-metre rule. There are now fears the behaviour of a selfish few could cause a second Covid wave.

But the party leader should be applauded for taking a firm stand on an issue that has become a stain on his party’s reputation.

Taro Kono also told media he thought recent movements in the hermit state were “all very strange.Pyongyang has repeatedly insisted the North has no cases of coronavirus amid the global pandemic, despite infections around the world reaching the millions and the virus hitting neighbouring South Korea.The Japanese defence minister told reporters: We have some suspicions about his [Kim Jong-un’s] health. He claimed the very strange movements in North Korea were because of Kim trying not to get infected,” and that Covid- was spreading around the country. Mr Kono did not elaborate on what may have happened to Mr Kim or imply any official speculation he is dead, saying only: I’m not allowed to discuss intelligence issues. The top official said Japan and the United States and other countries had been exchanging information about the North Korean leader.  The tyrantaposs sometimes y disappearing acts from the public eye have longed sparked death rumours. Tightly-controlled media in the state means the -year-oldaposs rare public outings can usually only be gleaned from propaganda reports. Pictures have emerged in the past purporting to show the leader using body doubles. Earlier this year rumours of his death circulated after claims of a botched heart operation. But he popped up again on May  in pictures at a fertiliser plant before vanishing again for three weeks, prompting more questions about his health.  Just as theories were beginning to fly once again, Mr Kim re-emerged to make declarations about putting his country on nuclear alert. In recent weeks tensions have flared up again on the peninsula, after Mr Kimaposs regime blew up a diplomatic liaison office in the latest clash with Seoul. Pictures of a smiling Mr Kim were released by the official state media, the Korean Central News Agency on June . Two months ago, Japanese Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi had revealed the government was working with the US to attempt to gather information on the leaderaposs health. The ided Koreas yesterday marked seventy years since the war began. Prospects for a peace treaty to officially end the conflict appear as distant as ever, as the North and South held low-key commemorations on Thursday amid heightened tensions. And Mr Kono told the conference on Thursday that Japan is considering acquiring weapons able to strike enemy missile launchers to bolster its defence against North Korea.

If players are sold then we might get the opportunity to look at that.“Certainly we won’t be adding to the squad .”Aberdeen have the vast majority of their first-team squad secured on contracts for the next season or beyond.Only number two keeper Tomas Cerny is out of contract and the Dons have already opened contract talks to extend his stay at the club.It is understood any possible new addition would be made on the basis of one out, one in –the Dons were to sell a player.McInnes and club chairman Dave Cormack have both recently stated there will be no cut-price sale of players in the summer, despite the club’s financial losses due to the pandemic.Aberdeen beat off competition from newly-promoted Dundee United and a number of English Championship clubs to secure theof Hayes to Pittodrie.The Republic of Ireland international winger starred for the Dons for five years until transferring to Celtic in summer .Hayes won the League Cup with the Dons during his first spell and racked up more than  appearances.During his first spell at Aberdeen, Hayes was utilised as a winger and terrorised full-backs with his pace, direct play and skill.However, last season at Celtic he played in the left-back role.Aberdeen had hoped to secure the permanent signing of NAC Breda left-back Greg Leigh, who had been on loan last season.However, the financial impact of the coronavirus derailed that permanent move for Leigh.McInnes has not ruled out revisiting a move for Leigh when the club emerges from the coronavirus crisis.McInnes is delighted to have a player of Hayes’ quality at the club to strengthen that left-hand side for the next two seasons.He said: “Jonny has demonstrated his ability to play in a number of positions – full-back, wing-back and as a wide player over the last few seasons.“Having Jonny operating on that left-hand side, regardless of where we ask him to play, we still expect a high level of performance.“It is great having that type of quality and person in the building again. He’s the kind of person you want at your club and I think he’s a brilliant signing for us.”Hayes met up with his new team-mates this week as the squad go through socially- distanced training at the £m Cormack Park.McInnes insists the training facility has been a “godsend” as the Dons prepare for the start of the Premiership on August .He said: “The fact we have Cormack Park and the challenges we face currently with all the protocols we need to meet – having the luxury of so much space is a godsend.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column may 15 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsRumour has it the UK government will bring in a -day quarantine for some # but not all # airline passengers at the end of this month.

Action is needed and the bullies must be confronted. That they were allowed to behave in this way for so long is the real shocker.Their own managers have questions to answer.

People who may have previously felt isolated in remote and rural communities may be feeling this even more acutely at this time, so it’s important they know support is available.Across the region, many people have also sadly faced the pain of losing loved ones to the virus or have fallen ill themselves, while others have seen their livelihoods put at risk or incomes reduced. All of this has put additional strain on people’s mental well-being.This year’s Mental Health Awareness Week is putting the focus on kindness as a means of helping people through the pandemic and building a better society as we emerge from it. We see many acts of kindness in the Highlands and Islands all the time, but this week is an opportunity for people to reflect on their interactions with others and how they can try and be a little kinder during this unprecedented time.David Stewart, MSP for Highlands and Islands region.Sir,During Mental Health Awareness Week, sight loss charity RNIB Scotland is highlighting the emotional reassurance and practical help it is offering during the coronavirus lockdown.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as their families, friends and carers.Losing some or even all your sight can be devastating news to take in, but our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.RNIB is concerned the lockdown might be affecting people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older, particularly hard. The uncertainty over access to basic shopping and medication, to information in accessible formats, the social isolation and barriers to being guided because of social distancing can all add and compound to the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.As well as our Need to Talk service, the RNIB helpline on    is available for anyone with sight loss and we continue to organise social activities over the phone and social media.We want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.James Adams, RNIB Scotland director, Edinburgh.The Scottish Invasive Species Initiativehas launched Alien Detectives – a fun and educational online resource to help the young and not so young  learn more about alien # or non-native – invasive species.Originally designed as a school education pack, the huge array of activities now includes a wide range of fun games and activities that anyone can enjoy at home, in the garden or on local walks during lockdown.Alien Detectives includes crafts, quizzes, worksheets, presentations and puzzles all themed around invasive species and the river environment. Although primarily aimed at young people, anyone with an interest in the environment or invasive species can enjoy them too.Our project team has been busy while homeworking during lockdown to produce these fantastic resources. We hope becoming Alien Detectives will bring many hours of enjoyment to iniduals and families during lockdown, especially at a time when most young people are not in a regular school environment and might be looking for a new challenge or activities to continue their learning.Invasive non-native species might be a new topic to many but it is a really important one. Invasive species can have a major impact on our environment and native wildle and are responsible for signicant bioersity loss in Scotland and across the world. We hope these resources will help raise awareness of the impacts of invasive species and inspire more young people to learn something about them.No prior knowledge is needed and there’s lots to learn and have fun with so become an Alien Detective and help us tackle invasive species today.All of the ‘Alien Detectives’ resources can be found at www.invasivespecies.scot alien-detectives.Callum Sinclair, SISI Project Manager, Newton Stewart.Sir,We may not be able to hold picnics in the usual way just yet, but why not hold the next best thing – a virtual picnic  That way you can invite as many people as you want.National charity Family Action is running its Virtual Family Picnic from May  to May  and everyone is invited.

We stayed with Margaret and Iain McDonald at their home named Meadowview in Tarbert which was located near the school.We all enjoyed the area so much that we continued to visit every year for the next consecutive eight years.Margaret invited me to go out on the herring boats once or twice. One was named Village Maid and the other Village Belle and, needless to say, we often had kippers for breakfast, which were very nice. I remember there was a boat called the Southern Cross tied up to Cock Island # can anyone tell me any history of it and when it disappeared There also used to be a smokehouse for kippers along from Tarbert to Ardrishaig.Another fond memory I have is watching the logging trucks unloading on the quay and watching them get loaded on to large boats and I think then being shipped round to Sweden or Finland. Is that correct or not as I thought there was a paper mill at Fort William As mentioned earlier, I joined North West Ambulance Service in the s and Margaret used to send me the Argyllshire Advertiser and in one of them was an advert for recruitment to the Scottish Ambulance Service.I duly got an application form from Paisley and was all but sending the form in when I realised it would be very unfair to move so far away from our young children#s grandparents and for them to be unable to see them growing up. At the time your local pharmacist was retiring and my we Sue was a qualied pharmacist, but our children were both under school age so relied on her parents for child care. Ironically, I believe the job was filled with a Blackpool pharmacist whom I had met ocassionally.My love for Scotland continued, and we had our honeymoon travelling around Scotland and calling in at Tarbert for several days on the trip round.Our last trip up there was  in June as a treat from our daughter who accompanied us on this trip. The weather was glorious, and one day we caught the bus to Skipness and walked part of the Kintyre Way back.Another day we took the MacBrayne Ferry to Islay, which was again a glorious day out, also visited Crinan, Lochgilphead and Inveraray, followed by a couple of days fishing off the pier in Tarbert. We travelled back via Portavadie and Dunoon, and have in the past used the ferry to Arran, then Brodick, Ardrossan and home.Thank you for taking the time to read this.

But the COVID- lockdown interrupted proceedings.This season’s Scottish Cup was a bit of a disappointment with Star exiting the competition in the second round after losing out to a vastly improved Dumbarton United side -. On the plus side, the first round saw Star take on Paisley League team Pollok FC and an excellent performance saw Star run out convincing winners -, one of only four defeats suffered by Pollok in all competitions.In the West Region Cup, Star progressed to the quarter-final again. A first round bye, a convincing - win against Cambuslang FA then a walkover saw the Lochgilphead youths face Paisley League A Division team Erskine.In a hard-fought encounter, Star matched Erskine for most of the game but with only  players available they couldn’t get the breakthrough they needed and eventually lost -.Star started their league campaign in September with a competitive match against new team Thorn, who transferred from Paisley A Division. Star lost -.Two strong performances in October saw Star record  a terric - win over Shettleston, last season’s league runners up, and a - win against St Patrick’s Sports Academy # an entertaining but nerve-wracking game.A mid-season stutter in November saw the Lochgilphead boys lose out to Cathcart -, then Clydebank -, both newcomers.The losing run continued into early December as Star faced last season’s champions Drumchapel Amateurs ending up down - at half-time before recovering their form with a committed second half display to pull it back to -. Unfortunately they lost out to a fourth Drumchapel goal as they chased the winner themselves.This set Star back on track as they finished the year with a hugely convincing performance, demolishing Cathcart -.January and February proved a real battle with the weather with wind, rain and freezing temperatures # often all three # only allowing four games to take place. Star secured fine victories over Busby, -, and Glasgow Red Star, -, and fought back to grind out creditable draws with Shettleston, -, and Place Park, another new team, -.Star played one league game in March before lockdown and again it was another entertaining game with a rollercoaster feel to it. Facing up to Drumchapel Amateurs, both teams played out another terric match which had everything.Coming back from a goal down and with only  men, Star played cracking football to race into a - lead but it took its toll as Drumchapel stuck to their task to draw level before adding a couple more goals to secure a win in the final five minutes.This was another fine season for Red Star s, competing well in a strong league, with only  signed players.Though the season was cut short, the boys played  games winning , drawing two and losing seven. They scored  goals and conceded  goals. There were some cracking games and the boys were looking forward to the knock-out stages of the league cup.Inconsistency probably cost Star a few more wins, but that’s what youth football development is all about and there is potential for the boys to develop.Well done from coaches and parents to the  boys who played this season – Craig Aitken, Zak Barclay, Gregor Brown, Keiran Caskie, Lewis Curran, Ruaridh Green, Woody Hoad, Alexander McLean, Conner McMurchy, Leon Murphy, Innes Paterson, Jamie Stewart and Tom West.Thanks for great support goes to sponsors Ardrishaig Community Trust, main strip, SC Crawford Building Contractors Limited, change strip and zip tops, Jewsons, tracksuits, and Mid Argyll Youth Development Services and the parents, supporters, referees and opposition teams that have made the season so enjoyable."},{"url":null,"title":"sheena shows the way as tarbert tees off","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsGolf started again at Glenralloch as lockdown measures were eased slightly across Scotland.The first members were on the tee at am on Friday May  for the re-opening, followed by a steady stream as the day went on.

It shows contempt for those in the NHS who have risked their lives to save others. It shows contempt for those who have died without their loved ones by their side.

between . to ., according to official figures.The British security minister James Brokenshire described the rise as \"concerning\".He said:\"It is concerning to see the situation inGermanyand its why we are informed in our actions by experience from around the world, why the chief scientic officer, the chief medical officer, speak to their counterparts in dferent parts of the world to ensure that we are applying the best learning and the best experience in informing our next steps.\"So, how does the R measure work The ldquoR value, or infection rate, refers to the number of people that one infected person will pass the virus to on average.Coronavirus has an estimated reproduction number of three, meaning an infected person will likely pass the virus on to at least three other people.A reproduction number that is higher than one poses a signicant risk, as the number of cases can increase rapidly, making it harder for the spread to be contained.That means thatGermanyrsquos R value is accurate, for every  people infected an additional  are likely to become affected.Why has the R valuerisen The R value has seen a surge following a series of outbreaks at hospitals, care homes, religious gatherings and refugee centres.One of the largest outbreaks took place at an abattoir in the countryrsquos north leading to the closure of schools and the launch of an investigation.Abattoir company Toennies, in western Germany, stopped production after hundreds of employees tested positive for coronavirusThe Robert Koch Institute,which measures the number of cases in the country, explained that the spike in the R value is partly due to the relatively small number of cases.Shouldthe UK be worried The spike in the R value is undoubtedly concerning, but the number of new cases across Germany remains relatively low.The Robert Koch Institute underlined the need for caution, but said that ldquolocal outbreaks have a relatively strong influence on the value.In a statement it

single dose, astudy in pigs has revealed.The ChAdOx nCoV-vaccine -developed by the University of Oxford - is currently undergoing human trials and it is hoped an effective vaccine could be ready later this year.Previous research indicated that macaques were protected against lung disease after a single immunisation.Now the Pirbright Institute, working with the University of Oxford, has shown that two doses of the Covid- vaccine might produce a greater immune response in pigs and therefore be a more effective approach to developing a protective response.What did the study find In the study, researchers saw a marked increase in neutralising antibodies, which bind to the virus in a way that blocks infection.It is not yet known what level of immune response will be required to protect humans against SARS-CoV- .Researchers said the finding in pigs is important as it suggests that two doses of the new vaccine could potentially give signicantly more protection in humans than a single dose.But they said further research in humans is required.What has Professor Bryan Charleston said Professor Bryan Charleston, director of the Pirbright Institute, said: ldquoThese results look encouraging that administering two injections with the same vaccine boosts antibody responses that can neutralise the virus, but it is the response in humans that is important.ldquoThe pig has proved to be a valuable model for testing human vaccines for other diseases to give an indication of the type of immune response induced and testing dferent doses.ldquoPigs are more physiologically similar to humans than some other animal models ndash for example, their body weight and metabolic rate ndash and are more accessible than studies using non-human primates.In the research, the pigs were split into two groups, with both receiving an initial dose of the vaccine, and one group receiving an identical booster immunisation on day  of the study.Latest developments are very encouragingProfessor Simon Graham, the lead author of the study, said: ldquoWhile it remains to be determined what immune responses are required to effectively protect people against Covid-, the demonstration that ChAdOx nCoV- induces both neutralising antibody and T cell responses is very encouraging.ldquoIt is likely that a combination of these responses would act in synergy to prevent and control infection, as we and others have recently shown in the context of experimental flu vaccines.What has the reaction been to this update Dr Stephen Grfin, associate professor in the school of medicine, University of Leeds, added: ldquoThe work done at Pirbright is an encouraging advance in support of the Oxford vaccine on three important fronts.,params: .pushldquoFirst, it has been conducted in a large animal model, namely pigs, which we know recapitulate human-like responses to influenza vaccines better than many other systems.ldquoSecond, it shows that a second dose of the vaccine, a so-called lsquoprime-boostrsquo strategy, gives rise to far better responses than a single inoculation, which might allay concerns arising from some of the earlier work on this and other spike-targeting vaccines.ldquoThird, it shows that the prime-boost strategy may well be achievable using the same vaccine rather than having to switch to an alternative  for the second dose, which could conceivably delay roll-out of the vaccination programme.ldquoWhilst these studies will need to be repeated within human subjects, and the precise nature and longevity of the responses might require further investigation, this is a heartening study that can be built upon and ideally followed by other potential vaccine s for SARS-CoV-."},{"url":null,"title":"staycation-five-scotlands-photogenic-places-visit-lockdown-eases","story":"WITH lockdown measures slowly beginning to ease and the coronavirus continuing to be

Theyrsquore because of public reaction and public perception of Tourettersquos.ldquoThe fact that Irsquom ticking doesnrsquot make me depressed and it doesnrsquot make me anxious.\"Itrsquos how other people react. Itrsquos only such a huge part of my le because of other people.ldquoItrsquos instinctive for people to turn around and look, but it doesnrsquot take away from the fact that it makes me feel uncomfortable and embarrassed over something that I cannot control.It was not only the tics that made Jack stand out from the crowd during childhood.As a gay teenager, he says he struggled to make any male friends because of his sexuality, which he has never hidden.And the struggles, although manesting in dferent forms, have continued into young adult le.As a result of years of relentless twitching and involuntary leg movements, Jack is battling chronic muscle pain and nausea.Cognitive behaviour therapy reiki reflexology ndash Jack has tried everything to relieve the pain but to little avail.He is prescribed strong painkillers, and at times has had to keep his neck in a brace because of his tics.,params: .pushWhen attempting to enter bars or nightclubs, bouncers sometimes reject him because they believe he is under the influence of illegal drugs.Alcohol consumption can trigger his tics, making them more prominent and frequent.Even in university lectures, he sometimes must call out people for continually turning around and staring at him, despite knowing his condition.Jack insists that suffering from Tourette syndrome has given him a ldquothick skin\".He has always felt fully supported by his parents but has chosen to be independent from a young age, refusing to let his condition prevent him from doing the things he wants to achieve.Attending doctors appointments on his own from the age of , Jack preferred to handle everything by himself.In his third year at Peebles High School, Jack ran a public campaign and was successfully elected as a Member of the Scottish Youth Parliamentfor the region.He said: ldquoI ran because Irsquove always been interested in social issues and wanted to meet like-minded people, which I sometimes felt starved of growing up.ldquoI think I would be a really confident, extroverted guy without my tics ndash they are the one thing holding me back.Since his darkest days battling anxiety and depression, Jack has made friends andhad part-time jobs in bars in Peebles and Edinburgh.Mental health struggles may have stolen parts of Jacks childhood ndash and he continues to live in the spotlight of Tourettersquos ndash but it hasnrsquot stopped him embracing student le."},{"url":null,"title":"bournemouth-major-incident-thousands-pack-beaches-south-coast","story":"A MAJORincident has been declared after thousands of people flocked to the beach in southern England.The sun-seekers - defying official advice -descended onBournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council beaches on the hottest day of the year so far.A multi-agency emergency response has now been activated to co-ordinate resources across the area.Council leader Vikki Slade said: ldquoWe are absolutely appalled at the scenes witnessed on our beaches, particularly at Bournemouth and Sandbanks, in the last - hours.\"The irresponsible behaviour and actions of so many people is just shocking and our services are stretched to the absolute hilt trying to keep everyone safe.\"We have had no choice now but to declare a major incident and initiate an emergency response.Services were left completely overstretched as visitors arrived in large volumes resulting in widespread problems of illegal parking, excessive waste, anti-social behaviour, gridlock on roads and prohibited overnight camping.BCP Council issued  parking enforcement fines ndash the highest on record ndash and responded to many reports of cars parking and causing an obstruction.Roads in and out of the area were heavily congested into the early hours.Crews received widespread abuse and intimidation as they attempted to empty overflowing bins on the seafront.

we knew that losing your sense of smellwas a signicant symptom of the disease.Now, after months of reports, both anecdotal and more rigorous clinical findings, we think we have a model for how this virus may cause smell loss.One of the most common causes of smell loss is a viral infection, such as the common cold, sinus or other upper respiratory tract infections.Those coronaviruses that donrsquot cause deadly diseases, such as COVID-, Sars and Mers, are one of the causes of the common cold and have been known to cause smell loss.In most of these cases, sense of smell s when symptoms clear, as smell loss is simply the result of a blocked nose, which prevents aroma molecules reaching olfactory receptors in the nose. In some cases, smell loss can persist for months and years.For the novel coronavirus , however, the pattern of smell loss is dferent. Many people with COVID- reported a sudden loss of sense of smell and then a sudden and fullto a normal sense of smell in a week or two.Interestingly, many of these people said their nose was clear, so smell loss cannot be attributed to a blocked nose.For others, smell loss was prolonged and several weeks later they still had no sense of smell. Any theory of anosmia in COVID- has to account for both of these patterns.This suddenof a normal sense of smell suggests an obstructive smell loss in which the aroma molecules cannot reach the receptors in the nose .Now that we have CT scans of the noses and sinuses of people with COVID- smell loss, we can see that the part of the nose that does the smelling, the olfactory cleft, is blocked with swollen soft tissue and mucus ndash known as a cleft syndrome.The rest of the nose and sinuses look normal and patients have no problem breathing through their nose.We know that the way SARS-CoV- infects the body is by attaching to ACE receptors on the surface of cells that line the upper respiratory tract.A protein called TMPRSS then helps the virus invade the cell. Once inside the cell, the virus can replicate, triggering the immune systemrsquos inflammatory response. This is the starting point for the havoc and destruction that this virus causes once in the body.Initially, we thought that the virus might be infecting and destroying the olfactory neurons.These are the cells that transmit the signal from the aroma molecule in your nose to the area in the brain where these signals get interpreted as ldquosmell.However, an international collaboration showed recently that the ACE proteins the virus needs to invade the cells were not found on the olfactory neurons.But they were found on cells called ldquosustentacular cells, which support the olfactory neurons.We expect that these support cells are likely to be the ones that are damaged by the virus, and the immune response would cause swelling of the area but leave the olfactory neurons intact.When the immune system has dealt with the virus, the swelling subsides and the aroma molecules have a clear route to their undamaged receptors and the sense of smell s to normal.So why does smell notin some cases This is more theoretical but follows from what we know about inflammation in other systems.Inflammation is the bodyrsquos response to damage and results in the release of chemicals that destroy the tissues involved.When this inflammation is severe, other nearby cells start to be damaged or destroyed by this ldquosplash damage. We believe that accounts for the second stage, where the olfactory neurons are damaged.Recovery of smell is much slower because the olfactory neurons need time to regenerate from the supply of stem cells within the lining of the nose.Initial recovery is often associated with distortion of the sense of smell known as parosmia, where things donrsquot smell like they used to.For many parosmics, for instance, the smell of coffee is often described as burnt, chemical, dirty and reminiscent of sewage.Physiotherapy for the noseOlfaction has been called the Cinderella of the senses because of its neglect by scientic research.But it has come to the forefront in this pandemic. The silver lining is that we will learn a lot about how viruses are involved in smell loss from this. But what hope is there for people with a loss of smell now The good news is that the olfactory neurons can regenerate. Theyrsquore regrowing in almost all of us, all of the time. We can harness that regeneration and guide it with ldquophysiotherapy for the nose: smell training."},{"url":null,"title":"headteacher-praised-leadership-style","story":"North Berwick High Schools head Lauren Rodgerwas described by Education Scotland inspectors as having a clear direction and being well respected.However while the inspection, carried out in February,praised the staff and leadership at the school and achievements of its senior students, it pointed to improvements required to enable more S-S pupils to learn a foreign language.The report called for more work to be done to ensure all younger students received their full entitlement to Broad General Educationin the first three years at the school.In particular it stated: \"Currently, a few young people are not experiencing a modern language until the end of S.\"Inaddition, the current arrangement is not sufficient for young people to receive their entitlementto a meaningful experience of a third language.\"Inspectors urged the school to ensure the focus was on ensuring younger pupils received full access to experiences across the curriculum and did not allow a focus on reaching exam levels to impact on them.The inspectors said: \"Teachers should ensure that learning at Sacross all curriculum areas remains focused on the experiences and outcomes of CfEanddoes not prioritise the requirements of National Qualications .\"Senior and middle leadersshould ensure that learning experiences in S provide those young people specialising atfourth level with appropriate depth in their learning to provide successful progression to thesenior phase.\"Inspectors visited the school in February  and assessed the schoolrsquos performance across four key indicators: leadership of change learning, teaching and assessment raising attainment and achievement and ensuring wellbeing, equality and inclusion.The school was evaluated as lsquovery goodrsquo in the first three categories and lsquogoodrsquo in the fourth.Headteacher Lauren Rodgerrsquos leadership style was described as ldquocharacterised by openness and by trust, promoting empowerment in a supportive ethos.

In the coming months, I suspect paper masks will become the new crisp packet or plastic water bottle, the leading litter offender of our times. Artists are doubtless already photographing bandit-style objects dangling from trees or trapped in drains, compiling a photo-montage of Covid detritus, to look back on in years to come.Now that face coverings are obligatory on public transport, and recommended in smaller shops and confined spaces, the day is coming when most of us will carry some form of protective gear in our pocket. This is meant to make us, and others, safer, yet the sight of bus passengers earlier this week, hidden from chin to eye, was anything but reassuring. It reminded me of cattle trucks, where all you can see between the slats are the animalsrsquo eyes, rolling in fear as they head for the abattoir.Some of my friends have been covering up for months others would rather head for the hills and ride out the storm like outlaws than comply. But like it or not, I suspect this latest accessory will be with us for the foreseeable future. The days when we used to stare in bemusement at Oriental tourists wearing what looked like BQ dust protectors are long gone. In some places, especially cities, it seems face coverings are already de rigueur, so much so that fashion houses are producing their own lines, to complement their designer range. This could either be seen as a definition of sad, or defiantly le-affirming.How did it come to this  In a text exchange with a friend, we were comparing styles, and recommending ones we liked, when a shudder went through both of us. Who ever thought we would be having this dialogue  It was a sobering moment, stark proof of how altered the world has become in a matter of months.The fabric visors I have on order are as non-medical as it gets, short of the Venice carnival. If Laura Ashley were still in business, I could have lurked unnoticed among the rails in one of these for days. Perhaps wisely, my husband has opted instead for the Ned Kelly look. With a hill-walking snood pulled up over his nose he looks dastardly, and warm. With the hottest days of the year approaching, wearers will be severely tested. It is no joke. On overheated buses, tubes and trains ndash often tropical even in winter ndash being cocooned behind cloth, wool or paper will raise temperatures to simmering point. Tempers might follow. This is no time, certainly, for the menopausal. It will be interesting to see what happensanyone finds it so unbearable a prospect that they dare to go bare-faced.So far the enforcement of lockdown measures has been largely consensual, the police working amicably to ensure peoplersquos safety. Butany passengers revolt or feel unwell when under wraps, who will handle that situation  Itrsquos simple enough to prevent refusniks getting on at the bus stop, but thereafter the driver cannot be expected to enforce the law. Will there be a member of transport police on every service or at every station, or a rapid response squad within hailing distance What about those who suffer from asthma or other respiratory complaints that mean they cannot trap their noses and mouths  Confronting public anger or filthy stares as they appear to flout the rules will be bad enough but how do they convince officials that their condition is genuine  The mere prospect of having to prove their credentials, or to run a gauntlet of jibes and stares, will deter many from even attempting to hop on public transport.Of course we will eventually get used to swaddling ourselves, just as wersquore now programmed to reach for soap after every foray beyond the front door, and to keep a cowrsquos distance from neighbours. Yet the potential hazards of facial wraps are fiercely debated. The main concern is that people will feel a  sense of security behind their personal protective barrier and neglect to wash their hands. Nor, Irsquove read, is cloth very effective at preventing the passage of small contagious droplets. When you add to this the likelihood that the discomfort of prolonged use leads to constant tweaking and touching, it seems their health benefits might be less assured than wersquove been encouraged to believe.All of this suggests the psychological signicance might be as important as the medical purpose. Seeing a sea of veiled faces around you reinforces the message of pervasive threat. Visors, in whatever shape, are a visible reminder that each and every one of us presents a potential risk to others. They are symbols of our collective duty to be seen to be taking precautions by wearing them, we signal willingness to help lower anxiety and alarm, and to play our part in the communal effort to defeat this disease.Will we ever feel relaxed under these circumstances  I can cope with the prospect of covering up while heading off on holiday but once at my destination, how easygoing will a cafe or gallery, beach or bar feel when you can only see waitersrsquo and bartendersrsquo eyes, and art lovers or bookshop browsers look like the cast in Holby City  Holidays are about escaping the everyday, and switching off.

The First Minister insists she is putting safety first.Scotland will not be following the ldquoreckless relaxation of lockdown pursued by heartless English Tories, who are only interested in the bottom line. Such at least is the political message the Scottish government hopes to convey.In reality, itrsquos not entirely clear what is happening in Scotland about social distancing. Jason Leitch, the National Clinical Director, told BBC Radio yesterday that he expected the two metre rule to be relaxed very soon.:Scotlands two-metre social distancing rule will change, according to Jason LeitchAnd John Swinney later announced that he is aiming for schools to go back to full time teaching on th August, which also suggests lockdown is not long for this world. The Labour MSP Iain Gray called this the ldquomother and father of ministerial climb-downs.Only last week Mr Swinney had been talking about a year of ldquoblended learning and no exams. This was under his assumption that the two metre rule would be still be adhered to over the summer and into the next school year.His u-turn may also be a broad wink to the hospitality industry that Scotland will be following England in the not too distant future. They should plan for a one metre rule and not give up the ghost.Letrsquos hope they get the message, because only % of pubs and % of restaurants say they can survive with two metre social distancing, according to the Scottish Tourism Alliance.Ms Sturgeon says she is no longer bothered about the R number ndash the infection rate that she said last month was her guiding policy. The number of infections is now so small that R is largely meaningless.So,the disease is disappearing fast, and the infection rate is irrelevant, why is Scotland sticking with the two-metre rule at all  Are we following the science or not Nicola Sturgeon suggested yesterday that the scientic advice from SAGE may not entirely concur with Boris Johnsonrsquos decision yesterday to liberate the nation from its Covid ldquohibernation.The former government Chief Scientic Adviser, Sir David King, chair of the ldquoindependent SAGE group, is pretty sure that the official SAGE scientists are not on side. He says it is ldquofar too soon to ease the two-metre rule and that this will increase infections and lead to more deaths.However, the science isnrsquot exactly rock solid on two metres. The World Health Organisation, which government critics often claim is a better advice-giver than SAGE, suggests a one metre rule is safe. WHO says that the risk of catching the disease falls by % over that distance.China, Denmark and more importantly our nearest neighbour France are also in the one metre camp.There is evidence that risk falls by at least a further %you are standing two metres distant. But the risk of transmission depends on many factors: distance is only a part of it. Wearing masks, for example, almost certainly makes one metre equivalent to two. Outdoors, there seems little dference between one and two metres, and even indoors itrsquos no guarantee of immunity.A study cited by the BBC from the Chinese city of Guangzhou, looked at a cluster of infections in a restaurant which was using the one metre rule. Half of the people who came down with the disease were discovered to have been sitting more than two metres away from the primary source of the infection.:Sturgeon prepares to accelerate Scotlands exit from lockdown - but two-metre rule stays for nowAir flow and ventilation seem to be a big factor. Bad ventilation can super spread this virus. On the other hand, sophisticated air conditioning, such as on aircraft with HEPA filters, might actually suppress Covid , especiallypassengers are wearing masks.Theof time you are in contact with a person with Covid- also seems to be a major factor. Just donrsquot hang around, is the message. Indeed, wersquore told thatyou want to hold a conversation with someone you should really stand back to back. Which would be most interesting at a conference or reception ndash assuming we ever have them again.Professor Linda Bauld, of Public Health at Edinburgh University says politicians should ldquonot to get too hung up about distance. There is just too much going on to make this into an inviolable rule ndash like the R number which politicians obsessed about until recently.This at any rate is the view of the UK government. Boris Johnson believes that the costs of relaxing the two-metre rule are far outweighed by the likely costs of not relaxing it. This isnrsquot just a financial calculus ndash putting profits before health.Not allowing the schools toto anything resembling normality is likely to have a signicant impact on the long term health and wellbeing of young people. Similarly, not opening bars, restaurants and leisure activities means depriving many more young people of jobs and security ndash major factors in mental health.It is simply not possible to conduct anything resembling normal le with a two metre rule. Public transport becomes unmanageable, tourism is undermined, shops and offices stay closed. We are a gregarious species and trying to keep two metres away from our fellow man and woman is extraordinarily dficult.Children are not observing anything like a two metre rule in parks and gardens, as is only too obvious. It seems absurd therefore that they should be prevented from attending well managed and clean schools where the risk will be very much less.:CMO warnshealthboards not to assume Covid antibodies provide immunityMany parents were outraged at Mr Swinneyrsquos ldquoblended learning plans, with some pupils getting as little as a day of teaching per week. They made their feelings very plain to the Deputy First Minister and he appears to have got the message.Mr Swinney is now sounding more bullish than Boris Johnson about reopening the schools full time from August th.

If you were looking for an archetypal hard-bitten tabloid hack who embodied the highs and lows of the trade, then Iain Calder was your man.The former Daily Record reporter was something of a star in Scandalous! The Tabloid that Changed America, a look at the rise and plummet of the National Enquirer. Cynical, sharp, bursting with stories ndash had you requested him from central casting you would have sent him back for being too much of a cliche.But that was the Enquirer, according to this superb Storyville documentary: always too much for its own good.Mark Landsmanrsquos -minute film swung between two attitudes to the paper and what it had brought to journalism.The first, typied by Carl Bernstein, was censorious. The Enquirer should be looked at in the realm of popular culture rather than journalism, snfed the Watergate warrior by way of an introduction.But then the story of its origins and early operations began and the film was off to the races, half awed by the tale and more than a little amused.Bought in the s with mob money , the title was owned outright by Generoso Pope Junior, the son of an Italian newspaperman. Legend has it that ldquoGene was driving along a highway when he saw people rubbernecking an accident. The Enquirer had found the first of its specialisms: gore porn. Circulation went up to one million but Pope wanted  million. To do that the paper had to go where readers went, into the supermarkets. Out went the gore and in came celebrity news, gossip, dogs, medical oddities, psychics, UFOs and general wackadoodle doo. Stories were to be ldquoexploded, sensationalised, and for that Pope needed the best, some might say worst, in the business: Fleet and McFleet Streetrsquos finest.Calder led the exodus. By age  he had worked on the Falkirk Sentinel, the Stirling Journal, Falkirk Mail, and the Daily Record . Unable to find the skills and attitude he wanted among the American media, Calder recruited from home. It was a second colonisation of America, and the locals reacted about as well as they did the last time the Brits came.The main change ushered in by the Enquirer was that it paid for information. From this, the film argued, the rot set in. Irsquom not sure American journalism was always that holier than thou hitherto, but the Enquirer certainly encouraged others to follow its methods and madness. Why  Because it was phenomenally successful. The edition with a photo of Elvis in his coffin sold seven million.Some scandals were filed away, as when a female reporter found out about Bill Cosbyrsquos many infidelities. Calder spiked the story to get softer interviews from the star. ldquoI was making trades that would make our readers happier, said Calder today.For a time, where the Enquirer led the mainstream media followed, particularly on OJ Simpson.But when it got it wrong it got it dreadfully wrong, as when the paper ran a picture of Dianathe day before the Princess died in Paris. From there it was a quick slide into further infamy. And then The Donald showed up. The paper, under new ownership, began to ldquocatch and kill stories, a lot of them unfavourable to candidate Trump as he became. The cover up, says Bernstein, was the ldquoultimate corruption.Terric use of archive, a dream cast of talking heads, and a solid, clear narrative made Scandalous this weekrsquos must see documentary.The Enquirer would not touch The Great British Sewing Bee with a metre stick. The reality show, which reached its final last night, has been far too nice to attract tabloid attention. Why, these contestants even helped each other outthere was a problem.While it was short on anything approaching real drama, the GBSB had enough going for it in genial host Joe Lycett, a worthy winner in s enthusiast Dr Clare, and judges, Esme Young and Patrick Grant, who knew their stuff. I particularly enjoyed Young reminiscing about sitting on a window ledge with Bowie watching the Notting Hill carnival go by.

Itrsquos a master class in political cynicism. So forgive meIrsquom cynical in .Many parents were angry that their children werenrsquot going to get the education they need. Home learning has been disastrous with some teachers reporting only a handful of children turning up for online lessons. Many other parents worried schools might not be safe enough for .Teachers busied themselves getting their classrooms ready for social distancing. Head teachers devised complicated timetables which would see groups of children in school on alternate days or weeks, or dfering times of the day.However, the SNP came under pressure over this worrisome and confusing policy. Angry parents and opposition MSPs made le dficult for Nicola Sturgeonrsquos government. As a result, on Tuesday, the policy changed.Now the plan is for schools to reopen full-time in August without social distancing. Why  Whatrsquos changed  Apparently, according to Swinney, when it comes to the pandemic, ldquothe picture looks more positive.Forgive me,I donrsquot believe this. Only a fool would think that this country ndash along with many other nations which have handled coronavirus much more successfully ndash isnrsquot heading for a second wave. Surgeons, nurses and GPs all fear a second wave.Countries which have eased lockdown are experiencing spikes and clusters. France recorded  new cases of coronavirus in  hours and is investigating five new clusters, bringing the total number of clusters in the country to . The country eased out of lockdown, opening bars and restaurants from early June but continues to see hundreds of new daily cases.Italy has recorded  new cases of coronavirus. Therersquos been clusters reported in Spain and Germany that have led to new restrictions being imposed. China fears a second wave.Scotland has handled the pandemic little better than the UK. Therersquos been more than  deaths here. In the UK, therersquos been more than ,. Scotland has roughly a tenth of the UKrsquos population. The figures speak for themselves.How is this a ldquopositive picture as Swinney claims  Understandably, parents are even more worried now. Before, it seemed that it was just their childrenrsquos education which would suffer. Now, parents worry about ato school without social distancing measures. Theyrsquore also more confused than ever. Swinneyrsquos announcement clashes with much of the information theyrsquore receiving from schools about their childrenrsquos education.Teachers are also worried. Theyrsquore genuinely scared. Theyrsquore being asked to go into their classrooms unsuregovernment guidance is sufficient to protect them. Nobody should be expected to go to work fearful. Teachers also feel used. They worked hard to put the \"blended\" model in place ndash now thatrsquos gone. So, itrsquos little wonder that teachers are angry with the SNP.The SNPrsquos dithering, confused messaging on education appears simply cruel when it comes to teachers, parents and children.But the most repellent aspect of the whole fiasco is the crowing and gloating and politicking by our MSPs and their party apparatchiks. Once Swinney switched from the blended model to a straightforwardto school, opposition MSPs were up on their hind legs bragging about a \"u-turn\". They had won. The SNP had been humiliated.The SNP, of course, said it wasnrsquot a u-turn. The blended model remained as a contingency planthe infection worsened. There were caveats, the nationalists said, so therersquod been no volte faceHerersquos the truth: it was a u-turn ndash but nobody cares. The SNP did cave in to pressure from parents and opposition parties, and wersquoll all have to wait and seethat capitulation was safe and sensible. To claim this isnrsquot a u-turn is to reinvent the concept of geometry, and political language.However, outside the incestuous bubble of Holyrood no-one gives a damn. Parents care about their children. Teachers care about their safety and their pupils. Who would spare even a thought to the pride and ego of the political class And this is what sickens most of all. Our politicians think that moving the debate from the future of our childrenrsquos education to the issue of whether they got a political win out of this or not is acceptable. It shows how deeply these people are out of touch with the rest of us.Party politics in inimical to the interests of the people. Political parties take a position, their rivals take the opposite position, and they dig in. It doesnrsquot matter whatrsquos good for us. Like generals in the First World War, they draw their lines and the casualties are the little people, the rank and file.The only issue that matters is that our children get a good education, that parents feel their children are safe and prospering, and that teachers feel protected at work. Thatrsquos all we should care about. Politics should be inconsequential.Parents, teachers and, most of all, children are being failed by our political class. But then the only lesson to be learned from this entire fiasco is that Scottish politics itself is a failure.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

He grew up in Yorkshire and signed for Hull when he was . He might then have stayed on at Hull and had a great career there, but he left, and played in America, then came to Scotland where Kilmarnock wanted him, then went off to Canada and lots of other places and none of it ever felt very comfortable for him and a big part of the reason for that was his sexuality.But now, this week, Thomas has gone public, making him only the second male professional footballer in the UK to reveal hersquos gay. Without doubt, itrsquos an important step for sport and for LGBT equality, but because Thomas retired in , it doesnrsquot actually change the fact that there still isnrsquot a single out gay man playing in the professional game in Britain. There was Justin Fashanu in the s, but thatrsquos it.The fact Thomas has waited until now to talk openly is understandable: when, who, andgay people reveal their sexuality is up to them, but the problem is that the football industry was, and is, unwelcoming for gay men. Watfordrsquos captain Troy Deeney said the other day that every football team is likely to have a gay player. The fact that not a single one of them is public tells you everything you need to know.The problem boils down to three parts: players, management, and the fans, and the pressure they are exerting, possibly unconsciously, on players to stay silent. Right across the game, people are making assumptions about what football is and what masculinity is and how the two interact and gay men are picking it up from a very early age.Take the players first. Thomas Beattie says that when he signed as a youth professional with Hull, the senior players took him to a strip club as an initiation. The other players assumed Thomas would enjoy a strip club they had assumed he was heterosexual. He also says he heard gay slurs in the changing room, although he doesnrsquot think the players were being malicious ndash they were saying it because they assumed there was no one in the room to be hurt or offended.Management is also a problem. Thomas says therersquos still an assumption that a gay player would disrupt the team, in the same way that the British Army used to assume a gay soldier would lead to the army losing wars because it was too gay. Thomas also believes that, because society generally is getting better, managers assume homophobia isnrsquot an issue in football either and therefore do nothing.Then therersquos the fans. Can we be confident thatThomas had stayed on at Kilmarnock or Hull or any other team and had come out as gay that he wouldnrsquot have faced abuse from the fans  Thomas says he felt like society was telling him the world of being gay and being a footballer were enemies andyoursquore a football fan, it might be worth asking yourself what assumptions you make. Have you ever thought, for example, thata man is gay he probably canrsquot kick a ball All of these assumptions played their part in making Thomas unhappy and, although they donrsquot necessarily translate into outright abuse, they do the job just as well. You canrsquot be gay and a footballer. Being gay will be bad for the team. Yoursquore a footballer therefore you love the ladies.The solution is for everyone in the game to check their assumptions. Thomas puts it this way: be conscious of the environment yoursquore creating and whether it lets everyone feel included. When a new player joins the team, do not assume theyrsquore straight. Maybe a few players will be offended by this, but gay players will feel more welcome and more able in the long run to go public.Everyone should also listen to what Thomas Beattie says about the longer term consequences of football failing to change. ldquoDo not fear the day where a gay athlete is wearing the badge on your shirt, he says. ldquoFear the prolonged period of time when there isnt. In other words, football could be missing out on great players, but even worse than that: as society and other sports progress, football is going to look more out-of-date on the issue of sexuality and ndash letrsquos just say it ndash homophobic.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Ma Stewart, being of a certain age, had to stay at home and avoid the grocery store so Ive been doing her shopping every week since the lockdown. In the run up to Easter, little extras appeared on the shopping list, such as yellow food colouring or baking powder.Id almost entire forgotten I was due a birthday until, about three weeks before, icing sugar was suddenly requested. Each ingredient meant for a celebration cake, buried in the list weeks in advance.Back in March, as it became clear that something momentous was afoot, items began disappearing from supermarket shelves. Among the many things seared in the national memory from this extraordinary time will be the Great Loo Roll Rush of .Tinned items soon followed. Beans, soup, canned tuna - good luck to you. Soap, hand sanitiser, bleach. Practical items for people planning to be stuck at home with mouths to feed and germs to kill.If the whole toilet paper panic was inexplicable, what came next was logical but still a bit of a surprise. Where was all the flour The supermarkets had none, and when they did get some in stock there was a frantic rush on it. People were sharing tips in community Facebook pages about where had a supply in stock and offering to trade it, like a finely milled currency.Ditto yeast. Photographs of sachets of yeast appeared on these social media pages too, offers to post it out at inflated prices or do contactless handovers in odd places in exchange for a bag of self-raising.Twitter became one long thread of sourdough starter discussions. How to get them going, how to keep them going, how to move on when the frothing stopped and the starter ended.There were people giving names to their starters , posting photos of them on social media, even creating Instragram accounts solely for their off-white pots of yeast.Even simple homebaking has an air of performance in the age of social media but then, people are bored at home and a few tweets is as decent a use of time as anything .As bulk buyers left the baking aisle bare, millers were working around the clock, genuinely milling flour  hours a day, seven days a week, to keep up with demand. Usually, two million bags of flour are produced every week but during lockdown this doubled to four million.Interestingly, it wasnt the lack of flour that was the problem: it was the lack of packaging. There werent enough small bags to keep up with demand and not enough capacity to pack them.In my local supermarket things came to such a pass that, not only were the flour shelves bare, the shop eventually removed the shelves too so there was an empty cavity where they had previously been.Perhaps this was to quash quickly any rising anticipation that maybe some flour existed tucked away at the back.As the baking trend continued to rise, supermarkets innovated. Some sold kg bags of flour and, incredibly, people bought them. Other stores decanted the kg sacks into smaller brown paper bags and let shoppers have them for p or so.Of course, local corner stores had flour all along, as well as all the other staples wed been scrambling to grab in the big stores. A friend would come to my local shop for his flour and leave with several bags of self-raising only after standing through a lecture in Middle Eastern politics from the chatty shopkeeper.Lockdown has meant an increase in time and an increase in time has meant the ability to use local shops, a trend we should hope continues.But the baking thing. What was it about  Time, again. Our lives are built now around work. Where my grandmothers generation of women would routinely be at home with the children, and where baking was an everyday staple, our economic model now depends on both parents working and those kitchen skills have slid away.Baking bread or cakes, once a chore to work through, has become a romanticised task - all about self-care and mindfulness, as much as the basic need for sustenance. Keeping a sourdough starter alive takes work and commitment, regular feeding. AndInstragram is to be believed, regular conversations with your frothing paste.A sourdough loaf must be done in strict, timed stages, giving shape to the day. Eventhats all you do from morning til night, those otherwise wayward hours are structured.Baking bread takes mental and physical focus, kneading, folding, a patient wait for rise. Folding again. The smell of baking bread as the chemistry of heat does its thing, an edible science experiment. You are in control of transforming a selection of basic ingredients into something wonderful, something solid when all  is shting and unpredictable.I have always enjoyed baking. It is a small act of love to create something delicious for someone  and, while I do resist the notion of self-care, being a grizzled old cynic, its satisfying to bake yourself a treat.This has been quite a boon of lockdown easing - friends keep showing up with home baking. Early on there were brownies left on my doorstep. Ma Stewart has made me beautul cakes with her carefully squirrelled away ingredients. My friend Dan dropped me off a picnic for my birthday with two fresh baguettes hed made, another lockdown baking convert.Another birthday gt was an extraordinary ice cream cake, three flavours wrapped in a giant chocolate chip brownie casing. Ive been gted several fresh loaves from neighbours who overestimated what they needed.To bake and be baked for are both basic and exalted things at once. Before, it was a question of fitting baking into our busy lives. Now we structure days around baking.

A storm in  showed something strange in the sand at the Bay of Skaill and the Laird, William Graham Watt, went on to excavate part of a , year old village. After reading the original reports, I now know that this isn’t true. The real story is more interesting.The Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, has three papers on Skara Brae. The first was by Samuel Laing, who visited the site in autumn .“Two chambers have been completely excavated, together with the passage and parts of the entrances to other chambers by Mr William Watt, a relative of William Watt, Esq of Breckness, residing at Skaill, to whose zeal the scientic world is indebted for the discovery and exhumation of this interesting relic of antiquity.#When I saw the credit being given to a relative of William Watt Esq, rather than the man himself, I remembered my father, Peter Leith, telling me that his father, also Peter, had told him that a dferent William Watt, known as Black Willie, had been the man responsible.In the  Census, I found the Laird living at Skaill, aged , with a son William, aged . His son and heir, William WG Watt was  and living at Kierfiold, so there were two sons called William.In James Irvine’s  book, ‘The Breckness Estate’, I read that William G Watt had a natural son, William, who in  was given £ a year and free board, “so long as he chose to remain a clerk in the house.”The story then turned into a neat circle. I followed up a reference in the book and found it was an Orkney Herald article written by my grandfather. It was about Hugh Miller’s book ‘Rambles of a Geologist’, in which Miller recorded his visit to Orkney in .My grandfather had written: “Another interesting person, who has already been mentioned, was William Watt of Skaill. This was not, as some readers may suppose, the laird of Skaill, but a distant relative who made his home there. He was well-known to everybody as “Black Willie” from his dark hair and complexion. Like Miller, he was a self-taught geologist, he always carried a little bag with a hammer and chisel to dig out any fossils he came across. He brought some of his more interesting specimens for Hugh Miller’s inspection and they had an interesting discussion. When Skarabrae was first dug into in the ’s, it is certain that Black Willie took an active part in the work and saw to it that anything found was safely preserved.”I looked up the references to William Watt in the book and found that Hugh Miller had come with a letter of introduction to him and described him both as an intelligent geologist and an intelligent palaeontologist. He showed Watt, along with Dr Garson of Stromness, where his famous discovery, the Astrolepsis fossil, lay.To read about the second and third papers on Skara Brae and what Patricia found out, see page  of this week#s edition of The Orcadian.Patricia Long is a tourist guide based in Stenness with a strong interest in social history.

Transport operators continue to play a key role in supporting essential travel and in ensuring passenger confidence in public transport while maintaining physical distancing.

Caravans and self-contained accommodation which does not share services to be permitted, with caution to respect rural communities and the islands.July  — Outdoor restaurant and dining services and beer gardens to open.July  — Extension likely to be made to socialising with other households. Further details to follow in coming days.July  — Outdoor sports to resume and shopping centres to reopen.July  —  Meeting  indoors with up to two other households to be allowed, with physical distancing and attention to hygiene indoor learning and childcare service to resumeholiday accommodation, museums, galleries, monuments, cinemas and libraries to reopen . This will NOT include theatres, bingo halls and casinos.Pubs and restaurants will also be able to reopen indoors, on limited basis. But before you head for a drink, you#ll be able to get that much-needed chop at the hairdressers or barbers.Ms Sturgeon explained that other Phase Three plans, such as communal gatherings including weddings and funerals, will require further consideration. Changes to guidance around this is unlikely to take effect before July .The First Minister also confirmed Scotland#s aim to move away from blanket guidance for all shielding people, with hopes instead of more tailored advice.She said: #Our challenge, which is not an easy one, is to manage all of this change while keeping this virus firmly under control.#If, at any stage, there appears to be a resurgence, our path out of lockdown will be halted — and we may need to go backwards.#To avoid that, we must get as close as possible to elimination of the virus now.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It is important that we face our fears and do not avoid them.“The enjoyment we might get from moving more freely outside, travelling and meeting friends and family is tempered when we are worried about the spread of infection. By sticking to the rules during the gradual lting of restrictions, we can be confident that risk won’t rise. Less virus around us can be matched with less restriction.“Although there are practical things we can do to help ourselves cope over the coming weeks, remember that help is availableneeded.  We’ve never had to deal with a situation like this before, so be kind to yourself and to others, and reach outyou need to talk to someone.  Support is there.”For practical tips, you can visit clearyourhead.scot.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It looks increasingly likely that any exit from lockdown and safe re-opening of tourism and hospitality businesses could be during the low season.#Without financial support to tide them over, that could be the nail in the coffin for many businesses.“In Shetland, like where in Scotland, earnings from tourism during the spring and summer months sustains people through the winter and it is a real worry that coronavirus hit just when the visitor season was starting.#It is clear that a -month plan, at least, is needed to ensure that viable businesses can survive to provide a living for their owners and be ready to safely welcome visitors again when the time is right.”Speaking via video link earlier this week, Mr Carmichael welcomed the Chancellor of the Exchequer#s announced extension to the furlough scheme to protect jobs – but added more was needed to help tourism.“Here in the Northern Isles we particularly see that in the visitor economy, which is crucial to us,# he added.#The assistance for bed and breakfast operators, or operators of self-catering accommodation, leaves too many people without the assistance they need.“A support scheme that finishes at the end of August, or September or whenever it will be, simply will not be adequate in parts of the country such as ours.#Those parts of the country that have seasonal tourism require a -month programme, or  the tourism industry that will be left to be resurrected at the end of this process will be that much weaker, and the rebuilding and recovery that much more dficult.” on Wednesday also heard from struggling tourism businesses.One BB owner said she had been unable to apply for support funds as they required applicants to have paid businesses rates, whereas she paid domestic council tax.Living Lerwick has also raised the plight of small tourism operators.Project manager Emma Miller said that as some did not have a business banking account they had been unable to apply for the Creative or Tourism and Hospitality Enterprises Fund, which opened in Scotland to support the industry. raquo"},{"url":null,"title":"owners asked to let coastguard know if boats are left unattended ","story":"Boat owners are being reminded to please inform the coastguardthey will be leaving vessels unattended for any period of time.The Aith leboat was called out on Sunday evening after reports of a small boat lying empty near an uninhabited isle to the west of Scalloway.While no missing people had been reported in the area, the volunteer crew of the Charles Lidbury were asked by local coastguard officers to make their way to the scene and investigate.The call out came at .pm and the leboat team steamed south to where the skf had been moored – near the skerry of Sanda Stour at the entrance to Weisdale Voe.On arrival the small boat was recognised by a crew member – who then made contact with the boat#s owner to confirm that they were safe and well.

Lets hope I am proved wrong for the greater good of everybody  The way that poll is set up will skew the result in favour of the wind farm.WIth respect, a #gas-fired power station# on its own is not a possible option since a substantial amount of renewable energy is already installed and it won#t be going away, any time soon. Renewable energy, of course, must have a grid link and a fully-specied standbyplant to cover cable failures. Having two options involving a gas-fired power station obviously splits the vote for that option.Firstly:I am really confused about what this poll is supposed to achieve at this stage in the process and why,it#s important, the Shetland Times didn#t hold it  years ago.It seems that the Shetland public have already voted to reject the Shetland Times# wording of this question so I think it#s time to withdraw the poll and re-launch a new one.Might I suggest that the ST editors consult John Tulloch and an equally well qualied renewables engineer over the wording of the new question so that the public can vote on TWO clear options that are technically feasible, otherwise, it is a wasted exercise.

More perplexing was the apparent lack of imagination or government will to procure the extra resources, staff, transport and buildings that may have allowed more children towhile observing physical distancing.Eventually, political and parental pressure # combined with more encouraging news on the suppression of the virus # led to this week’s climbdown.But questions remain as to how the revised arrangements will work.In a week where it emerged that Covid- could cost Highland Council nearly £ million, it is understandable that education chair John Finlayson is frustrated over the allocation of resources.As opposed to every request having first to be evaluated in Edinburgh, he urged the Scottish Government to “give the local authorities the additional funding so they can get on with things”.“Time is short,” the former headmaster added.We should also recognise that teachers will have every right to feel aggrieved.For weeks they and other education colleagues have been preparing plans, liaising with parents and helping to kit out classrooms to ready themselves for a socially distant re-opening in August.Yet days before the end of term, they are now heading for a summer of uncertainty and face having to come up with a new set of operating guidelines.At a time when measures have still to be reduced for the wider public, teachers have been told that social distancing in schools will not apply at all.As EIS General Secretary Larry Flanagan pointed out this week: “Why would it be mandatory to wear a face covering on public transport but not in a classroom “Why would a till assistant be protected by a Perspex sheet but not a teacher “There cannot be a social distancing rule for outside of schools and a dferent one for inside classrooms.”In some quarters the teachers’ unions have been accused of being obstructive to the prospect of schools re-opening.But in the face of a virus which has shown just how much society depends on these key workers, they are right to stand up for the interests of their members.The trade union faced similar criticism the last time they called for a teachers’ pay-rise.Would anyone, especially parents after more than three months of classes at the kitchen table, argue against that now The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until th July .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3168924.jpg--.jpg?1591864132000\n","title":"nie meter readers ready to call again","story":"NIE Networks is to resume its meter reading activities across Northern Ireland after the service was temporarily paused due to COVID- restrictions. While NIE Networks staff will still not be entering customers’ homes to obtain a meter read at this time, they will call at customers’ doors and ask them to read their meter while they wait. Meter readers will be able to take readings from meters located in outside positions as normal.NIE Networks is urging customers to protect its meter readers and themselves by continuing to observe social distancing protocols. Ben Cupples, Meter Reading Manager at NIE Networks, explained the importance of recording a precise meter reading for the customer.“Providing a precise meter reading will ensure that your electricity bills accurately reflect your consumption,” he said. “Our meter readers will call to your home and will record the reading you provide while we wait.“If you are unable to read your meter for any reason oryou are not at home when we call, we will leave a card with information on how to submit your meter reading online via the NIE Networks website, via email or over the phone.”Mr Cupples explained that while meter reading activity would resume it would only be carried out with the health and safety of the public and meter readers in mind.“The safety of our employees and customers is our utmost priority. “If you see our meter readers out and about, we would ask that you please help them by standing at least two metres away. Likewise, we will stand at least two metres from customers’ doors at all times.“We are continually reviewing how we undertake our meter reading activities in light of COVID- and we are looking forward to being able to resume our normal way of working with customers at some stage, but we will only make that decision when it’s safe to do so.” NIE Networks is reminding customers that you only need to submit your reading to either NIE Networks or your supplier – there is no need to do it twice. Customers unable to submit a meter reading will receive an estimated bill from their supplier based on their usage history.If a member of the NIE Networks team arrives at the door, they will always show identication.

Victor Leonard, chairman of the international youth football competition at which Rashford was twice a winner with Manchester United, has always been impressed with the manner in which the young England international striker has handled himself. As Rashford vowed to continue helping those in need after successfully forcing the government to reverse its decision not to provide free school meal vouchers during the summer, Mr. Leonard described the footballer as an inspiration to everyone. He added: “We first came across Marcus in the Manchester United squads that came across to Northern Ireland to compete in our tournaments. “He was a smash hit as United went on to win the Premier section in  and  but you could not help but admire the way, even at a young age, Marcus conducted himself. “We have been across to United many times and it was always very clear how highly regarded he was as a player and a person.” Rashford came off the bench in United’s  final victory over County Tyrone at Ballymena Showgrounds and started when the Red Devils triumphed  months later against defending champions Vendee from France. Victor added: “I think he is an inspiration to everyone. He has been so passionate about this issue but gone about attempting to bring change in a highly commendable manner. “He is a credit to his family and his club and we at STATSports SuperCupNI are privileged that he is one of our tournament graduates who has gone on to achieve greatness in his football career and also through his campaigning for something in which he believes so fervently. “Hopefully he will continue to be an inspiration to all of us.” Rashford has raised about poundm to supply around three million meals to vulnerable people while working with charity FareShare UK during the coronavirus lockdown. In an emotional open letter to MPs, Rashford drew on his own experience of relying on free school meals and food banks growing up. He said his story was all too familiar for families in England.

Undoubtedly a major part of the reason has been the common sense of the public which has helped to dramatically curtail the spread of the coronavirus.However, it would not seem too much of a stretch of imagination to suggest that strong lobbying from ious sectors of the economy has also hastened the relaxations. Essentially, the new normal will be largely in place by the end of August, while earlier it had been anticipated that some sectors would not be ing until possibly December.The move to reduce social distancing from two metres to one from Monday carries an obviously greater risk of infection being spread. It is not only the distance involved, but also the time spent in the company of another person at that distance which multiplies the risk factor.The timing of the reopening of some facilities - for example betting shops, tattoo parlours, spas and massage and therapy facilities coming at least  days earlier than reopening libraries - seems a trle strange, although the economic benefit of the commercial premises is obvious.It would be churlish not to congratulate the Executive for its determination to get the economy ing again to some extent as quickly as possible. The politicians clearly have listened to business interests and put the ball in their court.It must also be recognised that the relaxation of the rules is accompanied by a health warning. Deputy First Minister Michelle O#Neill was clear that action would be takenthere was any indication that infections were spiking again, especially as we head towards the winter months, which is always a danger period, pandemic or no pandemic.The public and the business owners must continue to show the common sense and adherence to basic hygiene rules which have worked so far in containing the virus.

The NICS employs just over , workers.More than halfof all staff, however, missed no days last year due to illness, while .% of absence spells lasted five working days or less.Compared with the private sector, NICS absence levels are much higher, with the average private sector worker losing an average of . days due to illness.Staff who have served less than two years with the NICS also recorded lower sickness absence rates than those who had served longer - . days and . days.TUV leader Jim Allister said sick leave is unacceptably high in the NICS.“Among the plethora of statistics two strike me most. One, how sick levels among probationers is substantially lower - suggesting the stricter sick leave regime operated for probationers works, he told the Belfast .Two, the contrast with the private sector again suggests a dferent culture at play in the public sector.”Anxiety, stress, depression and other psychiatric illnesses accounted for the most absencesand, within this category, work-related stress accounting for around a third of the days lost.Looking at absences across each Stormont department, the Department of Justicehad the highest sickness absence rate with an average of . days lost, while the Executive Office had the least at . days.A DoJ spokesperson said: “The Department of Justice continues to take a proactive approach to the management of sickness absence including application of NI Civil Service policies and procedures such as written warnings, dismissals and ill health retirements where appropriate. A high priority is placed on the health and wellbeing of staff and a range of support services are provided. The vast majority of DOJ staff operate in front line roles, which creates particular pressures.”The figures, covering the  months to the end of March this year, also show that Covid- accounted for .% of all NICS sickness absences. These absences occurred between January and March.Looking at gender, women had a higher rate of sickness absence than men, with an average of  days and . days lost, respectively.The largest cause of this disparity was pregancy-related illness and, when this is excluded, the absence level for females dropped to . days.Some .% of staff had at least one long-term period of absence, with all long-term absences making up % of the total amount of working days lost. The average long-term absence was . working days.The Department of Finance handles civil service personnel. A spokesperson acknowledged that the NICS has more work to do in addressing sickness absences across departments.The sickness absence reasons highlighted by the report, particularly in relation to absence due to anxiety, stress, depression and psychiatric illness, reflect the prevalence of mental health issues across society, they added.Arrangements are in place within the civil service to quickly identy staff experiencing stress and offer support. In many cases there is an immediate referral to the Occupational Health Service and trained Welfare Officers will make contact to offer support and signpost staff to more specialised supportthis is required.

Mr Maskey wrote: If the Assembly passes this resolution to enable the commission to develop any new determination, the commission is mindful of the need to ensure that any provisions both comply with wider good practice and ensure value for money in the use of public resources. Rigorous processes will continue to be in place to ensure that members demonstratethat all expenditure is in accordance with the rules regarding such allowances before they are reimbursed. Mr Maskey added these are complex matters which the commission considered in detail. The commission believes that this approach will retain the core principle of decisions on members# salaries and pensions being decided independently, while allowing some of the dficulties members have experienced in providing constituency services over recent years to be addressed, he wrote.Belfast Related Content\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland c .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_bfa-df-f-a-fbdbefab_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland c .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_bfa-df-f-a-fbdbefab_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland c .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_bfa-df-f-a-fbdbefab_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland c .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_bfa-df-f-a-fbdbefab_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland c .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_bfa-df-f-a-fbdbefab_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Northern IrelandProposal for Stormont body to set MLA expenses to be consideredA proposal for a Stormont body to set expenses for MLAs is being considered.Most ReadNoah Donohoe: Police say investigation still #very much a missing persons enquiry#Northern Ireland hairdresser in plea to public over £ quoteMalachi O#DohertyOpinionMichelle O#Neill said to know Bobby Storey was to love him.

Patrick McGonagle, , whose address was given as Old School Lane in Shantallow appeared in court on June  charged with breaching his bail conditions on June  by ‘intentionally exposing his genitals’. The defendant had been released on bail on June  after being charged with common assault, namely throwing bread at a woman and attempting to grab her, and disorderly behaviour in a public place. A police officer said that on June  the PSNI became aware of a video circulating online showing a man acting in an ‘indecent manner’. googletag.cmd.push It was brought to the attention of police by community representatives and family members of children who witnessed it. McGonagle was identied in multiple reports. The officer said the incident took place at Old School Lane where the -year-old was seen ‘defecating in view of children’. A -year-old recorded the incident. The officer added: “He used chip shop wrappers to wipe himself. He was extremely intoxicated.” Police located the defendant at Old School Lane and he charged straight away. Objecting to bail, the officer said on June  McGonagle was warned about his behaviour and not to be intoxicated in a public place. googletag.cmd.push The court heard the -year-old has  previous convictions and two suspended sentences. There is an ‘extremely high risk of reoffending’, the officer added, ‘this man is incapable of not being intoxicated in a public place.’ Defence barrister Stephen Mooney said his client pleaded guilty to the offences before the court on Monday at the first opportunity and it was adjourned for a pre-sentence report. McGonagle was not in a position to be interviewed by the police due to his level of intoxication. Mr Mooney told the court that back in   the -year-old spent a ‘very signicant’ period of time in custody on remand. He was then found ‘unfit for trial’ because of his mental capacity and the prosecution was discontinued. The defence barrister said it is not so much a ‘fool’s pardon but a street drinker’s pardon’ as he is a well-known street drinker. His alcoholism is being criminalised because of his inability to stay sober, he added. Mr Mooney asked for bail to be granted with strict conditions attached. District Judge Peter King said ‘you’re absolutely correct’ and any bail conditions would have to include a prohibition on alcohol which would set him up for ‘spectacular failure’. He added that McGonagle may upset the ‘wrong person or group of people and find himself facing more dficulties’. The defendant was remanded in custody due to a ‘clear risk of reoffending’ to appear by way of video link on July .

Hannah Richardson has grown up in Derry and is well-known in the local rock music scene as lead singer guitarist in three-piece rock band CHERYM. Her mother is a white Irish woman and father a black Sierra Leonean. Until now the -year-old has found the topic of racism dficult to address. But she felt duty-bound to speak out following the Black Lives Matter protests and subsequent stories in the Derry News. Nurse Beverly Simpson addressed the rally in Derry on June  then shared her family’s experience of racism in the city. googletag.cmd.push Last week, pharmacist Nkele Mushapho said she has been subjected to racism in the workplace with people requesting an ‘Irish pharmacist’ and constantly questioning her advice. Ms Richardson was ‘shocked’ that people commenting underneath those stories seemed unaware of racism in the city and were in some cases denying its existence. She has encountered racism since the age of  in nursery school and can’t understand the dismissive attitudes of some people. “There are a lot of people who are in denial about the fact that racism exists here,” she said. “I’ve lived here my whole le, it is a lovely place to live, the people here are fantastic. googletag.cmd.push “However, yes, there are a lot of racist people that live in Northern Ireland and Derry as well. “Racism is so common that I now have a tendency to just get on with it because you know it’s going to happen again the next time you go out. It becomes normal.” She was raised by a white mother and all her friends are predominantly white. Until now, she has never felt the need to make public her views. But the experience of Ms Mushapho struck a chord and she couldn’t believe people were disregarding her account. “I was reading those comments going, ‘seriously, you don’t know how bad it is’. I know that not all people from here are racist, or have anything against black people, but a lot of people are ignorant to the idea of racism. “A lot of people here find it acceptable to use racial slurs or casual racism because there’s never really been that many black people about to correct them or tell them otherwise - that ‘yes, that is offensive’.” COMPASSION Ms Richardson has natural afro hair which has attracted negative attention in the past: “I used to be fine with wearing it out, loud and proud and happy days, but recently every single time that I would wear my natural hair as opposed to having weaves or wearing a hat, somebody would say something about me. “Whether it be, ‘are you on your holidays or where are you from ’ “I was walking through Foyle Street recently when some boy came right up to me and screamed Mo Salah in my face. “It’s every weekend, every single day I leave the house with my hair like that I would say it happens. “It’s really, really tough. So, it is shocking to see people being so dismissive of other people’s experiences because I assumed everybody knew that it was like this but they clearly don’t.” The -year-old believes that now is the right time for everyone to have conversations about race. She was dismayed by comments underneath a post by former politician Pat Ramsey a number of years ago in which he shared a story of racist abuse directed at a group of black people visiting the city. On nights out people are ‘the worst’ because they see a group of black people and approach them, she said. At times it can be positive but on other occasions ‘slurs are thrown about’. Looking back, Ms Richardson ponders whether she should’ve engaged with people commenting under Pat Ramsey’s post. However, the most recent comments with people saying Ms Mushapho was ‘lying’, ‘Derry is not like that’, ‘Irish people have history of oppression and wouldn’t act in such a way’ couldn’t go unaddressed, Ms Richardson said. “Your own experience of oppression should not ever take away from the experiences of black people,anything it should make you more compassionate towards another minority suffering from racism. “Is it because people can’t relate to black struggle that they have to turn the oppression back on themselves. “We need to take a look at what’s going on under our noses.” PROGRESSIVE In her view, it is right to shine a spotlight on injustices everywhere but she believes it is wrong to overlook what is happening in the city by directing comments at Ms Mushapho such as ‘racism exists in South Africa too’. “That’s like saying, ‘your experience doesn’t matter to me, take a look at your own people’”, Ms Richardson added. She despises use of the word ‘coloured’ saying it is completely inappropriate when describing a black person. Experts on racism say it is regarded as a highly offensive racial slur which recalls a time when casual racism was a part of everyday le. In the US, because of the countrys era of racial segregation, it is among the most offensive words for describing a black person. Ms Richardson believes some people in Derry are intentionally racist but many others are completely unaware, they lack a basic understanding of what terms are racist. She explained: “A lot of us are ignorant on the subject, you might have made racist remarks in the past but you yourself might not be racist. “As long as you learn from that racist remark, take what you can from it and accept you may have offended someone then that’s a good progressive way to be.” Reflecting on the way forward, she concluded: “Does racism exist in Northern Ireland  Totally. “Does it exist in Derry  Aye. “Don’t be afraid to ask questions, to ask other black people “Stop disregarding people’s experiences of racism. “Let’s think about what can we do to make sure Derry is anti-racist, as opposed to just being against racism, what can we do to make this a better place ”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

As more and more companies continue to get back to work, we look at how the financial support is helping firms across the nation to adapt, innovate and protect jobs. Here is an example of how companies have been helped, and what support is available. Business Lenders like Danske Bank in Northern Ireland have been working with the UK Government to provide vital financial support to companies experiencing lost or deferred revenue as a result of the pandemic. googletag.cmd.push They have appointed a dedicated head of business sector engagement to lead proactive engagement with businesses, raising awareness of the support available. Robert McCullough has taken on the important role. Speaking last month, he said: “Since the beginning of March, Danske Bank has provided poundmillion in overall business lending, including poundmillion through the UK government-backed Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme and poundmillion on the Bounce Back Loan Scheme.” The UK Government’s Bounce Back Loan Scheme grants finance of up to pound, to small and medium-sized businesses, interest-free for the first  months. Meanwhile, for companies with a turnover of up to poundmillion, the UK-wide Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme allows them to access up to poundmillion where the UK Government will pay interest and any fees for the first  months. googletag.cmd.push Danske Bank has also been able to provide relief of up to poundmillion to large businesses via the Coronavirus Large Business Interruption Loan Scheme. As the largest bank in Northern Ireland, Danske Bank supports companies in a wide iety of sectors, such as retailers Lunn’s Jewellers, manufacturers The Signature Works and in tourism, family-run bus company Airporter.  poundM LENDING: Danske Bank’s Robert McCullough Robert said: “Businesses in some industries have managed to adapt quickly to a new reality of remote working and social distancing, while others have regrettably seen trade grind to a halt. “The unprecedented measures announced by the government will help a lot of companies to survive and we are hopeful the majority will ultimately recover.” The bank was able to launch each of the Schemes on day one, the majority of applications being approved through an easy, automated process. “Getting this financial support in place in Northern Ireland was the result of a huge effort from teams across the Danske Bank and we continue to work hard to make sure the process is as good as it should be and that we can get money to our customers quickly. “There is no doubt that we have an important role to play in the weeks and months ahead to get Northern Ireland moving again. “We have the commitment and the capacity to continue to support customers, the community and the wider economy.”  FINDING A SOLUTION: Staff working at the Sunamp site in East Lothian When the Covid- pandemic arrived the chief executive officer of East Lothian firm Sunamp, knew the company could respond. Andrew Bissellsaid: “A week into lockdown I woke up in the middle of the night and just thought ‘we have to do something that makes the business relevant in this crisis’.” Mr Bissell turned to Sunamp’s innovative technology, developed in partnership with the University of Edinburgh. The company has led the way in the manufacture of heat batteries that store heat energy rather than electricity like conventional batteries. The applications of the technology span several industries, but the company’s focus has so far been on offering a product that replaces the hot water tank in heating systems with something smaller and more efficient. Recognising the potential of the technology in the context of Covid-, Sunamp was one of more than , companies to apply for grant funding from Innovate UK, the UK Government’s innovation agency. In April, Innovate UK launched the Fast Start initiative, with poundm of funding available to companies responding to the pandemic with some form of innovation. In the end, Sunamp was one of  companies to secure a grant.  The pound, award is being used to develop mobile handwash units that can be installed in locations where people lack access to hygiene facilities that can help prevent the spread of Covid-. Mr Bissell said: “You don’t need hot water to wash your hands, but it is much more comfortable. “Right now, we’re dealing with the virus in the summer time, but as we head into winter,you have to wash your hands outside a railway station or supermarket or vaccination centre, it will be much more pleasant to have warm water.” The idea has gained traction with Sunamp’s clients, with inquiries coming in rapidly even though the finished product is still in development. Mr Bissell said: “Covid- is a global problem so there’s widespread interest. “Sunamp has partnerships and licensing arrangements with businesses all around the world through which it sells its heat batteries, so the ambition for the mobile units is international.” For Mr Bissell, the appeal of the project is that in addition to its obvious commercial potential, there’s a real societal benefit. “There is no minimising the negatives of Covid-,” he said. “But there are many people stepping and doing amazing things.” Working with everything from gas boilers to solar and heat pumps, Sunamp says its Heat Batteries deliver hot water with efficiency and proven savings of up to  per cent on utility bills in residential, commercial or industrial settings. The types of support on offer to help your company… Here are some examples of the support available for businesses and workers. middot The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has enabled businesses to put employees on a period of temporary leaveand apply for a UK Government grant to cover  per cent of those workers’ usual monthly wage costs, up to pound, a month. middot The Self-Employment Income Support Scheme will allow eligible self-employed iniduals to claim a taxable grant of  per cent of their average monthly profits, up to pound,. middot UK VAT-registered firms have been given the option to defer VAT payments until the end of June.

With handsanitiserat the door to every store, one-way systems, contactlesspayment, and limits on customernumbers, the new normal might take a while to get used to. Around half the shops in Foyleside Shopping Centre were open on Tuesday morning, with Dunnes Stores attracting the biggest crowds. Staff in Marks and Spencers and Boots, which have remained open throughout the pandemic, were glad to see a bit more hustle and bustle in the centre And with sales on in Debenhams, Dunnes and Marks and Spencer, many shoppers remarked on how happy they were to be out spendingagain. googletag.cmd.push But while the shops are open, cafes and coffee shops in the shopping centres remain closed for now. Mary McLaughlin, who hasnt been shopping in the city centrein over three months, said shewas glad to be back. This is my first day back up the town and Im all hyper with it, she said. I havent been up thetown since way beforeSt Patricks Day Its been awful not being able toget up the town, butas long as we are all healthy thats the main thing. Its just great to get out again. Ive been looking forward to it. Self-confessed shopaholic Geraldine Deery has been yearning for the social side of shopping. googletag.cmd.push Im ashopaholic and its been drivingme crazy, she said. I missed going up the town and meeting people and having a chat. And I really miss going in for a cup of coffee with my sister. Ive gone abit crazy buying things, Im making up for losttime of the weeks I missed. The management at Foyleside, The Richmond Centre and Debenhams have clearly put a lot of timeand effortinto establishingand marking out one-way systems and there are plenty of signs in place reminding people to keep to the two metre social distance rule. You do be a bit nervous because youre looking at the floor, trying to make sure you are going the right way, said Mrs McLaughlin. Everything is well spaced out and the floors are all marked out. Although Im glad I came out early because its quiet at the minute. Derrys small independent retailers are also slowly getting back to business after getting the go ahead this week, David Thomas, whose jewellery shop and workshop Thomas Goldsmith has operated from Pump Street for over  years, has been surprised that some of his fellow small traders havent reopned yet.  Ive just been for a walk round and Ive noticed that a large number of small independents arent openat the minute. This is the second dayinto it and they are taking their time to get back to work. Maybe thats their own choice. It surprisedme because to rebuild businessagain is important. For a lot of them who have furloughed staff and who are self employed as it were and are receiving payments they are thinking I wont risk it because theres a safety net there. But obviously that safety net is going to start disappearing. Business has been quite slow this week, but MrThomas is hopeful that shoppers will be back. We arecompleting the work we werent able to complete in March after the guillotine came down and we werent able to finish. And then we were hit by problems in the supply chain but that has started to ease up. In the last two weeks it has relaxed and things are filtering thoughnow. Were now able to complete things we should have done in March so weve stillgot that momentum from then, but in terms of work coming through its going to be a bit slow. There are a lot of people are being made redundant or who havent been able to claim grants and things like that. But on the other hand there are people who were furloughed and had to stay at home and werent able to spend money and they should have a fairly healthy bank account and they are desperate to get out and buy stuff. Mr Thomas has made changes to the way the shop operates in order to comply with the new regulations. Only one customer is admitted at a time, staff are usingfacemasks and hand sanitiser, and jewellery that has been tried on is being cleaned before it goes back on th shelf. People are understanding and respectful, remarked Mr Thomas. He feels that lockdown has given people time to reflect on their work le balance and lestyle. People are saying it will never be the same, he said. We were all chasing our tails a bit, workingvery hard. Does it have to be like that  Can we take things a bit easier  Do we have to be rushing off to Portugal on cheap flights  It has been strangeto sit at home in the garden and look up and see the skies totally clear. Many of Derrys charity shops have also reopened their doors, with Oxfam, Kinship Care, the Red Cross and Cancer Focus back in businessearlier this week. However, the three month closure has meant some stores are struggling with low stock levels. Deborah Tracey is the manager at Cancer Focus on Shipquay Street, which opened in May .  The shop reopened last Friday after a week of cleaning and preparation and have been busy ever since. Inside there is hand sanitiser at thedoor and a one-waysystem in place. Most people have been using the hand sanitiser before they come in, said Ms Tracey. We have been busy with people bringing stuff in and buying stuff too. People seem to feel confident coming out to shop now and theyare glad toget back to a bit of normality. Cancer Focus has amanager and deputy manager but all the other staff are volunteers. Some of our volunteers have been worried about coming back because they are older and more at risk, said MsTracy. So weare lookingfor newvolunteers now. We provide everyonewith shields, masks and gloves for their safety. Cancer Focus has also launched an appeal for donations. Any donations to the shop must be quarantined for  hours when we receive them, said Ms Tracy. We are looking for donations of clothes, bric-a-brac, shoes, bags and books. If you would like to make a donation to Cancer Focus or to enquire about becoming a volunteer telephone .

At present, hospitality businesses have to adhere to strict licensing laws in terms of serving outdoors. However, local councils have been encouraged by the Northern Ireland Executive to take a flexible approach to the situation to support the sector as it emerges from the coronavirus lockdown. Derry City and Strabane District Council is currently looking at ways it can help local businesses. They have launched a short survey asking for peoples opinions on the matter. The survey can be filled in here -https:bit.ly eohTnm googletag.cmd.push A council spokesperson said: The hospitality and retail industries have been some of the hardest hit in terms of lost revenue during COVID-. They will also be one of the last to fully emerge from the lockdown. With the impact of the pandemic and the resulting social distancing measures that must continue when businesses reopen it is essential that we start to reimagine how theservice industries can adapt and operate in the current circumstances.New business models and taking hospitality and trade outdoors will play a signicant part in the survival of the service industry locally. Using private and public spaces such as pavements, car parking spaces and events spaces such as Guildhall Square, Waterloo Place and the Canal Basin in Strabane could be part of the solution. googletag.cmd.push To achieve this, Council and key stakeholders including Department for Infrastructure and the Department for Communities will be adopting a flexible approach that seeks to facilitate innovation - whilst ensuring appropriate controls such as Insurance, disability access, enforcement and public health are in place.

Dean O’Neill, from Drumsurn, died suddenly last week and mourners at his funeral yesterday heard how the news had left the community in shock. “The church would be absolutely packed todaythings were normal,” said Fr Seamus Kelly, officiating at the funeral. “The tragic news that spread throughout the area on Thursday morning stunned the whole community. “He was one of the most gted sportsmen to emerge in Drumsurn in recent years and it was lovely to see all the young people with their shirts on as his remains were being carried in.” googletag.cmd.push  Dean, known around the community as ‘Floater’, excelled on the sports field and Fr Kelly described him as ‘one of the most gted sportsmen to emerge from Drumsurn in recent years’. In the colours of St Patrick’s College, Dungiven, he was outstanding and won a Derry vocational schools’ All-Star award in . He represented St Matthew’s GAC and Kevin Lynch Hurling Club and carried his talent with modesty. Fr Kelly recalled how he deflected praise after a notable victory at minor level. “He covered every blade of grass in defence and attack but didn’t want any great glory,” he told the congregation. googletag.cmd.push “When Drumsurn and Drum amalgamated as St Patrick’s at minor level a few years ago, he gave an exhibition of football as he dragged his team back into contention and eventually saw them defeat Glenullin having been nine points down at half time. “He declared humbly, ‘sure Micheacuteal Archibald deserves praise more than me’. He loved sport and played Gaelic, soccer, hurling and basketball with distinction for the school.”  Dean in the colours of Kevin Lynch Hurling Club. Off the pitch, Fr Kelly told mourners how Dean had a great sense of fun and spoke of his great love for his family and friends. “He tortured friends and relations with pranks and jokes. He was very close to all his cousins and friends and kept in touch with them,” he said. “When his brother, Justin, go married, he was best man for him and was godfather to their first child, Taylor. He absolutely doted on her, as indeed he did on all his nephews and nieces. “I know how proud Justin and Jordan were of their brother Dean, but they all have wonderful memories as have Gertie, Rory and wider family and friends. “He met a lovely girl in Amber and it looked like they would settle down for good. Of course, he was not known as Dean, it was just ‘Floater’ to all his friends who loved him so much. “In recent times, he had settled a lot and went to live in Dungiven, although, he always insisted, he was a Drumsurn man.” Fr Kelly spoke of the great sadness within the community following his passing. “I’m well aware that Drumsurn is in a state of mourning, as Dean was so well-known and loved here,” he said. “However, we have a promise that death is not the end, but another step on the journey to eternal le. “Everyone who knew him, or even met him, loved him. He had an amazing personality that endeared him to all and had a relentless sense of fun. “To young and old, he was a legend. It has been the most common remark uttered over the past few days. What a character.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Void Gallery is ‘delighted’ to announce artists Alan Phelan and David Beattie as the recipients of the Plinth Commissions for  and . The Walker Memorial Plinth was built in  - a  metre high column topped by a five metre high statue of the Reverend George Walker who was Governor of the city during the siege of Derry in . The column and statue were blown up by the IRA in . googletag.cmd.push The remaining plinth and its historical signicance have meant it has been a contentious space in the city. Funded by the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Plinth Commissions is a collaboration between Void Gallery, The Siege Museum and Friends of the Derry Walls. The ambition of the commission is to reclaim the space as a public area for collaboration and collective participation. Through an open call, artists both North and South of the border were invited to propose a project involving the community that surrounds the Plinth, creating sculptural interventions as part of the collaboration. The first commission by Dublin-based artist Alan Phelan will launch in September . googletag.cmd.push Phelan’s project is a crowd-sourced sculpture made by inidual participants in isolation, then assembled together to create the final artwork. This collective making process acknowledges and commemorates the COVID- crisis. The sculpture will be of a hyacinth flower using the red, green and blue colours with petals made in papier-macirccheacute, based around a small similar work due to be exhibited at Void Gallery as part of Phelan’s exhibition ‘echoes are always more muted’ which launches at the same time. Alan Phelan commented: “I am delighted to be part of the Plinth Commissions for . “My idea is to work with the community to mark this strange time we have all experienced and harness the people power of socially distanced activity to make this public sculpture. “I look forward to working with Void Engage and bringing people together by staying apart, as they say, for this project.” Launching in , David Beattie proposes a project that will unfold as an invitation to the community to collectively examine the River Foyle as an interconnecting body of water, a richness of bioersity, and a measure of perpetual time. Participants will be invited to connect with the river through a series of engagements that record their experiences and allow them to rethink their relationship with the river and their natural environments. The project will culminate in a sound recording that will be played from the Plinth and will mark the high and low tide of the river, bringing awareness of the rhythm of the river, and movement of time to people within the city. David Beattie, who is also from Dublin, said he was delighted to be selected for this unique commission. “It feels extra special to be supported to produce new artwork during a precarious time for artists and art workers. “I look forward to working alongside the team at Void and the communities on both sides of the River Foyle to realise the project for the Walker Plinth.” Void Director Mary Cremin added: “We are very excited about this public art programme that we have been developing in partnership with The Siege Museum and the Friends of the Derry Walls. “It is a signicant moment to have this plinth reclaimed as a public space when you consider how contentious public monuments and memorials are in this current moment in time,” added Ms Cremin.

He was a dream of a young fella. He was a fantastic hurler and loved representing his club and county. Family, friends and team mates held him in high esteem and he is sorely missed by us all.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

St Marys Grammar School, Magherafelt, confirmed they intend to use the transfer test, known as the GL Entrance Assessment. In a statement, the school said they are aware of the unprecedented circumstances of this year. After y consideration of the issues, the Board of Governors of St Marys Grammar School intends to use academic selection in its admissions criteria for pupils wishing to transfer to the school in September , it read. The GL Entrance Assessment will be conducted in accordance with the most up-to-date Public Health Agency guidance available to schools at that time. googletag.cmd.push The school are part ofa group called the Post-Primary Transfer Consortium , who have taken measures to mitigate some of the disruption caused by Covid- this academic year. The group released a statement claiming marking and standardising approaches will ensure comparable outcomes to previous years. It will not, for example, be harder to achieve an A grade this year, it read. Every year, regardless of how many pupils sit the Entrance Assessment or of whether the papers prove to be slightly easier or more dficult than a previous year, the marking and standardisation processes ensure that similar proportions of pupils will achieve similar grades. googletag.cmd.push St Marys added that they have a contingency plan in the event of the Entrance Assessment not being able to take place. They said: Should it be required, the implementation of this plan will include alternative admission criteria, the details of which will be published for parents at that time. Any change of circumstances would have to be considered in the local context, acted upon and communicated to parents at the earliest possible date. St Columbs and Thornhill in Derry city are among a number of schools that have opted against asking prospective pupils to take the transfer test this year. Both are also members of the PPTC. Another County Derry member, Rainey Endowed in Magherafelt, are yet to publicly announce their arrangements, but astatement from the PPTC is available on their website, detailing information about transfer arrangements.

The Unity of Purpose group was in the news earlier this month when it called for the postponement of a Black Lives Matter rally which was held in Derrys Guildhall Square on June . In a statement, which was issued through the City Centre Initiative in Derry, the group said they understood and supported the reasons for the rally, but added that they believed it should be called off due to public safety concerns in relation to the coronavirus pandemic. However, despite the appeal, the rally went ahead and police subsequently issued  fines to people taking part in the protest. googletag.cmd.push In its recent statement, a spokesperson for theUnityofPurposegroup said it consists of local MPs, MLAs, the Mayor and statutory and business leaders within Derry. In the wake of the Black Lives Matters rally,Shaun Harkin and Eamonn McCann, People Before Profit councillors on the local council, criticised the stance of the Unity of Purpose group and called for the group to disband. The Unity of Purpose group did not respond to the councillors criticisms. Speaking at todays monthly meeting of the council, independent councillor Gary Donnelly accused the group of being very very selective on what they comment on. There have been a lot things that have happened in this city during the time that this group has been about and they have issued no statements. he said. googletag.cmd.push My concern is that they are not accountable, they dont respond and there is a council connection that I am deeply concerned about. I have seen photographs with councillors and I have seen photographs with council officers and I want to try and get some clarication on that. I want clarication on funding. Do we fund them directly or indirectly  I know there is a link to them through the City Centre Initiative. Far from saying what they say they do on the tin, their actions have led to people becoming more marginalised and excluded, added Cllr Donnelly. Speaking at todays meeting, Councillor Eamonn McCann described the Unity of Purpose group as a faceless organisation. He said it was unusual that there no inidual names attached to the recent statement issued by the group. Does this group have a policy document that we can look at  Does it have a constitution  Does it have a set of aims or a mission statement  Becausewe dont see that we are unable to work out in what way the opposition to the Black Lives Matter rally comes within their remit, said Cllr McCann. Cllr Donnelly proposed that the council carry out a report into connections between the council and the Unity of Purpose group. The matter was put to a vote and the proposal was carried, after  councillors voted to support it. Six councillors voted against the proposal.

Given the restricted nature of these activities, we don’t see any clubs being left behind as we continue to work towards ato competition in September. I encourage all clubs to plan for that time with the highest safety standards in mind. PLAYER WELFARE  INJURY PREVENTION Workload volume and activity should be strictly controlled throughout these stages. This will be critical in terms of injury prevention as well as minimizing the risk of COVID- infection. IRFU Medical DirectorRod McLoughlinsaid: We must remember at all times that COVID- has not been eliminated from this island. It is critical that clubs continue to minimise risk and adhere to all public health measures in place. Rugby will onlyin a meaningful waywe adopt the right behaviours that will keep ourselves, our teammates and our club mates safe. He also urged clubs to take extra care with injury prevention measures for players. It has been over  days since any club player has been involved in competitive rugby and we have seen from other team sports that have ed earlier than rugby that there is an increased risk of injury. That means clubs will have to be extra cautious around the training loads they are putting in place. Player welfare still applies around injury prevention just as much as it does in terms of Covid-.

Those behind the ambitious project are confident that the ious stories will appeal to both locals and visitors alike.Other interpretative  will tell of the emigration of families from Saintfield to the United States over the last  years, using the example of the three Maffett brothers who left Leggygowan for America, the first in , followed by a further two brothers in .It is one of their descendants, David Moffett, who has made this precious community asset possible.Saintfield Development Association officials, who played a lead role in securing the new community centre, approached the owners of the Windmill Road field and began protracted negotiations to secure the site, with the all-important funding to acquire the land obtained through Mr Moffettrsquos generous donation.A successful business executive with a well-known company in America, his family had links with the area dating back to the early th century, with Mr Moffettrsquos ancestral, family including James and Isabella Maffett and their children, buried in the graveyard at Saintfield Parish Church.Explaining the background to the heritage park proposal, a spokesman for the Development Association explained that a successful funding bid was submitted to the Heritage Lottery Fund for money to carry out necessary feasibility studies on the field.ldquoThese studies have since been completed to the satisfaction of the funder and have shown that there are no impediments for the field to be developed as a community heritage park, he explained.ldquoThese studies will also provide evidence for the necessary planning application for the change of use of the field from agricultural to community use.The spokesman also confirmed that consultants who carried out the feasibility studies of the field also compiled a list of proposals for the development which include measures to obviate as much as possible any disruption or annoyance to neighbouring residents through noise or anti-social behaviour.Public consultation on the proposals will be undertaken once the current pandemic restrictions are sufficiently eased and, following this process, the Development Association intends to raise the funds needed to implement the agreed proposals by applying for suitable grants.There will also be community fundraising.In addition, Newry, Mourne and Down Council has been asked to approve a new link being created between the community centre and proposed heritage park. The issue was under discussion prior to the coronavirus pandemic.Rowallane councillor Robert Burgess has praised all those involved in the project and hopes that the remaining pieces in the development jigsaw fall into place.ldquoThis is a terric development that not only local people can enjoy, but one which visitors to the town can also enjoy and learn so much about Saintfield and its people, he said.ldquoWe are fortunate to have the new community centre up and running and developing a new heritage park would represent further success for the town. Great credit must go Saintfield Heritage Society and townrsquos hardworking Development Association.Cllr Burgess added Saintfield was ldquovery fortunate to have extremely committed community iniduals who have the town and its people very much at heart.Full details of the proposes heritage park proposal are available at discoversaintfield..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Butler look after royalty and presidents  ","story":"FRANCIS McBriar has been a butler to four generations of the Royal Family, served US and Irish presidents and Northern Ireland Secretaries of State.However, he has only one mantra in his mind every time he dons his smart unorm mdash and that is he treats everyone the same.The farmerrsquos son who lives just outside Saintfield with his we Heather has butlered for  years. For those in the know, hersquos the man to reach out foryou have a special occasion or dinner event coming up.Regularly employed by the Earl of Erne at his Fermanagh residence, Crom Castle, Francis was recently featured doing what he does best in the RTE food series, Lords and Ladles.The  year-old was introduced to Hillsborough Castle, the Royal Familyrsquos official residence when they are in Northern Ireland, by the castlersquos late and highly regarded former house manager, David Anderson.ldquoI wouldnrsquot be where I am today without David Anderson, itrsquos as simple as that, said Francis.ldquoWe met through First Saintfield Church which David joined when he moved into the area. We were part of a group looking after senior people of the congregation and we would have worked together hosting dinners and bus outings and so on.ldquoOne day David turned to me and said, lsquoFrancis you are a very adaptable person, you could be a great help to meyou would like to bersquo.ldquoI was invited up to Hillsborough Castle to work with him and things just took off from there. I enjoy working with people and always went out with the intention of helping others and to make sure that they enjoyed their day, or their dinner. I also always found it easy to chat away to people.At that time, Francis was working as a distribution manager for a group of fashion shops and was the father of three young children with no thoughts of a future career in butlering.Today, he works mostly at Crom Castle and, closer to home, at Montalto House in Ballynahinch, but also looks after an American family when they travel to the British Isles.They take Francis wherever they go, sometimes to the Scottish Highlands and hopefully inSeptember to their Dorset property.ldquoIrsquom hoping that it still happens, admits Francis, whose work, like many others, has been affected by the Covid- pandemic.ldquoI really enjoy it and I love to travel. It doesnrsquot bother me being away from home for maybe several weeks at a time. My family are grown up with families of their own and I think my we is quite content to see me going out and about as she gets her head showered.He and Heather have three children, Robert, Anita and James, and a grandchild, George, who will be one year old soon. A second grandchild is due any day now.Having, in his words, ldquolooked after the late Queen Mother, the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh, their children and Prince Charlesrsquo children, the likes of President Bush, Irish presidents Mary McAleese and Michael D Higgins, Francis admits his disappointment at missing out on meeting Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge.He said: ldquoItrsquos been lovely to look after the Royal Family and a few years ago I was invited up to look after Prince William. I was so looking forward to looking after the couple but unfortunately that was the day the Duchess announced she was pregnant with Prince Louis and couldnrsquot fly over. So I missed that opportunity and would have loved to have met Kate.He believes that having served royalty, he can serve anyone and his nerve has never let him down so far.ldquoI think perhaps once you have attended to the people at Hillsborough Castle, it takes any nerves away, said Francis. ldquoYou think wellI can serve the Queen, then I can serve anyone. No-one is better than anyone  in my eyes. I just go in and do my best for whoever Irsquom looking after.For most people, the role of butler is quite rare today but in the days of stately and larger homes a bulter was the head male servant in a large household and his job was to manage the work of all the other servants.Francis agrees that his role is similar to that of the most famous butler in recent times, Carson, from the hit TV series and movie, Downton Abbey.ldquoThe whole point of being a butler is be unobtrusive but close at hand in the backgroundyou are needed. You need to judge when not to overstay your welcome when you are at the table.ldquoWhat happens there, stays there. I suppose I have developed a reputation for being discreet and I try to be. I would never tell others the conversations I hear around the table. As far as Irsquom concerned, everything is private.ldquoI treat everyone the same, no matter what their position in le, These people are paying my wages. I believe that nobody is better than anyone . If they are there at the table, then Irsquom there to look after them.Unlike Carson, who had to extract Lady Mary out of a number of compromising situations, Francis has never come across anyone who was the worst for wear for drink or found in an embarrassing situation.ldquoI must admit that in the circles I would be in, Irsquove never come across anyone over-indulging. My job is really to be able to turn my hand to anything and to look after people. The butler is really in charge of the household. When I go to work at Crom Castle, the Earl tells me lsquoFrancis, yoursquore in charge, itrsquos over to yoursquo.Working with some of the best chefs around, Francis admits that hersquos been treated to some delicious dining experiences through his work.ldquoI honestly donrsquot see what I do as work. Itrsquos not workyou love what you do, he said..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Developers asked to show interest in Irish Street site  ","story":"DEVELOPERS will shortly be asked to submit expressions of interest in transforming a major site in the heart of Downpatrick to help bolster the townrsquos economic recovery.The Department for Communities and Newry, Mourne and Down Council are driving ambitious plans to redevelop a near two acre site encompassing the former Irish Street police station, a number of adjacent empty buildings and the local authority-owned car park.While it was feared that the coronavirus pandemic could delay plans to redevelop of the huge site, work has continued on the project with a new brochure produced to provide would-be developers and other interested parties with an overview of the sitersquos potential and secure expressions of interest.The development site stretches as far back as St Patrickrsquos Avenue and is also adjacent to the Irish Street car park, with council officials looking to make the brochure available to the public virtually.Described as a ldquostrategic and prominent location in the heart of Downpatrick, senior council officials, politicians and members of the business community are excited at the Irish Street sitersquos development potential and are working towards drawing up a development brief.While the former police base enjoys protected status, it is hoped that potential developers will be able to come up with an imaginative plan for the historic building and that a preferred bidder will be appointed as early as October and as late as the end of the year.The council and the Department for Communities are keen to revitalise Irish Street and hope its redevelopment will act as a catalyst for the wider economic and social regeneration of the town.Council officials say that the Irish Street project is vital to the recovery of the local economy, improving the wellbeing of the community and a welcome confidence boost for the construction sector.In addition, they insist that theyrsquore committed to working with the Downpatrick business community, residents and other stakeholders on the redevelopment of the site and want to hear their feedback on the way forward.The steering group set up to oversee the Downpatrick scheme held a recent progress meeting and council chairwoman Laura Devlin said she was delighted with the projectrsquos momentum.She confirmed that councillors and local authority officials have been working with the Department for Communities and local stakeholders to develop an lsquoonline engagement processrsquo.She explained this is designed to inform the preferred end uses for the Irish Street site and allow key stakeholders to have input into the development brief which is critical to the success of the project.ldquoWhile the Downpatrick regeneration scheme is in the early developmental stages, it will also stimulate signicant investment for the local economy, she added.John Armstrong, from the Construction Employers Federation, said the scheme and a number of others the council is planning for the Newry area, will provide a boost for the local construction sector.South Down MP Chris Hazzard and Downpatrick councillors Dermot Curran and Oonagh Hanlon have welcomed the progress being made on redeveloping he site.Mr Hazzard described the regeneration project as a ldquounique and exciting opportunity, one which has the potential to unlock much-needed economic and social opportunity for the town centre and wider community.ldquoThis regeneration project must act as a catalyst for the long overdue expansion of the townrsquos evening and weekend economy its new heartbeat in some respects, he continued.ldquoGiven the sitersquos close proximity to nearby homes, the project must also be viewed as more than a commercial development. It must seek to bind together the town centre with the outlying housing developments and consequently look to improve the economic and social wellbeing of the local community.Cllr Curran agreed that the Irish Street site offered a ldquounique opportunity for the development of business, employment and tourism.He thanked council committees and Department for Infrastructure for supporting the project.He said: ldquoThe Irish Street project represents the single biggest change to the town centre in a generation. It has the potential to transform Downpatrick and itrsquos vital everyone works together to make the regeneration proposal a major success.ldquoThe planned redevelopment is one of the most important projects ever proposed for Downpatrick and it is vital to make the most of the opportunities it presents. The proposal has the potential to add a new vibrancy with local people helping shape how this key site will be transformed.Cllr Hanlon said she was pleased that the next stage of the sitersquos redevelopment is ready for launch, allowing potential developers and interested parties an opportunity to view the site online, with feedback from the local community welcomed.ldquoPeople will be able to give their views on the potential for the site and the likely constraints within any proposed project, she explained. ldquoAny feedback would be used to assist both the council and Department for Communities to prepare a development brief for the site.Cllr Hanlon added: ldquoThe project to redevelop the former police base and surrounding area provides an opportunity to reinvigorate the Downpatrick town centre. This is the opportunity of a generation to restore a vibrant town centre and will build on the ongoing regeneration of the Irish Street area..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"DNA testing plans to catch owners over dog fouling  ","story":"DOG owners who fail to clean up after their pets could soon find themselves in court after local politicians agreed to investigate the potential of using DNA testing to catch offenders.Newry, Mourne and Down Council officers have been instructed to examine the merits of testing dog dirt in a bid to trace animals whose owners allow them to use public areas as open air toilets.Under the scheme, a sample of dog dirt would be taken for analysis to trace the identity of the animal, with the owner being subsequently prosecuted.Agreement for officers to research the DNA issue was given at last weekrsquos meeting of the local authorityrsquos Neighbourhood Services Committee following a proposal tabled by Rowallane councillor Patrick Brown.Dog dirt poses a major health risk, especially to children, who could potentially lose their sight as a result of coming into contact with it.Cllr Brown said there was a need to consider innovative ways of tackling the issue which has been raised on a regular basis by elected representatives across the local authorityrsquos seven DEAs.He is keen for the local authority to investigate the viability of using DNA testing in a bid to identy offenders and aid enforcement officers to dish out fines, suggesting that council officers draw upon best practice from other organisations who have introduced such a scheme in a bid to crack down on the dog fouling issue.Council officials say they will need to understand the time and resources required to implement such a scheme before compiling a report on its potential implementation.Cllr Billy Walker has welcomed the decision to investigate the DNA issue and says he cannot understand why dog owners to do not clean up after their pets.He said that the problem was district-wide and hoped that offenders will end up being prosecuted.ldquoI am an advocate of naming and shaming people on this particular issue but it is not a road which the council has been keen to go down. However,we use DNA technology to catch dog owners who allow their pets to foul public areas, their identity will be made publicthey end up in court, he continued.ldquoDog fouling problem is a highly contentious issue and, without doubt, one of the single most complained about problems across our district. It is something that we have not yet to got to grips with, but perhaps the new initiative under consideration will change that.Cllr Walker said it was important to remember that the overwhelming majority of dog owners across the district cleaned up after their pets, but there was a hardcore who did not.He added: ldquoWe have talked about this issue for years and the problem has not diminished in any way.

Phil, who used to wear XL shirts and had a waistline of  inches, was recently ill with what was thought to be Covid-. He believes that while it was unpleasant and he was knocked off his feet, he’s not sure he would have survivedhe hadn’t lost weight. He said: “I dread to think how my body would have responded. It was a timely reminder of how important my health is.”Phil Kayes before shedding  stones \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...At his heaviest Phil suffered a string of other health issues including pressure on his knees and sleep apnoea. His main worry was that would he die in his sleep and his body couldn’t be removed from the third floor of his parents’ house.Phil, who has slimmed from st .lbs to st lbs in three years, said: “I was always bigger than my peers – I remember at school being called out by my PE teacher for being too big to play football. “The weight really started to pile on though when I started university. My size meant my le became increasingly insular and I made up a iety of excuses not to go out.“I’d avoid gatherings like parties and weddings because I just felt so uncomfortable. I knew I wouldn’t fit into a plane seat so I never travelled, even though I really wanted to. Apart from my job as a civil servant, I didn’t really do anything except hide away and eat. It was a very lonely time.”Phil Kayes with his partner Nicole MullhollandPhil realised he had to do something about his weight when his mother was diagnosed with terminal cancer: “Mum was facing her fourth cancer battle which sadly turned out to be her last. The news sort of spurred me into action and I knew this time I had to try and be as healthy as I could – not just for her but for me as well. “I was also worried thatmy mum did pass away, I wouldn’t be able to be one of her pallbearers, which was heart-breaking. She died in October , by which point I’d lost five stones. I know she’d be really proudshe could see me now.”Since halving his bodyweight, Phil has become more active and has started cycling again after a near -year absence from the activity. He said the best thing to happen to him since shedding  stone is meeting his partner, Nicole Mullholland, on an online dating app. Since the temporary suspension of its , community groups, Slimming World has launched a virtual weight-loss service to continue to support members.A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

rescues people caught out by Bristol Channel tideOn Friday, Mr Drakeford was questioned about his governments position on non-medical coverings after a trade union representing doctors in Wales said bringing in rules would help control the spread of Covid- and save lives.Mr Drakeford told the Governments daily press briefing in Cardf: \"The context for face coverings has changed because of an announcement made yesterday in England about mandatory use of face masks on public transport.\"That will not come in until June , and that gives us a short number of days in order to consider the position here in Wales recognising that changed context.\"Mr Drakeford said a \"definitive statement\" on the issue would be made in the first part of next week, and that detailed questions about Englands new rules would be explored with ministers and officials in Westminster.But he said the UK Government had not discussed or given advanced notice of the decision with Wales, and questioned whether England was concerned with \"making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards\".\"I wish that wed had a chance to explore this with the UK Government before they made the announcements,\" he said.\"That would have allowed us to have some answers to the questions that I raised today before the event rather than after the event.\"But while on the bulk of issues we continue to be able to have discussion and co-operation in advance of decision making, in a small number of cases we hear about it only after the decision has been made.\"He added: \"Were going to have to use the time we now have to find out from them the extent to which they have got answers to these questions in advance of making the decision, or whether its a matter of making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards.\"Mr Drakeford said the advice from the chief medical officer for Wales remained that wearing face masks gave people \"some marginal extra protection\" but was not sufficient to make it mandatory.\"The chief medical officer has expressed his anxieties that people might do more risky things because they think a face mask offers them protection, which it doesnt,\" Mr Drakeford said.\"But context changes because in England it is mandatory to use face masks while on public transport.\"Trains and roads between north and south Wales weave in and out of the border all the time and in a sheer practical sense, we have to think through whether having separate regimes is a possibility when you can leave on a train that starts in Wales, goes into England, comes back into Wales, goes back into England, comes back into Wales.\"Earlier on Friday the British Medical AssociationWales called on the Welsh Government to change its stance on non-medical face coverings, and ensure a supply are available to the public.The trade unions council chair for Wales, Dr David Bailey, said: \"BMA Cymru Wales advocates the wearing of face coverings by the public in areas where they cannot socially distance.\"There still remains a considerable risk of infection, and emerging evidence has shown thatmouths and noses are covered when people are in areas where they cannot socially distance, it may help in controlling the spread of infection of Covid- and therefore save lives.\"BMA Cymru Wales is calling on the Welsh Government to change their position immediately, to lessen the risk of the public spreading the virus.\"Wales main train operator, Transport for Wales, said it would \"work collaboratively\" with partners to ensure passengers were kept safe travelling across borders.A spokesman said: \"The cross-border nature of our network means that we will continue to work collaboratively with industry partners to ensure customers understand how they can travel safely as they travel between Wales and England.\"The safety of our colleagues and customers is our top priority and wed like to reinforce the message to stay local and only use public

rescues people caught out by Bristol Channel tideOn Friday, Mr Drakeford was questioned about his governments position on non-medical coverings after a trade union representing doctors in Wales said bringing in rules would help control the spread of Covid- and save lives.Mr Drakeford told the Governments daily press briefing in Cardf: \"The context for face coverings has changed because of an announcement made yesterday in England about mandatory use of face masks on public transport.\"That will not come in until June , and that gives us a short number of days in order to consider the position here in Wales recognising that changed context.\"Mr Drakeford said a \"definitive statement\" on the issue would be made in the first part of next week, and that detailed questions about Englands new rules would be explored with ministers and officials in Westminster.But he said the UK Government had not discussed or given advanced notice of the decision with Wales, and questioned whether England was concerned with \"making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards\".\"I wish that wed had a chance to explore this with the UK Government before they made the announcements,\" he said.\"That would have allowed us to have some answers to the questions that I raised today before the event rather than after the event.\"But while on the bulk of issues we continue to be able to have discussion and co-operation in advance of decision making, in a small number of cases we hear about it only after the decision has been made.\"He added: \"Were going to have to use the time we now have to find out from them the extent to which they have got answers to these questions in advance of making the decision, or whether its a matter of making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards.\"Mr Drakeford said the advice from the chief medical officer for Wales remained that wearing face masks gave people \"some marginal extra protection\" but was not sufficient to make it mandatory.\"The chief medical officer has expressed his anxieties that people might do more risky things because they think a face mask offers them protection, which it doesnt,\" Mr Drakeford said.\"But context changes because in England it is mandatory to use face masks while on public transport.\"Trains and roads between north and south Wales weave in and out of the border all the time and in a sheer practical sense, we have to think through whether having separate regimes is a possibility when you can leave on a train that starts in Wales, goes into England, comes back into Wales, goes back into England, comes back into Wales.\"Earlier on Friday the British Medical AssociationWales called on the Welsh Government to change its stance on non-medical face coverings, and ensure a supply are available to the public.The trade unions council chair for Wales, Dr David Bailey, said: \"BMA Cymru Wales advocates the wearing of face coverings by the public in areas where they cannot socially distance.\"There still remains a considerable risk of infection, and emerging evidence has shown thatmouths and noses are covered when people are in areas where they cannot socially distance, it may help in controlling the spread of infection of Covid- and therefore save lives.\"BMA Cymru Wales is calling on the Welsh Government to change their position immediately, to lessen the risk of the public spreading the virus.\"Wales main train operator, Transport for Wales, said it would \"work collaboratively\" with partners to ensure passengers were kept safe travelling across borders.A spokesman said: \"The cross-border nature of our network means that we will continue to work collaboratively with industry partners to ensure customers understand how they can travel safely as they travel between Wales and England.\"The safety of our colleagues and customers is our top priority and wed like to reinforce the message to stay local and only use public

to coronavirus crisisPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownThe campaign by the Save Dinas Powys Woods and Protect Homes from Flooding group was launched in March  after the Woodland Trust said NRW was proposing to build a dam within its site of Cwm George and Casehill Woods.The group said the proposals would involve cutting down  square metres of trees including  square metres of ancient trees and regular flooding upstream during high rainfall would result in further destruction of ancient trees, hedgerows, wildle, and plants.Dormice and other protected species like bats were at risk, the group said.The woods, much-loved by the community, attracts visitors from other areas and is the Woodland Trustrsquos most visited site in Wales with more than ,

favour of a natural flood management programmein the Cadoxton River and Eastbrook catchments, plus improved channel maintenance andrequired local hard defences, rather than an environmentally

support.Community councillor, Chris Franks said NRW must not now ignore any problems.ldquoClearly over the years there has been reduced spending on maintenance of the stream through Dinas Powys and

has spoken of the plight of rural communities during lockdown in Uganda.Three months ago, Jenipher Wetaka Sambazi, a Fairtrade coffee farmer from the Mt Elgon region in Uganda, was sharing her experiences of the benefit of Fairtrade in Penarthrsquos Tabernacle Baptist Church.More NewsVictory in campaign to save Dinas Powys ancient woodland as dam plan is abandonedVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownNow she and her family, like communities around the world, are under lockdown.In March, campaigners, businesses, supporters, and students from around Wales heard Jenipherrsquos story, face to face.Now she is unable to travel or even meet with her neighbours.This means the coffee picked at the end of the last harvest remains on the mountain and Jenipher and her fellow farmers are prohibited from travelling to gather it for processing under the current lockdown rules.There are currently several hundred known cases of covid- in Uganda, but none in the Mount Elgon region and no fatalities in Uganda as yet.Farmers want to keep it this way, but lockdown is causing other concerns such as limiting access to food and healthcare.This is the time of year when there is the least amount of food available, and the closing of markets and freedom to travel for farmers to source food and water means that times are exceptionally hard.Jenipher as vice-chairwoman of a Fairtrade coffee cooperative, is responsible for many who rely on the cooperative for work.The expert hand-sorters who are seasonal workers and rely on this part of the coffee chain to feed their family at this time, have no coffee to sort.While they may have some spare eggs, vegetables or matoke to trade, the threat of soldiers prohibiting them from doing so is too much for them.Farmer co-operatives, an essential element of Fairtrade, enable and encourage communities to work together.Fairtrade also requires an extra amount of money, the Fairtrade premium, to be paid to producers.Fairtrade farmers like Jenipher are struggling, but they have the benefits of a strong local community as well as the backup of the Fairtrade premium.Fairtrade International have announced a .m euro Fairtrade Producer Relief fund targeting the immediate needs and Resilience Fund to help producers rebuild their businesses after Covid-.Jenipher Wettaka Sambazi said: ldquoLe is hard.ldquoThe markets are shut so there is nowhere to sell or earn money, or to buy food and basic essentials.ldquoLocal health centres have been shut to reduce the chance of spreading the virus, but since all transport is banned, those who need operations, treatment or antenatal care need to walk  km to the nearest hospital.ldquoTwo women and their unborn babies have died on the way.\"Roger Casey, who attends Tabernacle Baptist Church said: ldquoIt was wonderful to meet Jenipher and hear her story.ldquoWe get through a lot of coffee in our office and meeting a real coffee farmer from Uganda makes you think about the real people and real lives behind that Fairtrade logo.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquoMeeting Jenipher during her visit to Wales earlier this year was inspiring.ldquoThe increasing dficulties facing rural farming communities because of the pandemic has shown how important Fairtrade cooperatives continue to be and I am glad that leaders like Jenipher continue to promote the benefits of Fairtrade and to support communities.National co-ordinator of Fair Trade Wales, Aileen Burmeister added: ldquoFair Trade producers are being impacted by covid- restrictions.ldquoGlobal stock markets are falling, meaning that farmers and workers are receiving far less for their produce.\"It is in these times that we can really see how important the Fairtrade minimum price is. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey

These include:Communication of health information, and how effective it isCultural issues relating to the suitability of health and social services for BAME communitiesIncome and employment insecurity, which is experienced disproportionately by BAME communitiesPoor quality of ethnicity data, which is preventing accurate analysisHousing overcrowding and environmentThe financial burden created by migration statusThe role of structural and systemic racism and disadvantage.The report is by the BAME Covid- expert advisory group, set up by First Minister Mark Drakeford to look at the reasons why people from BAME communities were more likely to be adversely affected by coronavirus.:One of its two sub-groups was tasked with examining the socio-economic factors, chaired by Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna, professor of management and organization at Cardf Business School, Cardf University.\"Therersquos an overall theme running through our research for this report. It centres on long-standing racism and disadvantage, and the lack of BAME representation within decision-making processes,\" said Professor Ogbonna, who is also a trustee and vice-chair of Race Council Wales.ldquoThe coronavirus pandemic is, in some respects, revealing the consequences of a lack of action on race equality.ldquoMany of the issues wersquove highlighted have been identied and discussed previously, but they havenrsquot been addressed in any systematic and sustained way.Analysis of Covid- related deaths across England and Wales by ethnicity showed that people from a black ethnic background are at a greater risk of death involving COVID- than all other ethnic groups.The Office for National Statistics study showe that the risk for black males has been more than three times higher than white males, and nearly two-and-a-half times higher for black females than white.Adjusting for socio-economic factors and geographical location partly explains the increased risk, but there remains twice the risk for black males and around one-and-a-half times for black females.
