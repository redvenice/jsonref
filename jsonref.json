Mr Johnson speaks at a joint press conference with President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker (not pictured) at the European Commission headquarters in Brussels Despite apparently not knowing the details, he added: ‘These proposals risk triggering a race to the bottom on rights and protections – putting food safety at risk, cutting environmental standards and workers’ rights, and opening up our NHS to a takeover by US private corporations.‘This sell-out deal won’t bring the country together and should be rejected. The best way to get Brexit sorted is to give the people the final say in a public vote.’‘From what we’ve read of this deal, it doesn’t meet our demands or expectations, it creates a border down the Irish Sea and it leads once again to a race to the bottom in rights and protections for British citizens and a danger of the sell-off of our national assets to American companies.’Asked whether he had given up on his plan to negotiate a Labour Brexit deal, Mr Corbyn replied: ‘Not at all. A Labour government elected in a general election would within three months negotiate an agreement with the EU... and then within six months we would put that to a referendum.’Tory MP Michael Fabricant said: ‘Corbyn is seriously misreading the view of the British public who want Brexit done.‘He knows he is the most unpopular Opposition leader since records began in the Seventies. Maybe he thinks it can’t get any worse. It can. His immediate condemnation of the deal reveals him in an even clearer light.’ Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer also dismissed the deal, saying it ‘paves the way for a decade of deregulation’. He argued it would give the Government a ‘licence to slash’ worker, environment and consumer protections.Sir Keir added: ‘If Boris Johnson has confidence in his deal, he should put it back to the people in a public vote against Remain.’Tony Lloyd, the party’s Northern Ireland spokesman, said Labour MPs were ‘almost bound’ to vote for holding a referendum if Mr Johnson found a majority to support his deal.He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that even though Labour would ‘prefer a general election’, it was ‘consistent’ with party policy that MPs would back holding a confirmatory vote on the freshly inked Brexit deal.  Jeremy Corbyn has behaved like a spiv trying to welch on a bet, says Theresa May’s ex-communications boss SIR ROBBIE GIBBBy Sir Robbie Gibb for the Daily Mail Of all the descriptions often attributed to Jeremy Corbyn, being a mind-reader is not one. And yet before the Prime Minister’s new Brexit deal was published yesterday, the Labour leader definitively declared that he couldn’t support it.There are two possible explanations for this.Either Corbyn is a sage who managed to deduce the contents of the unpublished 64-page document.Or, he jumped in without waiting to read the first page.Having seen first-hand the shameless speed with which Corbyn can denounce a deal, forgive me if I lean towards the second possibility.Over the past three years, there has been little about Corbyn’s handling of Brexit to suggest he has any inclination to prioritise the Brexit referendum result over the demands of Labour’s own internal party politics. So much for the man who’s party went into the last general election with a manifesto which clearly stated: ‘Labour accepts the referendum result and a Labour government will put the national interest first.’         Labour Party Leader Jeremy Corbyn talks to the media as he arrives to attend a pre-council meeting of the Party of European Socialists at Albert Hall in Brussels on ThursdayFaced with a growing Remainer insurgency along his front bench, Corbyn has also ditched his own Eurosceptic beliefs.Whether, therefore, Corbyn has tried to scupper every attempt to deliver Brexit out of political cowardice or shameless cynicism scarcely matters.And while Boris Johnson has staked everything – not least his own reputation and premiership – on making good on that promise, the Labour leader has behaved like a slopey-shouldered spiv trying to welch on a bet. As his actions demonstrated yesterday, Corbyn isn’t one to spend time reading important documents.But should he ever start, he could do no worse than begin at page 24 of Labour’s own 2017 manifesto.Time and again, Corbyn has shown how those key five words – ‘Labour accepts the referendum result’ – aren’t worth the paper they were printed on.Under his leadership, Labour MPs opted to trigger Article 50 and set the two-year clock running on Brexit negotiations, but subsequently voted on 34 separate occasions in the Commons to block Brexit legislation.Even when we were trying to broker a deal with Labour to break the Parliamentary deadlock, I remember how their delegation failed to take the matter at hand seriously. I will never forget one particularly farcical moment in April when, during crunch talks with Labour to get Theresa’s May’s deal through, the party’s Brexit spokesman, Sir Keir Starmer, condemned a document we had just given him – even though it had been copied and pasted from his own proposals!At another point, Corbyn’s deputy, John McDonnell, suddenly raised the issue of a Second Referendum.I was surprised. At the time, McDonnell had no great love for the Remainer rump of his party.‘I said I’d raise it,’ he explained matter-of-factly, ‘and I’ve raised it.’ It was a bizarre outburst – though one that now explains why Corbyn’s self-serving game-playing over Brexit is coming home to roost.         At another point, Corbyn’s deputy, John McDonnell (pictured alongside Sajid Javid), suddenly raised the issue of a Second ReferendumHeld captive by Labour’s hardcore Remainer membership, he has been backed into a cul-de-sac of support for a second referendum.Meanwhile, Boris Johnson has never deviated from the course he set – to take Britain out of Europe on October 31, ‘do or die’.He has gambled everything on this promise and it seems to have paid off.Indeed, it means that, tomorrow, there is a clear choice for MPs: back this deal or leave without a deal in less than two weeks’ time.There are, of course, a handful of honourable former Labour MPs, such as John Mann and Iain Austin, who will do their duty and honour the referendum result.There are also decent, moderate Labour MPs, such as Caroline Flint, who voted Remain but have since stated resolutely that Brexit must be delivered.Tomorrow, other Labour MPs would do well to follow their lead.Now is the time for our politicians to break free from this appalling Parliamentary paralysis, to live up to their promises to voters and get Brexit done.If Jeremy Corbyn continues to put the brakes on Brexit, it could plunge Britain into an almighty crash.Sir Robbie Gibb was Theresa May’s director of communications  A boost for workers’ rights that could win Labour round: Boris Johnson pledges set ‘highest possible standards’ into LAW – despite Jeremy Corbyn saying deal is a ‘race to the bottom’By Daniel Martin for the Daily MailModerate Labour MPs could be persuaded to back the Prime Minister’s Brexit deal after he offered a series of sweeteners on workers’ rights.Speaking in Brussels last night, Boris Johnson said he would ‘gladly’ make a commitment to maintain the ‘highest possible standards’ on environmental and social protections.And the Daily Mail understands that Downing Street is now offering to write them into the Withdrawal Agreement Bill to make them legally binding.Behind-the-scenes talks have already taken place with rebel Labour MPs, led by Stephen Kinnock, who has previously said he would support a deal which honoured the referendum result.              Behind-the-scenes talks have already taken place with rebel Labour MPs, led by Stephen Kinnock (left), who has previously said he would support a deal which honoured the referendum result. Ruth Smeeth (right) yesterday said it was her ‘intention to vote for a deal’ unless rights were ‘undermined’ by the dealJeremy Corbyn made clear yesterday that he wanted Labour MPs to vote against the revised withdrawal agreement, saying it would lead to a ‘race to the bottom’ on workers’ rights.The party has not said whether MPs who defy him would lose the party whip. Even so, as many as ten Labour MPs are reported to be considering voting for the deal if Mr Johnson’s pledges on workers’ rights are enshrined in law.Ruth Smeeth yesterday said it was her ‘intention to vote for a deal’ unless rights were ‘undermined’ by the deal.Labour MPs John Mann, Sir Kevin Barron and Jim Fitzpatrick are also understood to support the agreement.Mr Johnson will be dependent on some Labour support now that the DUP has said it will vote against the deal on ‘Super Saturday’ tomorrow.Yesterday, the PM reached out to Labour MPs, saying: ‘It is a good text, and it gets to the heart of what we want to achieve with the EU. It does also contain important provisions and commitments that this country gladly makes about our determination to maintain the highest possible standards on environment and social protection.’The agreement, announced yesterday morning, provides for a ‘level playing field’ on workers’ rights and environmental protection and commits Britain to ‘maintain... standards at the current high levels’.However, the promise is part of the political agreement that sits alongside the withdrawal agreement – not the withdrawal agreement itself.         Mr Johnson (pictured alongside president of the European Comission Jean-Claude Juncker (second-from-right), Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay (left) and European Union chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier (right) during a press conference on the Brexit deal in Brussels) will be dependent on some Labour support now that the DUP has said it will vote against the deal on ‘Super Saturday’ tomorrowIt is understood that Downing Street is offering to write these protections into the Withdrawal Agreement Bill, the legislation which enacts the Brexit deal, to make them legally binding and get the Labour rebels on side.Mr Kinnock and 18 other Labour MPs wrote to European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker earlier this month, declaring that they ‘wish to see the British EU referendum result honoured without further delay’.One of the signatories told Huffington Post that around ten Labour MPs are now in the mood to vote for ‘any deal’.On Wednesday night Mr Kinnock suggested that he could support the Brexit deal.Speaking to Robert Peston on ITV, the MP was asked if he would back the deal. He said: ‘Yes, if the text meets Labour’s six tests... The level playing field is absolutely crucial.’Yesterday Mrs Smeeth said: ‘It is my intention to vote for a deal unless Boris has completely undermined workers’ rights, environmental rights and consumer rights.’Mr Mann said: ‘I will vote for this deal... We voted to leave, and I’m happier to leave with a deal that gives stability for businesses and jobs in this country, that’s what a deal does... I think the deal will get through.’Another Labour backbencher told the Huffington Post he would consider voting for Mr Johnson’s deal if it enshrined workers’ rights. ‘If Boris can write all these things on to the face of a Bill, and bring that Bill forward pronto, we can vote for it,’ he said.Labour MP Graham Stringer, who campaigned for Brexit, said he would back the Bill if it is ‘genuinely deal or No Deal’.Despite the Prime Minister’s pledges Mr Corbyn said he would not support the deal. ‘These proposals risk triggering a race to the bottom on rights and protections: putting food safety at risk, cutting environmental standards and workers’ rights, and opening up our NHS to a takeover,’ he said."},{"url":null,"title":"Europes wanted women","story":"Share this article          Elena Puzyrevich, 39, forced Russian girls into prostitution at a club in Cáceres between 2007 and 2008.

The move came five days after Trump raised the specter of sanctions in a letter to Erdogan, in which he also said that if the Turkish leader invaded Syria he would be remembered as a \u0027devil.\u0027Trump told Erdogan he wouldn\u0027t want to be responsible for \u0027slaughtering thousands of people,\u0027 and warned, \u0027don\u0027t be a tough guy. Don\u0027t be a fool!\u0027Erdogan defied the sanctions, saying the only way its military offensive would end was if Syrian Kurdish fighters leave a designated border area.Erdogan also said he had \u0027no problem\u0027 accepting an invitation from Russian President Vladimir Putin to visit Russia soon to discuss Syria. But he threw into doubt a planned Nov. 13 meeting with Trump, citing anger over the sanctions that Washington imposed Monday on the NATO ally.Despite an outcry among both Democratic and Republican lawmakers over the pullout and the Turkish invasion, Trump insisted a fight between Turkey and the Kurds was not a U.S. problem and that things are \u0027very nicely under control\u0027 in northern Syria.

Assad\u0027s forces are returning to regions of northern Syria they abandoned at the height of the 8-year-old civil war. Moscow has taken a more prominent role as an interlocutor among Assad, the former U.S.-allied Kurds and Turkey.Erdogan\u0027s office confirmed the Turkish leader would meet Thursday with Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and said he would travel to Sochi, Russia, for talks on Tuesday.Erdogan said he was not concerned by the U.S. sanctions. He told reporters that chances for his November trip to Washington are \u0027something to be assessed\u0027 after the talks with the American delegation, he said, adding that the sanctions and criticisms in the U.S. constituted \u0027great disrespect toward the Turkish Republic.\u0027 Turkish forces and Kurdish fighters also battled over the border town of Ras al-Ayn.

She thought it was disgusting.\u0027         In his defence evidence Dr Gelder (pictured outside the Medical Practitioners Tribunal in Manchester) told the hearing he had apologised to both women in writing and had also a attended a course on maintaining professional boundariesNurse A then said she did not want to speak to Dr Gelder, nor work or see him again, Mr Taylor continued.  \u0027When she got to the fridge to pick up some medication for a patient, Dr Gelder was at the fridge and he said: Oh, just got her. \u0027He was laughing and she was in shock and found it inappropriate and not funny, so she walked away.\u0027Before she walked away she told him the only person allowed to do that to her was her husband and he replied Well, he\u0027s a very lucky man. \u0027The hearing was told the second incident occurred later that same day after another female colleague known as Miss B wanted to speak to Dr Gelder about patients who had been treated the previous day.Mr Taylor added: \u0027She told him the patients were not assessed properly downstairs and he had not written in the notes. \u0027They discussed this and Dr Gelder responded saying: You\u0027re sexy when you are cross. \u0027Miss B was surprised and taken aback as he had not spoken to her in that way before. He then walked away.\u0027He accepts he squeezed the nurse\u0027s bottom whilst undertaking the ward round and accepts saying the inappropriate comment you\u0027re sexy when you are cross.\u0027However, he does not accept his actions were sexually motivated saying he never had any such conscious thought and that it was an immature intention to behave in a jokey way.\u0027He thought it could possibly be a reaction to a substance called Valerian, which can be found in Pet Remedy and thought it could possibly be a reaction with the antihistamine he was taking.\u0027The tribunal was told an oral dose of 70ml of Valerian also called Fexofenadine had been shown in reports to alter excitability.Medical expert Dr Johann Grundlingh said: \u0027We know already that the potential effects of Fexofenadine could include delirium and stimulation and it is well known that drugs causing delirium and stimulation may lead to sexually disinhibition and inappropriate behaviour.\u0027Thus, a mild delirium and stimulation caused by Fexofenadine may have led to a degree of disinhibition and inappropriate behaviour, but this conclusion is more tenuous than my previous conclusion stating that Fexofenadine may have explained his symptoms of \u0027mind racing, dizziness, fainting, abnormal dreams, restlessness and nausea.\u0027In his defence evidence Dr Gelder, who has also been a Clinical Lead for a project which helps COPD sufferers, told the hearing he had apologised to both women in writing and had also a attended a course on maintaining professional boundaries.He said: \u0027I had arrived at work at 8am and was experiencing feelings of euphoria. At the time I thought I could do anything and I thought I was Superman.

I just woke up feeling euphoric. \u0027I told the Trust I would happily expose myself to Pet Remedy again to confirm the effects. \u0027I was absolutely stunned at what happened. I have never behaved in that way before or since. Touching her bottom was inappropriate, it was a stupid idea and a practical joke.But in a statement, the nurse said: \u0027What Dr Gelder did to me made me feel dirty and cheap, he shouldn\u0027t have done it as when I explained to him that he shouldn\u0027t have done that to me, he responded by saying my husband is a lucky man.\u0027It\u0027s disgusting.

Pairing early works by the late Scottish painter Alan Davie (1920-2014) and David Hockney, the gallery sets out to acknowledge Davie’s influence on the younger Hockney, who took what he needed from the older artist and moved on, while Davie was still struggling to escape, most notably from Jackson Pollock. A second, attendant exhibition at the Hepworth, of American painter Christina Quarles, allows us to look at her work in the light of Hockney.Davie’s earlier work was altogether too clamorous, clogged and beefy, and only by ditching all those layers of mark-making did he get anywhere close to the lightness and airy spaces of the best of Pollock’s all-over paintings. At times Davie’s art took a Pollock turn, a Miró turn, a Sam Francis turn.In Davie’s art, heavy symbolism gave way to love-hearts, cleavages, buttocks, penis tips, hairy balls and pudenda. Words emerged, alongside squiggles, flurries and jumbly scribblings. “Glory” says one painting, in a sudden lapse into language. Next to it hangs an early Hockney, with the word “Love” written over the smeary, faecal forms.Not yet 40, Davie held a retrospective at the former Wakefield Art Gallery in 1958, where it was seen by Hockney, then completing his national service before enrolling at the Royal College of Art the following year. The stray drips, the dirtied whites, the umbers, blacks and furry edges – all of which were familiar in British painting in the 1950s, and as much a continuation of European art informel as from American abstract expressionism – as well as the words got into Hockney’s work.“Queen”, “thrust”, and most famously, “We 2 boys together clinging”, were more than random painterly mutterings, and open provocation in the art of the early 60s. While Hockney was being openly gay, and quoting Walt Whitman, Davie had begun adding brushed-on phrases: MANGO TIME, PEACH TIME, BANANA TIME to otherwise abstract canvases. You can take these, I suppose, as sexual euphemisms.At the time of Davie’s 1958 show, the critic David Sylvester described him in terms of the “vehemence, sensuousness and generosity of great Romantic painting”. Give me banana time any day. Davie had a parallel life as a free-jazz musician, and as he began making his art more improvisational, so Hockney got more cool and sophisticated, ditching spattery grubbiness and physicality in favour of arch pictorial quotations, irony and games with different levels of abstraction and figuration. Queering painting as much as he was celebrating his own sexuality.Which also provides a starting point for the work of Quarles. Born in 1984 and based in Los Angeles, Quarles’s large-scale paintings are filled with female bodies that extrude and bloat, stretch, slither, dangle and droop. Sometimes they get entangled as they clutch, quiver, kiss, caress and morph in all sorts of unlikely directions. And this is to say nothing as yet about the ways in which she paints these lascivious, fraught beings.The painting keeps changing tack. Stencilled patterns give way to modelled and shaded limbs that then suddenly lose their three-dimensionality and become flat outlines, or turn into cartoonish drawing. Heads fade into washy silhouette under wodges of thickly painted and combed hair. Bodies go all harlequin-patterned, the scrabbling and clutching hands turn from the sensual to the mechanical.There is a lot going on. Sometimes we are taken back to Hockney’s work from the 60s, and his own experiment with degrees and styles of representation. Quarles quotes his California swimming-pool paintings with her own white ripples on blue water. One can link to gear shifts in Hockney’s Rocky Mountains and Tired Indians, or in his Man in a Museum (You’re in the Wrong Movie) to the disjunctures in Quarles’ paintings. But as much as Hockney is in Quarles’ art, so you can also find hints of the body distortions in the self-portraits of Austrian painter Maria Lassnig, and in the paintings of US-based British painter Nicola Tyson in Quarles’ work.Born to a white mother and black father, Quarles is pale-skinned, and often taken as white. The figures in her paintings refuse the normative. Her bodies exist in complex, interdependent ways with the spaces they inhabit. She has a complicated relationship to her artistic peers and forebears. As with Davie, and so with Hockney, we are all somehow under the influence, learning to escape."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b99670e551f44545ca84c73835e800b29769e72b/0_138_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=14e8959c7f9b7561c183c3a8ade5e3bc","title":"buy a classic guardian photograph westonbirt arboretum","story":"Our weekly series of exclusive  print sales continues with an autumnal shot of trees, photographed by Felix Clay, November 2013 The afternoon sun casts long and elegant shadows in a clearing at Westonbirt arboretum, Gloucestershire, captured by the  photographer Felix Clay, who died in May 2019 after a long illness.

Having launched a car into orbit and developed a self-landing rocket, the billionaire SpaceX founder seems to have set his sights on bombing the red planet. “T-shirt soon,” he added.But it wasn’t just another drug-induced whim. Musk has been contemplating the idea since 2015. By nuking the sky over the Martian poles every couple of seconds, he thinks he could create two tiny pulsing “suns” that would melt the ice and release vast amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. It would essentially create an instant greenhouse effect, raising the temperature and air pressure of the planet – climate change on demand from the man who marketed flamethrowers for torching marshmallows.A rotating vision of Musk’s Mars, looking like a smudgy brown version of the Earth, is now on display in the Design Museum, as part of a new exhibition about our lusty relationship with the fourth rock from the sun, provocatively titled Moving to Mars.“We’ve been successfully putting landers on Mars since 1976,” says chief curator Justin McGuirk, “but people are a different prospect. The human factor changes the conversation from a purely engineering question to one of design. Keeping people alive and sane in a capsule for the seven months it takes to get there is just the start.”The show takes a broad look at the subject, ranging from attempts to map the planet by 19th-century astronomers, to proposed 3D-printed habitats and even speculative Martian fashions. It is intended to be the museum’s most family-friendly exhibition to date, with activity briefs set for each section and a fun model spaceship hideout where kids can be occupied while parents study fascinating archive material. It’s an accessible introduction to the questions of space habitation, without dumbing down.Ever since Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli identified the outlines of seas and continents inscribed across the planet’s surface in 1877, we have longed to believe there was some form of life on Mars. His use of the word “canali”, meaning channels, set off a “canal craze”, fuelling dreams of an ancient civilisation that might have once carved these waterways through the red rock. His beguiling maps of the planet, on show in the exhibition, depict islands with names such as Elysium and Utopia, connected by a radial network of channels – an urban pattern echoed in Musk’s plans for a Martian colony later in the show.Quite how many themes and ideas have persisted through the ages is a recurring theme. McGuirk says the basic principles of mission plans to Mars haven’t much changed since German rocket scientist Wernher von Braun set out “Das Marsprojekt” in 1948, a 91-page manual written while under house arrest in the US, where he was secretly whisked after the war. For Von Braun, it was the ultimate escape fantasy – and, for many of the projects featured in the exhibition, it still is.For survivalist architects Mars represents a kind of utopian blank slate to test out their most extreme ideas. “It’s the most inhospitable place we’ve ever tried to colonise,” says McGuirk – freezing temperatures, no oxygen, covered in razor-sharp sticky sand and bombarded by radiation. The architectural results, produced for Nasa’s 3D-Printed Habitat Challenge competition, are predictably bunker-like, comprising low-lying shell forms made by heaping layers of Martian sand over various pod-like modules below. The winning proposal, by New York firm AI SpaceFactory, differs in that it flips the bunker 90 degrees, forming a beehive-like tower, with working, sleeping and recreational spaces organised vertically, flooded with light from a water-filled oculus in the roof. It’s fair to say that, despite the technical ingenuity, the prototypes on show wouldn’t make anyone much want to move to Mars any time soon.The real highlight is a section that is less “what if?” dreaming, and more focused on the practical design innovations that the difficulties of zero-gravity space travel have inspired. It features the beautiful drawings of the little-known Russian designer Galina Balashova, the first ever space architect, who worked on the interior design of the Soyuz capsules, and Salyut and Mir space stations for the Soviet space programme. Freed from the limitations of gravity, these habitats could create entirely new kinds of interior space – but Balashova realised that, psychologically, it’s quite useful to have a defined floor, ceiling and walls.“You need two things to orient yourself in zero-gravity space,” she said. “A sense of direction, and the feeling of being fixed in place.” Her solution was to colour-code the different surfaces: green floor, blue-grey ceiling, pale yellow walls, essentially using colour to replace gravity. It is a principle that is still maintained in the International Space Station, hidden behind the plethora of cables and control panels. Keeping the astronaut’s mental state in mind, Balashova even produced little watercolour paintings of Russian landscapes to sooth their anxiety during takeoff. They’re displayed alongside a Soviet space hammer, cleverly filled with ballbearings to create momentum, still in use today.More recent innovations include the zero-gravity coffee cup, which looks a bit like a truncated Shewee, its strange geometry the result of modelling how fluids behave in space. It was developed by the same scientists who usually model things like the movement of rocket fuel, but they decided to turn their attention to how astronauts could enjoy the perfect space espresso, without having to suck it from a bag. The cup tapers to a corner, which acts like a wick, using surface tension to guide the liquid towards your mouth, in little shippable balls of coffee.It’s an important point made by the exhibition – that if we’re ever going to survive outside the Earth’s orbit in any form, the details of everyday human comforts, such as drinking coffee and being able to look out of a window, will be just as important as calculating landing trajectories.

Profits have also come under pressure as the value of the pound has fallen against the dollar, increasing the cost of buying goods overseas.Karen Millen, Coast, House of Fraser and Debenhams have all fallen into administration in the past 18 months while New Look and Marks \u0026amp Spencer have been closing stores.Bonmarché, which previously went into administration with sister chain Peacocks in 2012, issued a string of profits warnings in the past year, saying it expected to make a loss of up to £6m this year.The collapse comes after Bonmarché was taken private by the Edinburgh Woollen Mill owner Philip Day’s Dubai-based acquisition vehicle Spectre in August.The value of Day’s £5m-plus investment in Bonmarché will be wiped out in the administration and it is not clear if Day, who also owns Jaeger, Austin Reed and Peacocks, will try and maintain control of the business.Bonmarché’s problems emerged on the same day that Watt Brothers, the Scottish department store chain, also called in administrators with 220 immediate redundancies and nearly 90 further jobs on the line."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7476246aadaa9b1f967ea0626ad46185118fa475/0_264_4134_2480/master/4134.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=489e32eadd5617acd59b7dce1c790103","title":"uk finance watchdog sues airport car park scheme","story":"FCA hopes to reimburse thousands of small investors over scheme selling leases on airport parking spacesAn airport car park investment scheme which raised £230m from thousands of people who poured in their pensions and life savings is at the heart of two legal cases that accuse the directors of making false and misleading statements to attract investors.The Financial Conduct Authority announced on Thursday it had started proceedings against Park First Limited, its senior managers and other connected companies following the collapse of what it said was an “illegal collective investment scheme”.In a separate case, investors are suing the same people, claiming they “fraudulently misrepresented” the nature of the scheme. But after sales were stopped by the FCA in 2017, payments slowed or stopped, and the company put some of its businesses into administration.Investors are taking legal action against related companies and the directors, saying that the spaces were overvalued, the demand for them was overstated and that the company is now trespassing on their land.Patrick Lawrence, a lawyer representing investors, said his clients were “suing to recover their pensions, savings and inheritance monies”. And while investors are out of pocket and have set up a crowd-funder to pay for their legal action, the ultimate owner, Toby Whittaker, has taken large idends from the parent company, Group First Global.The company has denied making fraudulent representations to investors and said that all monies received could be accounted for.Group First Global began to advertise investments in the Park First scheme in 2012. The firm bought land in Glasgow and near Gatwick airport and ided it into inidual plots which were marketed on a leasehold basis for £20,000 each, directly and via agents.Brochures for prospective investors heralded “a new commercial property opportunity designed for today’s astute investor that we believe is low risk and highly profitable”.The brochure referred to a break clause after two years “by agreement” between both parties.Investors typically received the first two years’ payments without problems, but then faced delays, or were told that the contract was being cancelled.The FCA started to look at the scheme in 2015, and in December 2017 told Park First it was in breach of the Financial Services \u0026amp Markets Act, and that investors had a right to their money back.Many investors were unhappy with the options, particularly when it emerged that the company wanted those who were selling back their spot to sign over the deeds and wait up to a year for payment.Then in July this year Group First Global put four companies into administration, blaming the cost of reimbursing investors.All payments were suspended, as administrators moved in to work out what could be returned.The way that the car parks were structured raised questions about how investors would be paid after the original guarantee period.The court filing details how some of the car parks worked on a “meet and greet” basis, whereby holidaymakers left their cars with a valet who took it to the Park First land and parked it nose to tail with other cars, rather than in designated spots.Others operated on a pay-to-access basis, where the driver paid in advance for a code to get into the car park, then left their car in whichever spot they wanted. Both models meant that Park First was not collecting payments for inidual plots, and could not accurately allocate money to inidual investors.Investor Hanif Younus told the  he had once tried to visit the four Gatwick parking spaces that he invested in for his sons.“I got there and it’s an open plot – there are no lines are the floor. I asked the woman running it where my place was, and she said she didn’t know – that there were no spaces.”Since signing the leaseback scheme he has received one small payment. “The spaces are being let out but we don’t know who is getting the money,” he said. “I don’t know what four places I own, or if I really own anything.”In 2009, one of Whittaker’s previous property businesses, Dylan Harvey was wound up, owing more than £6.5m to investors.More recently, a scheme based on storage units was wound-up by the secretary of state for business over concerns that investors were given misleading information.But after two years most were told that the company wanted to exercise its right to break the contract.after several days of hearings, it was agreed that three Store First companies would be closed and one would continue trading and collect rents to distribute to investors.And this has been offset by costs - on top of the ground rent charged by Store First, he has received a demand for more than £300 in business rates from Barnsley borough council.“At the moment the investments are costing me money,” he said. Group First Global, which is based on a business park in Burnley, was set up in March 2006. In its last set of accounts it declared a turnover of £15m.Whittaker, the sole shareholder in the company, has been paid almost £5m in idends since 2012.Park First said it was “surprised that the FCA has chosen to commence legal proceedings at this time when the FCA is aware of the material steps that Park First has been taking to restructure its car parking schemes for the benefit of investors.“The proceedings are unmeritorious and will only disrupt the steps that Park First is presently taking.”In response to the investors’ legal action, Ruth Almond from Group First Global said the Park First investments were all legitimate. She added: “In order to minimise operating costs and thereby maximise income for the benefit of investors, some of the car parks have been closed. This means that Park First does not incur costs such as business rates in operating these car parks.“This does not have any impact on investors.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b43a7d0fa640b3756d915d2c68c58e8298a2f417/0_138_4288_2573/master/4288.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0a19436fb58a872b1d91041ea32325f0","title":"no deal brexit food shortages are you a small business owner whos stockpiling","story":"We’d like to hear from small business owners about how they are preparing ahead of BrexitWith the cut-off date to secure a Brexit deal looming, the likely outcome of negotiations this week is still uncertain.

He had worked on North Yorkshire’s railways before moving to Hunslet, known as the “workshop of Leeds” on account of its iron foundries and steelworks. Like neighbouring Holbeck, the centre of Leeds’ textile industry, workers lived in red-brick terraced houses close to their places of employment.By the 1890s Hunslet’s steel works was Britain’s largest producer of railway tracks, sprawling over a 25-acre site. By 1911, one in every five men worked in Leeds’ heavy industries, which were predominantly concentrated south of the River Aire.South Leeds’ reliance on iron, steel and textiles meant it was hit hard by industrial decline. By the 1960s the area’s traditional industries had largely collapsed and workers’ terraces were demolished in slum clearances. Stourton, a working-class suburb bordering Holbeck, was transformed in the space of a few years from residential suburb to post-industrial wasteland. The city council, keen to rebrand Leeds as a thoroughly modern city, welcomed the construction of the M621 motorway through Holbeck and Hunslet, and attempted to style Leeds as the “Motorway City of the Seventies”.A walk through south Leeds reveals a district caught between industrial grandeur, post-industrial wasteland and urban blandness. The starting point is Leeds station, where the 1960s edifice and the 1930s art-deco concourse sit directly above the Dark Arches, a series of vaults ning the River Aire that serve as the station’s foundation. A metal walkway passes through the Dark Arches and over the Aire, where passers-by can stop andwatch the churning water receding into darkness. Around 18m bricks were used to construct the arches during the 1860s – the largest such project in the world at that time.Through the Dark Arches lies the Leeds-Liverpool canal and the gentrified tip of Holbeck: “Holbeck Urban Village”, a tight knot of former red-brick flax mills and steam engine works. The Round Foundry dates back to 1795 and was once home to steam engine manufacturers today the complex is home to offices, a brewery and Yorkshire’s official tourist board. The gentrification of this small part of Holbeck has done little to ease poverty in south Leeds as a whole, but it has preserved a part of the district’s history that was previously at risk.The buildings in the Urban Village are significant, but the most impressive relics of south Leeds’ industrial heritage lie just around the corner. Tower Works on Globe Road was constructed in the 1860s by the industrialist Thomas Harding to produce needles for south Leeds’ textile manufacturers. A lover of Italian architecture, Harding took the unusual decision to embellish his factory with red-brick replicas of famous towers in Verona, Florence and San Gimignano. Derelict for several decades, Tower Works is currently being converted into luxury flats.Perhaps the most impressive relic of south Leeds’ industrial past lies a five minute walk from Tower Works. Pass Marshall Mills, an imposing six-storey edifice that dwarfs the smaller industrial buildings around it, and you might be surprised to find an Egyptian temple executed in millstone grit. This is Temple Works, modelled on the Temple of Horus at Edfu on the west bank of the Nile, and a prime example of northern industrialists’ use of architecture to flaunt their cultural capital.Temple Works opened in 1840 and boasted the largest single- room in the world, as well as a grass-covered roof where sheep could graze, sometimes falling on to the street below. The mill was sold in the 1880s, and by 2008 it was on the verge of collapse. After several stalled attempts at redevelopment, Temple Works has been purchased by a local developer, CEG. Work has started on the restoration, with CEG stating: “We want to reconnect the communities that were cut off by the M621 and feel the city centre is not for them. It needs to be an inclusive use that everyone is proud of.”Beyond Temple Works the gentrification ends abruptly. South of the regenerated buildings lies a patchwork landscape of old railway viaducts, industrial wasteland and decaying historic buildings such as Low Hall Mills, constructed in 1874 and now derelict. The area is peppered with listed buildings the red terracotta and Burmantofts tiling of Holbeck public library, now offices the United Methodist Free Chapel constructed in 1880, now home to a carpet warehouse. Yet much of the landscape is a blur of roundabouts and light industrial units.This part of Holbeck has seen its fair share of controversy: in 2014 the area was profiled in the press as the UK’s first “legal” red light district, a reference to Leeds city council’s introduction of a “managed zone” where sex workers and punters could work free of police interference within agreed hours and geographic limits. Although efforts to improve safety for sex workers are commendable, Holbeck’s ginnels and viaducts are far from a sanctuary. In 2016 a young woman named Daria Pionko was murdered by a punter in the managed zone, a reminder of the dangers that women working in Holbeck still face.In neighbouring Hunslet, the remnants of south Leeds’ industrial past are harder to spot. Clues remain, however: among the most impressive examples of Hunslet’s industrial past are Leeds city college’s conversion of a former printworks factory into a campus, resplendent in terracotta, and the former Hunslet Engine Company headquarters on Jack Lane, where an exposed section of rail track still cuts through the road (the Hunslet Engine Company is still manufacturing locomotive engines in south Leeds to this day).Just over the border in Middleton lies the oldest continuously operating railway in the world, Middleton Railway, opened in 1758 to serve south Leeds’ coal mines. There are other reasons to be optimistic: Victoria Mills, derelict since the 1970s and once among the Victorian Society’s top 10 at-risk buildings, is being redeveloped as flats. It is not clear how many will be affordable, but at the very least part of Hunslet’s industrial history has been salvaged.South Leeds was once the heart of industrial Leeds, but suffered a steep decline in the late 20th century. There are reasons to question how far the redevelopment of buildings like Victoria Mills will address stubborn poverty in the area, and there remains a perceived boundary between Holbeck proper and the Urban Village. Nonetheless, after decades of neglect, there are signs that south Leeds and its remarkable history is finally being recognised.Francesca Roe is a writer, printmaker and illustrator from Leeds.

Always ahead of the curve, David Cameron is leaning in to the coming winds of financial and ritualistic deregulation with demob abandon. Speaking in Harrogate to promote his book on Thursday night, Cameron predicted success for Boris Johnson and his deal. As the former prime minister put it: “The thing about the greased piglet is that he manages to slip through other people’s hands where mere mortals fail.”That’s it, mate. Why keep your mouth shut about pigs any more? We should just take it from one who knows: greasing a pig makes it go better. Given the dramatic degeneration of our public conversation over the past three years, it feels right that Cameron chose to finally “go there” on the porcine front in Harrogate, a town that was for so long a byword for a certain type of regional gentility.I would imagine his next tour stop will be in Royal Leamington Spa, where he will expand on the point with a demonstration comparing different means of lubricant. Local boars who’ve always wanted to put their daughter on the stage are invited to get in touch with his promoter.As for which atrocious timeline we are about to be flung into tomorrow, who can say? A lot of journalists would certainly like to say. Everything has improved, hasn’t it, since journalists decided their job is predicting what might happen in the future as opposed to reporting on what they do currently know, or scrutinising what they can currently see.Thus the 36 hours or so between Johnson announcing his deal in Brussels and the special sitting of parliament to vote on it feel like they have been mostly spent watching or reading hacks and pundits debating the complex question, “Will the agreement pass?” I don’t know, guys! I guess you could concentrate on what’s in it – or are you as committed to a no-spoilers Brexit as the government is?Lavishing hours of airtime and miles of column inches on speculating precisely how close it all is feels a bit like being given advance notice of a shitstorm, and frittering your day away taking spread bets on the possible wind speed. Six votes? Three votes? Would someone like to come on air and say they reckon there’s maybe just a couple of votes in it? What if it was a tie?Either way, the conclusion, which may of course be debunked tomorrow, is that it will be Very Close. Then, when it is, lots of people will be able to sweep online to declare that they “CALLED IT”. You can print out those tweets and burn them for warmth in the years when we’re discovering the true implications of the Very Close Vote on whatever it was a vote on.The only people who seem to have spent less time thinking about the detail are the likes of Andrew Bridgen. “It looks like Brexit, it smells like Brexit,” he explained to Channel 4 News. “That’s Brexit for me.” Despite being even more cruelly miscast as a “Spartan” than cinema’s Gerard Butler once was, the likes of Mark Francois and Andrew Bridgen have succeeded in getting apparently serious commentators to use their self-styled nickname “the Spartans” without deploying airquotes so thrustingly sarcastic that they could be harnessed for wind power.Meanwhile, Michael Gove could be found lurching unsteadily towards the TV camera to bat away Andrew Neil’s inquiry about the possibility of a second referendum amendment. “That ain’t gonna happen,” drawled the bespectacled Clint Eastwood of Surrey Heath. “Ain’t gonna – ain’t gonna be no second referendum.” In retrospect, that may be the moment this once self-respecting nation had to officially admit it was over.We have created an environment so intensely deregulated that Michael Gove is emboldened enough to imagine he’s some kind of gunslinger. The system has already failed. We passed checks and balances three galaxies ago. Our executive defences have been breached by Jacob Rees-Mogg, a man grown in a petri dish to provide Monty Burns with someone who could lose to him at arm wrestling.Given the problems Theresa May had, there was some sense of surprise that Johnson should have pulled off a deal acceptable to the more deranged elements of his party. But history is likely to judge that it’s easier than it looks when you’re a man whose sole ideological red line is frictionless abortions. Having given a speech in November 2018 insisting that “no British Conservative government could or should sign up” to regulatory and customs checks in the Irish Sea, Johnson’s British Conservative government was just shy of three months old when it cheerily signed up to regulatory and customs checks in the Irish Sea. That was a great outcome, explained foreign secretary and famous geography dunce Dominic Raab, who said it was a “cracking deal” for Northern Ireland on the basis that they’d keep “frictionless access to the single market”. There it is: the dream. Only a few more days of having to remember which lie you told.Speaking of Northern Ireland, the week has offered the chance to watch the Democratic Unionist party discover in real time who the sucker at the table was. It would take a heart of stone not to enjoy the disappointment of DUP hive queen Arlene Foster, who has carried herself throughout the Brexit process like the kind of maternal screen villain who tries to scupper their child’s every romantic attachment for not being good enough.The DUP have so enjoyed being at the centre of the soap opera since the 2017 election, and acting like as, that they didn’t realise until they saw this week’s script that the producers couldn’t be doing with them any more and were killing them off. It’s a lot like what happened with Martine McCutcheon on EastEnders. She went off and showed them by having a 15-minute pop career Arlene is not thought to have any musical ambitions, but will now always be a hero to those dreaming of a united Ireland.As for the prime minister, he seems to be enjoying himself, as much as is possible for a sort of middle-aged Kylo Ren who’s making all the correct self-care decisions. In Westminster, many judge that, whatever happens tomorrow, Boris Johnson is in a win-win situation, with the sole losing entity being the entire United Kingdom. As David Cameron continues to promote his bestselling book, and the rabid deregulators continue to promote Boris Johnson, it does feel as if the nation might end up the true sucker in all this. Then again, for all the mirth it produced, there was always a rather leaden sense of dramatic irony clouding the original Cameronpig tale. People like David Cameron end up playing David Cameron. The rest of the public is in danger of being the pig."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/93efaa13dc0103a79ffc88f42bda8dd149b802aa/97_574_3268_1961/master/3268.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f18705999758609cc92d0c4a6de7ca2a","title":"second referendum scottish independence brexit scots","story":"Brexit is just one reason Scots are increasingly drawn to the idea of living in a small, liberal, European nation stateThe political landscape has changed because Holyrood and Westminster have erged so strongly on policy. There is real fury in Scotland that the Home Office is still at large, stymieing the desire to secure the future of EU citizens, its existence obstructing a potentially liberal immigration policy.There have been no attempts to marketise the health service in the country, unlike elsewhere in the UK, and a raft of social measures have passed that ensure no tuition fees, free personal care, and a childcare policy that gives every new child a baby box starter pack and, from next year, a £10 a week allowance.It’s not a utopia. It’s not problem- or failure-free. But people increasingly know they want no part of a world in which a morally bankrupt Boris Johnson can become prime minister and Jacob Rees-Mogg leader of the House. They look in horror at the rise of Tommy Robinson’s English Defence League and of both Islamophobia and antisemitism.Increasing numbers like the idea of living in a small, liberal, European nation state. That uptick in support in a raft of polls was not the only factor that produced two pledges from Sturgeon that on the surface leave her with little wriggle room among her more fervent pro-independence supporters. She has watched – although pointedly not participated in – pro-independence marches all over Scotland, with the most recent wave culminating in 200,000 turning up on her Edinburgh doorstep on a damp and dreich October afternoon.The fact that she has now pledged to ask for the powers to hold another referendum to be transferred to the Holyrood parliament by the end of this year – the section 30 order signed by both David Cameron and Alex Salmond in 2012 – and, crucially, promised her troops a new referendum in 2020, means that she placed herself on a collision course with the prime minister, and self-declared minister for the union.For months she has been under pressure to be bolder. Her legendary caution has been founded on one central belief: that unless a referendum is run on the legally binding basis a section 30 order provides, what she calls “the gold standard”, she would be unable to persuade Brussels and the wider world of its legitimacy.Backstage, however, much is going on to pave the way for a second vote. The referendums bill (Scotland) is nearing the end of its parliamentary journey. This says that when the power to hold one is devolved, it can proceed very quickly. It also waives the usual lengthy procedure to agree a question where one has been asked before. The very large elephant in this room is what happens when Boris Johnson – or any other premier – simply says no. In her speech, Sturgeon told other parties “not to even pick up the phone” if they didn’t accede to her demand.Mike Russell, the minister responsible for constitutional matters including Brexit, hinted that his government might take the matter to the courts. Yet there is no guarantee this would work. A legal challenge to post-Brexit powers – even previously devolved ones – being repatriated to Westminster rather than Holyrood was lost in 2017.It is a trope much used by commentators that Brexit has fuelled the desire for self-determination in Scotland. Moreover, that if there were to be a new vote for remain, the SNP’s fox would be shot. This is to misunderstand profoundly the current mood in Scotland.Brexit is clearly a factor in a remain-voting country. It’s true, too, that there is enduring frustration at watching the DUP trotting in and out of Downing Street despite having 10 seats at Westminster, less than a third of the Nationalists’ 35-seat presence. Unlike the SNP, the DUP is also totally at odds with its own electorate. This frustration has been exacerbated by the Brexit ministers from Scotland and Wales being sidelined throughout the negotiations with Brussels, and the joint ministerial council reduced to little more than window dressing.The Institute for Government has produced a report that says it would be unsustainable to deny a second independence referendum if Scots vote for parties supporting one. It says: “If the union is to survive, it must be because a majority of people in all four parts of the UK are persuaded that its survival is for the best, not because Westminster wields the power… to hold the nations… together against their will.”Sturgeon insists the question is not what Scotland should do if Westminster says no to a referendum. The question, she says, is what gives anyone the right to refuse Scots the choice? These days it’s a question with resonance well beyond her party’s faithful.• Ruth Wishart is a Scottish columnist and broadcaster"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f03f83d52f4ce1a95a00eb2b2d41debdcf9efb72/0_18_1216_730/master/1216.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=68f8b116adb1844ec74cb584f1970e6b","title":"10 unmissable experiences in nova scotia","story":"Whether it’s visiting wine country by doubledecker bus, rafting on a tidal bore or tucking into a lobster feast, there are memories to be made in Nova ScotiaNova Scotia is the kind of place where strangers stop to talk and smiles come easy. It’s also where this famous east-coast hospitality, fresh seafood, good wine and pristine beaches all come together to create memorable summer holidays. Just a six-hour flight from the UK, there’s no shortage of things to do, from exploring historic fishing villages to world-class surfing. Here are our top 10 recommendations.Line up a lobsterWhether it’s fish and chips from a food truck or fresh oysters from a trendy downtown restaurant, there is no shortage of seafood here. Although Nova Scotia is renowned for its lobster, other seafood options are extensive and menus are constantly evolving, but for a traditional lobster feast, you can take your pick from a lineup of restaurants along the Halifax waterfront. The most famous local lobster experience, however, can be found at the Shore Club, located by the shore 30 minutes outside of the city in Hubbards. The club has been around for more than 80 years and is popular with locals, while the restaurant serves a daily lobster dinner throughout the summer.Take in colourful LunenburgThe charming seaside town, located an hour south of Halifax, on the South Shore, is known for its brightly painted wooden houses and buildings. The colourful facades are meant to reflect how the town would have looked during Victorian times, when houses served as beacons for the ships coming in to port. It’s the perfect town to stroll in, stopping for a fresh seafood lunch by the water and admiring the secret coves and fishing boats. It’s also home to the Fisheries Museum of the Atlantic, as well as the Ironworks Distillery, where visitors can enjoy both local spirits and a lesson in Lunenburg’s history of rum running.Have a pre-breakfast surfThe secret is out: some of the best waves this side of the Atlantic are waiting for those intrepid enough to withstand the cool waters. Think misty mornings, wetsuits and world-class waves, all set against the bucolic backdrop of friendly, rural communities. Infamous east-coast storms and hurricanes can result in some intense waves, but it’s still a good spot to learn, with the help of expert teachers at East Coast Surf School. Bonus: the waves are so close to the city you can hit the beach for an early-morning surf and be back in time for breakfast.Sea kayaking in Cape LaHaveKayak through a network of more than 20 islands, with incredible local guides at Cape LaHave Adventures. Paddlers can learn about the flora, fauna and folklore of the region and see untouched beaches and coastal wildlife, including seals. Choose from a two-hour lesson to a three-day glamping adventure that includes campfires, craft cocktails and fresh oysters for dinner.The Rum Runners TrailDuring Prohibition, many Nova Scotian fishermen opted for a lucrative career change: rum running from Canada to the eastern seaboard of the US. The former train route that transported much of the booze from the hidden inlets to the main ports, almost 100 years ago, has now been converted into a 74-mile multi-use trail that runs between Halifax and Lunenburg. The trail is the ideal way for outdoor enthusiasts to explore the coastal communities, stopping at local cafes, bars, beaches and provincial parks along the way.Alight at Peggy’s Cove Nova Scotia is home to more than 150 lighthouses, but the one at Peggy’s Cove is definitely the most recognised. Just a 40-minute drive outside Halifax, the cove is covered in sprawling granite boulders that stretch out into the crashing waves of the Atlantic, creating a dramatic backdrop for landscape photos and windswept selfies. Wooden fishing shacks and lobster traps line the inlet that both local fishermen and an inspired community of artists all call home.Fossil hunt at Bay of FundyThe Bay of Fundy is a unique, visually arresting coastal environment. Every day the tide rises as high as 16 metres (53 feet) and during the following six hours recedes back down, leaving behind geological gems on the ocean floor. At low tide, it’s possible to walk along the mudflats, hunt for fossils and look at marine life in tidal pools. For a more adrenaline-infused way to experience the tides, head out on a tidal-bore rafting adventure. When the incoming tide meets the Shubenacadie River, the waves created by the tidal bore make for a pretty wild rafting ride.On the Halifax waterfrontHalifax boasts almost 4km of boardwalk and the waterfront is jam-packed with museums, farmers’ markets and shops. There are also plenty of options for harbour tours. Alternatively, watch the boats sail in while sipping on a cold pint in a beer garden, or head somewhere a little more upscale, like the Five Fishermen, to feast on fresh seafood and local wines. Catch some live music at Stayner’s Wharf Pub and Grill, or at the iconic Lower Deck, located in one of the beautiful Historic Properties. Across the harbour, the downtown of neighbouring Dartmouth boasts lots of excellent cafes, breweries and restaurants. The ferry takes just 10 minutes to cross and offers excellent views of the city.Explore the coastlineWherever you end up in Nova Scotia, you can count on a beach being close by. The province has more than 8,200 miles of pristine coastline, including the many islands that dot the coast, and there are beaches to suit everyone’s taste. Think white sand and crystal-clear turquoise water, rocky, mist-laden shores with rolling waves or swimming and relaxing at the warm water beaches of Northumberland Shore. If you fancy surfing, Lawrencetown beach is a favourite, with its sand and cobblestone beach and big waves, just half an hour from the city centre. Crystal Crescent, just 40 minutes south of the city, is an expansive crescent-shaped beach, backed by a gorgeous 12-mile coastal hiking trail.Enjoy the east-coast hospitality and explore Halifax with Canadian Affair"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c54e3f5126f9fdbb42eae23b5e539088a8ecc0b4/0_183_4221_2532/master/4221.jpg?width=300\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e27e39dcce56d8064ab43c99bc1d36e","title":"we have the best hole in the walls the insider guide to edmonton","story":"Hometown devotee Jen Mallia chats with city ambassador Linda Hoang and photographer extraordinaire Emilie Iggiotti for the inside scoop on Edmonton, Alberta’s buzzing capitalEdmonton boasts an arts scene that won’t quit and a banging array of places to eat and drink, plus opportunities to commune with nature, shop indie boutiques or visit the largest mall on the continent. It’s a welcoming city on the prairies of roughly a million people – a home for artists, tradespeople, academics, government workers, and people from around the world. Edmonton is the place you didn’t know you belonged!Another way to enjoy the mix of the urban and provincial in Edmonton is at one of the farmers’ markets. Many of them are outdoor, and therefore seasonal, but a select few operate year-round indoors. The Downtown Farmers’ Market is an indoor-outdoor hybrid. During the winter months, the market takes over one of downtown’s historic buildings, and in the warmer months it takes to the streets.During the summer months, the outdoor markets shift around the city, and you’ll find local gems around Edmonton’s inner neighbourhoods on both Saturdays and Sundays from June through to Canadian Thanksgiving in mid-October, when vendors up stalls and shift indoors. (Insider tip: don’t miss Moonshine Doughnuts at Old Strathcona Farmers’ Market – vegan and delicious!)Edmonton is nicknamed Festival City for a reason – you won’t get too far without happening upon a celebration. If a person likes something, Edmonton has a festival for it … from ice to cats! One of the most popular is the Edmonton international fringe theatre festival, held in venues centred in the Old Strathcona neighbourhood. Every year at the end of August, performers from around the world contribute their work. Attendees can see a show at almost any time of the day or night, then hang out in the beer garden, trading critiques on the performances that range from the ridiculous to the sublime.Trendy Whyte Avenue is the backbone of the Old Strathcona neighbourhood. Take time to poke through the shops, restaurants, and bars that line the avenue and surrounding blocks. Don’t miss brunch at Pip, or satisfy your sweet tooth at La Boule or Sugared \u0026amp Spiced. A soft serve ice-cream from Yelo’d is the perfect accompaniment to a sunny day. Venture a bit to the southeast to check out the new Ritchie Market – notably for Transcend Coffee or something stronger from Blind Enthusiasm brewery. Their craft beers pair well with the bites from adjacent Biera.Just like Fringe, Rust Magic is an annual festival that features the work of local and international artists. But Instead of treading the boards, these artists are spray-painting them. Each year since 2016, 15 new murals have been created and bequeathed to the city. Plans are in the works for guided tours of the street art during the festival, and maps are readily available at local businesses for self-guided exploration. Periodically throughout the year, Hoang herself runs Photo Walks featuring Instagrammable Walls of Edmonton, which are a great way to see some city colour and get some superb pics to take home too.Before Alberta developed its oil and gas industry, it was straight-up farming and ranch country. Calling back to the area’s agricultural heritage, high-calibre restaurants are cropping up all over town, with chefs focusing on innovative ways to use locally grown and sourced ingredients. A great way to sample a variety of these restaurants is with a culinary tour from Eat or Alberta Food Tours you can also pedal between nibbles and drinks with Food Bike Tours or the big bikes from Urban Pedal.You won’t go hungry in any area of the city, but a high concentration of foodie favourites are found downtown and in the Ice District. Try the vegan pizzas at Die Pie, Italian to die for at Uccellino, wood-fired creations at Woodwork, or share some plates at Bundok or Baijiu.West of downtown has experienced a hip revival in recent years. In addition to arty new shops, there are tons of places to eat. Start at Wilfred’s in the Brewery District, then swing by the Oliver Exchange Building, full of great places to grab a bite or a drink. Come hungry to enjoy Canadian cuisine at RGE RD on 123rd Street NW. A short walk to the north-east brings you to the fresh and French Café Linnea. If you still have room after that, locals swear by the treats at Duchess Bake Shop and the vegan cookies at Bloom Cookie Co.Before heading off, make sure to toast your time in the city. There are ample opportunities to enjoy a pint or two. To curate the experience, try a brewery tour from Alberta Craft Tours or Urban Pedal. If you are going it on your own, make sure Sea Change, Strathcona Spirits, Town Square, and the newly opened Polar Park are on your list. Make time for an inventive cocktail at the cosy Bar Clementine or chic Partake. For something a little different, try to score tickets on Eventbrite for one of the seasonal Street Car Cask events hosted by the Common. There’s beer and snacks and lots of fun, as the reconditioned streetcar travels across the top of the High Level Bridge connecting downtown and Old Strathcona.Fly London to Edmonton with WestJet to enjoy this growing city.

Following discussions among editors about how we could change the language we use in our coverage of environmental issues, our attention then turned to images. We have been working across the organisation to better understand how we aim to visually communicate the impact the climate emergency is having across the world.Our goal is to provide guidelines for anyone working with images at the . We are also asking the agencies and photographers we work with to provide images that are appropriate to the changing narrative.The concern over how best to depict the climate emergency led us to seek advice from the research organisation Climate Visuals, who have found that “images that define climate change shape the way it is understood and acted upon”.It was important to address our own use of images and understand the processes that lead to image selection for our environmental and weather stories. When given a story, a picture editor or subeditor may have a short time to choose an image from our database, which is why the availability and prominence of climate crisis photography is a key element in the process. It can also be difficult for photographers to capture images that reflect global heating, weather patterns and wildlife extinction, especially when trying to depict what cannot always be seen.We know, from years of experience, that people love polar bears and pandas, so it is easy to see how these appealing creatures have become the emblems for the topics of endangered species and what we previously termed as global warming. Often, when signalling environmental stories to our readers, selecting an image of a polar bear on melting ice has been the obvious – though not necessarily appropriate – choice. These images tell a certain story about the climate crisis but can seem remote and abstract – a problem that is not a human one, nor one that is particularly urgent.So it made sense when we heard that research conducted by the team at Climate Visuals has shown that people respond to human pictures and stories. Images that show emotion and pictures of real situations make the story relevant to the inidual. Rather than choosing, say, an image of a smoke stack pumping out pollution or a forest on fire, such as this: … we should consider showing the direct impact of environmental issues on people’s daily lives as well as trying to indicate the scale of the impact, such as these:In the UK, the weather is a national preoccupation and as such a subject of tradition for British newspapers. People enjoying a sunny holiday weekend, or a fresh fall of snow at home or abroad can deliver some delightful and beautiful images:But as we have reported, the science tells us a much more sinister story of regular heatwaves and unseasonal weather being a defining indicator of the climate crisis. So, although scenes of children playing in fountains and everyone racing to the beach can be uplifting and irresistible, we have to be mindful of the tone of our journalism. This summer, the British media published dramatic headlines issuing climate warnings and covered in detail the negative impact of the crisis, but the images were typically of people taking pleasure in the environment. The contradiction in messaging, between the headlines and imagery, can undermine the effect of the reporting and how we perceive the risks.In June this year we published a picture gallery on the heatwave across Europe. In its original form, this was of a lighter tone, but we felt on reflection this was wrong and disregarded the current context, so we amended the publication to include images that covered a range of human experience of the extraordinary temperatures.The photographer Brook Mitchell made an impactful series about the drought in Australia affecting families in New South Wales, which we published as a photo essay in July. The environmental scenes of the scorched landscape were striking, as were the suffering animals, but the portraits and stories of the people battling the catastrophe really anchored the piece and drove the level of engagement.It is an example of how, as picture editors and photographers, we are having to think again about finding the right focus. Many of the impacts to communities, bioersity, agriculture, water and food supply represent the escalating crisis our planet faces, yet visually they can be far more challenging to depict. We need new imagery for new narratives. This can be challenging in a fast-paced newsroom but it is important to be nuanced and creative with search terms to unearth photography beyond the usual keywords of climate change, heatwave and floods.As our stories make a journey from their initial point of publication through the various networks of social media we also have to be mindful of how the image is connected to the headline. We have to consider that the two must work together to allow the reader to make a broad sense of the article often simply at a glance. Relatable images that are not overly abstract have become a good choice.However, in its simplest form, getting the emotional tone of imagery in line with the issue is critical, rather than the visual overload of society universally having fun in the sun. We hope that if we keep having these conversations, we will be able to have even more of an impact with our climate coverage, and others will follow suit.If you are a journalist, a photographer or work with other news organisations depicting the climate crisis, please contact membershipeditorial@ to join our conversation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/399dfc115cc0d5d9d9d140ac885cc05cfca93401/0_97_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=44fcc539d5e386fbff529197dec69b4c","title":"naming and shaming the polluters","story":"Global environment editor Jonathan Watts discusses the ’s investigation into the fossil fuel industry, and the structures that need to change to halt the climate emergency.

In his 2015 film, Shaun and his mates rescued their farmer from the big smoke of the city. With this sheepquel, Aardman have seriously upped the ante, delivering a Spielbergian sci-fi epic: an ovine spin on ET crammed with gags (spot the “HG Wheels” sign on a mechanic’s garage), movie pastiches, and all the usual something-for-all-ages charm.Shaun has just ordered in pizza for the flock when adorable lost alien Lu-la shows up at Mossy Bottom Farm, having crash-landed her spaceship in nearby woods. (For an Aardman figure, Lu-La is a bit of a letdown – too cutesy by half.) As Shaun steps up to help, the unfeeling, robot-like boss of the Ministry of Alien Detection shows up – a woman hellbent on creating a hostile environment for extra-terrestrials. (It’s a sign of the times that even Aardman’s brand of buttery-toast comedy is dragged into politics: one of the film’s directors has confirmed the villainous Red was inspired by Theresa May.) Meanwhile, the farmer puts Bitzer the jobsworth dog to work building a crappy UFO theme park, Farmageddon, in a back field for the UFO nuts who’ve descended on the village.As in the long-running Shaun the Sheep TV series, there is no dialogue, just plenty of expressive baas and bleating. In place of one-liners, the slapstick and sight gags come thick and fast – a joke involving a frozen pizza thrown into the air and being mistaken for a UFO is vintage Aardman. A little of the personality has been lost in adapting Shaun’s world for sci-fi (the Wallace and Gromit movie Curse of the Were-Rabbit pulled off horror with a little more finesse). It’s a minor quibble Shaun is by no means past his prime.• A Shaun the Sheep Movie: Farmageddon is released in the UK on 18 October, the US on 13 December and Australia on 9 January."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9f0e05afeeadbae28af83dde5e08cba7e9485cc/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d0297567f1ef6bf412c8b4a12d874912","title":"barney the dinsosaur movie daniel kaluuya producer mattel","story":"The Oscar-nominated actor is set to produce a film based on the much-loved children’s character that will ‘surprise audiences and subvert expectations’Daniel Kaluuya and Mattel are teaming up to make a live-action Barney the Dinosaur movie.The Oscar nominated star of Get Out will produce the film based on the children’s TV character who hosted Barney \u0026amp Friends from 1998 to 2009.“Barney was a ubiquitous figure in many of our childhoods, then he disappeared into the shadows, left misunderstood,” said Kaluuya. “We’re excited to explore this compelling modern-day hero and see if his message of ‘I love you, you love me’ can stand the test of time.”Specifics of the plot are yet to be revealed but Mattel Films’ Robbie Brenner has stated that the film will take some unexpected turns. “Working with Daniel Kaluuya will enable us to take a completely new approach to Barney that will surprise audiences and subvert expectations,” said Brenner. “The project will speak to the nostalgia of the brand in a way that will resonate with adults, while entertaining today’s kids.”The project joins a number of other major films in development from the toy company. Earlier this year, it was announced that Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach will co-write the script for a new film based on Barbie set to star Margot Robbie.

It’s just a pity that Manchester United v Liverpool matches regularly resemble those mid-2000s Birmingham v Bolton clashes that not even Sky Sports Premier League finds airspace to replay. Each of the last three seasons has featured a 0-0 draw in a fixture that gets the loudest fanfare for the most diminished returns. By now, you know the drill for the buildup: a Jimmy Nesbitt voiceover or a local poet delivering Vogon verse atop a soft-focus glimpse of life in the north west’s two great cities, soundtracked by either Pete Wylie or the Stone Roses, depending on which is the home side.Could Sunday’s showdown be any different? With Liverpool riding high and Ole Gunnar Solskjær, the Moyes-faced Assassin, looking increasingly befuddled, the worst is feared at Old Trafford – a humbling at the hands of the old enemy. United chief suit Ed Woodward has been getting some pre-emptive strikes in before Gary Neville, Graeme Souness and Roy Keane deliver their weekly post-match lecture on what is going wrong for Big Red. “There is a myth that we have non‑football people making football decisions, and it’s insulting to the brilliant people who work on the football side in this club,” roared Ed.The briefing has been broad. Poor, poor David Moyes had zero chance of success, it has been admitted. Daley Blind, yes Daley Blind, that Dutch chap who didn’t cost much and was actually quite decent in midfield, central defence and at left-back, was exactly the wrong player for Manchester United. Lord Ferg’s recruitment process was too reliant on a nod and a wink for any of Ed’s four managers in six years to be able to replicate. But don’t go blaming the Glazer family, that real-life version of Succession season four, the one set after Logan Roy has breathed his last, who pay Ed an annual stipend north of £4m a year and took out £23m in idends last year, according to United’s 2018-19 accounts. “What’s important is the commercial side is never allowed to take priority over the football side,” said Ed, thumbing the Mr Potato keyring in his pocket.As Jürgen Klopp toked on his post-training Lucky Strike on Friday, he might have exhaled sympathy for his counterpart. Liverpool spent more than two decades trailing in United’s wake but are barrelling towards the Premier League title. They have Pep Guardiola on the run, let alone Ole’s Scott McTominay-inspired army. And it has been achieved through careful planning, a workable hierarchy and a recognisable style of play, each of which appear well beyond the ken of those running the show at United. Should the worst happen on Sunday, and despite Ed’s protestations and great promises for the future, those sat under Old Trafford’s leaking roof will be letting the directors’ box know exactly who they think is responsible for the mess.“I’d go for dinner and a drink but obviously not the after-hours stuff. I was the lame guy who never did anything, haha. People didn’t understand then, when I started playing for the first team, they began to. Some didn’t even know, then they’d see me play.

Some do it to bolster their ego, says Annalisa BarbieriTwo years ago, I started a relationship with a wonderful older man, but from the beginning something seemed a little off. After we celebrated our first anniversary, I had the shameful impulse to ask to see his phone. He agreed. There I saw what was bothering me: a previous girlfriend had been texting him every day, and he had been replying: photos, kiss emoticons, five-minute-long voice messages. It had been going on every day for the year we had been together.They apparently had an intense, somewhat problematic, two-year relationship, but she moved abroad. He says they were going to break up anyway. I felt they were being disrespectful towards me and towards themselves, putting all this energy into something that had theoretically ended and not allowing new relationships to fully blossom. He said they texted because they remained good friends, that’s all. That is hard for me to believe. He said he was not aware this could be so damaging to me. He told me he had stopped messaging her so often and that, for him, it made no difference.A year has passed and everything is great. However, I still have moments of doubt. He travels a lot and works in the same field as his ex, sometimes travelling to the same places. I can’t help but imagine emotionally charged encounters, if not more. Does my insecurity have some sort of foundation, or I am making a bit too much of this?I wonder what made you ask to see his phone after a year? And I wonder what made you write now?I think we can become insecure when we know something’s not right, and that some people make us feel more insecure than others. We tend to lack confidence in situations, or people, when we feel information is being withheld and we don’t know the full story – so we fill in the gaps with our own imagination.I would have liked to know a bit more about your past relationships and if you’ve always been like this. If so, then it’s worth looking at why relationships make you feel insecure. Or maybe this is your first serious relationship and you don’t have exes, so you can’t understand why people stay in touch with theirs. When I found out my first boyfriend still occasionally saw his ex, I couldn’t understand why, either. But people stay in touch with exes for all sorts of reasons, some of them benign and some not so much. Some people like to have their exes on the back-burner to bolster their ego. I’ve known men like that.Five-minute-long voice messages and texts every day is quite a commitment, however: does he lavish the same attention on all his friends? What’s the context? I’m also intrigued that he’s older, has experience of relationships, but doesn’t seem to think that being in touch with his ex might bother you. Plus, so much texting yet it “made no difference to him”? Then why do it? I think he’s being disingenuous.Gavin de Becker writes (brilliant, fascinating) books about how we ignore our intuition, often to our detriment. It has made me realise the power of intuition, which social conditioning has largely taught us to ignore for fear of seeming silly or paranoid. We don’t feel we can trust our instincts, so often look for proof instead – as you did with your boyfriend’s phone.In De Becker’s book The Gift Of Fear, he writes about giving a talk and asking how many people in the audience had children. Then he asked: “How many of you have left your children with a babysitter?” And finally he asked: “How many of you aren’t absolutely sure about your babysitter?” A few hands went up. So he said: “What are you doing here? Go home.”This isn’t really about who your boyfriend is in contact with or not it’s about the fact that you feel something isn’t quite right. Pay attention to that feeling and explore it. There may be nothing going on, or you may just feel doubtful about him and have pegged all those doubts on to this one thing. For this relationship to have a future, you need to be able to trust him with your fears and know he will try to understand them he should not only respect them, he should assuage them. A relationship where you doubt both him and yourself will eventually exhaust you. • Send your problem to annalisa.barbieri@mac.

She shook my hand and congratulated meOne recent Sunday morning, my mum and grandma drove me to a 5km race not far from where we live in St Cloud, Minnesota, in the US. There was a fierce thunderstorm, and when we got there I had to wait for it to pass beneath an overhang with the other runners. I started to feel a little nervous, because some of the people there looked really fast. They had proper running leggings and long, skinny legs. They were all different ages. I wasn’t wearing running clothes just a normal T-shirt and shorts.I’m nine years old now, but have been running competitively since I was six. I love it, because it makes me feel good. I have a lot of energy to use up and I can do it by just moving my legs. Sometimes I run for the sake of it, other times I run to win. That morning, I wanted to win.An hour after the official start time, even though it was still raining, the race organisers said we could go. The starting line was crowded, but I positioned myself at the front and in the middle because I like to get out ahead.That morning, I was running confidently and feeling strong. The route went through a neighbourhood and there were quite a few people cheering us on, but I didn’t see any faces I knew. It started to pour again, but I love running in the rain: it keeps me cool and I can keep going for longer, even when I get tired. When I run, I don’t wear a watch or look to see what distance I’m at I just focus on moving, breathing and how my body feels.At one point, I came to a split in the course. A woman who was directing us blocked off the route I thought I was meant to take and told me to go the other way, so I followed her directions. I was confused, but just kept running. I knew I must be close to finishing the 5km, but I couldn’t see the finishing line.After a while I saw route directions for a 10km race. I was worried and thought I was lost, but had to keep going. My body started to get tired and my muscles a little sore. I said to myself, “You’re almost there. Just keep breathing.”Eventually I saw the finish line and spotted my mum. She looked angry. I got past the line and she was yelling, “Why did you do this, Kade? You are in so much trouble.”When she didn’t see me at the 5km finishing line, she and my grandma had gone looking for me and couldn’t find me anywhere. They thought something bad had happened and Mum had got really upset. She’d even given a photograph of me to a fireman, before someone said they’d spotted me in the 10k. I said, “I didn’t do this on purpose, Mum! It was a mistake.” She calmed down when she realised I hadn’t intentionally run the 10km race without telling her. I felt bad that I had worried her.My mum went up to the lady who was timing the race. She told my mum, “He finished first. He won the race.” It’s funny, because in the pictures of the finish, there is no one in front or behind me. Mum assumed, as I was on my own, I had come in last. I had no idea where I was in the race. My mum checked whether the lady meant in my age group but she said, “No, he won the whole thing. No other 10k-ers have finished yet.”I couldn’t believe it. I didn’t even know I was running a 10km and I had won it. My mum and my grandma were so excited and kept hugging me. I was still trying to catch my breath. I felt so happy and proud. It was my first time running such a distance.A 40-year-old woman came in second, about a minute after me. After she finished, she shook my hand and congratulated me and said that I had run smart and she was impressed. I thought it was funny, because everyone else had trained harder than me and been running longer.The rest of the day was pretty normal. We went home and I had a bath with salts in it, then did my homework and played with my dog. I hope my story inspires other people to run, too. It has made me want to do more 10km races and marathons, even. A local marathon runner has volunteered to help me train. One day I would love to go running for five days in another country. That’s my dream now.As told to Candice Pires● Do you have an experience to share?

Can I ever keep up?At midday on 9 June this year, my 64-year-old mother was approaching the halfway point of her second Ironman triathlon. I, meanwhile, was eating breakfast in bed (three packets of Quavers, white chocolate Magnum), too hungover to open both eyes at once. We’d both dedicated our weekends to testing the limits of human endurance. It’s just that I’d done so at a festival for gays, watching Samantha Mumba announce, “I refuse to leave this stage without acknowledging Martha P Johnson”, before dropping that train of thought as quickly as it arrived and launching into her 2000 banger Body II Body.I’m cursed with belonging to a sporty family. It’s not that I am particularly unathletic, more electively idle – a condition that is thrown into sharp relief by the attention-seeking antics of my mother, who once ran 100 miles over the Himalayas in five days, and brother, who has won three cycling gold medals at the Paralympics. Next to them, perfectly reasonable activities – such as eating five Creme Eggs in the bath while listening to Stevie Nicks – begin to look lazy or unwholesome.Mum has exercised compulsively for as long as I can remember, first swimming, then running, then running marathons. She is not great at directions, so schoolmates would report opening their curtains on winter mornings to be greeted by the sight of her jogging through their garden in a sports bra and head torch, trying to locate a footpath. There was even a short-lived foray into bog snorkelling she came 13th in the world championships, neglecting to mention that only 14 people had been mad enough to enter. But things stepped up several gears when she discovered the fitness app Strava. Instead of encouraging people to compare their children (Facebook) or thigh gaps (Instagram), Strava tracks users’ run and cycle times and ranks them against others who have downloaded the app. To say that Strava ignited Mum’s competitive spirit would be like saying Donald Trump doesn’t love the people of Mexico.The app compares your performance across a number of metrics, including age and gender, meaning there is always plenty of urgent data that Mum wants to discuss. A number of missed calls at an unsociable hour used to indicate a family tragedy. Now, it means Mum has won a Strava trophy (she’s in the top 10 fastest women to have completed a particular segment of a race) or – better yet – a “Queen of the Mountain” crown (she is number one, the fastest of all). When she’s displaced from the top spot, lunches are abandoned and conversations halted mid-flow, so that she can rush out on her bike and attempt to reclaim her crown. On a cycling holiday in Colombia, she instructed one of the men to race just ahead of her in order to decrease wind resistance and unseat a rival on the app. “After we finished, we couldn’t get wifi for a couple of hours,” she told me. “It was a tense afternoon.” I could imagine.My sister’s lack of interest in Mum’s analytics is so violent that she has placed restrictions on how much Strava chat she’ll tolerate (three minutes before she hangs up). I try to be more encouraging, and even joined Mum on a run as she trained for her latest Ironman. I managed 8k, prompting frenzied claims from her that I could probably run a marathon if I trained really hard. Perhaps I could, but what would be the long game? A plastic medal and a JustGiving page to make my colleagues hate me?Maybe my problem is that a lifetime surrounded by Lycra has rendered sporting achievements unremarkable – encouraging the mistaken belief that I could probably run 100 miles over the Himalayas, too, if only I weren’t so well-balanced. The only sportsperson I’ve ever truly admired is the Olympic figure skater Adam Rippon, and that’s mostly because of a competition where he refused to skate and instead lip-synched to his own heavily Auto-Tuned version of a Rihanna song. Don’t try and tell me that’s less iconic than traditional sporting achievements such as running fast or jumping high.That’s not to say I never exercise. I’ve been known to slutdrop to Little Mix for upwards of five hours at a time, and I cycle to work, inspiring one editor to remark (quite unkindly) that she’d seen me “wobbling along the canal”. Once a year, when I go home for Christmas, I do a day of gym classes with my mum as a kind of annual MOT if I don’t die, I consider myself to have passed.I briefly abandoned this homeopathic approach to physical activity in 2017, when a stranger at a house party prodded my belly and told me to “suck it in”. After I’d disposed of his body, I embarked on one of those 12-week transformations that you see advertised on the bus. When the trainer asked me my fitness goal, I said it was to look like Tom Daley, but aged 13, because I wanted to manage expectations. For the next three months I subsisted on dry chicken and rice cakes, going to the gym every evening and dreaming of Minstrels every night. By the second month I was so immune to discomfort that I dislocated my shoulder while using a dumbbell and popped it back into the socket myself. In my protein shake-addled mind I’d become He-Man, minus the Anna Wintour bob.For someone who sits at a desk all day, it felt good to challenge myself in a way that wasn’t seeing how many packets of crisps I could eat during a single episode of Love Island Australia. But when the 12 weeks ended, I immediately degenerated into my old ways. Exercising every day hadn’t given me more energy, or filled me with endorphins, or made me look like Brad Pitt in Fight Club – it had just driven me dangerously close to becoming the kind of person who posts changing room selfies. Faced with such a sobering prospect, I gave up. Perhaps my mistake was being motivated by vanity alone, whereas my mum is driven by a higher cause: her own immortality.This year she turned 65, moving her up an age category at events, and so increasing her chances of winning competitions. “It feels like a landmark age,” she told me, “and rather than be defined as someone old, I want to be defined as someone who wins medals.” She’s never been massively tactful (on my boyfriend: “You’re better-looking, but he’s a nicer person”), and in recent years I’ve watched her grow increasingly frustrated with some of her peers. “They’re boring,” she complains whenever she meets someone new. “All they want to talk about is their ailments.” These days, she prefers going on group holidays where the average person is 20 years younger, and upending their expectations of what a grandmother on a bike looks like. In the end, perhaps we’re both motivated by the same spirit of rebellion. As a pensioner, Mum isn’t expected to be hitting the gym five times a week. As a young-ish gay man, I emphatically am.Watching her compete, I feel proud. But also grateful to have been spared whichever gene compels you to snorkel in a bog.• If you would like a\u0026nbspcomment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine’s letters page in print, please email\u0026nbspweekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/50df3a072aafc308373cd9c7bb03a5c2e61b8e68/0_137_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=47597a9dc45c615a25ac0f4a0324dde5","title":"abomination dup opera belfast arlene foster drag queen gay cake","story":"Inspired by remarks made by a unionist MP, an incendiary opera is about to unleash gay cake and drag on Belfast. Will Arlene Foster be in the front row? We meet its creatorThe Newtownards Road in the heart of Protestant, unionist east Belfast is the unlikely setting for rehearsals of Abomination: A DUP Opera, the incendiary work that will open the Outburst Queer arts festival in the city next month. The building is surrounded by murals recording the unionist struggle there is a memorial to Ulster Defence Association volunteers nearby, and union jacks adorn many houses and lamp-posts. Yet here, in the heartland of the Democratic Unionist party, composer Conor Mitchell is hatching an opera that dramatises an incident that showed the socially conservative, Christian evangelical party at its most bigoted.That incident was a phone interview in June 2008 in which Radio Ulster presenter Stephen Nolan talked to Iris Robinson, then a DUP MP and wife of Northern Ireland’s first minister, Peter Robinson. In the interview, which came soon after a homophobic assault on a gay man in Newtownabbey, north of Belfast, Robinson branded homosexuality an “abomination”.Mitchell has used a verbatim account of that lengthy and hugely controversial phone conversation, together with other DUP statements attacking homosexuality over the last 40 years, to create the libretto of an hour-long opera that arrives in Belfast at the most sensitive of moments. As well as the DUP being the pivotal player in the battle over Brexit, same-sex marriage and abortion today are reaching a key stage on the road to legalisation in Northern Ireland. In theory, the failure of the Stormont assembly to reconvene means that, following legislation at Westminster earlier this year, both will now automatically be legalised early in 2020, though gay and women’s rights activists still expect there to be efforts to block liberalisation.The festival’s artistic director, Ruth McCarthy, insists the opera, parts of which were tried out at last year’s festival, wasn’t chosen to coincide with these historic events: “We wish we were that organised!” The Brexit and same-sex marriage deadlines had not been fixed, she says, when the festival was planned."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd4294fc58cf133351c77c9bd347f3734a4268fc/0_67_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cfbee35f3b4a0327ceb3a3e10531568e","title":"amazon music festival intersect prizes commerce over culture it must be resisted","story":"Amazon has announced a Las Vegas music festival called Intersect. Like so many other branded events today, it exists only to exploit artists and audiencesFirst it was books, then it was the Kindle. It was DVD box sets, then it was making the shows themselves. It was CDs, then it was streaming, and now, a music festival.The next step in Amazon’s iterative takeover of western culture has been announced for December in Las Vegas: Intersect, a two-day festival featuring acts including Foo Fighters, Beck, Kacey Musgraves and Anderson .Paak. It also promises a “postapocalyptic dodgeball stadium,” a “mega-sized ball pit with over 200,000 balls”, visual art installations, and games including one where you try to mash buttons at high speed. The latter is the perfect symbol for the enterprise: one that values immediate sensory thrills over deep cultural engagement, and which tries to press every pop-cultural button as hard and fast as it can in an attempt to succeed.The lineup faces firmly towards the millennials and Gen Z hipsters that Amazon so need to ensure ongoing relevance: leftfield black talent such as Flying Lotus, HER, Thundercat and Jpegmafia new indie stars like Japanese Breakfast, Snail Mail and Miya Folick dance tracks from Jamie xx, Max Cooper and Gesaffelstein. The Black Madonna, another of the DJs booked to play, has reacted with horror at the festival announcement, saying that Amazon’s name was not mentioned on the paperwork she signed.This is nothing new. Music is the most cheap and easily available cultural form of all, accessible via streaming, radio, YouTube and elsewhere. Compared with film, TV, literature or anything on stage, it is also the cheapest and easiest to make, as grassroots scenes from blues to UK drill attest. So music has an immediacy and authenticity to it that is absolute catnip for brands, who long for such qualities in their own advertising – the simplest way to access it is to simply shackle themselves to the music.Red Bull is the master of the craft, nurturing musicians in its Red Bull Music Academy and publishing music journalism – before it switched tack to its own festival held in London last month headlined by Aphex Twin. Savvier still is Boiler Room, the live-streaming, brand-supported dance music site who have started their own music festival but also their own advertising agency, leveraging the cool – and the data-led audience insights – they have earned over the last decade to sell back to brands. The two other big names in streaming, Spotify and Apple, have their own music events: the former’s Who We Be festival returns for a third year in November, while the latter has replaced its Apple Music festival with its Up Next Live concert series.Other music festivals may not be run by brands or advertising agencies, but they feel that way. Over the last two years it has been a strange and ghastly experience walking through London’s All Points East festival (whose branding aesthetic is echoed by Amazon’s Intersect), where the brilliance of the artists – Björk, Nick Cave, etc – is dulled by vast walk-in advertising experiences for Jägermeister, Samsung, Tinder and others.This co-opting of musical space by branding has become so normalised that the head of one hip independent London music company told me that its audience see them as more, not less legitimate if they do brand partnerships. A PR for Red Bull recently assured me, regarding coverage of one of its events, that “this is not a sponsoredbranded event, the event is produced and owned by Red Bull”, as if it was a Medici-style cultural patron rather than an energy drink brand.But we should rail against this normalisation. To walk through a music festival that only exists because of a branding imperative is one of the most spiritually bereft experiences in cultural life. It’s almost worth going to them just to get the bracing sense of music being played for its own sake at others: the bucolic idyll of Green Man and End of the Road, or Glastonbury, where the only branding you see – beyond the glorious font of alcoholic glucose that is the Brothers cider bus – is for Oxfam, Greenpeace and WaterAid.I just returned from Poland’s Unsound festival, one of Europe’s best. Aside from some unobtrusive sponsorship from Brooklyn Brewery at the closing party, the festival is funded via a variety of European and Polish bodies – it essentially insulates people from commerce for a week by deploying public funds. To me this is such an important psychic state: to not feel hectored to consume, as you do at so many branded festivals. Arts funding has an important role to play in clearing that space.Unsound’s truly global lineup – from Kazakhstan to west Africa – meanwhile is not mere clout-mining or box-ticking in the manner of Intersect, but rather a product of true artistic passion and a desire for profound cultural conversation. Sure enough, it was only here or the likes of Glastonbury, rather than in the repugnant branded spaces of other festivals, that I could really lose my mind – or, as Intersect festival hopes for itself in perfect brand-speak, “create new paths of expression and new ways to engage your senses”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ce274e2850bd908bf9819d3f6346cd7ef2d9f41/89_0_3285_1971/master/3285.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=064f423f4995e462705b014d0bb24cdc","title":"how tv music supervisors boost new artists","story":"Streaming services are pouring money into finding the right tracks for their shows – and sometimes, obscure is bestThe influx of money from streaming services such as Amazon Prime, Netflix and Apple TV into music supervision and licensing has helped to compensate artists for falling record sales, according to one of the sector’s most prominent figures.Music supervisors used to be a rarely mentioned role, but the investment in TV from streaming platforms has made having impeccable music supervision another vital element in a standout series. “Some people think supervision is like fantasy football for music,” says Zach Cowie, one of the new breed of music supervisors. “But there is a lot of stuff you need to know beyond just selecting good music.”Cowie – who worked at record labels and toured with Animal Collective and Fleet Foxes before becoming a DJ and moving into music supervision – has worked on Netflix’s Master of None, Amazon’s Forever, Kirsten Dunst’s series On Becoming a God in Central Florida, and Apple’s forthcoming anthology show Little America.Cowie says his work on a show should ideally start when the scripts are still being written, rather than in the editing room, where a supervisor attempts to find, match and license a song for a scene that was shot weeks ago. For Master of None, which was Cowie’s first music supervision project for Netflix, he worked with showrunners Alan Yang and Aziz Ansari to pick songs, which were then written into scenes. “We can pre-clear the track and shoot to the song, rather than doing it in the edit,” says Cowie. “The nightmare is finding something that everyone gets attached to and then not getting the clearance.”Jen Malone, a music supervisor on Atlanta and Euphoria, the HBO and Sky Atlantic teen drama about a dysfunctional American town, found tracks for Euphoria by screengrabbing songs people shared on Instagram. “Whenever I have downtime, I take out my phone and I go through all of the screenshots and listen to the music,” she told the Fader. “And if it’s good for Euphoria, it’ll go in the Euphoria bin. If it’s good for one of my other shows, I’ll throw it in there.”Cowie’s holistic approach is unusual, with supervisors often spending hours in editing bays ensuring songs fit and more time securing licensing. Thomas Golubić, a veteran supervisor who is president of the Guild of Music Supervisors and best known for his work with Vince Gilligan on Breaking Bad, describes supervisors as the “Swiss army knives of post-production”. “We have many different roles and sometimes nobody ever needs to take the screwdriver out,” Golubić told Red Bull Music Academy earlier this year. “Sometimes you just need the saw and a pair of scissors.”The role of music supervision has started to be recognised within the music industry. Last year’s Grammys was the first in which music supervisors were eligible to win in the compilation soundtrack album category, a step Golubić described as “long overdue”.Cowie can’t discuss exact figures for song licensing, but says that artists fall roughly into four groups. The most expensive music to secure is on a major label, followed by what Cowie calls the “major indies”. Then there are the “indy indies”, which cost a bit less, and then artist-owned music, which is generally the cheapest to secure.“As everyone knows, you don’t make shit from streaming, record sales are down and you have to be at a certain level to make any money from music,” he says. “But the right commercial or show can finance your next project. I like being in that Robin Hood position.” Cowie sees the role as being a way to support more obscure artists, and insists licensing budgets are at a certain level before he will even begin to talk to a studio about a project.But picking obscure tracks can cause problems. Cowie decided to used hard-to-clear Italo Disco tracks such as Pino d’Angio’s Okay Okay in an episode of Master of None’s second season. “The number-one source of drama in my job is getting someone attached to something we can’t keep,” says Cowie. “There’s this phenomenon called ‘temp love’ where you cut a scene with a track, everyone loves it and you figure out you can’t keep it, and no one will ever be happy with anything else.”But there is a practical benefit to finding more obscure songs to include, too. “At a certain point some of these songs are going to run out of emotional steam because they’ve been attached to so many things. The right unknown song, in the right scene, can do so much for your story.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd67411371a9a294fd623e369476d85222ea87b5/0_332_5592_3356/master/5592.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=98dd06efe01e9af0590fde47a87e7de8","title":"on the frontline as us troops leave northern syria","story":"Martin Chulov, who covers the Middle East for the , has spent the past week on the frontline of north-east Syria.

There shall be no delay unless there are major changes.”The Irish taoiseach Leo Varadkar also sought to scotch talk of an extension, pointing out any decision would have to be approved unanimously by all 27 EU leaders: “I don’t think any MP voting tomorrow should make the assumption that there would be unanimity for an extension.”Despite the comments, which echoed those of the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, on Thursday, the privately stated position of Angela Merkel is seen in Brussels as closer to the reality of the leaders’ thinking.During a discussion on Thursday, the German chancellor told EU leaders that a Brexit extension would be unavoidable if British MPs vote down the new deal.She advised her fellow heads of state and government they could not pretend an extension would not be offered to the UK if it was requested, according to a source familiar with the discussions.Merkel framed Brexit as a historic issue weighing on the EU and said leaders had a responsibility not to push the UK out without a deal if there was a request for further delay.The intervention by Macron and Juncker, who sought to “rule out” an extension as he arrived at the summit on Thursday, expose the desire among the EU27 to move the Brexit talks on after two arduous years of negotiation.In his press conference on Friday, Macron went on to say that Johnson had started out with unacceptable proposals but had then “got into the complexity” of the issue.He said: “He is who he is, but I think he is a real leader with real strategic thoughts and those who do not take him seriously are wrong and will continue to be wrong”.Merkel’s comments were made on Thursday, shortly before EU leaders announced their unanimous backing for the new deal with Johnson.She told Johnson not to tell the British public that EU leaders had ruled out an extension. While EU leaders are anxious for the Brexit deal to pass, they do not wish to be drawn into the vortex of British politics.The new Brexit deal is essentially the old\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspdeal with a new chapter on the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland and a few key tweaks to the political declaration. Here is a\u0026nbsplink to the full text.The backstop has essentially been replaced by a full stop whereby Northern Ireland remains aligned to the EU from the end of the transition period for at least four years. A change can only happen if it is voted on by the Stormont assembly.Stormont will have a key role in future Brexit arrangements. And if there is cross-community support to remain aligned to the EU rather than the UK the consent will hold for eight years.The arrangements in this deal will automatically kick in for a mandated four years if there is a breakdown in trade talks, so it remains a “backstop” but with a permanent tinge.That four-year period will start at the end of December 2020.Two months before the end of the four-year period, that is October 2024, Stormont will be asked to vote on whether to remain aligned to the EU in ways outlined by this deal or not.Under the deal, the UK and the EU are “underlining their firm commitment to no customs and regulatory checks or controls and related physical infrastructure at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland”.The EU and the UK will aim for a zero-tariff deal with unlimited quotas. The entire UK, including Northern Ireland, will be free to sign trade deals. The line in the political declaration that “the United Kingdom will consider aligning with union rules in relevant areas” in any future trade talks has been ditched.Northern Ireland will remain legally in the UK customs territory but practically in the EU customs unions. There will therefore be no customs checks on the border but tariffs will be payable on certain commercial goods.No customs duties will be payable on “personal property” being transited from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. That protects online shopping and all items bought for personal rather than commercial use.Customs duties will be payable on goods imported from the UK for commercial use unless it can be demonstrated that the goods remain in Northern Ireland or are for personal use, as above.A system of rebates will allow importers to be reimbursed.The commitment to frictionless trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain is restated.EU law on VAT will apply in Northern Ireland.The island of Ireland is considering a single market for electricity so homes in Northern Ireland can get their energy from a supplier in Northern Ireland or the republic. There were fears this could be disrupted by Brexit. Under the Johnson deal, the provisions of union law remain so nothing will change.This guarantees that the UK will remain in line with EU conventions on climate, environment and workers rights in a future trade agreement.During a 25-minute meeting with EU leaders, Johnson expressed confidence he could get a majority for his Brexit deal in a rare Saturday sitting of the Commons.Thanking the EU for the deal, the prime minister made a short, upbeat statement in which he referred to his school days in Brussels. Johnson attended the European school in Uccle, which educates the children of EU officials.Johnson also touched on the UK’s long relationship with Europe, suggesting Britain had never been truly European but always half in, half out. It was a businesslike meeting that made some think of the unemotional signing of orce papers.Once he had left the room, EU leaders discussed how to respond to any rejection of the deal by the Commons. Some EU leaders, such as Luxembourg’s Xavier Bettel and Malta’s Joseph Muscat, voiced frustration at the idea of another extension.Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, agreed with Merkel. He later told journalists he would consult EU leaders if there was a request for an extension. But he did not organise a detailed discussion on extension.“We have not been focusing on the question today, if or when,” Merkel said. “It’s a free decision to be taken by the British parliament.”With the vote in the Commons on a knife edge, EU leaders are also thinking about the future relationship with the UK. Merkel said the EU now had a clearer idea of the kind of future relationship the UK was seeking, in contrast to the picture sketched out by Theresa May.Merkel, who has recently described the UK as a “potential competitor”, said it was clear the UK would be a “third country”, ie completely outside the EU’s economic system, “and we will quickly begin negotiating a free-trade agreement with that third country, Great Britain”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6440064d9388981a7a7532fb231dc7cfebb7b8dd/0_105_4232_2539/master/4232.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c588ee619aa0060f9bfe37a74528b43e","title":"labour accused skewing candidate longlist selections","story":"Members say longlists made by NEC in case of snap election are skewed and undemocraticLabour members and councillors across the country have accused the party of skewing the selection of candidates in safe seats where the incumbent MP is retiring or has resigned.More than 30 Labour seats have been up for grabs for the next election, significantly more than the 13 that were vacated before the 2017 vote.Activists have complained that longlists drawn up by the party’s ruling national executive committee (NEC) under a fast-track process to prepare Labour for an election are designed to increase the chances of success for favoured candidates.Members in Ealing North in London are among those to have written to the Labour party’s general secretary, Jennie Formby, to register their dismay at the longlists produced for their constituencies.A Labour member in the Ealing North constituency, which has been represented by Stephen Pound since 1997, said the longlist had managed to enrage both the right and the left of the party. “Jeremy Corbyn promised a new era of people’s democracy and respecting members. But this is like control-freakery of the Blair era,” they said.About 17 Labour MPs have announced they will not stand again, with at least another four resigning after being suspended. A further 10 resigned in order to stand for different parties or as independents, citing the party’s Brexit position and approach to antisemitism allegations. Many decided to resign under the threat of deselection by their local parties.This month the NEC agreed on a fast-tracked selection process for new candidates in order to ensure they were in place in the event of a snap general election.The new process took the responsibility for drawing up a longlist of candidates out of the hands of local parties and gave it to the NEC. Shortlists are finalised by a panel comprising NEC, regional board and local party representatives before they are put to local members.Members in Coventry North West, which has been represented by Geoffrey Robinson since 1976, held an emergency meeting on Wednesday night after a longlist of candidates was leaked to a local journalist and included no local councillors. About 50 people attended.Robinson has submitted a formal complaint to the party about the “shambolic and underhand nature” of the selection process, while Coventry Momentum tweeted: “Local candidates in #Coventry need to be selected by local members. We do not want a list of candidates imposed on us, this is not what democracy looks like.”Chris Jones, the chair of the constituency party, said: “It seems to me that they are trying to skew the longlist so it becomes inevitable that certain favourites are chosen.”Damian Gannon, a local member, said: “This isn’t about left and right, it’s about central control and local democracy. We know that all leaderships have done stuff like this in the past, but they’ve only done it in one or two seats at a time. Now they’re trying to do it in a load of seats across the country.”There are similar complaints from members in Enfield North, which is currently represented by Joan Ryan, who left the Labour party in February to join the Independent Group for Change. Ed Poole, the vice-chair of membership in the constituency party, said it had been clear that members wanted local Corbyn-supporting candidates on the long list, but there were none.“The candidate with the highest number of endorsements from nominations hasn’t been longlisted,” he said. “I got nominated by the biggest ward, so was arguably third out of 61 candidates. I’m not longlisted.“We certainly don’t feel the membership has been reflected at all in this process. We were supposed to have membership democracy. We were supposed to have grassroots movement. We were supposed to have more and more say.”He added: “It looks like having friends in high places is useful and having the support of local members is not.”An NEC source said the party had been flooded with applications when the selections opened. “There are so many excellent candidates to choose from, forcing us to make really tough decisions,” they said. “So we’ve longlisted the candidates with the best applications. It’s as simple as that.”A Labour source said: “The purpose of longlists is to narrow the field, so clearly not everyone can be on that list. These are hotly contested seats with many high-quality applications and of course unsuccessful candidates will be disappointed.”A party spokesperson said: “These fast-tracked selection processes are the only way to ensure democratic selections in such a short space of time. Members will democratically select their candidates with local members on the shortlisting panels.“An election could be round the corner, so we are moving quickly to make sure we have candidates and campaigns ready to go to defeat the Tories so we can end austerity and transform society.”Additional reporting by Martha Brennan."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1dbb5f126815751176cc12e132556d61a47e7680/0_228_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=79227817223d3d37acb0f5ad1f688af1","title":"labours melanie onn declares intention to vote for brexit deal","story":"MP for Grimsby asks colleagues to back plan in an article with Tory Victoria PrentisMelanie Onn has become the latest Labour MP to declare she is prepared to vote for Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal despite intense pressure to oppose it.Onn, who represents the leave-voting seat of Grimsby, has written an article for the  with the Conservative MP Victoria Prentis urging colleagues to “use this unique chance to help us move on and get back to helping our constituents”.They wrote: “The risk of letting this final shot at a deal slip through our fingers is too great. Our collective hope rests on brave Labour MPs, and indeed others, who can see that.”Onn, who comes from a working-class background and grew up in Grimsby, was considered a rising star in the party before she resigned from a frontbench role in March in protest at Labour’s support for a second referendum.The Democratic Unionist party opposes Johnson’s deal and is encouraging Conservative MPs to vote against it, meaning the prime minister is likely to need to win over more Labour MPs than the handful of ardent Brexiters who supported Theresa May’s deal.The Labour leadership have said Johnson’s deal shifts the “level playing field” pledges on workers’ rights and environmental standards from the legally binding withdrawal agreement to the political declaration. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said on Friday he did not expect more than a few Labour MPs to be won over.He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “I don’t believe there are Labour MPs out there who will not think through the detail of this deal and then, when they see the impact – particularly on environmental, consumers’ and workers’ rights – will vote for it.”Among the Labour MPs who have said they will vote for the deal are Jim Fitzpatrick, who represents Poplar and Limehouse in London, and Ronnie Campbell, the MP for Blyth Valley in the north-east.Asked about Campbell’s views, McDonnell said: “I’m going to have a chat with Ronnie because he is a good socialist and all his life he has fought alongside me to protect trade union rights and develop trade union rights.“On this one I’m going to have a chat with him and point out to him: please do not give this power to Boris Johnson, because you know what he’ll do. He’ll undermine trade union rights. Boris Johnson and those Tory MPs that populate the cabinet, these are the extreme right who have attacked trade unions throughout their political careers.”He added: “No MP, as far as I’m concerned, who has the true interest of their constituents at heart can allow that to happen.”Several more Labour MPs who in the past have expressed their preference for a Brexit deal over a second referendum will continue considering their decision overnight.One said colleagues were finding the decision very difficult, with more than one in tears at a recent meeting. They suggested trades unions were ringing round MPs saying they would not receive financial support in future if they voted with the government.Many of the “MPs for a deal” group, which includes Onn and Prentis, are likely to support the Letwin amendment, which effectively delays the final decision. They would then hope to amend the withdrawal agreement, potentially to allow more reassurances on workers’ rights and other issues.Jon Lansman, the chair of pro-Jeremy Corbyn campaign group Momentum, suggested the party’s ruling national executive committee could replace Labour MPs who defied the whip.Corbyn himself has hinted he is minded to take a gentler approach, saying: “I believe in the power of persuasion rather than the power of threat.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d5c3dd3a118c354d7989642f2a6b5108924d82fd/242_0_3258_1956/master/3258.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=059c634725d0dbd693b828f91843ef30","title":"nasa all female spacewalk christina koch jessica meir","story":"Christina Koch and Jessica Meir leave International Space Station to replace faulty deviceTwo Nasa astronauts have embarked on the first all-female space walk in a historic first.Christina Koch and Jessica Meir floated feet-first out of the International Space Station’s (ISS) Quest airlock on Friday lunchtime UK time, tasked with replacing a failed power control unit.The spacewalk, known as an extra-vehicular activity (EVA) in astronaut jargon, took place seven months after the original planned date for an all-female outing, which had to be scrapped because the ISS had only one medium-sized spacesuit on board. The agency sent up a second medium spacesuit in October.“I think it’s important because of the historical nature of what we’re doing,” Koch said ahead of the spacewalk. “In the past, women haven’t always been at the table. It’s wonderful to be contributing to the space program at a time when all contributions are being accepted, when everyone has a role. That can lead in turn to increased chance for success.”Koch, who has been on the ISS since March, was first out the hatch, followed by Meir, carrying a tool bag. During the five-and-a-half-hour spacewalk, the astronauts remained attached to handrails on the exterior of the ISS using harnesses and pairs of metal carabiners. These are sequentially clipped and unclipped to ensure that the astronauts cannot float off into space.Video footage from the astronauts’ helmet cameras, as they dangled 260 miles above Earth, provided a live stream of the painstaking operation to carry the new hardware, install it and then return the faulty battery to the airlock for a postmortem back on Earth into why it failed.Tracy Caldwell Dyson, a Nasa astronaut who completed three spacewalks as part of the Expedition 24 crew on the ISS in 2010, said: “This is significant … As much as it’s worth celebrating, many of us are looking forward to it just being normal.”During the spacewalk, the coordinator on the ground was Stephanie Wilson, also an astronaut.Koch, 40, is due to remain on the ISS until February, bringing her total time in space to 328 days, the longest single spaceflight by a woman and just short of Scott Kelly’s 340-day record. Researchers are collecting extensive biomedical data on the impact of spaceflight on Koch’s body.The majority of data available is on male astronauts, but there is some evidence that there are sex differences in responses to a space environment. One study found that women are more likely than men to experience faintness as a result of “orthostatic hypotension”, a cardiovascular issue. Men appear more prone to vision changes caused by spaceflight associated neuro-ocular syndrome (Sans).Previously, 14 women and 213 men have carried out spacewalks. The first woman was the Russian cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya, who went outside the USSR’s Salyut 7 space station in 1984.On Tuesday, Nasa unveiled the prototype for a new spacesuit that could be worn by the next crew, expected to include a woman, to land on the moon. The suit is designed to give a customised fit to the inidual astronaut, whatever their shape or size."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/25b70eb7ed21491c817acda27297e8ed733c30df/0_156_1116_670/master/1116.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bddcf2cd7a05b9d45e2300272393ec7c","title":"chess magnus carlsen among nine closely bunched leaders at isle of man","story":"Four rounds from the end of the $430,000 FideChess Isle of Man event, chances of a bunch finish were growing as just half a point covered the leading nine contenders, among them the world champion, Magnus Carlsen, and the world No 2, Fabiano Caruana.Top pairings for round eight (of 11) starting on Friday were Caruana (US) v Levon Aronian (Armenia), and Wang Hao (China) v Carlsen (Norway). Caruana and Aronian were joint leaders on 5.57, followed by Carlsen and Wang Hao among the seven players on 57. Games are live and free to watch online, with expert and computer commentaries plus player interviews.Carlsen and Caruana, who competed for the world crown in London last November, have both avoided defeat as a mixture of defensive skills and missed chances by their opponents in time pressure pulled them through.The champion had the luckier escape when his careless Sicilian allowed Vladislav Kovalev from Belarus a crushing central advantage with a passed d6 pawn supported by Qd5 and Ne4. How did Carlsen react to such a horrible position ?“He reached for the rook, and then I saw oh, oh, Rae 1. He took a couple more minutes before he actually made the move and I am sitting there thinking. I have 1.30 on the clock and I am completely lost. I mean how can you be so dumb? Afterwards there were so many good continuations for him but he probably got nervous. Then he got low on time and then anything can happen.”Resilient Carlsen got away with it and that seemed to spark his creative juices and a return to peak form. His next two wins were stylish and elegant, his confidence boosted because he had already defeated Surya Ganguly and Alexey Shirov as a teenager.After Thursday’s seventh round Carlsen’s unbeaten streak reached 97 games, surpassing Mikhail Tal’s 95 in 1973-74 and closing in on Ding Liren’s record of 100 against high-level opponents. The record will fall in the 11th and final Isle of Man round on Monday if he continues to avoid defeat.“For sure, I’m thinking about it” Carlsen said. “It’s been so many games that you cannot help to want to get that record, but from the way I’m playing it doesn’t seem that it’s what I care about. Over this streak I’ve shown very good resilience in defence, but I’ve been lucky. My opponents have missed some pretty easy wins.”Caruana’s great escape came against Luke McShane in the fifth round. McShane drew his first game, then he followed up with three excellent wins from which his smooth victory over India’s Baskaran Adhiban was the pick.The Englishman, whose main career has been in the City and is often called the world’s strongest amateur, had a chance to become the clear leader on 4.55. He had a large advantage and missed several wins ranging from clear to complex, including the one in this week’s puzzle.It would be stretching the story to say that with a clear lead McShane at age 35 could have gone on to qualify for the 2020 candidates, but the missed opportunities were a defining moment for his tournament. A loss to Wang Hao and a draw with Kovalev followed.Levon Aronian is one of the greatest players, with an impressive career record and a fearless and imaginative style, but the Armenian has failed in four candidates tournaments. At 37, qualifying from Douglas to the 2020 candidates is his last realistic chance. He began slowly with two draws, then surged with 4.55 and is in pole position for the final four rounds.3641 1 Nc1! wins at least another piece (1...Qg2+ leaving White a rook up) since Caruana’s black queen has no reasonable way to maintain guard against Qh5+ and Qxe8+. Take credit if you chose 1 Rf7 Bc3 2 Rf2, which is also strong. Even McShane’s choice of 1 Nxb4 still leads to a win, but 1 Nc1! would probably have induced Caruana to resign."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c9b223255ff0d1524166b1183075ad67323376b9/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3a0d917b448bc62af204e3d097c97c4a","title":"no quarter given rugby world up quarter finals","story":"The tournament has won millions of new fans in Japan and the onus is on the sport to keep them interested by providing a worthy spectacle in the quarter-finalsA storm blew into the sleepy little city of Oita on Friday morning. It brought thunder, lightning and tens of thousands of rugby fans from England, Australia, France and Wales. They found each other under the awnings around the central station, where they sang songs about Delilah and Matilda and all the unseemly things that went on in a Chicago department store, while the locals scurried by and sheltered inside. The World Cup has been running for a month already, but really, it is only just getting started. This weekend the eight best teams in the world square off and they all have a shot at winning to reach the semi-finals.The tens of thousands will be joined by tens of millions at kick-off. Half of Japan watched their team play Scotland on TV last Sunday, twice as many as watched their opening match against Russia. So whatever happens when they play South Africa in Tokyo on Sunday evening, the landscape of the game has changed in the past four weeks. The horizon is broader now. There are reams of saccharine quotes we could use, from one of those spurious online collections of inspirational sayings, all about how the point of travel is to learn about yourself as much as it is to visit somewhere else.Suffice to say rugby is discovering some good things about itself on this particular trip, that it can expand beyond its old heartlands and win over millions of new viewers. The Japanese even have a phrase for it: niwaka fans. Newcomers, bandwagon jumpers. Well hop on. And do not worry, the lyrics come easier than the laws, and are twice as much fun when you have learned them.It helps that Japan are winning. But it is true, too, that there is something there, at the heart of the game, that has drawn this audience to it. The superhuman speed, skill and ferocity, yes, but also its values too. Little things, such as the way the players have made a point of bowing to the crowd, and big ones, such as the footage of the Canadian team going out in the streets to help shovel up muck when the biggest game of their World Cup, against Namibia, had been cancelled because of Typhoon Hagibis. That stuff matters in a country where manners do too.They are values that some of the people running the game maybe need to be reminded of themselves. The only time they seem to pay them any mind is when they are reckoning what they can sell them for. There was a sighting of rugby’s old, narrow-minded parochialism in the petty squabble that blew up last weekend when the men in button-down shirts were busy bickering about which union had stitched up who while matches were being cancelled because the host country was dealing with the worst typhoon since the 1950s. If this World Cup has given us a glimpse of what the game could be, it has shown us, too, some of what is holding it back.You can also see that in the way some of the leading countries are all too happy to take from the Pacific Islands without giving anything worthwhile in return. And the way they, and the other emerging nations, struggle to get the fixtures they need against those top teams. And you have to guess that it is right there in the boardrooms where the English clubs and European countries are doing deals with CVC Capital, a vampire squid of a company who were accused of “raping the sport” after they got involved with F1. So yes, it is a good moment for rugby to show us its heart and soul.It starts on Saturday, when England play Australia. Eddie Jones compared the World Cup to a game of poker. Well, let’s see what he has got in his hand. He has spent four years getting the team ready for this, winnowing the best of English rugby, nasty, brutish and fast, from the worst, dull, lumpen and unimaginative. We are about to find out if it worked. Australia are a dangerous team to run into. Their coach, Michael Cheika, has been keeping his cards close to his chest. But he, and a couple of Australia’s best-ever players – Will Genia and David Pocock – know this could be the last game they play. They do not need another reason to want to beat England, but they have a few right there.Then in Tokyo, it is Ireland against the All Blacks, which would once have been a mismatch. Ireland had not beaten New Zealand in more than a hundred years of trying, now they have done it twice in three matches, which is one reason why no one really knows whether this is another good New Zealand team or whether it could become a great one. And if it seems as if Ireland have taken a step backwards since their famous victory against the All Blacks in Dublin, they still have Johnny Sexton, the world player of the year and a man who is not fooling around. He has played 147 minutes out of 320 in this World Cup, and Ireland are 78-8 up with him, 19-43 without.Wales play France on Sunday. Wales are being stretched pretty thin, but they have a coach, Warren Gatland and, a captain, Alun Wyn Jones, who know how to win. They have learned it across three Lions tours together, not to mention all those Six Nations’ grand slams. They have been impressively self-possessed, even though a scandal cost them their attack coach. They know exactly what they are about, whereas the French are still figuring it out. But they have a brilliantly bright bunch of young players, and finally have a coach, Fabien Galthié, who seems to have got them playing in their own inimitable way, even if he is still officially Jacques Brunel’s assistant.Then to cap it all off, Japan v South Africa, a rematch of the startling game at Brighton in 2015, when the rugby world first started to turn upside down. This South Africa team, shaped by Rassie Erasmus, steered by Siya Kolisi, sparked by Cheslin Kolbe, is better than the one who lost there. But Japan have improved exponentially too and, after the way they played in a 30-minute stretch against Scotland when they seemed untouchable, no one is sure what they may be capable of. Least of all the 60 million new fans, who know only that their team has won four Tests in a row.It is all unknown, like so much else about where the game is heading. But there is some hope, at least, that the game is going to show the best of itself, and that there are better things ahead."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39dc2035acfd731754019ad1d414a1f4b84820a0/1_0_3023_1814/master/3023.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=19a68be1b7301ac6dc19f9c919d8e5a2","title":"rugby world cup 2019 quarter finals ugo monye","story":"Eddie Jones has picked a team with England’s Six Nations win in Dublin in mind. If Jones has a blueprint for precisely how he wants his team to play, that is the closest they have come to it since he took charge.People need to understand that for Jones, selection is about picking the best players to fit the system he wants. England’s biggest strengths in this tournament are their power and their dynamism, so I’m not surprised he has added extra ballast, particularly with Samu Kerevi at No 12 for Australia. He is the epicentre of everything good for the Wallabies and he needs to be paid a huge amount of attention.I’ve loved the soundbites coming out of Australia’s camp this week. They seem very well prepared mentally, they are a brilliant knockout team and that carries so much weight. One of the key areas of the match will be the breakdown and with four fetchers on the field, a lot will rest on how much of a contest the referee, Jérôme Garcès, allows. That also brings tactical kicking into play – Australia kick the least, England among the most, and knowing when to keep the ball and when to try to pin back your opponents will be crucial. I also think England have the edge in the tight five and I am backing them to edge it.If there is one defensive coach I would select to try to beat New Zealand it would be Andy Farrell and the Ireland players will take a huge amount of comfort and positivity from that. He was always a big-match player, with an unbelievable temperament, and he knows how to ready players for the big stage. He did it in New Zealand with the Lions and he’ll be hoping to do it again.Ireland are not the same team they were a year or two ago but they have a one-off performance in them. They’ve got a huge amount of experience but are going to have to play a lot better than they have so far this year and they will have to do it collectively. Ireland will almost welcome being told that they are in decline. Internally they will be telling each other that apparently we’re not good enough. There’s nothing better than proving people wrong.Look at the New Zealand v South Africa match, it was two bad kicks from the Springboks that led to 17 points in no time. That is how deadly they are. New Zealand have been impeccable, They have not really been spoken about, maybe just because we’ve come to expect the level they play at. Ireland either edge this through sheer belligerence, physicality and owning the big moments, or you can see New Zealand putting 30-40 points on them. I can’t look past the All Blacks.The hardest of the four matches to call. If France can play to their full capabilities for the whole 80 minutes it could cause Wales all manner of problems. Wales pride themselves on their physicality and their big-match temperament and Sunday should be no different.The big thing I wonder about them is whether they can score enough tries when push comes to shove. They have the ability but I’m not sure their approach suits them in that regard. All in all, they’ve looked decent so far. But if France start like they did against Argentina and Wales are asked to score two or three tries to win the match, can they do it?Wales are very good at stopping teams gaining momentum. I just would love to see the very best of Wales and the very best of France going at it. When France get momentum, their offloading going, and fluidity in their attack, it just gives them so much energy. My one reservation is whether they can sustain it. They had the game won against Argentina and then almost lost it. It has always been my question of them. If they can sustain it they can be a match for anyone at this tournament but I do not believe Wales will allow them to.Japan, who face South Africa in Sunday’s second quarter-final, are not getting enough credit for the way they have played. If New Zealand had played with the skill, the verve and the pace Japan did against Scotland, with the execution they showed over and over again, we’d be saying that is why they are the best team in the world.There was every reason for them to enjoy the moment afterwards because they created history with the backdrop of what happened the day before. It was an emotional time. I just wonder, have they already had their big match? I appreciate we wondered that after the Ireland match but how many more times can they do it? If they come with that energy, if they hang on to the ball …But I’m not sure South Africa will find the answers Ireland and Scotland could not if Japan have so much possession. South Africa have a wonderful blend of brutal ball carriers and deadly backs, though, and if Handré Pollard is on form I think this will be the end of a wonderful journey for Japan. That means I’ve predicted all four favourites to win this weekend. It’s incredibly hard not to but I think I’ll be proved wrong in at least one of them – I just don’t know which."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e4dc1cbd70dc97ef4884b4672987f8662d4ad20/0_313_2362_1417/master/2362.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d0439d137832e3c427d429085eb64eea","title":"darren harriot funniest things","story":"The standup, Newsjack host and Fighting Talk panel member on the things that make him laugh the mostProbably Taken 3 as it’s absolutely terrible.“Are those your teeth?” ( I have big teeth.)Under the age of about 11, I used to get designs shaved into the back of my head, as all young black boys did back then.

The Libra cryptocurrency project now faces existential threats from world leaders and central bankers worried about its harmful potential: as a vehicle for money laundering, a threat to global financial stability, open to data privacy abuse, dangerous for consumers and stripping nations of the control of their economies by privatising the money supply.Seven high-profile partners in the Facebook-led consortium that is building the digital currency – known as the Libra Association – have quit in dramatic fashion in recent weeks, including PayPal, eBay, Visa and Mastercard, as concerns mount.“One by one they’re starting to drop away. That’s certainly not good news,” said John Sedunov, a professor of finance and expert in cryptocurrencies at Villanova University.“I’m not saying that it’s tearing apart at the seams totally, but we’re starting to inch towards the cliff. The fewer financial firms and fewer mainstream companies in this project, the more it loses credibility,” he added.In the latest blow to the project, the G7 group of the world’s most powerful nations warned on Friday that digital currencies such as Libra “pose challenges for competition and antitrust policies” and should not be allowed to launch until the regulatory concerns are addressed.Mark Zuckerberg is expected to feel the pressure mount further next week when he heads for a grilling at the US House of Representatives over Libra. In the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, he will face sharp questions over data privacy. To add to fears over Facebook’s control of personal information, building a digital currency brings sensitive financial data into its orbit, raising the stakes.“I get the sense that they’ll get hit harder on those areas for Libra. And I don’t think Zuckerberg is the politicians’ favourite person. That comes into play,” said Sedunov.As the problems for Libra mount, comments made this week by the Labour MP Alison McGovern could prove instructive to preview the showdown in Washington: “Isn’t it a legitimate question of policymakers to ask Facebook: ‘Why are you bothering? Why is this for you?’”Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, told McGovern and other MPs on the Commons Treasury committee that Libra should be heavily regulated worldwide “or it’s not going to happen”.“This will not be like social media. This will not be a case where something gets up and starts running and then the system tries to figure out after the fact how it’s going to regulate it,” he said.Threadneedle Street insiders believe Libra was probably planned with too many technologists and too few economists to think about its risks to the world economy. With 2 billion Facebook users, Libra could become systemically important for the global financial system overnight. In a clash of worlds between technology and finance, the fail-fast-and-improve Silicon Valley approach is incompatible with a too-big-to-fail financial project.Dante Disparte, the head of policy and communications for the Libra Association, dismissed the concerns, adding: “We agree that the Libra project should be appropriately regulated, so calls for regulation are not a ‘setback’ or ‘blow’ to the project. Responsible financial innovation and regulatory oversight are not in contest.”However, governments and central banks around the world are worried they could lose control of their monetary policy if significant chunks of activity shift to Libra.Bruno Le Maire, the French finance minister, warned in the Financial Times this week that Libra posed a threat to national sovereignty. He argued that even regulation would not be enough to address the risks posed, “because Libra is asking states to share their monetary sovereignty with private companies”. Le Maire wrote that he “cannot countenance” passing control of a key tool for steering the economy from democratically elected governments and their central banks to a group with explicitly commercial interests.Andrew Milligan, the head of global strategy at the fund manager Aberdeen Standard, said: “With digital money created by corporations, we therefore have to transfer our trust to corporations. That’s different from trusting a traditional bank and the governments that back deposits in them.”Despite the existential threat to its future, Libra still draws support for its potential to revolutionise finance – if it can satisfy central bankers over their concerns.Financial exclusion around the globe could be tackled by a company with Facebook’s presence in developing countries, while the promise of digital currency has potential to cut the cost of notoriously expensive cross-border payments, saving households and businesses money and time.However, with mounting regulatory pressures, the time and cost of building Libra to settle those concerns could quickly spiral. The Bank of England warned earlier this month that Libra would need to meet similar standards to traditional banks. Building a payment system to meet the myriad of bank regulations could rapidly erode the high-tech competitive advantages that would make Libra quicker and cheaper.Teunis Brosens, the lead economist for digital finance regulation at the Dutch bank ING, said: “The financial sector is the most heavily regulated sector of all and I think they underestimated that.”However, big banks have long feared competition from internet giants. And in the shape of Facebook, they have a rival with deep pockets. Brosens added: “It really could go both ways. I find it a bit too easy to say with schadenfreude that Facebook has launched this thing and they fell flat on their face.“They made a big play and now they face a substantial setback. But they can still recover. I don’t expect Facebook to give up this easily.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/947b75cfe9dbfd2ae5e41e894548fdb6f422c6b1/917_0_1364_820/master/1364.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5fe7e6ebc02370919c6cbd9cd95f5262","title":"paris atelier des lumires festival graphic and immersive digital design competition","story":"Atelier des Lumières opens festival dedicated to graphic and immersive digital design, with surreal and exciting results Out of the darkness of the large stone foundry in Paris, Alice in Wonderland emerges. Flitting between the dimly lit woodland which has popped up around us and in search of adventures, Alice is off to explore a succession of surreal worlds as pop music thuds around the venue and it feels like we – gallery visitors – are running through the trees with her. In the distance, the moonlight glistens on the water. The black and white animated short, an adaptation of Lewis Carroll’s Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, is the creation of Cutback, a France-based studio best known for providing musicians such as Johnny Hallyday with graphic screens and backdrops for concerts.But on Friday night, it’s one of 11 artistic collectives from France, Ireland and Turkey competing in Paris’s first Interactive art festival at the Atelier des Lumières in north-east Paris operated by Culturespace, a French museum foundation that specialise in immersive art displays. This year, for its inaugural immersive art festival, the focus is on digital design as a form of artistic expression in its own right. Each evening between 18 and 24 October, the 11 competing teams will put on a four-minute immersive show that will flow around the large space, using techniques that combine video, photography, motion design and specialised sound, immersing audiences in their art. One of the greatest talking points and most frightening parts of the screening was the large monstrous spider wandering alongside me as I leant on a concrete wall. Cokau Lab has created an imaginary planet by photographing real life creatures, including centipedes and tarantulas, using an innovative lighting technique.The focus of this project may be to give the public a chance to experience new artists through innovative technologies, but it also shows how visitors can engage and share art when digital design and interactive experiences are combined on such an ambitious scale.Museum goers can interact and vote on the creations via an app and, combined with a jury, a winner will be announced on October 24 and house an exhibition in the Atelier for six months.This experimental festival opens possibilities to innovation and storytelling in ways I had never previously imagined. It’s possible the museum of the future starts here.• The festival is on in the evenings 18-24 October but tickets (€24) are only available on 23 October.

It has already been spun off into a very good podcast, with the stories read by big-name stars. But Modern Love (Amazon Prime) for television continues the streaming giant’s run of so-so dramas that can’t quite break new ground. This should be a surefire success. It’s A-list and painfully classy, but over eight episodes it only rarely lifts off, and instead settles into an oddly bland, will-this-do middle ground.I expected something along the lines of Easy, another half-hour anthology show about love and relationships. Easy was – well – easy to love, though this is far more wholesome. If Easy is a 4am taxi back to a stranger’s house after a big night out, Modern Love is an afternoon coffee, but just one, because you both have somewhere else you would rather be. Its eight episodes follow lovestruck or lovelorn New Yorkers, and while it is mostly about romantic love, it has a healthy respect for the power of supportive friends and family, too. The first episode is about a doorman’s years-long paternal affection for a woman who lives in the apartment building where he works a later instalment is about a first date that ends up in a trip to the hospital. Episodes are pleasant, if slight, and if you’ve seen any film about finding love in New York from the past 30 years, will feel very familiar.One of the biggest draws is episode three – Take Me As I Am, Whoever I Am– in which Anne Hathaway plays Lexi, a lawyer with bipolar disorder struggling to manage her highs and lows. It is by far the most distinctive of the eight, and views mental illness through an ambitiously theatrical lens. When she is manic, Lexi is a Rita Hayworth-esque bombshell who craves peaches in the middle of the night and charms men in the supermarket into having breakfast with her. When she is low, she can barely get out of bed and can only bring herself to eat muesli. John Carney, who executive produced the series and directs most of the episodes, has turned it into a sort of musical, with My Crazy Ex-Girlfriend flourishes and a joke about La La Land. Strange, then, that it is the stripped back scenes that ring most true: it finds its emotional core in a scene in a diner, with two women deciding simply to become friends. The razzle-dazzle window-dressing feels extraneous, with Hathaway’s performance at its best when it is quietest.There are two episodes that prove exceptions to Modern Love’s mostly saccharine and straightforward worldview, and both have moments of honesty that feel authentic rather than stagey. When Cupid Is a Prying Journalist (I do not recognise this description of journalists) sees Dev Patel play a tech mogul who invented a dating site, while Catherine Keener is a writer sent to profile him. She asks him if he has ever been in love they end up swapping stories about the one who got away. It nails the romance perfectly, in part because they are a great platonic pairing, but also because it allows each story to take a different path. One is fairytale, the other stoic. It is the episode that packs in the elegance you suspect they were reaching for elsewhere, and its finale is a genuine tearjerker.The other standout, Rallying to Keep the Game Alive, adds some much needed vinegar. Written and directed by Sharon Horgan, it stars Tina Fey and John Slattery as a long-married couple with two teenage children who are wondering why they’re still together. They watch a film about penguins, and wonder what the point of long-term love is they go to couples’ therapy, and bicker their way through it, grasping impatiently for some common ground. (A line about whether cooking can be a hobby is the finest in the whole series.) Eventually, they settle on vicious, rule-breaking tennis. It is the least sentimental episode, and by far the best.Though they are based on true essays, the rest of the stories have a peculiar veneer of fantasy to them. As an occasional indulgence, it’s sweet, but over eight episodes, it becomes sickly. That is to say nothing of its insistence on adding to the inexplicably long list of Ed Sheeran cameos out there in the world. Overall, the feeling is one of anecdotes that have been told over and over until they have been smoothed into one familiar shape, losing all of the rough, awkward edges of what actually happened over time. Advice for anyone reading who might be interested in making a series out of the ’s own Blind Date: the one with the house party and the left-behind knickers might have just enough bite."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09f46922dcd1de8c36ec7afa685553e147a34c7d/0_431_5200_3120/master/5200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca83b9f6b4d4ee0140b9692512467404","title":"eu refusal to open talks with albania and north macedonia condemned as historic mistake","story":"Juncker says failure of EU to keep its promises was ‘major historic mistake’Leaders of the EU institutions have condemned the bloc’s refusal to open membership talks with North Macedonia and Albania as a “historic mistake”.In a blow to pro-EU politicians in the small Balkan states, EU government leaders missed a deadline to approve the launch of talks.Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European commission, said it was a “major historic mistake”, adding: “If we want to be respected, we have to keep our promises.”Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, described the impasse as a mistake. “It is not a failure, it is a mistake. I feel really embarrassed,” he told journalists at the end of a two-day summit in Brussels. “Both countries, they passed their exams I can’t say this about our member states.”The French president, Emmanuel Macron, led opposition to opening membership talks with North Macedonia and Albania, putting him at odds with Germany’s Angela Merkel, who has championed the EU hopes of six Balkan states.Denmark and the Netherlands also blocked the decision, although were open to considering the two countries separately. Both opposed opening talks with Albania, but suggested North Macedonia could get a green light by passing a law to safeguard the future of an independent public prosecutor.Balkan states began their long journey to EU membership at a summit in Thessaloniki in 2003 when optimism after the end of the cold war was still high.North Macedonia’s foreign minister, Nikola Dimitrov, suggested the EU was being dishonest. “The least that the European Union owes the region is to be straightforward with us,” he tweeted. “If there is no more consensus on the European future of the western Balkans, if the promise of Thessaloniki 2003 does not stand, the citizens deserve to know.”North Macedonia had been led to believe the path to EU membership would be opened after it resolved a three-decade-long dispute over its name. The former Yugoslav Republic became North Macedonia in February after a historic agreement with Greece, which had blocked Skopje’s Nato and EU ambitions over the dispute.Albania’s prime minister, Edi Rama, said the decision was “linked with an open confrontation within the EU itself”, on its enlargement process. He vowed to continue domestic reforms “not because Paris, Berlin, Brussels or all of them are asking for it, but because it is needed to turn our country into a European, functional one”, Associated Press in Tirana reported.EU leaders had promised in June to take “a clear and substantive decision as soon as possible and no later than October 2019”.Shortly before a ministerial decision was due this week, France announced it wanted to reform the EU’s enlargement process. The last-minute decision was greeted with scepticism by EU diplomats supporting enlargement, who suspected a ruse to delay a decision.The French government has said it supports the “European perspective” of the western Balkan countries, but argues the current process is not credible.Democratic backsliding in Poland and Hungary, fatigue after the Greek eurozone crisis, as well as a widespread view that Romania and Bulgaria were let into the EU too soon, has contributed to doubts about EU expansion in some of the club’s older members."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7cf567659db92ff8e4d4add1cd71b69142469094/0_346_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8c205301a568d72172c3391a2fb6a21e","title":"father family dutch farmhouse cult moonies","story":"Dutch media report that 67-year-old was former member of movement known as MooniesThe father of a family that spent nearly a decade living in a secret room in a Dutch farmhouse once belonged to the Rev Sun Myung Moon’s controversial Unification church and was trying to found a cult of his own, Dutch media have reported.The 67-year-old man, who has not been identified by Dutch police but was named by the movement, often known as the Moonies, as Gerrit-Jan van Dorsten, was arrested on Thursday on suspicion of “depriving people of their liberty, harming the health of others and money laundering”, police said in a statement.They said they were investigating allegations that a “certain belief in faith” lay behind the case. “We have reason to believe the people did not stay on the premises out of free will,” the statement said. “The situation requires a careful approach whereby attention and care is given to the young adults found.”The five young people, who have said they are siblings and are believed to be aged between 18 and 25, were discovered in the hidden room with the man they said was their father after a sixth, supposedly the oldest brother, arrived at a local bar in a state of confusion and told the owner they urgently needed help.The tenant of the farmhouse, a 58-year-old Austrian man identified by the church as Josef Brunner, appeared before an examining magistrate on Thursday on similar charges and was ordered to be detained for two weeks. “We are dealing with an exceptional situation,” the police statement said.The Universal Peace Federation, as the church now calls itself, was founded in 1954 and is famed for its mass weddings. It said in a statement issued in New York that it was “deeply alarmed to hear of the family being held in inhumane conditions on a farmhouse in the Netherlands”.It said it could confirm that Van Dorsten “was briefly a member of our movement in the mid-1980s” but had left in 1987. He was “known to have mental health issues” and his brother had not heard from him for over 30 years, it said, adding that there were no records indicating Brunner had ever been associated with the movement.A local TV station, RTV Drenthe, had earlier reported that the Austrian was a member of the church, which was where the two men had met. The broadcaster also reported that the siblings had been moved from a holiday park where they were taken after other guests had seen them performing cult rituals, such as walking in circles.Three people who say they are also Van Dorsten’s children have come forward to say they left the family eight years ago and had heard no news of the others since. Neighbours told Dutch media they had assumed he had moved to South Korea, where the movement was founded, or died. He did not attend his mother’s funeral, one said.Willem Koetsier, a church member in Amsterdam, told the Algemeen Dagblad newspaper that after van Dorsten had left the movement he had gone to Germany where “we lost sight of him”. He said he believed the father “together with someone else” had since started their own cult.Van Dorsten was was active in the movement in Germany and Austria and later married an Austrian woman, Koetsier told the paper. “I have heard from older members that he was a very spiritual person and set up a group with his family,” he said. “Sometimes people who are spiritual start their own church or movement. I think this is the case with him. It could be that he thought he had a special mission.”Brunner’s brother said separately that the Austrian had previously been in a cult after leaving military service, although he did not say which group. “He was in a sect,” the brother told the Kronen Zeitung newspaper. “We’ve had no contact with him for 10 years. I told him to get lost when he wanted me to become his financial guarantor.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17062e1c599cf90c7a2ae6c769d811361feb67c0/0_426_6385_3831/master/6385.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b827b9a21c9814c5929629da8485f11f","title":"the wing how an exclusive womens club sparked a thousand arguments","story":"The Wing is a private members’ space for women that claims to be an ‘accelerator’ for feminist revolution in the US – and now it’s coming to the UK. But how progressive is it really? By  Linda KinstlerOn a recent weeknight in midtown Manhattan, a trickle of professional women wearing sheath dresses and smart blouses swept into a delicately lit penthouse. The space they entered was filled with women quietly working and chatting, seated on an array of curved pastel furniture, designed to fit the precise ergonomic specifications of the average woman. The women’s computers bore stickers reading “I’m With Her”, “Hermione 2020”, and “Cornell”. The colour-coded bookshelves behind them included works such as 50 Ways to Comfort a Woman in Labor, Suffragette: My Own Story, and Cunt: A Declaration of Independence.It was a typical Wednesday night at The Wing, an exclusive club that describes itself as a “network of work and community spaces designed for women of all definitions”. For between $185 and $250 per month, US Wing members – or Winglets, as the company sometimes calls them – can use the space to work, eat, socialise, breastfeed, shower, network, exercise, nap, reapply their makeup, meditate or all of the above. In other words, The Wing is a one-stop shop for the performance of contemporary mainstream feminism, a meticulously curated space where women can blow-dry their hair or “stage a small coup”, depending on the day.Audrey Gelman, the company’s co-founder and CEO, often tells The Wing’s origin story roughly as follows: she was working as a press secretary, and later as a political consultant, dashing from city to city and from meetings to parties. This lifestyle forced her to change her outfits in Starbucks and Amtrak bathrooms, places she found “semi-degrading”. She dreamed of having a more dignified place to go, where women like her – talented, outgoing, highly ambitious – could find like-minded souls, get changed and charge their phones in peace. Thus the idea for The Wing was born.The company now has eight locations – three in New York City, and one each in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, Boston and Washington DC, with five more scheduled to open imminently. Its first international outpost, on Great Portland Street in London, opens next week. Second locations in London, San Francisco and LA are in the works there will be 20 Wings by 2020. Over the past two years, The Wing has raised $117.5m in funding, attracting a formidable and erse array of investors, whose ranks include Serena Williams, President Obama’s friend and former senior adviser Valerie Jarrett, and members of the US women’s soccer team.Since the moment it opened its doors three years ago, The Wing has attracted the kind of buzz, funding and controversy usually reserved for projects involving Gwyneth Paltrow or Lena Dunham. (Not totally coincidentally, Dunham is a close friend of Gelman’s and a Wing founding member. Gelman had a cameo on Girls, and was famously the basis for the character of Marnie.) The attention The Wing generates is, in large part, because it was founded upon a paradox: its brand is steeped in the feminist language of emancipation, empowerment and equality, while its business is based on one of society’s most elitist institutions: the private members’ club. The result is that the company has become a kind of proxy for national debates over issues of gender, race, inclusivity, intersectionality and the limits and possibilities of neoliberal democratic politics. And yet, the number of people who actually belong to The Wing is still pretty small – it aims to have about 15,000 members by the end of the year, slightly less than the monthly circulation figures for The Cricketer magazine, and 16 times less than the total youth membership of the RSPB.Because The Wing is in part a co-working space, many of its members hail from professions in which office space is a rare commodity – the creative class of writers, editors, freelancers, artists and influencers who make up the media. Handily, these are precisely the same kind of people who like to tweet, Instagram and write about the world as it looks from The Wing. This has ensured that even its minutest details, from the coffee to the furniture to the lunch offerings to the customised scented candles in the gift shop, have been deemed worthy of an article of their own. It also means that The Wing has been the subject of seemingly endless criticism – accused of being too rich, too white, too cis-gendered, too feminist, not feminist enough, too liberal and not liberal enough. One former employee described it as a “super-toxic” place, while a British member told me that upon walking into The Wing in New York, she felt that she had found her “holy grail.”That Wednesday evening in Manhattan, Wing members sat with their guests, sipping rosé and snacking on seasoned popcorn as they waited for the evening’s event to begin. It was nominally a talk by the writer Caitlin Moscatello, whose new book tells the stories of first-time female candidates running for office, but it was more like a political strategy meeting for women who were thinking of running themselves. Sitting in the audience felt like being entrusted with trade secrets. Moscatello sat between Kimberly Peeler-Allen, co-founder of Higher Heights, an organisation that works to elect black women, and Catalina Cruz, the newly elected assemblywoman for New York’s 39th district.After the three speakers finished their discussion, a woman in the audience raised her hand and introduced herself to the group. She was planning a run for local office, but had yet to announce. “Please don’t repeat this!” the woman told the crowd. “Cone of silence!” exclaimed Peeler-Allen. As Cruz went on to describe the personal and financial strains of campaigning, the woman who had announced her run looked increasingly stricken. “You’re scaring me!” she said. “You’ll be fine, girl,” said Cruz. “Just get yourself ready.”It was just the kind of exchange that The Wing has been designed to generate. One of its press representatives described it to me as an “accelerator” for the coming revolution, a place where women are preparing to “leap year” into a more egalitarian future. In the US, it has become an almost compulsory campaign stop for women, trans and non-binary political candidates. Three of the women running for president have visited in the past year, and a Wing spokesperson told me that the other two – front-runner Elizabeth Warren and Senator Amy Klobuchar – are actively discussing doing so. The company’s corporate ranks are stacked with former Democratic political operatives who worked on Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaigns or in the Obama administration.To belong to The Wing is to join this in-crowd, a kind of utopian shadow government. “There’s a secret smile that you share with the other women in the elevator,” said Jess Lee, a partner at the Silicon Valley venture capital firm Sequoia, which led the The Wing’s latest $75m funding round. And it was true – I found myself giving a look of ambiguous fellowship to the women I encountered in The Wing, and felt a slight twinge of embarrassment at the check-in desk as they swiped their membership cards and glided away, while I announced myself as a journalist, there to report on the workings of their private club. At Moscatello’s event, I laughed and clapped along with the women in the audience as they shared strategies for their political triumph. In the elevator on the way out, an older woman turned to me and two young women and gave us the secret smile. “So, are you all going to run?” she asked.The Wing opened its doors on 10 October 2016, four weeks before the presidential election. One of the very first events it held was an invitation-only “very adult sleepover” featuring face masks, monogrammed pyjamas and pillow fights. The next one was a public “phone bank and debate watch party” in partnership with Clinton’s presidential campaign, which invited women to spend three hours calling members of the public and urging them to vote the first woman into the Oval Office. Gelman and her co-founder Lauren Kassan hoped that their company would flourish alongside a Clinton administration, buoyed by the arrival of feminism’s golden age.On election night, about 175 women gathered in the Wing’s Flatiron location to watch the results come in. Like just about everyone else in New York, they expected it would be a celebratory event, a coronation. But as the evening drew on, and it became increasingly clear that Clinton was not going to win, the mood shifted. “Oh my goodness, you could feel it getting colder,” says Noël Duan, a Wing founding member. At one point, Gelman, wearing a backwards baseball cap and a pink “Madam President” T-shirt, sat down and held Duan’s hand. The Wing was heavily aligned with Clinton, yet among the Democratic party’s young, progressive voters, Clinton’s strain of establishment politics was swiftly disavowed. In no time at all, the former secretary of state had become both a feminist martyr and a political liability, a flawed candidate whose defeat everyone felt they should have seen coming.Almost everyone I spoke to about the company said it would be a different place if Clinton had won. Instead of being just a beautiful space for women to revel beneath a shattered glass ceiling, it became, for its members, a place to take shelter. “It was a really sobering moment,” Kassan told me. “I think there was already the demand and excitement, and I think that we realised just how important it was now.”A few days later, The Wing briefly opened its doors to all women who felt they needed a place to regroup. Gelman and Kassan gave the organisers of the Women’s March on Washington access to the space, and in January, they hired buses to take 100 Wing members to Washington to participate. The Wing began to emphasise civic and political programming, ramped up hiring and continued planning to expand. In interviews, Gelman has articulated the mission in overtly political terms: “Being a girl is no longer politically neutral. Your identity, whether you like it or not, is now political,” she told Elle in 2017.The Wing has found itself trying to please all sides, in the process finding itself attacked from all sides, often within its own walls. It is an easy target, and the fact that it is owned and operated by women makes it all the more so. Where its programming and brand have conflicted with the aims of progressive politics, its members have called the company out. Yet anyone who criticises The Wing may expect to be swiftly criticised in turn, on one side for poking holes in an otherwise admirable project, and on the other for paying it any attention at all. All parties involved might expect their exchange to be followed by a polite reminder of the specific actions that The Wing has taken to respond to the initial criticism, and perhaps an invitation to continue their discussion in a panel event. To begin to reckon with The Wing’s project is to risk entering an “ouroboros of doom”, as the writer and illustrator Shelby Lorman put it. “It feels like such a perfect metaphor,” she said, for the many tangled and charged disagreements over what it means to be a modern woman, feminist and political subject.Before any woman sets foot in The Wing, she will, in all likelihood, already know what it looks like. Every corner of every branch seems to have been designed specifically for Instagram, which is to say that the furniture and art and food and plants and people feel as if they have been carefully chosen to telegraph that they are coveted, consumable goods. The company posts mock-ups of every new space months before it is built, so that women between the ages of 26 to 35 living in major metropolitan areas and possessing roughly $2,000 of annual disposable income can begin to imagine themselves wandering around there. (The company’s omnipresence on social media is another reminder that its power derives from not letting everyone in and letting everyone know about it.)Every outpost contains careful local touches, and each projects an air of strained yet somewhat soothing whimsy. In the Soho premises in New York, I walked up a set of stairs that read “It’s not a reach when we climb together”, before settling in to enjoy a “fork the patriarchy” grain bowl on a blue pastel desk. In its Washington DC outpost, located above a spa in Georgetown, one of the toniest corners of the city, there is a conference room named “K Street”, after the city’s main lobbying thoroughfare, and a phone booth named after Anita Hill, “legal eagle”. The Wing London, a five-storey penthouse in Fitzrovia, will offer a tearoom, terrace, fitness room and floral patterned tile floors, as well as a portrait gallery featuring the likenesses of Diane Abbott, Mary Beard and Amal Clooney, among others. It is the first members’ club in London that has signed on to the mayor’s living-wage pact, and proceeds from its cafe and its programming will benefit local charities. There will be trellises, black-and-white tiles and chandeliers. “I was very inspired by the British countryside,” Laetitia Gorra, the company’s director of interiors, told me.Walking through one of the Wing’s premises can sometimes feel like exploring what would happen if Oliver Bonas were to design a luxury corporate office: lots of pastel and very few sharp edges. The walls, cushions and seating offer an array of muted pink, mustard and rose-gold hues, a colour scheme chosen in part for its calming effect. The air conditioning is usually set at 22C (72F), to accommodate women’s slightly lower skin temperatures. Chiara de Rege, who helped design the first few locations, said that the goal was to make them “feminine, but not girly girl or precious”. Hilary Koyfman, who collaborated with De Rege on the early design, has described the overall aesthetic as “kind of like Mad Men – without the men”.There is certainly something beautiful and powerful, even alchemic, about being in a women-only space. For some women, it is a place to find support, friendship and inspiration, where they do not have to apologise for anything or worry about their things being stolen or their drinks being spiked. Two locations currently offer childcare services, while every location features a private nursing room for new mothers. Each Wing also offers a luxurious beauty room with a wide array of hair and makeup products. These beauty rooms, staff told me, are a key part of the company’s “storytelling”. They are designed to make life easier, as Gelman once said, for the kind of woman for whom “part of being successful is not only making sure that you know everything that’s going on in the news and that you’ve responded to every single email , and that nothing is on fire in your house, but also looking good because it is what’s expected of you and can make you feel more confident”.Yet, for its critics, this point of articulation is where the alchemy dissolves: instead of being a place that seeks to lift all women up, it becomes a place where one must constantly consider how well one is performing both feminism and femininity. And with any performance, this can be exhausting, and always carries the risk of failure. Spending time at The Wing, I was reminded of the kind of “ideal woman” that the writer Jia Tolentino described in a recent essay: she has expensive hair and expensive skin, she is successful and svelte. “Today’s ideal woman is of a type that coexists easily with feminism in its current market-friendly and mainstream form,” she writes. “This sort of feminism has organised itself around being as visible and appealing to as many people as possible it has greatly over-valorised women’s inidual success.”Some of the tensions within this brand of feminism can be glimpsed, not too surprisingly, at The Wing’s in-house shops, where it sells T-shirts, bags and hats with slogans like “casual business woman” and “annihilate the patriarchy” on them. There are workout clothes and $17.50 keychains. When I visited the Soho location in early August, the shop was selling a range of colourful award ribbons, printed with lines such as “Wow, you’re not sexist”, “Best ally”, and “You’re my Wingman of the year”. As Jezebel has reported, some of the merchandise resembles that of other feminist artists. The ribbons, for example, seem to be emulating the work of Shelby Lorman, whose book Awards for Good Boys satirises the low standards to which men are held. Lorman first spotted The Wing’s version of the ribbons on Instagram. “I thought it was amazing and hilarious, because they are awards for men, for sale for $6, but they’re stripped of humour, so it’s literal,” she told me. “I truly don’t think that anything could be funnier because if they did borrow my work, they have totally missed the point. And they are monetising the missed point, which is kind of genius. It’s so sinister and so evil that I kind of love it.”The commission was investigating the company for discriminating on the basis of gender. (New York law requires it to investigate any complaint it receives. The investigation closed in March 2019.) At first, the club refused to allow men into its spaces, even as guests. A former employee told me that one of the first things they were taught was how to keep men out: “Block them with your body, push them to the elevator, push the elevator button.” But outward appearance does not always correlate with gender identity the employee witnessed instances where iniduals who presented themselves to the check-in desk at The Wing were misgendered by staff. In August 2018, a serially litigious 53-year-old man sued The Wing for up to $12m for rejecting his application, claiming that he had been denied entry because of his gender. After the lawsuit was filed, and as a result of conversations with its trans and nonbinary staff and members, The Wing adopted a formal membership policy that would evaluate applicants “based on their commitment to The Wing’s mission, regardless of their perceived gender or gender identity”. In a letter to members announcing the new policy, Kassan and Gelman wrote that they would be “working to actively incorporate the perspective of trans and non-binary members into our offerings”. The language of guest emails was changed from “she’s landed” to “they’ve landed.” The policy also meant that men could enter the space as guests and apply for membership, if they really wanted to.The company’s success is partly due to the fact that, over the past five years, the identity-based members club has emerged as a powerful trend. In the US, The Wing already has too many competitors and imitators to list, which have names such as The Lola (Atlanta), The Broad (Richmond), The Assembly (San Francisco), The Riveter (Seattle) and The Hivery (Mill Valley). In London, women’s clubs such as The AllBright and The Trouble Club already occupy part of The Wing’s target audience. In November, Ethel’s Club, “the first private social and wellness club designed with people of colour in mind”, will open its doors in Brooklyn. “The Wing was created for a certain type of woman, which, from my point of view, is not for me,” Ethel’s Club founder, Najla Austin, told me. “I’m looking for my people. It’s not unlike religion. If you write down the similarities of Catholicism and a social club, they’re not that different.”Akilah Cadet, who runs a ersity and inclusion consulting firm in Oakland, had a similar first impression of The Wing, and decided that it probably was not for her. But then Yari Blanco, at the time The Wing’s senior manager of culture and ersity, reached out to her about her work, and Cadet decided to join the club. Being a member, she rightly predicted, would bring in business. “Honestly, my objective was like, get this money, so that’s what I did,” she told me. She said her application to the San Francisco location was fast-tracked, and soon she found herself at an event thrown specifically for black women. At one point, a white woman stood up on the couch and announced that they would be giving away T-shirts reading “phenomenally black”. Cadet raised her concerns about the event to Blanco and her team, criticising what she perceived to be a lack of serious thought about the way the event was organised. Two days later, she found herself on a panel at The Wing sponsored by Secret deodorant, where she got a new client.The company has made similar missteps along the way, and has almost always made concerted efforts to correct them wherever they arise. Noël Duan, the founding member from New York, who is Chinese American, told me that when The Wing held an event for Asian women, they posted an Instagram story intended to celebrate the club’s “women from Asia”. Duan did not attend, but some of her friends did. “They were like: we’re not women from Asia, we’re American,” she said. “What I really love about Wing members is that they are willing to speak out, including against the company,” Duan added, noting that the company had changed in response to criticism. “I can see from personal experience that it has come a long way since they first launched,” she said.Cadet took it upon herself to point out instances where The Wing could be more attentive to ersity and difference. Eventually, she was doing so much work for The Wing that she said they offered her a complimentary membership, and she frequently used the space to hold meetings in San Francisco. Like many of its critics, Cadet tries to view the company with generosity.Lately, however, maintaining this nuanced view has come to require a more intricate set of mental gymnastics. At the end of May, a racial confrontation occurred at the West Hollywood branch. According to reporting by the online magazine Zora, Wing member Asha Grant, the director of The Free Black Women’s Library Los Angeles, and her guest were harassed in the parking lot by “an unaccompanied white woman guest” who began yelling at them after Grant took what she felt was her parking space. The harassment and racist threats continued inside, where the white woman gave the middle finger to Grant, her guest, and another black club member, Stephanie Kimou. In an attempt to ease the situation, staff offered Kimou, Grant and her guest a free meal, but the white woman was not asked to leave the premises.News of the incident spread quickly. In mid-August, Kimou and Grant posted on Instagram announcing that they were cancelling their memberships. “After the initial allure of their perfectly designed co-working spaces, beauty rooms stocked full of Glossier and Goop, the lattes and their ‘commitment to ersity’, the facade started to crack and what was underneath all that pink felt oppressive and debilitating,” Kimou wrote in her post.On 6 September, the day after the first email from Gelman and Kassan went out, I visited the company’s new headquarters in the East Village in New York. Zara Rahim, senior director of strategic communications, gave me a tour around the four-storey office, which is located in what was once a hospital for German immigrants and later expanded to include a dedicated women’s wing. In the basement, the only place in the building where I spotted several men, the tech team was hard at work. Upstairs, we popped our heads into a mint-green conference room, where a planning meeting for the London launch was underway.Rahim and I settled into a couch in Kassan’s office, where Kassan greeted us wearing a yellow plaid jacquard blazer and a logo necklace bearing The Wing’s “hero W”, which looks something like the Wonder Woman logo, but softer, rounder, cuter. While Gelman, as CEO, is the public face of the company, Kassan, as COO, tends to handle operations behind the scenes. Before this venture, Kassan was the first employee at the fitness chain SLT, which specialises in high-intensity reformer pilates (motto: “better sore than sorry”), and then moved on to Classpass, a fitness class app. She rarely gives interviews, but by the time we spoke, Gelman was busy preparing to go on maternity leave and Kassan was taking over some of her duties.Kassan was excited for the London launch, which she told me had been years in the making. She would be bringing her whole family over to celebrate the opening. I asked her about the recent email to members and about the common criticisms of the company. Diversity had been “a part of who we are and what we’ve cared about since the beginning”, she explained. “That shows up through our programming and through our products. When things happen, we want to be transparent and clear about that … because there are things that happen outside in the world that we can’t control. And we want to create a space to be able to have these honest and hard conversations.”The more time I spent speaking to the company’s critics and supporters, the clearer it became that the controversy it generates has far more to do with what it claims to be rather than what it actually is. Last month, for instance, it debuted a members-only job marketplace that allows members to post listings and hire one another. From a business perspective, this is a savvy move – giving ambitious women yet another reason to want to join, while connecting bosses who are members with a pool of promising candidates. But this is a very narrow vision of feminism. Of course, many talented people will gain new opportunities through this service but, equally obviously, its exclusivity threatens to exacerbate the same kinds of inequality that The Wing claims to want to combat.“Feminism, for me, is fundamentally about collective struggle, not iniduals,” says Sarah Banet-Weiser, a scholar of communication and gender studies at the London School of Economics. The Wing’s strain of feminism, she argued, is something else: “They’re empowering women to be better economic subjects within capitalism, empowering women to network, to get a raise, to address the pay gap. Those are real things, but they are really tied to capitalist logic.” As a former employee put it, The Wing’s feminism is less about making the world more equitable as it is about making sure women are given equal opportunities to make money: “It’s like, you only make $1m? Well, this man makes $2m! You could make $2m if only it weren’t for misogyny.” (One recent post from The Wing’s Instagram feed read: “Mood: CE0,000,000”.)Progressives often talk about The Wing in the same way they talk about the Democratic party: it’s not great but maybe things will get better, maybe the politicians will figure it out, maybe the world The Wing’s founders imagined they would serve will one day emerge. One vocal supporter of The Wing is, somewhat surprisingly, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Gelman hosted a fundraiser for Ocasio-Cortez at her home in Brooklyn last summer and, a few months later, the politician told Glamour: “The Wing isn’t just a functional space, it’s a real symbol of what’s happening in our country.” She called the company “one of the most potent forces that we’ve seen emerge in politics this year.” Many of the people I spoke to for this piece were disappointed in The Wing for a variety of reasons, but hesitant to publicly criticise it. They had made good friends there, and saw all the work that staff were putting in to make it a better place. They had low expectations for corporate behaviour, and saw The Wing doing a better job than most companies when it comes to addressing its failures. They understood the paradox of a company whose profitability rests upon both expanding its tent and guarding the entrances. “I really wonder what the plan is to grow while staying true to their values,” one San Francisco-based member told me. “Maybe they have something up their sleeve, they have a ton of really smart women working for that company, but I don’t see it.” Cadet also felt burned out by her experience. “I want this to go well. I want this to be a good thing,” she said. “I don’t know, maybe I’ve done all that I can do.” (“And when you write that, say that I was gazing off into the distance,” she joked.)The opening of the London branch comes as The Wing seems to be reckoning with its first few years. Last week, The Wing unveiled a mural advertisement on a street corner in Shoreditch in east London. In a bright coral hue, it introduces The Wing as “the first place in London to solve the dual epidemic of mansplaining and manspreading”. After it went up, Rahim texted me a photo of a handful of men and women pausing in front of it, presumably wondering what a thing called The Wing could be and what it might become.• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4055526.1571421556!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"reference for doctor in fitness to practise case not written by signatory hearing told","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDr Idowu Adeyemi Adeboro, medically trained in Romania and the holder of a Spanish passport, has been suspended by the Medical Council after it emerged the documents he submitted in his registration application were falsely notarised. File photograph: Anthony DevlinPA WireAn Irish-trained doctor living in the US has expressed his surprise on finding a fraudulent reference purporting to be written by him was being used in support of job applications in Dublin.Dr Robert Reynolds was giving evidence in a fitness-to-practise hearing at the Medical Council into Dr Idowu Adeyemi Adeboro’s alleged use of falsified documents sent to a recruitment agency.Dr Adeboro is alleged to have submitted, “or allowed to have submitted” two falsified references to the recruitment agency, Cowley Brown. One of the references was allegedly written by Dr Reynolds, of the Cancer Institute of Florida.However, Dr Reynolds told the inquiry he knew from the moment he saw the reference it was “fraudulent documentation” which he was not involved in creating.Dr Reynolds graduated from the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland in 1984 and has spent most of his working career at the Cancer Institute of Florida. He retired in 2017.The reference furnished by Dr Adeboro to a Dublin recruitment agency was signed by “Dr Robert Reynolds” and dated November 21st, 2017.Speaking to the inquiry by videolink, Dr Reynolds said he was surprised on being shown a copy of the reference by the Medical Council during its inquiries into Dr Adeboro. “I did not recognise it. It was not something I had any foreknowledge of and I had no part in generating it.”“From the first moment, I knew it was a fraudulent documentation.”He pointed out that the symbol used on the reference for the institute looked more like a “road sign on the highway” than the correct one, while the address bore no relation to that of the institute. The email address used, the title he was given and the signature were all fraudulent, he said.Asked whether he had ever come across Dr Adeboro, he said he did not recognise the name and had never met him, “as far as I know”.“I don’t know if he even exists,” he added. “I did not give this person a reference. It should not have been part of his CV. It doesn’t reflect truthfully our cancer institute or my involvement in it.”“I appreciate your vigilance in seeking the truth, wherever it may lie,” he told the inquiry.Dr Adeboro, medically trained in Romania and the holder of a Spanish passport, has been suspended by the Medical Council after it emerged the documents he submitted in his registration application were falsely notarised.It is also alleged he incorporated “or caused to be incorporated” a healthcare clinic with an address on Dublin’s Harcourt Street, which never existed. His CV stated that he had worked for this clinic.A second reference he submitted to the recruitment agency came from a non-existent doctor at a non-existent medical centre in the UK, it is alleged.Prof Stephen Lane, a respiratory consultant at Tallaght Hospital, told the inquiry that if the allegations against Dr Adeboro were proven, it would clearly amount to professional misconduct.Giving evidence as an expert witness, Prof Lane said the allegations, if proven, would clearly put patients at risk and could be considered disgraceful and dishonourable.The hearing, which Dr Adeboro is not attending, concludes on Monday."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Irish doctor based in US said he did not know and never met Dr Idowu Adeyemi AdeboroAoife Bennett claims she developed narcolepsy after getting swine flu vaccineJudge investigating claims officer was in improper relationship with heroin dealerAlmost 80 per cent of households go online every day, according to CSO researchThe nuts and bolts of Johnson\u0027s plans for Northern Ireland are fraught with difficultyBishop of Waterford \u0026amp Lismore Alphonsus Cullinan said yoga was not suitable for schoolNo suitable facility for teenager with behavioural problems in State, court hearsCourt previously heard Victor Olaru deny allegations he was involved in \u0026lsquomassive fraud\u0026rsquoLack of any obvious figurehead makes an extremist political faction less likelyCaolan Smith from Donore, Co Meath accused over shooting at garage in north DublinDCU economics professor says housing and childcare costs could be affecting birth ratePaul Flaherty (30) was found guilty by a jury at the Central Criminal Court last DecemberJohn McClean (74) accused of sexually abusing nine victims at Terenure College\u0026lsquoThe children are still on pur\u0026eacuteed food in pouches, at two and three years of age\u0026rsquoPatrick Hutch accused over fatal shooting of David Byrne at Dublin\u0026rsquos Regency HotelMany Irish fans bought tickets in anticipation of being in the \u0026lsquoother quarter-final\u0026rsquoJohn Murphy \u0026lsquocruelly violated\u0026rsquo relationship with his brother in the family home"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4054486.1571343043!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit out but in customs plan has hallmarks of hastily agreed deal","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIn an effort to maintain an open Irish border, the EU is outsourcing checks on goods coming on to the island of Ireland – and possibly into the EU market. Photograph: Alan BetsonA major change from the original Northern Ireland backstop to avoid a hard border will require a huge leap into the unknown. It is the area of customs.In practical terms, this is the most complex part of the proposed Brexit plan to manage, with much of the small print yet to be written.By dropping the idea of a EU-UK customs territory in the original plan, London and Brussels have agreed to allow Northern Ireland to leave the EU customs union while still applying the bloc’s customs rules there.In an effort to maintain an open Irish Border, the EU is outsourcing checks on goods coming on to the island – and possibly into the EU market – to the UK authorities, with EU officials entitled to be present for checks at ports in the North, Scotland and England.Beyond a broad line of how it would work, there is little detail on how it will be managed. It is not clear what exactly would happen to a truckload of widgets travelling from Scotland to Northern Ireland through Belfast Port on to Dublin and then further into the EU market. A similar customs proposal from the UK was dismissed last year by Brussels as unworkable.Five paragraphsOnly three pages in the 64-page “protocol” are devoted to this unprecedented out-but-in customs plan and there are just five paragraphs on how the EU’s value-added tax rules would apply for goods in Northern Ireland. The issue is “totally fudged” in the deal, according to VAT expert Jeremy Cape.The plan is described by the European Commission as a “fully legally operative solution,” yet the day-to-day operation of the proposals is being deferred to a proposed “joint committee” of EU and UK officials to work out the precise details in the standstill transition period that, as of now, would run until the end of next year. It has all the hallmarks of a deal cobbled together at the last minute.In broad terms, it would work as follows: no customs duties would be paid on goods going into Northern Ireland from another part of the UK “unless that good is at risk of subsequently being moved” into the EU.TrickyThis is where matters become tricky: how to manage products coming into Northern Ireland that end up being used to manufacture other products which could find their way into the EU market.The deal proposes managing this by charging the EU customs tariff on the goods and allowing Northern Irish businesses to claim back a rebate from the beneficial difference in tariffs to benefit from future UK trade deals where it agrees lower tariffs with third countries.As for much of the detail here, the protocol document kicks lot of cans on the operational minutiae down the road to the all-powerful joint committee.All this creates a substantial new border between Britain and Northern Ireland and a heavy administrative burden for Northern Irish businesses.“It won’t be a huge problem for a large company. It could be a lot more difficult for a small company,” said Carol Lynch, trade expert at consultants BDO.Other problemsAvoiding a hard Irish land border and pushing checks back to Scottish and English ports potentially creates other problems on the island of Ireland.Edgar Morgenroth, professor of economics at Dublin City University, said that goods from another country transiting from Dublin Port to Britain via Northern Ireland might not be checked until they reach Scotland.“The potential for really significant smuggling into the EU is the bit I worry about,” he said. “If that is what would happen, then somebody would have to stop it and then the problem is an Irish problem.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Olivier HosletEPATo avoid a hard border in Ireland, the new Brexit deal means Northern Ireland will remain in the UK customs territory legally but practically it will be under EU customs rules, with checks falling between the North and Britain.To understand how this would work, imagine you are a Northern Irish firm importing bolts.When your bolts arrive in Larne or Belfast, they will be checked and EU tariffs will be applied and collected by the UK and paid on to the EU. That is unless they are personal property and they are a final product and not going to be used in the manufacture of something else.In addition, EU tariffs could be waived if they meet criteria yet to be determined by a “joint committee” of EU and UK officials who will have to figure this out over a 14-month transition period.These still-undecided criteria must, the proposed deal says, consider the final destination and use of a good, its nature and value, its movement and the incentive for not declaring the onward movement of the good into the EU, in particular incentives resulting from duties not being paid to the UK.ComplicatedIt is presumed that if you can prove the bolts are being sold in Northern Ireland, then you will be able to claim the EU tariff back. If your bolt is exempt under the criteria, it can either enter the North tariff-free from Britain or at the UK tariff for bolts from the rest of the world, presuming it is lower.If you were unable to show that the train set, your final product, was sold in the North, you would have already paid the EU tariff anyway. If you imported your bolts from China and you ended up selling your train set in the North, you would apply the UK customs tariff and claim a rebate on the EU tariff from the UK.This would allow Northern Irish businesses to benefit from any free trade agreement that the UK could sign with China after Brexit – a key reason for Boris Johnson’s decision to take all of the UK out of the customs union.To complicate things further, if your bolts do not satisfy the criteria to be exempt from EU tariffs, the UK could “pay” it on your behalf – up to the limits of EU state aid rules – by either waiving or rebating it.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

People living in Ireland are having significantly fewer children compared to a decade ago despite Ireland’s thriving economy, the Central Statistics Office yearbook reveals.Last year 61,016 babies were born in the Republic, the lowest figure since 2002.That is a fall of 1.6 per cent on 2017’s figure of 62,053 and almost 20 per cent down from the peak in 2009 when 75,554 babies were born.Despite the fall in births, the population of the Republic has continued to increase because of inward migration and declining deaths and is now almost at 5 million.As a result of this the birth rate – the rate of births per head of population – has fallen even further.Since the beginning of this century, birth rates in Ireland peaked at 16.8 births per thousand in 2008. It is now down to 12.6 births per thousand, a decrease of 25 per cent .CSO figures due out at the end of the month will show the replacement rate for the population, which is an average of 2.1 children per woman, will fall below that figure, although the Republic still has one of the highest birth rates in the EU.The average age of mothers in Ireland is now 32.9. This has increased by more than two years since the middle of the last decade.Figures from the CSO also show that the number of births to women over 40 have increased by more than half between 2006 and 2016 while the number of children born to teenage mothers have fallen by 52.8 per cent in the same time period.Dublin City University economics professor Edgar Morgenroth said the reasons for the dramatic decrease may be both demographic and economic.He explained that after a baby boom in the 1970s, fewer children were born in the Republic in the 1980s. The recent decline could be partly explained by the smaller 1980s generation now starting families.He also suggested that the current reluctance to have children might be because “the costs of housing and childcare are starting to bite”.“Kids aren’t cheap and you have to live some place. If you are living in an inappropriate place and you can’t afford to move and childcare is expensive, you will choose to have fewer kids,” he said.He warned that the falling birth rate could have long term consequences for Ireland as it did for his native Germany, where in some areas the working-age population is shrinking.“You check the age and vibrancy of a lot of places in Germany, it has had a huge effect. There are towns in Germany as big as Galway which don’t even have a cinema now.”Marriage rates have fallen to their lowest level since 1997 and would be lower still but for the inclusion of figures for same-sex marriages.The marriage rate was 4.3 per 1,000 in 2018, the same as 1997. It peaked during the boom when there was a succession of years from 2002 to 2007 when it was 5.2 per thousand.Couples are also older when they get married. In 2018 the average age of a man getting married in the Republic was 36.4 years the average for a woman was 34.4. In 2008 the equivalent figures were 33.8 for a man and 31.7 for a woman.It is even older for those involved in same-sex marriages which constitute 3 per cent of the total marriages in the Republic last year. The average age of men in same-sex marriage is 40.1 for women it is 38.7.Rising birth and marriage rates are often a barometer of a healthy economy, but this does not seem to be the case in the present statistics.Consumers seem to be having it good with average weekly earnings up by 3.5 per cent annually to €757.21 last year.The average weekly household disposable income in 2017 was €929.01 up 4.7 per cent on the previous year, while the average weekly disposable income per inidual was €478.78 up 5.5 per cent."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4055547.1571423198!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"blocking of balkan states accession talks historic mistake eu says","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAlbanian prime minister Edi Rama said his country was “collateral damage” in the EU’s internal disputes. Photograph: Gent ShkullakuAFPNorth Macedonia and Albania reacted with dismay on Friday to a decision by member states not to start accession talks with the two Balkan candidate countries.France led opposition to calls to open negotiations with Tirana and Skopje, insisting on the need to overhaul the European Union enlargement process despite assertions from Brussels that both countries had met the demands made of them so far.Critics of the refusal warn that it could strengthen populist and nationalist forces in both countries, undermine reform efforts and discredit the EU while boosting the influence of rival powers such as Russia and China.“The least that the European Union owes the region is to be straightforward with us. If there is no more consensus on the European future of the western Balkans . . . the citizens deserve to know,” said Nikola Dimitrov, North Macedonia’s foreign minister.He was a key negotiator of a deal that North Macedonia signed with Greece last year to change its name, ending a 27-year dispute that was seen as Skopje’s main obstacle to accession talks.French president Emmanuel Macron insisted the EU needed to change before accepting new members, and to decide on “a reformed enlargement process, a real credibility and a strategic vision of who we are and our role.”The Netherlands and Denmark were reportedly willing to allow North Macedonia to start accession talks but joined France in calling on Albania to do more to fight crime and corruption.Albanian prime minister Edi Rama told The  last week that his country was “collateral damage” in the EU’s own internal disputes. “The western Balkans is surrounded by EU borders,” he said.“When they talk about illegal migration, transnational crime and security – all these are reasons why the EU needs the western Balkans as much as we need the EU,” he argued.“To have this area like a grey zone in the middle of the continent and within EU borders and not think strategically – well, it’s not very visionary.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4054469.1571342908!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"new brexit deal same as may s but with tweaks regarding ireland","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar and president of the European Council Donald Tusk during a press conference at the Brexit summit in Brussels. Photograph: Olivier HosletEPAEuropean leaders on Thursday night approved a Brexit agreement with the UK that reflected only slight changes – amendments to six paragraphs dealing with Ireland – to the 600-page withdrawal agreement reached with former prime minister Theresa May.The rest of the agreement, which has been rejected three times by the UK parliament, remains intact, and the whole thing now goes to the House of Commons on Saturday, and then to the European Parliament, for ratification. All being well, Brexit will now happen on UK prime minister Boris Johnson’s schedule of midnight on October 31st.A beaming Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, unusually, joined the leaders of the EU institutions, Jean-Claude Juncker and Donald Tusk, on stage at a press conference to announce the approval of the full legal text by EU leaders.Mr Tusk, the European Council president, turned towards Mr Varadkar to acknowledge the special place of Ireland in the talks:“Why has a deal that was impossible yesterday become possible today?” he asked. “Firstly, the new version of the deal has been positively assessed by Ireland. I’ve said from the beginning that we would always stand behind Ireland, and not force a deal unfavourable to Dublin.”He spoke of what had made the deal possible: “The key change in comparison with the earlier version of the deal is prime minister Johnson’s acceptance to have customs checks at the points of entry into Northern Ireland. This compromise will allow us to avoid Border checks between Ireland and Northern Ireland, and will ensure the integrity of the single market.”Extension ‘unnecessary’The council’s “conclusions” were brief and to the point, erging only slightly from those in November, when another deal had been approved. They record the endorsement of both the revised withdrawal agreement and the political declaration on the future relationship between the EU and the UK and invite “the commission, the European Parliament and the council to take the necessary steps to ensure that the agreement can enter into force on November 1st, 2019, so as to provide for an orderly withdrawal”.They included no mention of a possible extension beyond October 31st, which European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker dismissed as unnecessary.Mr Varadkar said the deal met Dublin’s tests of avoiding a hard border with Northern Ireland, protecting the all-Ireland economy and preserving the Belfast Agreement.All three men expressed their sadness at Brexit but said they recognised the democratic “will of the British people”. German chancellor Angela Merkel, echoing similar sentiments to Mr Varadkar, said the deal demonstrated the power of EU unity. “We have shown that the EU 27 have stuck together,” she said. “I am feeling quite optimistic.”Asked what he would say to the 48 per cent of UK voters who had supported voted to remain in the EU, Mr Juncker said sadly: “I would like to say to the 48 that they were right.”Cautious noteIncoming commission president Ursula von der Leyen, who is due to take over from Mr Juncker at the end of November, said it was important Brexit happened “in an orderly way, as that’s decisive for people and for the economy. It’s also decisive for the starting point of the future relations we’ll have with Britain”.But she said she was cautious about whether Mr Johnson could secure a Commons majority, and one of her new vice-presidents, Frans Timmermans, said he had “stopped trying to predict what the British parliament will think of it”.On Thursday night EU leaders were set to discuss Turkey – its invasion of northern Syria and illegal drilling off Cyprus. They were expected to endorse sanctions and an arms embargo approved by foreign ministers on Monday. Sources said there may be some attempt to increase the pressure on Ankara.And they will debate the possibility of opening accession talks with Albania and North Macedonia. Although the process is likely to take many years, it is being held up by a small number of states, led by France, which wants the whole system reformed before any new applicants are considered. Tempers, it was anticipated, might fray.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches. See more here.

Earlier this year, Cambridge University announced it is launching an inquiry into how it benefited from the slave trade.   It will also probe how far Cambridge academics “reinforced and validated race-based thinking between the 18th and early 20th Century”.  Other leading universities have refused to bow to pressure from decolonisation campaigns aimed at names of buildings and statues, as well as their curriculum.Oxford University refused to give in to the demands of the Rhodes Must Fall campaign, which called for the statue of Cecil Rhodes to be taken down from Oriel College over his links to imperialism. Meanwhile, Bristol University announced that it will not rename the Wills Memorial Building despite campaigners claiming it is named after a slave trader. In a section of the NUS manifesto titled decolonising our education, it says: Our educational structures and institutions are a product of colonialism: some have directly profited from this, while others have propagated systems that assure white privilege.This is reflected in the racist barriers and structures students face, with the attainment gap the most striking symptom of race inequity.”The NUS said that universities have recognised that they have a “responsibility to dismantle these systems”. But their manifesto went on to say that institutions are still lacking in a vision of a truly liberated education, one that can thrive free from isolated attachment to western narratives.The NUS said it will support activists to understand, identify, and actively challenge the racist structures in our colleges and universities. Their manifesto also examines issues for university students such as funding, accessible and affordable housing and transport, health care and fair access to education.A spokeswoman for Universities UK, which represents vice-Chancellors, said: Many institutions have taken on board the need to have a more inclusive curriculum.Our work suggests several universities are reviewing their curriculums as well as conducting liberation or decolonisation activities in co-ordination with students\u0027 unions and iniduals.

The more sponsors pay, the more products they can nominate to be on the list and the more prominently their own products will be featured on the popular website. Amazon aimed to sell at least $20m in sponsorships for this year’s list, the documents show. Amazon also published a summer toy list with lower sponsorship prices.It’s perfectly legal for Amazon to sell advertising on its site. It becomes a problem when the world’s largest online retailer tells shoppers recommendations are curated by experts but doesn’t disclose the money it gets from the toy industry, said Robert Weissman, president of the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen. Because consumers place more value on recommendations from independent sources, companies prefer to keep their financial involvement hidden, he argued.“They don’t write ‘paid ad’ on it because it completely changes how consumers perceive the information,” Mr Weissman said. “If the list is entirely or in part paid advertising, people have a right to know.”Amazon likened the payments it received to the money brands pay stores to be included in advertising circulars or to get prominent shelf space.In an emailed statement, the company said: “Every product on our annual Holiday Toy List, which features family gift ideas from new releases to customer favourites, is independently curated by a team of in-house experts based on a high bar for quality, design, innovation and play experience. We source product ideas from many places, including our selling partners who have an opportunity to nominate their best toys for the season and increase visibility of those toys.”Gift lists are a time-tested way for toy manufacturers to stand out in the critical holiday rush when busy parents are desperate for ideas. Toymakers are eager to appear on these lists because the companies generate about half their annual sales during the holiday season.Walmart charges toymakers $10,000 monthly per product to appear on its “Buyer’s Picks” toy list in November and December, according to documents reviewed by Bloomberg. The company produces other lists, including “Top Rated by Kids”, which uses feedback from children who test and rate more than 100 toys in July. Walmart and its toy suppliers partner to determine which 100 toys will be tested. Spokeswoman Leigh Stidham said suppliers and brands cannot pay to be included on the latter list, but didn’t comment on “Buyer’s Picks”.Parents looking for independent recommendations can turn to toy lists produced by third-party reviewers such as Toy Insider and Toys, Tots, Pets \u0026amp More (TTPM). But in an era when customer reviews can be gamed and social media influencers push products without always disclosing that they’re getting paid, consumers sometimes struggle to distinguish between objective online recommendations and paid promotions.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe US law is murky about precisely what should be disclosed and when. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which enforces laws on deceptive advertising, issues general guidelines. A full-page magazine photo of a thirsty runner guzzling from a glistening bottle of Fiji water is so obviously an advertisement it doesn’t have to be disclosed. If the same water brand pays the magazine to publish what appears to be a news story about the health benefits of its product, it must be clearly labelled an advertisement so consumers aren’t confused.While federal regulators are taking a closer look at advertising these days, they can’t possibly monitor all the promotional activity out there. So the FTC occasionally cracks down to send a message, as it did in 2017 with letters to more than 90 influencers and marketers reminding them about the need to disclose paid promotions in social media. The spotty enforcement presents a big grey area for the toy industry.Amazon promotes security cameras that can be hacked to spy on youNew Amazon devices put Alexa inside glasses, a ring and your earsHow to get the best Amazon Black Friday deals this yearThe lists are a powerful negotiating tool for retailers, according to industry insiders familiar with the process. Toymakers are led to understand that if they buy marketing space on the lists they will get bigger orders, the people said. Sometimes manufacturers get better visibility if they agree to sell a product exclusively through the retailer, they said. Retailers include only toys on the list that they are actually selling.Lists are a fast-growing part of Amazon’s advertising business. Amazon holiday gift guides promoting toys, electronics and home goods combined to generate more than $120m in revenue in 2017, up about 40 per cent from the previous year, according to documents reviewed by Bloomberg.What sets Amazon apart from other retailers is how much it charges for space on its toy page over the holidays. A narrow strip across the top of the web page costs $500,000 per month in November and December, up from $150,000 the rest of the year, according to documents reviewed by Bloomberg. A billboard ad atop the toys page runs $300,000 per month, up from $75,000 the rest of the year.Similar spots atop Walmart’s toy page cost $180,000 in November and $132,000 in December. According to Comscore, Amazon generates about twice as much web traffic as Walmart, which could explain the discrepancy in pricing.Public Citizen, the watchdog group, in July lodged a complaint with the FTC about Amazon’s annual summer sale Prime Day, alleging the retailer didn’t do enough to help shoppers differentiate between paid promotions and genuine recommendations. The FTC confirmed receiving the complaint. The annual toy list presents similar concerns, Mr Weissman said.“When Amazon presents a top 100 toy list,” he said, “it’s a mistake to assume that shoppers understand this is just paid billboard space versus a list Amazon curated itself.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

While a deal has now been agreed firms are still unclear about what shape Brexit will take and how it will affect them.\u0026nbsp in\u0026nbspProperty and real estate businesses experienced the highest annual increase in distress of any sector covered by the research, in part because they have found it difficult to raise the cash needed to finance their operations.\u0026nbspJulie Palmer, partner at Begbies Traynor, said: “With a considerable increase in the number of businesses suffering significant financial distress in the last three years there is growing frustration among businesses that they cannot plan for the future and the whole economy is lagging as a result.“Much investment is on hold as businesses have their hands tied by not knowing what the state of play will be post-Brexit and whether the agreements or contracts they currently have in place will still be valid following the expected withdrawal, which is contributing to stifled growth nationwide.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The more sponsors pay, the more products they can nominate to be on the list and the more prominently their own products will be featured on the popular website. Amazon aimed to sell at least $20m in sponsorships for this year’s list, the documents show. Amazon also published a summer toy list with lower sponsorship prices.It’s perfectly legal for Amazon to sell advertising on its site. It becomes a problem when the world’s largest online retailer tells shoppers recommendations are curated by experts but doesn’t disclose the money it gets from the toy industry, said Robert Weissman, president of the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen. Because consumers place more value on recommendations from independent sources, companies prefer to keep their financial involvement hidden, he argued.“They don’t write ‘paid ad’ on it because it completely changes how consumers perceive the information,” Mr Weissman said. “If the list is entirely or in part paid advertising, people have a right to know.”Amazon likened the payments it received to the money brands pay stores to be included in advertising circulars or to get prominent shelf space.In an emailed statement, the company said: “Every product on our annual Holiday Toy List, which features family gift ideas from new releases to customer favourites, is independently curated by a team of in-house experts based on a high bar for quality, design, innovation and play experience. We source product ideas from many places, including our selling partners who have an opportunity to nominate their best toys for the season and increase visibility of those toys.”Gift lists are a time-tested way for toy manufacturers to stand out in the critical holiday rush when busy parents are desperate for ideas. Toymakers are eager to appear on these lists because the companies generate about half their annual sales during the holiday season.Walmart charges toymakers $10,000 monthly per product to appear on its “Buyer’s Picks” toy list in November and December, according to documents reviewed by Bloomberg. The company produces other lists, including “Top Rated by Kids”, which uses feedback from children who test and rate more than 100 toys in July. Walmart and its toy suppliers partner to determine which 100 toys will be tested. Spokeswoman Leigh Stidham said suppliers and brands cannot pay to be included on the latter list, but didn’t comment on “Buyer’s Picks”.Parents looking for independent recommendations can turn to toy lists produced by third-party reviewers such as Toy Insider and Toys, Tots, Pets \u0026amp More (TTPM). But in an era when customer reviews can be gamed and social media influencers push products without always disclosing that they’re getting paid, consumers sometimes struggle to distinguish between objective online recommendations and paid promotions.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which enforces laws on deceptive advertising, issues general guidelines. A full-page magazine photo of a thirsty runner guzzling from a glistening bottle of Fiji water is so obviously an advertisement it doesn’t have to be disclosed. If the same water brand pays the magazine to publish what appears to be a news story about the health benefits of its product, it must be clearly labelled an advertisement so consumers aren’t confused.While federal regulators are taking a closer look at advertising these days, they can’t possibly monitor all the promotional activity out there. So the FTC occasionally cracks down to send a message, as it did in 2017 with letters to more than 90 influencers and marketers reminding them about the need to disclose paid promotions in social media. The spotty enforcement presents a big grey area for the toy industry.Amazon promotes security cameras that can be hacked to spy on youNew Amazon devices put Alexa inside glasses, a ring and your earsHow to get the best Amazon Black Friday deals this yearThe lists are a powerful negotiating tool for retailers, according to industry insiders familiar with the process. Toymakers are led to understand that if they buy marketing space on the lists they will get bigger orders, the people said. Sometimes manufacturers get better visibility if they agree to sell a product exclusively through the retailer, they said. Retailers include only toys on the list that they are actually selling.Lists are a fast-growing part of Amazon’s advertising business. Amazon holiday gift guides promoting toys, electronics and home goods combined to generate more than $120m in revenue in 2017, up about 40 per cent from the previous year, according to documents reviewed by Bloomberg.What sets Amazon apart from other retailers is how much it charges for space on its toy page over the holidays. A narrow strip across the top of the web page costs $500,000 per month in November and December, up from $150,000 the rest of the year, according to documents reviewed by Bloomberg. A billboard ad atop the toys page runs $300,000 per month, up from $75,000 the rest of the year.Similar spots atop Walmart’s toy page cost $180,000 in November and $132,000 in December. According to Comscore, Amazon generates about twice as much web traffic as Walmart, which could explain the discrepancy in pricing.Public Citizen, the watchdog group, in July lodged a complaint with the FTC about Amazon’s annual summer sale Prime Day, alleging the retailer didn’t do enough to help shoppers differentiate between paid promotions and genuine recommendations. The FTC confirmed receiving the complaint. The annual toy list presents similar concerns, Mr Weissman said.“When Amazon presents a top 100 toy list,” he said, “it’s a mistake to assume that shoppers understand this is just paid billboard space versus a list Amazon curated itself.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

While a deal has now been agreed firms are still unclear about what shape Brexit will take and how it will affect them.\u0026nbsp in\u0026nbspProperty and real estate businesses experienced the highest annual increase in distress of any sector covered by the research, in part because they have found it difficult to raise the cash needed to finance their operations.\u0026nbspJulie Palmer, partner at Begbies Traynor, said: “With a considerable increase in the number of businesses suffering significant financial distress in the last three years there is growing frustration among businesses that they cannot plan for the future and the whole economy is lagging as a result.“Much investment is on hold as businesses have their hands tied by not knowing what the state of play will be post-Brexit and whether the agreements or contracts they currently have in place will still be valid following the expected withdrawal, which is contributing to stifled growth nationwide.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The researchers point to previous work by the OECD showing that some people with health issues or a disability would be able to work if arrangements such as flexible hours or remote work were an option.In contrast, UK government statisticians treat those two types of the “hidden” jobless as economically inactive rather than unemployed, without distinguishing why some people are not looking for work.“When the hidden unemployed are added to official unemployment statistics, the number of working-age jobless people not in education is estimated to jump from 4.6 per cent to 13.2 per cent,” the Centre for Cities said on Thursday.“This challenges the claim that Britain has experienced a job creation miracle in recent years.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and Britain\u0027s Prime Minister Boris Johnson shake hands during a news conference after agreeing on a Brexit deal, in BrusselsA man walks his dog through the fallen leaves in Clarkes Gardens, Allerton in LiverpoolPolice officers carry away an activist as Extinction Rebellion protesters block a road with a caravan in central LondonQueen Elizabeth II sits with Prince Charles on the Sovereign\u0027s throne ahead of delivering the Queen\u0027s Speech at the State Opening of ParliamentGreat Britain\u0027s Joe Fraser competes on Parallel Bars during the World Gymnastics Championships in Stuttgart, Germany.

The authors used that figure because other data in the report is also from 2017.In cities with weaker economies, such as Liverpool, Dundee and Sunderland, the jobless rate that includes the “hidden” unemployed reaches nearly 20 per cent, according to the report.“This research suggests that people in cities which have struggled to recover from the deindustrialisation of the 20th\u0026nbspcentury could be dealt a second blow as they are ill-equipped to respond to automation,” said Andrew Carter, the chief executive of the Centre for Cities.In another change from official statistics, the researchers excluded from their calculation of the overall unemployment rates people who are inactive by choice or for other non-economic reasons – specifically, students, early retirees and people looking after children, relatives or a home.“Being a student, retiring earlier and looking after family or home are not necessarily directly linked to the economic performance of the local area where people live and work,” they wrote.For example, most early retirees have probably left work because they can afford it, the authors note.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The director\u0027s adaptation is a nonsensical, deeply convoluted disaster that wastes an enjoyably oddball cast. It\u0027s the only one of Lynch\u0027s films the director has publicly disowned. Still, hopes are high that next year’s version from Arrival director Denis Villeneuve, starring Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya, will somehow be better.  326 The Bonfire of the Vanities (1990)Fresh off the success of bestselling novel The Bonfire of the Vanities, Warner Bros bought the rights from Tom Wolfe for a staggering $750,000. Tom Hanks and Melanie Griffiths were both (mis)cast in the lead roles after director Brian De Palma\u0027s preferred choices turned him down. The filmmaker himself struggled to spin the 1990 production\u0027s many plates amid reports of rising on-set troubles that were all witnessed and documented in Julie Salmon\u0027s follow-up book, The Devil\u0027s Candy.1991 gangster film Billy Bathgate, which stars Dustin Hoffman and Nicole Kidman, did no justice to EL Doctorow\u0027s beloved 1989 novel. With the efforts of Oscar-winning Kramer vs Kramer director Robert Benton and a script by Tom Stoppard, the film had all the ingredients to become as good as The Godfather, Scarface, and Goodfellas. Instead, it was a hollow adaptation, largely because all the magic was lost with the absence of the central character\u0027s narration – a huge reason behind the novel\u0027s success.The Scarlet Letter (1995) is ranked as one of the worst book adaptations ever made and for good reason. Described by DH Lawrence as “a perfect work of the American imagination, the book was handed a Hollywood makeover that found itself the brunt of ridicule after flopping at the box office. Director Roland Joffé strayed so far from Nathaniel Hawthorne\u0027s pages that what should have been an enticing romance became an extremely throwaway erotic drama.  To be fair, few would be able to turn L Ron Hubbard’s allegedly Scientology-inspired Battlefield Earth (2000) into something decent. This John Travolta-with-dreadlocks epic has since gone down in “Worst Movies Ever” infamy, effectively ending Travolta’s mainstream movie career and destroying Barry Pepper’s before it even started.  Louis de Bernières\u0027s Captain Corelli\u0027s Mandolin was one of the biggest literary successes of the 1990s, but the 2001 film version – from the same British company that made Notting Hill – lost all traces of the novel\u0027s heart and soul. The dialogue is disastrous and lead stars Nicolas Cage (Captain Corelli) and Penélope Cruz (Pelagia) lack any chemistry. It may look pretty, but this adaptation was a complete mistake.  The beauty of HG Wells’s 1895 science fiction novella The Time Machine was lost amid all the CGI in this insipid 2002 adaptation, which was directed by Wells\u0027s great-grandson, Simon. Everything featured, including Guy Pearce\u0027s lead performance, is wooden apart from the copper time travel contraption at the heart of the story.There have been just as many disappointing Stephen King adaptations as there have been successful ones, but Dreamcatcher sits at the bottom of that list. The talent was present (Damian Lewis! Morgan Freeman! Timothy Olyphant!), but the end product never once correlates to anything at all decent. The film\u0027s late-stage swerve into monster movie territory is nothing short of dreadful.Before he took on the role of 007, Daniel Craig starred in this adaptation of Ian McEwan’s novel about people whose lives become entangled after witnessing a deadly accident. While Craig’s performance as college lecturer Joe, along with Rhys Ifans as Jed – the man who becomes obsessed with him – are convincing, the film allows little time for character development and suffers because of it.Nick Hornby adaptations don’t inherently need to be set in the UK (the John Cusack-starring High Fidelity, if you like that sort of thing, is something of a classic, after all), but they do need to translate the fussy, infuriating male neuroses of his novels. The Perfect Catch is the 2005 US adaptation of Hornby’s Fever Pitch, released a decade after Colin Firth starred in his own British adaptation, and transforms the source material into a more throwaway and uninteresting big-city romcom. Drew Barrymore, in a \u0027girlfriend’ role significantly beefed up in comparison to Hornby’s novel, is great, but watching her try and source chemistry with a shrill and unappealing Jimmy Fallon (in one of his rare, pre-talk show acting roles) is harrowing.The Da Vinci Code is a stinker of the highest order. Its sequels, Angels \u0026amp Demons (2009) and Inferno (2016), are also awful films, but the reason the initial Dan Brown adaptation ranks as the worst is because the others wouldn\u0027t have existed had this one not been so successful.20th Century Fox clearly wanted Eragon to be their answer to Harry Potter, but the terrible reviews stopped that plan dead in its tracks. Eragon is the worst kind of fantasy adaptation – one where all of the source materials\u0027 sense of fantastical vibrancy disappears during its translation to the big screen.1426 Running with Scissors (2006)Augusten Burroughs’s Running with Scissors consistently walks a dangerous tightrope between manic farce and adolescent horror tale. Ryan Murphy’s adaptation, released in 2006, collapses beneath such a task. You can see why Murphy, for his feature film debut, would be attracted to a tale of neurotic family dysfunction and sexual awakening as they are themes that crop up in many of his TV shows (Glee, American Horror Story, etc). But this adaptation is a tonal misfire from start to finish, despite the best efforts of an all-star cast that includes Annette Bening, Gwyneth Paltrow, Evan Rachel Wood and Brian Cox. It’s no wonder this sunk without a trace. In another case of Hollywood throwing money at something in the belief that will be enough, Philip Pullman’s superb His Dark Materials trilogy – or rather, the first book Northern Lights – was condensed into an agonising mess of CGI and hammy acting in 2007\u0027s The Golden Compass. Much of the blame went to the fact that Hollywood, where God is thanked above anyone else at the Oscars, would likely be uncomfortable handling material that was so critical of the Catholic church. It also suffered by trying to condense an overwhelming amount of information into the opening few scenes. A forthcoming BBC adaptation starring James McAvoy and Lin-Manuel Miranda looks far more promising.Where to start with this disaster of a film? Audrey Niffenegger’s The Time Traveller\u0027s Wife is beautifully and convincingly written, but there\u0027s nothing convincing about its adaptation. Producers thought casting two major Hollywood stars was a good idea, but Rachel McAdams and Eric Bana had zero chemistry. Cloud Atlas (2012) is by no means a disaster, but it\u0027s meandering plot lines, sketchy pacing and often questionable acting (Hanks has never been dodgier) do David Mitchell\u0027s sprawling, inventive novel a disservice. Still, it\u0027s an enjoyable Wachowskis romp that features Hugh Grant as a cannibal tribesman, so it has that going for it.Fans of The Hobbit did not expect the novel, so short and sweet and set in such a familiar and adored world, to be messed up by The Lord of the Rings maestro Peter Jackson – but that’s exactly what happened. While the trilogy of Hobbit films were a box-office success, they came under fire from critics for stretching the book\u0027s material too thin. Third outing, The Battle of Five Armies, was the worst received of all three.  The film adaptation of the profoundly moving and dark tale The Book Thief, which follows a young girl in Nazi Germany, is tonally off from the first scene. The glossy cinematography and excessively sentimental score jar with its grim subject matter and the performances verge on caricature. It doesn\u0027t help that all of the English dialogue is spoken with a German accent.No adaptation of The Great Gatsby,  F Scott Fitzgerald’s most famous work, has managed to capture the excess, glamour and underlying sleaze of the roaring Twenties. Baz Luhrmann\u0027s 2013 version was fun and arguably the best at revealing the insecurities of (a brilliant) Leonardo DiCaprio’s Gatsby. However, the flashiness of the production stripped away all of Fitzgerald’s delicate story-telling.Disgraced producer Harvey Weinstein’s fingerprints are all over this messy adaptation of Young Adult novel The Giver (2014), which attempts to fuse a sincere, thoughtful allegory with a Twilight-style love story backed up by action fresh from The Hunger Games  and a Taylor Swift cameo. By attempting to appeal to every single teenager all at once, though, The Giver loses sight of its fascinating dystopian premise and gives its eccentric cast (among them Jeff Bridges, Meryl Streep, Alexander Skarsgård and Katie Holmes) very little to do.  John Niven\u0027s Kill Your Friends is a blistering, debauched exploration into the life of a cocaine-sniffing record label agent. It passes by in the blink of an eye, which can\u0027t be said for its adaptation. The film, released in 2015, tries so hard to nail what Niven achieves so fluidly and it shows – the result is nothing short of embarrassing with the clean-cut Nicholas Hoult failing to convince as the sociopathic Steven Stelfox.2326 The Girl on the Train (2016)Although it will always exist in the shadow of Gillian Flynn’s ingenious thriller Gone Girl, The Girl on the Train is an undeniably pacy and intelligent novel. But it was completely let down by this US film adaptation. The 2016 release, starring Emily Blunt, is cheesy and lacking in nuance – and criminally takes the story away from its original gritty London setting, plonking the characters down in glossy New York for no apparent reason. The 2016 adaptation of Me Before You, starring Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin, was brutally panned by critics for being emotionally manipulative. Its bad acting and problematic premise didn\u0027t help, either. Clarke\u0027s performance as the paid companion to Claflin’s quadriplegic was in particular criticised for being offensively exaggerated.  While not the same calibre of flop as Dreamcatcher, The Dark Tower is a fine example of a botched attempt at adapting one of Stephen King\u0027s finest works. With Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey in the lead roles as the heroic and villainous characters caught in a fated tussle, it should have soared – but a rush job such as Nikolaj Arcel\u0027s 2017 film is no way to treat such an expansive piece of work. Despite magnetic performances from Saoirse Ronan and Billy Howle, this adaptation of Ian McEwan\u0027s On Chesil Beach was weighed down by a turgid script and clumsy old-age make-up. The finished product is worlds away from the McEwan adaptation that Ronan previously starred in –\u0026nbspthe Oscar-winning drama Atonement (2007).Dune was never going to be an easy book to turn into a two-hour action movie – and David Lynch’s attempt is proof that it should be best left alone. The director\u0027s adaptation is a nonsensical, deeply convoluted disaster that wastes an enjoyably oddball cast. It\u0027s the only one of Lynch\u0027s films the director has publicly disowned.

The film adaptation of the profoundly moving and dark tale The Book Thief, which follows a young girl in Nazi Germany, is tonally off from the first scene. The glossy cinematography and excessively sentimental score jar with its grim subject matter and the performances verge on caricature. It doesn\u0027t help that all of the English dialogue is spoken with a German accent.No adaptation of The Great Gatsby,  F Scott Fitzgerald’s most famous work, has managed to capture the excess, glamour and underlying sleaze of the roaring Twenties. Baz Luhrmann\u0027s 2013 version was fun and arguably the best at revealing the insecurities of (a brilliant) Leonardo DiCaprio’s Gatsby. However, the flashiness of the production stripped away all of Fitzgerald’s delicate story-telling.Disgraced producer Harvey Weinstein’s fingerprints are all over this messy adaptation of Young Adult novel The Giver (2014), which attempts to fuse a sincere, thoughtful allegory with a Twilight-style love story backed up by action fresh from The Hunger Games  and a Taylor Swift cameo. By attempting to appeal to every single teenager all at once, though, The Giver loses sight of its fascinating dystopian premise and gives its eccentric cast (among them Jeff Bridges, Meryl Streep, Alexander Skarsgård and Katie Holmes) very little to do.  John Niven\u0027s Kill Your Friends is a blistering, debauched exploration into the life of a cocaine-sniffing record label agent. It passes by in the blink of an eye, which can\u0027t be said for its adaptation. The film, released in 2015, tries so hard to nail what Niven achieves so fluidly and it shows – the result is nothing short of embarrassing with the clean-cut Nicholas Hoult failing to convince as the sociopathic Steven Stelfox.2326 The Girl on the Train (2016)Although it will always exist in the shadow of Gillian Flynn’s ingenious thriller Gone Girl, The Girl on the Train is an undeniably pacy and intelligent novel. But it was completely let down by this US film adaptation. The 2016 release, starring Emily Blunt, is cheesy and lacking in nuance – and criminally takes the story away from its original gritty London setting, plonking the characters down in glossy New York for no apparent reason. The 2016 adaptation of Me Before You, starring Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin, was brutally panned by critics for being emotionally manipulative. Its bad acting and problematic premise didn\u0027t help, either. Clarke\u0027s performance as the paid companion to Claflin’s quadriplegic was in particular criticised for being offensively exaggerated.  While not the same calibre of flop as Dreamcatcher, The Dark Tower is a fine example of a botched attempt at adapting one of Stephen King\u0027s finest works. With Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey in the lead roles as the heroic and villainous characters caught in a fated tussle, it should have soared – but a rush job such as Nikolaj Arcel\u0027s 2017 film is no way to treat such an expansive piece of work. Despite magnetic performances from Saoirse Ronan and Billy Howle, this adaptation of Ian McEwan\u0027s On Chesil Beach was weighed down by a turgid script and clumsy old-age make-up. The finished product is worlds away from the McEwan adaptation that Ronan previously starred in –\u0026nbspthe Oscar-winning drama Atonement (2007).If you do so in Google Street View, you will find yourself at the bottom of the vertiginous flight of stairs.Staircases such as the one seen in\u0026nbspJoker\u0026nbspare known as “step streets” in New York City and can most often be found in the Bronx and upper Manhattan.They were created to allow pedestrians to circulate in hilly areas of the city where motorised transportation wasn’t an option.\u0026nbspThe longest step street in the city is located in the Bronx on 230th Street and covers three blocks between Riverdale and Netherland\u0026nbspAvenues.\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave. That’s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called “the future of music”. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey240 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha FranklinWhen Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself. The Queen of Soul gave herself the same space. You can hear her listening to the band, biding her time before firing up her voice to demand R-E-S-P-E-C-T 50 years before the #MeToo movement. Helen Brown340 Master of Puppets (1986), MetallicaDespite not featuring any singles, Metallica’s third album was the UK rock radio breakthrough they’d been looking for. In 1986, they released one of the best metal records of all time, which dealt with the potency and very nature of control, meshing beauty and raw human ugliness together on tracks like “Damage Inc” and “Orion”. This album is about storytelling – the medieval-influenced guitar picks on opener “Battery” should be enough to tell you that. Although that was really the only medieval imagery they conjured up – they ripped Dungeons \u0026amp Dragons clichés out of the lyrics and replaced them with the apocalypse, with bassist Cliff Burton, drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett and singerrhythm guitarist James Hetfield serving as the four horsemen. Roisin O’Connor440 Remain in Light (1980), Talking Heads“Facts are simple and facts are straight  Facts are lazy and facts are late…” sang David Byrne, submerging personal and planetary anxieties about fake news and conspicuous consumption in dense, layers and loops of Afrobeat-indebted funk. Propulsive polyrhythms drive against the lyrical pleas for us to stop and take stock. Same as it ever was. HB540 Catch a Fire (Jamaican version) (1973), Bob Marley and the WailersThe album that carried reggae music to the four corners of the Earth and made Bob Marley an international superstar also set the political tone for many artists to follow. Marley sang of life “where the living is hardest” in “Concrete Jungle” and looked back to Jamaica’s ignoble slaving past – “No chains around my feet but I’m not free”. He packed the album with beautiful melodic numbers, such as “High Tide and Low Tide”, and rhythmic dance tracks like “Kinky Reggae”. Released outside of Jamaica by Island Records with guitar overdubs and ornamentation, the original Jamaican version is a stripped-down masterpiece. CHAn unprecedented 220 hours of studio experimentation saw George Martin and The Beatles looping, speeding, slowing and spooling tapes backwards to create a terrifically trippy new sound. The mournful enigma of McCartney’s “For No One” and the psychedelia of Lennon’s “Tomorrow Never Knows” and “She Said, She Said” can still leave you standing hypnotised over the spinning vinyl, wondering if the music is coming out or being sucked back in. HBIt may be the most “serious” album she’s ever made, yet Like a Prayer is still Madonna at her most accessible – pulling no punches in topics from religion to the dissolution of her marriage. In 1989, Madonna’s personal life was tabloid fodder: a tumultuous marriage to actor Sean Penn finally ended in orce, and she was causing controversy with the “Like a Prayer” video and its burning crosses. On the gospel abandon of the title track, she takes the listener’s breath away with her sheer ambition. Where her past records had been reflections of the modern music that influenced her – Like a Prayer saw her pay homage to bands like Sly \u0026amp the Family Stone, and Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel. The album was also about an artist taking control over her own narrative, after releasing records that asked the audience – and the press – to like her. ROMillennials coming at this album can end up feeling like the guy who saw Hamlet and complained it was all quotations. Jimmy Page’s juggernaut riffs and Robert Plant’s hedonistic wails set the bench mark for all subsequent heavy, hedonistic rock. But it’s worth playing the whole thing to experience the full mystic, monolithic ritual of the thing. Stairway? Undeniable. HB940 The Best of the Shangri-Las (1996), The Shangri-LasOh no. Oh no. Oh no no no no no, no one ever did teen heartbreak quite like the Shangri-Las. Long before the Spice Girls packaged attitude for popular consumption, songwriter Ellie Greenwich was having trouble with a group of teenagers who had grown up in a tough part of Queen’s – “with their gestures, and language, and chewing the gum and the stockings ripped up their legs”. But the Shangri-Las sang with an ardour that was so streetwise, passionate and raw that it still reaches across more than half a century without losing any of its power. Leader of the Pack (co-written by Greenwich) may be their best-known song, but they were never a novelty act. This compilation captures them at their early Sixties peak. CH1040 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), David BowieFlamboyance, excess, eccentricity – this is the breakthrough album that asserted Bowie as glam rock’s new icon, surpassing T Rex. He may have come to rue his Ziggy Stardust character, but with it, Bowie transcended artists seeking authenticity via more mundane means. It was his most ambitious album – musically and thematically – that, like Prince, saw him unite his greatest strengths from previous works and pull off one of the great rock and roll albums without losing his sense of humour, or the wish to continue entertaining his fans. “I’m out to bloody entertain, not just get up onstage and knock out a few songs,” he declared. “I’m the last person to pretend I’m a radio. I’d rather go out and be a colour television set.” ROIn their brief career, ended by the suicide of 23-year-old singer Ian Curtis, Joy Division created two candidates for the best album by anyone ever. Closer may be a final flowering, but Unknown Pleasures is more tonally consistent, utterly unlike anything before or since. The mood is an all-pervading ink-black darkness, but there is a spiritual force coming out of the grooves that is so far beyond pop or rock, it feels almost Dostoevskyan. There are classic songs – Disorder, She’s Lost Control and New Dawn Fades – and for those who’d swap every note Eric Clapton ever played for one of Peter Hook’s basslines, the sequence at 4:20 on I Remember Nothing is perhaps the single most thrilling moment in the entire Joy Division catalogue. CHThough her 1971 album, Blue, is usually chosen for these kinds of lists, Mitchell surpassed its silvery, heartbroken folk five years later with a record that found her confidently questioning its culturally conditioned expectations of womanhood. Against an ambiguous, jazzy landscape, her deepening, difficult voice weighs romance and domesticity against the adventure of “strange pillows” and solitude. HBThe answer to whether Robyn could follow up the brilliance of her self-titled 2005 album came in a burst of releases in 2010, the EPs Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt3, and this 15-track effort, essentially a compilation album. It includes different versions of some tracks, such as the non-acoustic version of “Hang With Me” (and we can argue all night about that one), but leaves well alone when it comes to the single greatest electronic dance track since “I Feel Love”, “Dancing On My Own”. Body Talk is simply jammed with great songs. CH “I will study and look back on the whole world of entertainment and perfect it,” wrote Jackson as he turned 21 and shook off his cute, controlled child-star imagery to release his jubilant, fourth solo album. Produced by Quincy Jones, the sophisticated disco funk nails the balance between tight, tendon-twanging grooves and liberated euphoria. Glitter ball magic. HBHow good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music – not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densely-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.” ROThis is the album that changes everything. The synthesised sounds coming out of Kraftwerk’s Kling-Klang studios had already become pure and beautiful on 1975’s Radio-Activity, but on Trans-Europe Express, their sophistication subtly shifts all future possibilities. The familiar quality of human sweetness and melancholy in Ralf Hutter’s voice is subsumed into the machine as rhythms interlock and bloom in side two’s mini-symphony that begins with the title track. Released four months before Giorgio Moroder’s I Feel Love, Trans-Europe Express influenced everything from hip-hop to techno. All electronic dance music starts here. CH1740 Kind of Blue (1959), Miles DavisWith the sketches of melody only written down hours before recording, the world’s best-selling jazz record still feels spontaneous and unpredictable. Davis’s friend George Russell once explained that the secret of its tonal jazz was to use every note in a scale “without having to meet the deadline of a particular chord”. Kind of Blue is unrepeatably cool. HB“If I ventured in the slipstream, between the viaducts of your dream…” To enter this musical cathedral, where folk, jazz and blue-eyed soul meet is always to feel a sense of awe. Recorded in just two eight-hour sessions, in which Morrison first played the songs to the assembled musicians then told them to do their own thing, Astral Weeks still feels as if it was made yesterday. Morrison’s stream-of-consciousness lyrics within the richness of the acoustic setting – double bass, classical guitar and flute – make this as emotionally affecting an album as any in rock and pop. CH“Life is all right in America  If you\u0027re all white in America” yelp the immigrants in this passionate and political musical relocating of Romeo and Juliet to Fifites New York. Leonard Bernstein’s sophisticated score is a melting pot of pop, classical and Latin music Stephen Sondheim’s lyrics sharp as a flick knife. An unanswered prayer for a united and forgiving USA. HB2040 Sign o\u0027 the Times (1987), PrinceSign o’ the Times is Prince’s magnum opus from a catalogue of masterworks – a double album ning funk, rock, R\u0026ampB and most essentially, soul. It is the greatest articulation of his alchemic experiments with musical fusion – the sum of several projects Prince was working on during his most creatively fruitful year. On Sign o’ the Times, the bass is king – Prince cemented his guitar god status on Purple Rain. There are tracks that drip with sex, and love songs like “Adore”, which remains one of the greatest of all time. Stitched together with the utmost care, as if he were writing a play with a beginning, a middle and an end, the album is a landmark in both pop and in art. ROCaught in the psychological undertow of family trauma and all those commercial surf songs, 23-year-old Brian Wilson had a panic attack and retreated to the studio to write this dreamlike series of songs whose structural tides washed them way beyond the preppy formulas of drugstore jukeboxes. Notes pinged from vibraphones and coke cans gleam in the strange, sad waves of bittersweet melody. HBWeave a circle round her thrice… Joanna Newsom is dismissed by some as kookily faux-naif, but her second album, before she trained out the childlike quality from her voice, may be the most enchanted record ever made. At times, she sounds other-worldly, sitting at her harp, singing to herself of sassafras and Sisyphus, but then a phrase will carry you off suddenly to the heart’s depths – “Still, my dear, I’d have walked you to the edge of the water”. Ys’s pleasures are not simple or immediate. Newsom’s unusual song structures, with their fragmented melodies, and strange and beautiful orchestral arrangements by 63-year-old Van Dyke Parks, take time to work their magic. But once you’re bewitched, Ys’s spell never wears off. CH2340 It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (1988), Public EnemyPublic Enemy’s second album is hip-hop’s game-changing moment, where a new musical form that arrived fully born after years of development away from meddling outsiders found its radical voice. It Takes a Nation of Millions… is still one of the most powerful, provocative albums ever made, “Here is a land that never gave a damn  About a brother like me,” raps Chuck D on “Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos”. Producer Hank Shocklee creates a hard-edged sound from samples that pay homage to soul greats such as James Brown and Isaac Hayes, and Flavor Flav gives it an unmistakeable zest. CH2440 Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Pink FloydIt’s easy to knock these white, male, middle-class proggers, with their spaceship full of technology and their monolithic ambitions. But the walloping drums, operatic howls and “quiet desperation” of this concept album about the various forms of madness still resonates with the unbalanced, overwhelmed and alienated parts of us all. Play loud, alone and after dark. HB2540 The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998), Lauryn HillLauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with this immense and groundbreaking work. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around. ROThe great French singer-songwriter provocateur probably wouldn’t get too many takers today for a concept album about a tender love between his middle-aged self and a teenage girl he knocks off her bicycle in his Rolls-Royce. But, musically, this cult album is sublime, an extraordinary collision of funk bass, spoken-word lyrics and Jean-Claude Vannier’s heavenly string arrangements. “Ballade de Melody Nelson”, sung by Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, is one of his most sublimely gorgeous songs. CHThere’s nothing contrived about Karen Dalton’s ability to flip out the guts of familiar songs and give them a dry, cracked folk-blues twist. Expanding the emotional and narrative boundaries of songs like Percy Sledge’s When a Man Loves a Woman is just what she did. Why has it taken the world so long to appreciate her? HB“Goddamn Europeans, take me back to beautiful England.” PJ Harvey may have sounded like she was channelling Boris and Nige when she made this striking album in 2015, but few Brexiteers would want to take this journey with her. Let England Shake digs deep into the soil of the land, where buried plowshares lie waiting to be beaten into swords. Death is everywhere, sometimes in its most visceral form: “I’ve seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat,” she sings on “The Words That Maketh Murder”, “Arms and legs are in the trees.” Musically, though, it’s ravishing: Harvey employs autoharp, zither, rhodes piano, xylophone and trombone to create a futuristic folk sound that’s strikingly original yet could almost be from an earlier century. CH2940 Boy in da Corner (2003), Dizzee RascalIt’s staggering to listen back to this album and remember Dizzee was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk. RO3040 Hounds of Love (1985), Kate BushProof that a woman could satisfy her unique artistic vision and top the charts without kowtowing to industry expectations, Kate Bush’s self-produced masterpiece explored the extreme range of her oceanic emotions from the seclusion of a cutting-edge studio built in the garden of her 17th-century farmhouse. The human vulnerability of her voice and traditional instruments are given an electrical charge by her pioneering use of synthesisers. Thrilling and immersive. HBA uniquely British take on hip hop and soul that continues to influence booming modern genres like grime and dubstep, the Bristol collective’s debut gave a cool new pulse to the nation’s grit and grey. You can smell ashtrays on greasy spoon tables in Tricky’s whisper and feel the rain on your face in Shara Nelson’s exhilarating improvisations. HBIt only takes 20 seconds of opening track Bone Machine to realise Pixies and producer Steve Albini have stripped down the sound of rock ’n’ roll and rebuilt it piece by piece. The angry smack of Led Zep drums, ripe bass, and sheet metal guitar straight off the Stooges’ Detroit production line are separated and recombined. Pixies’ sound is already complete before Black Francis embarks on one of his elusive pop cult narratives (“your bone’s got a little machine”). The tension between the savagery of his vocals and Kim Deal’s softer melodic tone won’t reach its perfect balance until their next album but their debut, Surfer Rosa is gigantic, and deserving of big, big love. Its “loud, quiet, loud” tectonics would prove so influential that Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain would later say he “was basically trying to rip off the Pixies”. CH3340 Talking Timbuktu (1994), Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder If you ever doubt the possibility of relaxed and respectful conversation across the world’s cultural isions, then give yourself an hour with this astonishing collaboration between Mali’s Ali Farka Toure (who wrote all but one of the tracks) and California’s Ry Cooder (whose slide guitar travels through them like a pilgrim). Desert meets Delta Blues. HBCompared to the blues, the incalculable influence of gospel music on pop, soul and rock ’n’ roll has been underplayed. It can be found in every song on this brilliant 27-track compilation. If you can’t hear James Brown in the foot-stomping opener “Move on Up a Little Higher” by Brother Joe May, you’re not listening hard enough. The road to Motown from “Lord, Lord, Lord” by Professor Alex Bradford is narrow indeed, but you could still take a side-turning and follow his ecstatic whoops straight to Little Richard, who borrowed them, and on to the Beatles who copied them from him. The swooping chord changes in James Cleveland’s “My Soul Looks Back” are magnificent. All the irreplaceable soul voices, from Aretha Franklin to Bobby Womack, were steeped in gospel. This is a great place to hear where they came from. Companion album The Great Gospel Women is a marvel, too. CH“A lot of the music scene is just a wanking, self-congratulatory boys club,” said this angel-voiced, transgender artist in 2012. Four years later, the seismic drums and radical ecofeminist agenda of Hopelessness shook that club’s crumbling foundations to dust. The horrors of drone warfare, paedophilia and global warming are held up to the bright lights in disconcertingly beautiful rage. HBKurt Cobain had one goal with In Utero: to pull Nirvana away from what he dubbed the “candy-ass” sound on Nevermind – the album that had turned them into one of the biggest rock bands on the planet – and take them back to punk-rock. He asked Pixies’ producer Steve Albini to oversee production.  It didn’t exactly eschew commercial success upon release (it went on to sell 15m copies worldwide), but the heaviness the band felt as they recorded it bears down on the listener from the opening track. Disheartened by the media obsession with his personal life and the fans clamouring for the same old shit, In Utero is pure, undiluted rage. “GO AWAYYYYYYYYYYY” he screams on “Scentless Apprentice”, capturing the essence of Patrick Suskind’s novel Perfume: Story of a Murderer and using it as a metaphor for his disgust at the music industry, and the press. ROCurtis Mayfield had been spinning golden soul music from doo-wop roots with The Impressions for more than a decade before releasing his first solo album, which contains some of his greatest songs. While some point to the 1972 Blaxploitation soundtrack Superfly as the definitive Mayfield album, Curtis is deeper and more joyous, its complex arrangements masterly. Mayfield’s sweet falsetto sings of Nixon’s bland reassurances over the fuzz-bass of “(Don’t Worry) If There Is a Hell Below We’re All Going to Go” doleful horns give the politically conscious “We the People Who Are Darker Than Blue” a profound emotional undertow “Move On Up” is simply one of the most exhilarating songs in pop. To spend time with Curtis is to be in the presence of a beautiful soul. CHBefore they went their own way, Fleetwood Mac decided to tell a story that would be the quintessential marker for American rock culture in the Seventies. As Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks tossed the charred remains of their relationship at one another on “Dreams” and “Go Your Own Way”, the rest of the band conjured up the warm West Coast harmonies, the laid back California vibes of the rhythm section and the clear highs on “Gold Dust Woman”, in such a way that Rumours would become the definitive sound of the era. At the time of its release, it was the fastest-selling LP of all time its success turned Fleetwood Mac into a cultural phenomenon. ROA virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Hendrix used Are You Experienced? to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced? the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. RODisco’s crowning glory is this album that Chic’s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards made with Kathy Sledge and her sisters Debbie, Joni and Kim. Nile and ’Nard were at the peak of their powers, classic songs were pouring out of them – We Are Family was released in the same year as the epochal “Good Times” by Chic – and this album has four of them, “Lost in Music”, “He’s the Greatest Dancer”, “Thinking of You” and the title track itself. Sister Sledge gave Rodgers a chance to work with warmer, gutsier vocals than the cool voices he used to give Chic records such laid-back style and the result is a floor-filling dance party, punctuated by mellow ballads. CHIt was Andy Warhol who wanted Lou Reed and John Cale to let his beautiful new friend Nico sing with their avant-garde rock band. Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave. That’s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called “the future of music”. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey240 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha FranklinWhen Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself. The Queen of Soul gave herself the same space. You can hear her listening to the band, biding her time before firing up her voice to demand R-E-S-P-E-C-T 50 years before the #MeToo movement. Helen Brown340 Master of Puppets (1986), MetallicaDespite not featuring any singles, Metallica’s third album was the UK rock radio breakthrough they’d been looking for. In 1986, they released one of the best metal records of all time, which dealt with the potency and very nature of control, meshing beauty and raw human ugliness together on tracks like “Damage Inc” and “Orion”. This album is about storytelling – the medieval-influenced guitar picks on opener “Battery” should be enough to tell you that. Although that was really the only medieval imagery they conjured up – they ripped Dungeons \u0026amp Dragons clichés out of the lyrics and replaced them with the apocalypse, with bassist Cliff Burton, drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett and singerrhythm guitarist James Hetfield serving as the four horsemen. Roisin O’Connor440 Remain in Light (1980), Talking Heads“Facts are simple and facts are straight  Facts are lazy and facts are late…” sang David Byrne, submerging personal and planetary anxieties about fake news and conspicuous consumption in dense, layers and loops of Afrobeat-indebted funk. Propulsive polyrhythms drive against the lyrical pleas for us to stop and take stock. Same as it ever was. HB540 Catch a Fire (Jamaican version) (1973), Bob Marley and the WailersThe album that carried reggae music to the four corners of the Earth and made Bob Marley an international superstar also set the political tone for many artists to follow. Marley sang of life “where the living is hardest” in “Concrete Jungle” and looked back to Jamaica’s ignoble slaving past – “No chains around my feet but I’m not free”. He packed the album with beautiful melodic numbers, such as “High Tide and Low Tide”, and rhythmic dance tracks like “Kinky Reggae”. Released outside of Jamaica by Island Records with guitar overdubs and ornamentation, the original Jamaican version is a stripped-down masterpiece. CHAn unprecedented 220 hours of studio experimentation saw George Martin and The Beatles looping, speeding, slowing and spooling tapes backwards to create a terrifically trippy new sound. The mournful enigma of McCartney’s “For No One” and the psychedelia of Lennon’s “Tomorrow Never Knows” and “She Said, She Said” can still leave you standing hypnotised over the spinning vinyl, wondering if the music is coming out or being sucked back in. HBIt may be the most “serious” album she’s ever made, yet Like a Prayer is still Madonna at her most accessible – pulling no punches in topics from religion to the dissolution of her marriage. In 1989, Madonna’s personal life was tabloid fodder: a tumultuous marriage to actor Sean Penn finally ended in orce, and she was causing controversy with the “Like a Prayer” video and its burning crosses. On the gospel abandon of the title track, she takes the listener’s breath away with her sheer ambition. Where her past records had been reflections of the modern music that influenced her – Like a Prayer saw her pay homage to bands like Sly \u0026amp the Family Stone, and Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel. The album was also about an artist taking control over her own narrative, after releasing records that asked the audience – and the press – to like her. ROMillennials coming at this album can end up feeling like the guy who saw Hamlet and complained it was all quotations. Jimmy Page’s juggernaut riffs and Robert Plant’s hedonistic wails set the bench mark for all subsequent heavy, hedonistic rock. But it’s worth playing the whole thing to experience the full mystic, monolithic ritual of the thing. Stairway? Undeniable. HB940 The Best of the Shangri-Las (1996), The Shangri-LasOh no. Oh no. Oh no no no no no, no one ever did teen heartbreak quite like the Shangri-Las. Long before the Spice Girls packaged attitude for popular consumption, songwriter Ellie Greenwich was having trouble with a group of teenagers who had grown up in a tough part of Queen’s – “with their gestures, and language, and chewing the gum and the stockings ripped up their legs”. But the Shangri-Las sang with an ardour that was so streetwise, passionate and raw that it still reaches across more than half a century without losing any of its power. Leader of the Pack (co-written by Greenwich) may be their best-known song, but they were never a novelty act. This compilation captures them at their early Sixties peak. CH1040 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), David BowieFlamboyance, excess, eccentricity – this is the breakthrough album that asserted Bowie as glam rock’s new icon, surpassing T Rex. He may have come to rue his Ziggy Stardust character, but with it, Bowie transcended artists seeking authenticity via more mundane means. It was his most ambitious album – musically and thematically – that, like Prince, saw him unite his greatest strengths from previous works and pull off one of the great rock and roll albums without losing his sense of humour, or the wish to continue entertaining his fans. “I’m out to bloody entertain, not just get up onstage and knock out a few songs,” he declared. “I’m the last person to pretend I’m a radio. I’d rather go out and be a colour television set.” ROIn their brief career, ended by the suicide of 23-year-old singer Ian Curtis, Joy Division created two candidates for the best album by anyone ever. Closer may be a final flowering, but Unknown Pleasures is more tonally consistent, utterly unlike anything before or since. The mood is an all-pervading ink-black darkness, but there is a spiritual force coming out of the grooves that is so far beyond pop or rock, it feels almost Dostoevskyan. There are classic songs – Disorder, She’s Lost Control and New Dawn Fades – and for those who’d swap every note Eric Clapton ever played for one of Peter Hook’s basslines, the sequence at 4:20 on I Remember Nothing is perhaps the single most thrilling moment in the entire Joy Division catalogue. CHThough her 1971 album, Blue, is usually chosen for these kinds of lists, Mitchell surpassed its silvery, heartbroken folk five years later with a record that found her confidently questioning its culturally conditioned expectations of womanhood. Against an ambiguous, jazzy landscape, her deepening, difficult voice weighs romance and domesticity against the adventure of “strange pillows” and solitude. HBThe answer to whether Robyn could follow up the brilliance of her self-titled 2005 album came in a burst of releases in 2010, the EPs Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt3, and this 15-track effort, essentially a compilation album. It includes different versions of some tracks, such as the non-acoustic version of “Hang With Me” (and we can argue all night about that one), but leaves well alone when it comes to the single greatest electronic dance track since “I Feel Love”, “Dancing On My Own”. Body Talk is simply jammed with great songs. CH “I will study and look back on the whole world of entertainment and perfect it,” wrote Jackson as he turned 21 and shook off his cute, controlled child-star imagery to release his jubilant, fourth solo album. Produced by Quincy Jones, the sophisticated disco funk nails the balance between tight, tendon-twanging grooves and liberated euphoria. Glitter ball magic. HBHow good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music – not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densely-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.” ROThis is the album that changes everything. The synthesised sounds coming out of Kraftwerk’s Kling-Klang studios had already become pure and beautiful on 1975’s Radio-Activity, but on Trans-Europe Express, their sophistication subtly shifts all future possibilities. The familiar quality of human sweetness and melancholy in Ralf Hutter’s voice is subsumed into the machine as rhythms interlock and bloom in side two’s mini-symphony that begins with the title track. Released four months before Giorgio Moroder’s I Feel Love, Trans-Europe Express influenced everything from hip-hop to techno. All electronic dance music starts here. CH1740 Kind of Blue (1959), Miles DavisWith the sketches of melody only written down hours before recording, the world’s best-selling jazz record still feels spontaneous and unpredictable. Davis’s friend George Russell once explained that the secret of its tonal jazz was to use every note in a scale “without having to meet the deadline of a particular chord”. Kind of Blue is unrepeatably cool. HB“If I ventured in the slipstream, between the viaducts of your dream…” To enter this musical cathedral, where folk, jazz and blue-eyed soul meet is always to feel a sense of awe. Recorded in just two eight-hour sessions, in which Morrison first played the songs to the assembled musicians then told them to do their own thing, Astral Weeks still feels as if it was made yesterday. Morrison’s stream-of-consciousness lyrics within the richness of the acoustic setting – double bass, classical guitar and flute – make this as emotionally affecting an album as any in rock and pop. CH“Life is all right in America  If you\u0027re all white in America” yelp the immigrants in this passionate and political musical relocating of Romeo and Juliet to Fifites New York. Leonard Bernstein’s sophisticated score is a melting pot of pop, classical and Latin music Stephen Sondheim’s lyrics sharp as a flick knife. An unanswered prayer for a united and forgiving USA. HB2040 Sign o\u0027 the Times (1987), PrinceSign o’ the Times is Prince’s magnum opus from a catalogue of masterworks – a double album ning funk, rock, R\u0026ampB and most essentially, soul. It is the greatest articulation of his alchemic experiments with musical fusion – the sum of several projects Prince was working on during his most creatively fruitful year. On Sign o’ the Times, the bass is king – Prince cemented his guitar god status on Purple Rain. There are tracks that drip with sex, and love songs like “Adore”, which remains one of the greatest of all time. Stitched together with the utmost care, as if he were writing a play with a beginning, a middle and an end, the album is a landmark in both pop and in art. ROCaught in the psychological undertow of family trauma and all those commercial surf songs, 23-year-old Brian Wilson had a panic attack and retreated to the studio to write this dreamlike series of songs whose structural tides washed them way beyond the preppy formulas of drugstore jukeboxes. Notes pinged from vibraphones and coke cans gleam in the strange, sad waves of bittersweet melody. HBWeave a circle round her thrice… Joanna Newsom is dismissed by some as kookily faux-naif, but her second album, before she trained out the childlike quality from her voice, may be the most enchanted record ever made. At times, she sounds other-worldly, sitting at her harp, singing to herself of sassafras and Sisyphus, but then a phrase will carry you off suddenly to the heart’s depths – “Still, my dear, I’d have walked you to the edge of the water”. Ys’s pleasures are not simple or immediate. Newsom’s unusual song structures, with their fragmented melodies, and strange and beautiful orchestral arrangements by 63-year-old Van Dyke Parks, take time to work their magic. But once you’re bewitched, Ys’s spell never wears off. CH2340 It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (1988), Public EnemyPublic Enemy’s second album is hip-hop’s game-changing moment, where a new musical form that arrived fully born after years of development away from meddling outsiders found its radical voice. It Takes a Nation of Millions… is still one of the most powerful, provocative albums ever made, “Here is a land that never gave a damn  About a brother like me,” raps Chuck D on “Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos”. Producer Hank Shocklee creates a hard-edged sound from samples that pay homage to soul greats such as James Brown and Isaac Hayes, and Flavor Flav gives it an unmistakeable zest. CH2440 Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Pink FloydIt’s easy to knock these white, male, middle-class proggers, with their spaceship full of technology and their monolithic ambitions. But the walloping drums, operatic howls and “quiet desperation” of this concept album about the various forms of madness still resonates with the unbalanced, overwhelmed and alienated parts of us all. Play loud, alone and after dark. HB2540 The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998), Lauryn HillLauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with this immense and groundbreaking work. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around. ROThe great French singer-songwriter provocateur probably wouldn’t get too many takers today for a concept album about a tender love between his middle-aged self and a teenage girl he knocks off her bicycle in his Rolls-Royce. But, musically, this cult album is sublime, an extraordinary collision of funk bass, spoken-word lyrics and Jean-Claude Vannier’s heavenly string arrangements. “Ballade de Melody Nelson”, sung by Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, is one of his most sublimely gorgeous songs. CHThere’s nothing contrived about Karen Dalton’s ability to flip out the guts of familiar songs and give them a dry, cracked folk-blues twist. Expanding the emotional and narrative boundaries of songs like Percy Sledge’s When a Man Loves a Woman is just what she did. Why has it taken the world so long to appreciate her? HB“Goddamn Europeans, take me back to beautiful England.” PJ Harvey may have sounded like she was channelling Boris and Nige when she made this striking album in 2015, but few Brexiteers would want to take this journey with her. Let England Shake digs deep into the soil of the land, where buried plowshares lie waiting to be beaten into swords. Death is everywhere, sometimes in its most visceral form: “I’ve seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat,” she sings on “The Words That Maketh Murder”, “Arms and legs are in the trees.” Musically, though, it’s ravishing: Harvey employs autoharp, zither, rhodes piano, xylophone and trombone to create a futuristic folk sound that’s strikingly original yet could almost be from an earlier century. CH2940 Boy in da Corner (2003), Dizzee RascalIt’s staggering to listen back to this album and remember Dizzee was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk. RO3040 Hounds of Love (1985), Kate BushProof that a woman could satisfy her unique artistic vision and top the charts without kowtowing to industry expectations, Kate Bush’s self-produced masterpiece explored the extreme range of her oceanic emotions from the seclusion of a cutting-edge studio built in the garden of her 17th-century farmhouse. The human vulnerability of her voice and traditional instruments are given an electrical charge by her pioneering use of synthesisers. Thrilling and immersive. HBA uniquely British take on hip hop and soul that continues to influence booming modern genres like grime and dubstep, the Bristol collective’s debut gave a cool new pulse to the nation’s grit and grey. You can smell ashtrays on greasy spoon tables in Tricky’s whisper and feel the rain on your face in Shara Nelson’s exhilarating improvisations. HBIt only takes 20 seconds of opening track Bone Machine to realise Pixies and producer Steve Albini have stripped down the sound of rock ’n’ roll and rebuilt it piece by piece. The angry smack of Led Zep drums, ripe bass, and sheet metal guitar straight off the Stooges’ Detroit production line are separated and recombined. Pixies’ sound is already complete before Black Francis embarks on one of his elusive pop cult narratives (“your bone’s got a little machine”). The tension between the savagery of his vocals and Kim Deal’s softer melodic tone won’t reach its perfect balance until their next album but their debut, Surfer Rosa is gigantic, and deserving of big, big love. Its “loud, quiet, loud” tectonics would prove so influential that Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain would later say he “was basically trying to rip off the Pixies”. CH3340 Talking Timbuktu (1994), Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder If you ever doubt the possibility of relaxed and respectful conversation across the world’s cultural isions, then give yourself an hour with this astonishing collaboration between Mali’s Ali Farka Toure (who wrote all but one of the tracks) and California’s Ry Cooder (whose slide guitar travels through them like a pilgrim). Desert meets Delta Blues. HBCompared to the blues, the incalculable influence of gospel music on pop, soul and rock ’n’ roll has been underplayed. It can be found in every song on this brilliant 27-track compilation. If you can’t hear James Brown in the foot-stomping opener “Move on Up a Little Higher” by Brother Joe May, you’re not listening hard enough. The road to Motown from “Lord, Lord, Lord” by Professor Alex Bradford is narrow indeed, but you could still take a side-turning and follow his ecstatic whoops straight to Little Richard, who borrowed them, and on to the Beatles who copied them from him. The swooping chord changes in James Cleveland’s “My Soul Looks Back” are magnificent. All the irreplaceable soul voices, from Aretha Franklin to Bobby Womack, were steeped in gospel. This is a great place to hear where they came from. Companion album The Great Gospel Women is a marvel, too. CH“A lot of the music scene is just a wanking, self-congratulatory boys club,” said this angel-voiced, transgender artist in 2012. Four years later, the seismic drums and radical ecofeminist agenda of Hopelessness shook that club’s crumbling foundations to dust. The horrors of drone warfare, paedophilia and global warming are held up to the bright lights in disconcertingly beautiful rage. HBKurt Cobain had one goal with In Utero: to pull Nirvana away from what he dubbed the “candy-ass” sound on Nevermind – the album that had turned them into one of the biggest rock bands on the planet – and take them back to punk-rock. He asked Pixies’ producer Steve Albini to oversee production.  It didn’t exactly eschew commercial success upon release (it went on to sell 15m copies worldwide), but the heaviness the band felt as they recorded it bears down on the listener from the opening track. Disheartened by the media obsession with his personal life and the fans clamouring for the same old shit, In Utero is pure, undiluted rage. “GO AWAYYYYYYYYYYY” he screams on “Scentless Apprentice”, capturing the essence of Patrick Suskind’s novel Perfume: Story of a Murderer and using it as a metaphor for his disgust at the music industry, and the press. ROCurtis Mayfield had been spinning golden soul music from doo-wop roots with The Impressions for more than a decade before releasing his first solo album, which contains some of his greatest songs. While some point to the 1972 Blaxploitation soundtrack Superfly as the definitive Mayfield album, Curtis is deeper and more joyous, its complex arrangements masterly. Mayfield’s sweet falsetto sings of Nixon’s bland reassurances over the fuzz-bass of “(Don’t Worry) If There Is a Hell Below We’re All Going to Go” doleful horns give the politically conscious “We the People Who Are Darker Than Blue” a profound emotional undertow “Move On Up” is simply one of the most exhilarating songs in pop. To spend time with Curtis is to be in the presence of a beautiful soul. CHBefore they went their own way, Fleetwood Mac decided to tell a story that would be the quintessential marker for American rock culture in the Seventies. As Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks tossed the charred remains of their relationship at one another on “Dreams” and “Go Your Own Way”, the rest of the band conjured up the warm West Coast harmonies, the laid back California vibes of the rhythm section and the clear highs on “Gold Dust Woman”, in such a way that Rumours would become the definitive sound of the era. At the time of its release, it was the fastest-selling LP of all time its success turned Fleetwood Mac into a cultural phenomenon. ROA virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Hendrix used Are You Experienced? to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced? the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. RODisco’s crowning glory is this album that Chic’s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards made with Kathy Sledge and her sisters Debbie, Joni and Kim. Nile and ’Nard were at the peak of their powers, classic songs were pouring out of them – We Are Family was released in the same year as the epochal “Good Times” by Chic – and this album has four of them, “Lost in Music”, “He’s the Greatest Dancer”, “Thinking of You” and the title track itself. Sister Sledge gave Rodgers a chance to work with warmer, gutsier vocals than the cool voices he used to give Chic records such laid-back style and the result is a floor-filling dance party, punctuated by mellow ballads.

Not only did Alfred Hitchcock never win an Oscar (save for his memorial award in 1968), neither did any of his films - one of which is Vertigo, a classic that won Sight \u0026amp Sound\u0027s once-a-decade greatest films of all time poll in 2012.One of the films that kickstarted the New Hollywood Cinema, The Graduate may have won director Mike Nichols an Oscar, but ultimately lost out to Norman Jewison\u0027s In the Heat of the night.

That Ridley Scott\u0027s latest sci-fi The Martian received seven nominations could signal how the Academy are finally taking responsibility for their past errors.Having awarded both The Godfather parts I and II Best Picture in 1972 and 1974 respectively, you\u0027d think Scorsese\u0027s gangster classic stood half a chance but no - Kevin Costner\u0027s directorial debut Dances With Wolves was the most appealing choice for voters.New talent on the block Quentin Tarantino\u0027s second feature won him the coveted Palme d\u0027Or at Cannes - a success he failed to match back on home turf while he won an Original Screenplay Oscar, Pulp Fiction got beat by Forrest Gump....and it wasn\u0027t the only one. Frank Darabont\u0027s adaptation of Stephen King\u0027s prison-set novella The Shawshank Redemption also fell victim to Robert Zemeckis\u0027 Oscar-friendly Forrest Gump. We don\u0027t see that film sitting atop the IMDB top 250 though, do we?You may think it was remiss of the Academy to shun Fargo but it did come pretty close to winning, its chances bolstered somewhat by seven nominations and two wins (Actress for Frances McDormand and Original Screenplay for the Coen Brothers). It lost out to The English Patient.Having won Best Director five years previous for Schindler\u0027s List, everybody expected Steven Spielberg\u0027s next war epic to scoop all the top awards.

That Ridley Scott\u0027s latest sci-fi The Martian received seven nominations could signal how the Academy are finally taking responsibility for their past errors.Having awarded both The Godfather parts I and II Best Picture in 1972 and 1974 respectively, you\u0027d think Scorsese\u0027s gangster classic stood half a chance but no - Kevin Costner\u0027s directorial debut Dances With Wolves was the most appealing choice for voters.New talent on the block Quentin Tarantino\u0027s second feature won him the coveted Palme d\u0027Or at Cannes - a success he failed to match back on home turf while he won an Original Screenplay Oscar, Pulp Fiction got beat by Forrest Gump....and it wasn\u0027t the only one. Frank Darabont\u0027s adaptation of Stephen King\u0027s prison-set novella The Shawshank Redemption also fell victim to Robert Zemeckis\u0027 Oscar-friendly Forrest Gump. We don\u0027t see that film sitting atop the IMDB top 250 though, do we?You may think it was remiss of the Academy to shun Fargo but it did come pretty close to winning, its chances bolstered somewhat by seven nominations and two wins (Actress for Frances McDormand and Original Screenplay for the Coen Brothers). It lost out to The English Patient.Having won Best Director five years previous for Schindler\u0027s List, everybody expected Steven Spielberg\u0027s next war epic to scoop all the top awards. Cue Shakespeare In Love upsetting the establishment.David Fincher\u0027s generational Facebook drama got shunned in favour of British patriotism in an Oscar two-horse race for the ages that ultimately saw The King\u0027s Speech crowned winner.For last year\u0027s Oscar race, you were either team Birdman or team Boyhood (not forgetting outside bet Whiplash, of course). Each represented a different facet of movie-making that posited them as favourites that Richard Linklater\u0027s labour of love - shot intermittently over 12 years - failed to win may still come as a surprise.Going by Rotten Tomatoes, Scorsese’s\u0026nbspThe Irishman\u0026nbspis his best reviewed film since 1976\u0026nbspdrama\u0026nbspTaxi Driver.The new film, based on Charles Brandt’s book\u0026nbspI Heard You Paint Houses,\u0026nbspmarks the ninth collaboration between the filmmaker\u0026nbspand Robert De Niro.\u0026nbspAl Pacino and Joe\u0026nbspPesci\u0026nbspalso star in the mob drama that\u0026nbspfollows real-life Mafia\u0026nbsphitman\u0026nbspFrank\u0026nbspSheeran\u0026nbsp(De Niro) across several decades of his life and his experiences with labour union teamster Jimmy\u0026nbspHoffa\u0026nbsp(Pacino) and crime boss Russell\u0026nbspBufalino\u0026nbsp(Pesci).The Irishman\u0026nbspwill be released in selected UK cinemas on 8 November, before arriving on\u0026nbspNetflix\u0026nbspfrom 27 November.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Their job is to fix a broken part of the station’s solar power network.NASA originally wanted to conduct an all-female spacewalk last spring, but did not have enough medium-size suits ready to go.This is Ms Koch’s fourth spacewalk and a first for Ms Meir, who has become the 15th woman to venture out of the ISS and into the vacuum.It is expected to last five-and-a-half hours.Created with Sketch.Best Nasa pictures of the month Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The eye of Hurricane Dorian as captured  by Nasa astronaut Nick Hague from onboard the International Space Station (ISS) on 3 September The River Nile and its delta captured at night from the ISS on 2 SeptemberThe galaxy Messier 81, located in the northern constellation of Ursa Major, as seen by Nasa\u0027s Spitzer Space TelescopeThe flight path Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft is seen in this long exposure photograph as it launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberDanielson Crater, an impact crater in the Arabia region of Mars, as captured by Nasa\u0027s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft A team rehearses landing and crew extraction from Boeing\u0027s CST-100 Starliner, which will be used to carry humans to the International Space Station at the White Sands Missile Range outside Las Cruces, New MexicoBound for the International Space Station, the Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberHurricane Dorian as seen from the ISS on 2 SeptemberA string of tropical cyclones streams across Earth\u0027s northern hemisphere in this picture taken from the ISS on 4 SeptemberThe city of New York as seen from the ISS on 11 SeptemberThe eye of Hurricane Dorian as captured  by Nasa astronaut Nick Hague from onboard the International Space Station (ISS) on 3 September The River Nile and its delta captured at night from the ISS on 2 SeptemberThe galaxy Messier 81, located in the northern constellation of Ursa Major, as seen by Nasa\u0027s Spitzer Space TelescopeThe flight path Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft is seen in this long exposure photograph as it launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberDanielson Crater, an impact crater in the Arabia region of Mars, as captured by Nasa\u0027s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft A team rehearses landing and crew extraction from Boeing\u0027s CST-100 Starliner, which will be used to carry humans to the International Space Station at the White Sands Missile Range outside Las Cruces, New MexicoBound for the International Space Station, the Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberHurricane Dorian as seen from the ISS on 2 SeptemberA string of tropical cyclones streams across Earth\u0027s northern hemisphere in this picture taken from the ISS on 4 SeptemberThe city of New York as seen from the ISS on 11 SeptemberThe duo were assisted by Luca Parmitano of the European Space Agency, who is also the mission commander, and Nasa Flight Engineer Andrew Morgan.The astronauts exited from the space station’s the Quest airlock after their spacesuits were set to battery power.Ms Koch was the first to leave the hatch followed by Ms Meir.Nasa reveals new spacesuits ahead of humanity’s return to the MoonThey will replace a battery unit on the Port 6 truss structure – the attachment points for external payloads received by the ISS – that stopped working after new lithium-ion batteries were installed on the space station last week.There have been 227 spacewalkers since the first spacewalk in 1965 and all of them have included a male astronaut or cosmonaut.The US space agency had originally planned an all-female spacewalk in March – which included Ms Koch and fellow astronaut Anne McClain – but had to cancel it because of a shortage of medium-size suits.Ms McClain originally thought a large-size spacesuit would be fit for purpose but later concluded that a medium would be safer.She returned to Earth in June and Nasa sent a second medium-size spacesuit up to the station earlier this month.Spacesuits are made of many interchangeable parts – designed to accommodate astronauts with widely varying body sizes.Body measurements of each astronaut are taken and plotted against the size ranges available for each spacesuit component. The suits are then assembled – usually four months prior to flight.While there are no differences between a male and female spacesuit, female astronauts usually wear a smaller size.\u0026nbspBoth Ms Koch and Ms Meir are wearing medium-size suits, with Ms Koch’s spacesuit featuring red stripes.In a recent interview, Ms Koch spoke about the significance of this spacewalk, saying: “I think it’s important because of the historical nature of what we’re doing.“In the past women haven’t always been at the table.“It’s wonderful to be contributing to the space programme at a time when all contributions are being accepted, when everyone has a role.“That can lead in turn to increased chance for success. There are a lot of people who derive motivation from inspiring stories of people who look like them, and I think it’s an important story to tell.”Ms Koch, an electrical engineer, has been living in space since March while Ms Meir, a marine biologist, joined the ISS crew in September.Both are members of Nasa’s Astronaut Class of 2013.Ms Koch is more than 200 days into her mission and is slated to set a record for the longest single spaceflight by a woman – with an expected total of 328 days in space.Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don’t let that, or the show’s bland English-language title, put you off – creator Álex Pina has made something special. The heist here, led by a mysterious man known only as The Professor, involves breaking into the Royal Mint of Spain and printing off €2.4 billion. There are even more twists in the show’s 15 episodes than there are hostages. 220 American Vandal (TV series, two seasons, 2017–2018)Part satire of true crime documentaries such as Making a Murderer, part carefully observed portrayal of teenage life, American Vandal was criminally underappreciated during its two season run. It’s been cancelled now, but that doesn’t mean you can’t catch up with it, and then write Netflix a strongly worded email.320 One Day at a Time (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)In stark contrast to the off-beat, low-key comedy that currently rules TV – the kind that provokes a wry smirk rather than a hearty laugh – One Day at a Time is a big, bright sitcom filmed in front of an interminably enthusiastic studio audience. You wouldn’t have thought that the story of a Cuban-American army veteran  nurse  single mother – who suffers from PTSD and depression – would fit into this format, but it does so beautifully, tackling issues of sexuality, racism and sexism in the process.  Based on writer  director Tamara Jenkins’s own fertility struggles, Private Life stars Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti (both giving brilliant performances) as a spiky, loving middle-aged couple desperate to have a baby. They even rope their enthusiastic but irresponsible niece Sadie (Kayli Carter) into the mix, much to the horror of Sadie’s mother (Molly Shannon, turning a potentially repellent character into one worthy of empathy). It’s subtle, restrained and beautifully realised.520 Big Mouth (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Crude, rude, and rife with surprise emissions and bodily functions, animated sitcom Big Mouth is also a sensitive, nuanced deep e into the various horrors of teenagehood. When 12-year-old Andrew Glouberman (John Mulaney) is visited by the hormone monster (Nick Kroll, who voices many of the show’s best characters), he finds his life irreversibly – and seemingly disastrously – changed. Unlike many other puberty-centred comedies, Big Mouth makes as much time for its confused female protagonists as its male ones Maya Rudolph is a delight as the female hormone monster, and look out for Kristen Wiig’s wonderful turn as a talking vagina.  620 Easy (TV series, two seasons, 2016–)Joe Swanberg’s style of defiantly undramatic mumblecore isn’t for everyone, but if you enjoyed his earlier films, Drinking Buddies and Happy Christmas, you’ll find plenty to admire in this anthology comedy-drama series. Big-name stars such as Orlando Bloom and Aubrey Plaza crop up, but Jane Adams – who you might remember from Todd Solondz’s chronically depressing 1998 film Happiness – is the show’s heart, and Marc Maron is its jaded soul.Community’s Gillian Jacobs is brilliant as the prickly, magnetic recovering addict Mickey, who forms an unlikely – and arguably deeply unwise – relationship with her nerdy neighbour Gus (Paul Rust). Despite Gus’s pathological need to be the nice guy, we’re never quite sure who or what we’re rooting for – which is what makes Love such complex, compelling viewing.  In 2016, comedian Patton Oswalt’s wife, the true crime writer Michelle McNamara, died suddenly in her sleep. That subject matter doesn’t exactly scream “stand-up special”, but out of his devastating loss, Oswalt managed to craft something funny and profound. Over the course of an hour, he processes his grief onstage, managing to find humour in the struggle to raise his grieving six-year-old daughter alone.920 Santa Clarita Diet (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Granted, this horror-comedy – which stars Drew Barrymore as a neurotic real estate agent who suddenly develops a taste for human flesh – is really silly, and really, really disgusting. But it’s also strangely charming, and funny. Timothy Olyphant is excellent as Sheila’s frazzled husband Joel, and the pair’s idiosyncratic but respectful relationship with their smart teenage daughter Abby (Liv Hewson) isn’t quite like anything else on TV right now.1020 Dark Tourist (TV series, one season, 2018–)New Zealand journalist David Farrier is an unlikely TV presenter in the same way that Louis Theroux is – in just about every scenario in which he finds himself, he’s a little bit awkward. But as with Theroux, Farrier’s weakness is actually his strength, allowing him to endear himself to the many unusual people he meets on his journey through the world’s most questionable tourist destinations. Farrier’s stops include the site of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the road where JFK was assassinated, and the Milwaukee suburbs where serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer murdered his victims.1120 Sacred Games (TV series, one season, 2018–)Based on Vikram Chandra’s epic 2006 novel, Netflix’s first Indian original series is a slowly unfolding gem. The first season of Sacred Games – which follows a troubled police officer (Saif Ali Khan) who has 25 days to save his city thanks to a tip-off from a presumed dead gangster – only covered one quarter of Chandra’s 1,000-page novel. As the show itself declared when it announced the forthcoming second season, “the worst is yet to come”.When the trailer for Dumplin’ first landed, it seemed all the ingredients were in place for a film that was at worst tone-deaf, and at best vaguely patronising. Thank heavens, then, that the trailer did Dumplin’ such a disservice. Starring Danielle Macdonald (who broke out in the excellent 2017 film Patti Cake$) as Willowdean, a self-described “fat girl” who enters a local pageant to annoy her former beauty queen mother (Jennifer Aniston), Dumplin’ is as funny, warm and sensitive as its protagonist – and with a killer Dolly Parton-laden soundtrack to boot.1320 Dark (TV series, one season, 2017–)This sci-fi thriller – which features disappearing children, a mysterious local power plant, and scenes set in the Eighties – has, for obvious reasons, drawn comparisons to Stranger Things. But Dark is even more beguiling and (true to its name) less family-friendly than Stranger Things.1420 The Death and Life of Marsha P Johnson (Film, 2017)Though it’s been somewhat tarnished by claims that director David France appropriated the work and research of trans film-maker Reina Gossett, this documentary is nonetheless a loving, respectful tribute to gay rights activist Marsha P Johnson. One of the key figures in the Stonewall uprising (though her involvement was almost entirely eradicated in 2015’s critically hated Stonewall), Johnson modelled for Andy Warhol, performed onstage with drag group Hot Peaches, helped found the Gay Liberation Front, and then died under suspicious circumstances in 1992.1520 On My Block (TV series, one season, 2018–)This coming-of-age series might not have found as many eyeballs as it deserved last year, but those it did find were glued to the screen. In fact, it was the most-binged show of 2018 – meaning that it had the highest watch-time-per-viewing session of any Netflix original. Created by Awkward’s Lauren Iungerich, On My Block follows a group of Los Angeles teens as they navigate both the drama of high school and the danger of inner-city life.Two beleaguered assistants (Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell) conspire to get their over-demanding bosses (Taye Diggs and Lucy Liu) together in order to get their lives back in this winning romantic comedy. Set It Up is responsible not only for coining the term “over-dicking” (it’s much more innocent than it sounds), but for rejuvenating a tired genre.Martin Freeman stars as the father struggling to protect his young daughter from a zombie epidemic spreading across Australia. So far, so overdone. But this drama thriller, directed by Ben Howling and Yolanda Ramke and based on their 2013 short of the same name, throws a handful of unpredictable ners in the works.    1920 Godless (TV series, one season, 2017–)With shades of John Ford\u0027s The Searchers, this languorous western was critically acclaimed but swiftly forgotten after it landed on Netflix in 2016. Set in 1884, it\u0027s about Frank Griffin (Jeff Daniels) and his notoriously ruthless gang of outlaws’ pursuit of their injured former ally Roy Goode (Jack O’Connell), who is hiding out in a small town populated solely by women after a mining accident killed off all its men. A gun-toting Michelle Dockery, clearly relishing the change of scenery after years of Downton Abbey, and a taciturn Jack O’Connell, are on brilliant form.2020 Atypical (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)This coming-of-age series about a teenage boy with autism was sweet and well-intentioned from the start, but its first season was criticised for a handful of inaccuracies, and for its lack of autistic actors. Rather than drowning in a sea of defensiveness – as too many shows tend to do – it listened, and brought in autistic actors and writers for its excellent second season.120 Money Heist (TV series, one season, 2017–)Known as La Casa de Papel (House of Paper) in its native Spanish, Money Heist is Netflix’s most streamed non-English language show. The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don’t let that, or the show’s bland English-language title, put you off – creator Álex Pina has made something special. The heist here, led by a mysterious man known only as The Professor, involves breaking into the Royal Mint of Spain and printing off €2.4 billion.

Set in 1884, it\u0027s about Frank Griffin (Jeff Daniels) and his notoriously ruthless gang of outlaws’ pursuit of their injured former ally Roy Goode (Jack O’Connell), who is hiding out in a small town populated solely by women after a mining accident killed off all its men. A gun-toting Michelle Dockery, clearly relishing the change of scenery after years of Downton Abbey, and a taciturn Jack O’Connell, are on brilliant form.2020 Atypical (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)This coming-of-age series about a teenage boy with autism was sweet and well-intentioned from the start, but its first season was criticised for a handful of inaccuracies, and for its lack of autistic actors. Rather than drowning in a sea of defensiveness – as too many shows tend to do – it listened, and brought in autistic actors and writers for its excellent second season.“We continue to monitor it so we’re looking at the situation,” Peters said.“We’ll see those consumer-friendly ways to push on the edges of that.”Peters said the company didn’t have “big plans” to announce immediately.Password sharing has been a topic of interest in the streaming industry for some time.According to the research company Magid, 35 per cent of millennials\u0026nbspshare their passwords for streaming services, compared to 19 per cent of Generation Xers and 13 per cent of Baby Boomers.Overall, it is estimated by Magid that nine per cent of customers engage in password sharing. While that proportion doesn’t seem high at first glance, the practice can add up to millions of dollars.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They were winning ever greater support but, somehow, still appearing to lose the battle.Record-breaking crowds had turned up for the Put It To The People rally in the capital in March. Increasing numbers of politicians and experts – and Gary Lineker – were throwing their weight behind the idea. An online poll asking for Article 50 to be revoked had just topped 4 million signatures.Yet somehow, despite all this – or perhaps because of it – this mass movement was being characterised, with some success, as representing the views of only a minor metropolitan elite.It did not, its critics said, understand the midlands or the north. It did not understand small towns. It did not understand the working class.“Have these people ever even been in a Wetherspoon’s?” Martin Daubney, now a Brexit Party MEP, asked me in Wolverhampton in April. Raise the idea of a second vote in there, he added, “and see how it goes down”.By May, on the back of such claims, his group had won 29 out of 71 seats at the European Parliament elections – including almost half of those available in England outside of London.Created with Sketch.People\u0027s Vote march – demanding vote on final Brexit deal Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 march“We realised there was a disconnect between this narrative and the actual reality,” says Kevin Keith, director of People’s Vote North, today. “We knew from polling that support for a second referendum was strong all over the UK, and certainly so in the north.Government can’t ‘play Santa’ with firms after no deal, report warnsSketch: Brexit is in the hands of the idiots, and they’ve dropped itLabour ready to vote for Final Say referendum on Boris Johnson dealCampaigners release ‘six tests Johnson will fail’ on BrexitPeople’s Vote rally sees campaigners demand second say in SunderlandPeople’s Vote rally in Yorkshire sees celebs demand second vote“But, somehow, this view that the north was just a homogenised mass of Leave voters had almost become received wisdom. It wasn’t true then and it isn’t true now. So we realised we needed a platform to challenge that myth.”And now, as campaigners prepare for what could become one of the biggest marches ever held in the capital on Saturday, it is perhaps safe to say that challenge has been met and that myth busted.More than 175 coaches will make their way to London from towns and cities across the UK, full of people asking to be asked again. Underground users have been told to expect large crowds around St Pancras, King’s Cross and Euston – the stations that connect London to the north and Midlands.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailIt comes after 11 rallies were staged across the UK throughout summer and autumn in what were billed by People’s Vote bosses as a show of national strength.More than 12,000 people attended events from Cheltenham in the south to Glasgow and Edinburgh in Scotland and Belfast over the Irish Sea. In supposed\u0026nbspLeave-strongholds, such as Sunderland, Derby and Newport, hundreds turned out. In Brighton, 5,000 supporters attended a beach-front Let us Be Heard rally. In Leeds, campaigners cheered as footballing legend Peter Reid dispensed with niceties: “shambollocks”, he said when asked to describe the last three years in a single word.“There was a feeling that yes, big London marches are massively important in helping create real political pressure but we also had to be out in the regions showing what we already knew: that there was mass support for a second vote – everywhere,” says Mr Keith. “This idea that Sunderland, for instance, had become a no-go area if you wanted a second vote – it’s just a lie. Sunderland is going to be one of the cities hit hardest by Brexit and there is huge hunger there for a chance to have another say.”Curbishley, Alastair Campbell, Peter Reid and Garreth Carvell during June’s People’s Vote rally in Leeds (PA)Among the activists at the Stadium of Light that Sunday afternoon was Louise Brown, a committee member with North East for Europe. “A lot of us will stand on stalls in town centres and it’s hard work because not everyone agrees with what we’re trying to do,” she told me as the day’s audience filed past, all EU flags and Bollocks to Brexit stickers. “But when you come to an event like this, it drives home how devastating leaving the EU will be and how important what we’re doing is.”The devastation spoken about differed from region to region and depended on what calamitous no deal revelation had been brought into the open that particular week but concerns generally riffed on similar themes: economic deprivation, job losses, an NHS vulnerable to predatory privatisation, a country less able to protect itself against terrorism, climate change and cyberattacks.“The scale of just how bad a no deal would be was emerging constantly over the summer,” says Mr Keith. “And I think that naturally brought more people to us. What we noticed anecdotally was that we were getting more and more Leave voters supporting us because there was a growing realisation that the Brexit we were told would happen in 2016 never really existed.”At each event, an ever-rotating list of political speakers – Tories, Labour, Anna Soubry – were joined by comedians, sports stars and business people.\u0026nbspThe Derby rally may be the only place Michael Heseltine and Margaret Beckett have ever shared a stage. Almost certainly, these events showed footage of the one time you’ll ever hear erstwhile Coronation Street star Denise Welch ponder international import and export tariffs. “Where are all these trade deals?” she wondered in a video message.Boris Johnson’s Brexit plans receive crushing blow from DUPIn Edinburgh, Alistair Campbell played Ode To Joy on the bagpipes, while in Leeds John Barnes compared Brexit to a bad VAR decision. Let’s replay it, he suggested, and get it right.“I think there’s no doubt this is one of the most varied political campaigns in recent decades,” says Richard Brooks, the 27-year-old co-founder of For our Future’s Sake, ostensibly the movement’s youth wing. “The people who come can’t be pigeon-holed – they’re young, old, middle class, working class. It goes across so many spectrums. We’ve had events where there’s been a 20-something Northern Irish apprentice on stage with someone who’s been a member of the Tory party for decades. We’re uniting people constantly.”Critics would say, of course, that these are still relatively small numbers.A ComRes poll published on Wednesday showed that, overwhelmingly, people wanted to honour the results of the original referendum. Fifty-four per cent of those questioned said the UK should leave the EU. Only 32 per cent said it should not. All regions had a Leave majority\u0026nbsp– save for London, Scotland and Northern Ireland. In a similar survey carried out by BMG between July and October, fewer than one in five people said they wanted another referendum.And, yet, as the political landscape has changed on an almost daily basis – the first northern rally was held way back in the era when Theresa May was still prime minister before Yellowhammer was revealed when the prorogation of parliament was not yet a twinkle in Dominic Cummings’ eye –\u0026nbspand politics has mutated, something remarkable has happened. Support for a People’s Vote – a consistent, accessible plan to move things forward – has kept gaining momentum.Hilary Benn – who, whatever happens next, may come to be considered one of his generation’s few politicians of stature – came on board, despite previous reservations. Every opposition party, bar one, has now said they favour a second vote. Labour’s position may still remain ambiguous under Jeremy Corbyn, but, if rumours are to be believed, it won’t stay that way if chancellor John McDonnell gets his way.And now, on Saturday: a new London march, which organisers say could attract up to 1.5 million people from all corners of the UK.“Only an idiot would dismiss that as anything other than a mass movement,” adds Mr Keith. “I compare this to a journey where it’s not just the landscape that’s constantly changing but even the road you’re driving on keeps moving about.“But if you have your destination in mind – a final vote – it’s just a case of keeping your sights steady, holding your nerve and doing your best to get there. I believe we’re closer now than we ever have been. The country needs it. One way or another, it’s the only possible way out of this mess.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

country,” he added.“Whether it’s a deal or no deal, the Brexit the prime minister is planning bears no relation to the promises made back in 2016 and it threatens immense harm to our economy, our prosperity, our young people and our United Kingdom.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The researchers point to previous work by the OECD showing that some people with health issues or a disability would be able to work if arrangements such as flexible hours or remote work were an option.In contrast, UK government statisticians treat those two types of the “hidden” jobless as economically inactive rather than unemployed, without distinguishing why some people are not looking for work.“When the hidden unemployed are added to official unemployment statistics, the number of working-age jobless people not in education is estimated to jump from 4.6 per cent to 13.2 per cent,” the Centre for Cities said on Thursday.“This challenges the claim that Britain has experienced a job creation miracle in recent years.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and Britain\u0027s Prime Minister Boris Johnson shake hands during a news conference after agreeing on a Brexit deal, in BrusselsA man walks his dog through the fallen leaves in Clarkes Gardens, Allerton in LiverpoolPolice officers carry away an activist as Extinction Rebellion protesters block a road with a caravan in central LondonQueen Elizabeth II sits with Prince Charles on the Sovereign\u0027s throne ahead of delivering the Queen\u0027s Speech at the State Opening of ParliamentGreat Britain\u0027s Joe Fraser competes on Parallel Bars during the World Gymnastics Championships in Stuttgart, Germany.

The authors used that figure because other data in the report is also from 2017.In cities with weaker economies, such as Liverpool, Dundee and Sunderland, the jobless rate that includes the “hidden” unemployed reaches nearly 20 per cent, according to the report.“This research suggests that people in cities which have struggled to recover from the deindustrialisation of the 20th\u0026nbspcentury could be dealt a second blow as they are ill-equipped to respond to automation,” said Andrew Carter, the chief executive of the Centre for Cities.In another change from official statistics, the researchers excluded from their calculation of the overall unemployment rates people who are inactive by choice or for other non-economic reasons – specifically, students, early retirees and people looking after children, relatives or a home.“Being a student, retiring earlier and looking after family or home are not necessarily directly linked to the economic performance of the local area where people live and work,” they wrote.For example, most early retirees have probably left work because they can afford it, the authors note.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He claimed that the EU\u0027s enlargement process was in general need of an overhaul. Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker described the move as historic error, while Council president Donald Tusk agreed it was\u0026nbspa mistake.Macedonia officially changes name to North Macedonia to end disputeWhy is Macedonia considering changing its name?EU leaders have long said that if the former Yugoslav republic changed its name from Macedonia to end a decades-long dispute with Greece, its application could go ahead.The name change was politically costly for the country\u0027s government, which faced domestic opposition from nationalists. On Friday afternoon its foreign minister accused EU leaders of not being straightforward with us, but thanked those leaders who backed his country in the room.There was more widespread opposition on the European Council to opening talks with Albania, which some leaders argue has not made enough progress on reforms, including to the rule of law. Other than France,\u0026nbspDenmark and the Netherlands raised concerns.A compromise plan proposed by the Netherlands\u0027 prime minister Mark Rutte to open talks with North Macedonia only failed, with EU leaders refusing to separate the two countries\u0027 bids from one another.A\u0026nbspnumber of countries were reluctant regarding today\u0027s opening of negotiations, and France was part of them, Mr Macron confirmed.\u0026nbspHe said the EU was struggling to take effective decisions with 28 members, and that\u0026nbspbefore any effective enlargement we must reform ourselves.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The states launched an unsuccessful diplomatic offensive ahead of the meeting to try and undermine the French veto.\u0026nbspGermany\u0027s Angela Merkel was also supportive of opening talks, saying that she deplored the decision not to proceed.Unfortunately we were not able to reach agreement, she told a press conference on Friday after the meeting. We were not able to reach unanimity regarding that position. I very much deplore this fact.\u0026nbspShe said North Macedonia had done a lot to meet conditions set by the bloc, adding: Albania too has made progress on the vetting process – the appointment of new judges is a far-reaching measure indeed that many countries in the Western Balkans have not yet got around to doing.\u0026nbspThe chancellor continued: I always make the point that we have to be reliable when we make promises, when we set standards we have to be predictable in our responses instead of turning our backs on them and saying \u0027well, you\u0027ve done quite well, but we\u0027ve thought of something new\u0027.I\u0027ve always thought it was in Europe\u0027s interest to engage these countries in Europe. When you take a look at the map you get an idea of how important that is. We\u0027re talking about countries here that want to become members of the European Union.Speaking at the close of the summit, Council president Mr Tusk told reporters: The overwhelming majority wanted to open accession talks with North Macedonia and Albania, however such a decision requires unanimity and there was no unanimity yesterday.\u0026nbspLet me be very clear –\u0026nbspare not to blame for this and the Commission reports are also clear that both these countries did what they were asked to do.mBoth countries have the right to start negotiations as of today: they are ready. Unfortunately a few member states are not ready yet. This is why we did not manage to reach a positive decision. Personally I think it was a mistake but I will not comment on it further.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A protester throws a tire on a fire to block the highway north of Beirut, Lebanon.

I fully understand your frustration because you did your share and we haven\u0027t. The EU a complex political entity and it is true that sometimes it takes too long to decide, but I have absolutely no doubt that one day you will become full members of the European Union.Mr Tusk, who comes from Poland,\u0026nbspcontinued: You should never give up. I remember the first time I started to dream of a European future for my country. I think I was maybe 30, 35 years old. I had to wait 25 years for this.Nikola Dimitrov, North Macedonia\u0027s foreign minister, said on Friday afternoon after the result of the meeting had become clear: The least that the European Union owes the region is to be straightforward with us.\u0026nbspIf there is no more consensus on the European future of the Western Balkans, if the promise of Thessaloniki 2003 does not stand, the citizens deserve to know.\u0026nbspGratitude to all leaders that fought hard for the EU to open accession talks with us, thus acknowledging and anchoring the historic Prespa Agreement, encouraging domestic reforms and underpinning the European narrative in North Macedonia, a candidate country for 14 years.\u0026nbspWhile we wait for a renewed consensus, we must continue to defend true European values at home.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Police confirmed they were investigating whether religious faith was involved in the family\u0027s alleged incarceration.Mr van Dorsten was arrested on Thursday on suspicion of “depriving people of their liberty, harming the health of others and money laundering”, Dutch police said in a statement.“We have reason to believe that the six people involved did not stay at the premises out of free will. We are investigating whether following a certain belief in life or faith has led to the living situation in which the people were found,” the police statement said, according to the Agence France-Presse\u0026nbspnews agency.Mr van Dorsten’s six children were found by police after the eldest, a 25-year-old man, turned up at a local bar, drank five beers and told staff he needed help.Created with Sketch.Wildlife Photographer of the Year 2019: The Winners Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.115  Grand title winner and Joint Winner, Behaviour: MammalsThe moment by Yongqing Bao, ChinaYongqing BaoWildlife Photographer of the YearNight glow by Cruz Erdmann, New ZealandCruz ErdmannWildlife Photographer of the Year315 Plants and Fungi WinnerTapestry of life by Zorica Kovacevic, SerbiaUSAZorica KovacevicWildlife Photographer of the YearLand of the eagle by Audun Rikardsen, NorwayAudun RikardsenWildlife Photographer of the Year515 Black and White WinnerSnow exposure by Max Waugh, USAMax WaughWildlife Photographer of the YearThe equal match by Ingo Arndt, GermanyIngo ArndtWildlife Photographer of the YearCreation by Luis Vilariño Lopez, SpainLuis Vilariño LopezWildlife Photographer of the Year815 Wildlife Photographer of the Year Portfolio Award WinnerThe huddle by Stefan Christmann, GermanyStefan ChristmannWildlife Photographer of the Year915 10 years and under WinnerHumming surprise by Thomas Easterbrook, UKThomas EasterbrookWildlife Photographer of the YearAnother barred migrant by Alejandro Prieto, MexicoAlejandro PrietoWildlife Photographer of the YearFrozen moment by Jérémie Villet, FranceJérémie VilletWildlife Photographer of the YearEarly riser by Riccardo Marchgiani, ItalyRiccardo MarchegianiWildlife Photographer of the Year1315 Behaviour: Amphibians and Reptiles WinnerPondworld by Manuel Plaickner, ItalyManuel PlaicknerWildlife Photographer of the YearFace of deception by Ripan Biswas, IndiaRipan BiswasWildlife Photographer of the Year1515 Animals in Their Environment WinnerSnow-plateau nomads by Shangzhen Fan, ChinaShangzhen FanWildlife Photographer of the Year115  Grand title winner and Joint Winner, Behaviour: MammalsThe moment by Yongqing Bao, ChinaYongqing BaoWildlife Photographer of the YearNight glow by Cruz Erdmann, New ZealandCruz ErdmannWildlife Photographer of the Year315 Plants and Fungi WinnerTapestry of life by Zorica Kovacevic, SerbiaUSAZorica KovacevicWildlife Photographer of the YearLand of the eagle by Audun Rikardsen, NorwayAudun RikardsenWildlife Photographer of the Year515 Black and White WinnerSnow exposure by Max Waugh, USAMax WaughWildlife Photographer of the YearThe equal match by Ingo Arndt, GermanyIngo ArndtWildlife Photographer of the YearCreation by Luis Vilariño Lopez, SpainLuis Vilariño LopezWildlife Photographer of the Year815 Wildlife Photographer of the Year Portfolio Award WinnerThe huddle by Stefan Christmann, GermanyStefan ChristmannWildlife Photographer of the Year915 10 years and under WinnerHumming surprise by Thomas Easterbrook, UKThomas EasterbrookWildlife Photographer of the YearAnother barred migrant by Alejandro Prieto, MexicoAlejandro PrietoWildlife Photographer of the YearFrozen moment by Jérémie Villet, FranceJérémie VilletWildlife Photographer of the YearEarly riser by Riccardo Marchgiani, ItalyRiccardo MarchegianiWildlife Photographer of the Year1315 Behaviour: Amphibians and Reptiles WinnerPondworld by Manuel Plaickner, ItalyManuel PlaicknerWildlife Photographer of the YearFace of deception by Ripan Biswas, IndiaRipan BiswasWildlife Photographer of the Year1515 Animals in Their Environment WinnerSnow-plateau nomads by Shangzhen Fan, ChinaShangzhen FanWildlife Photographer of the YearWhen officers searched the farmhouse in Ruinerwold, Drenthe, they eventually found a door hidden behind a cupboard which led to a secret basement where they found Mr van Dorsten and the five remaining children who had apparently been held there for almost a decade.The 58-year-old Austrian tenant at the farmhouse, named as Josef Brunner, has also been arrested on similar charges to Mr van Dorsten. He was reportedly also a former member of the Unification church, though the organisation has not confirmed this.Buitenhuizerweg in Ruinerwold, Drenthe (EPA)The Unification church said in a statement it was “deeply alarmed to hear of the family being held in inhumane conditions on a farmhouse in the Netherlands.” Mr van Dorsten was briefly a member of our movement in the mid-1980s, it said, but he left in 1987.The church\u0027s statement also revealed that Mr van Dorsten’s brother, Derek van Dorsten, remained “a long-time member” of the movement, and is quoted as saying “I have not heard from my brother since 1984”.It added: “In addition, we are unable to confirm any records of Mr Josef Brunner, the alleged captor, having ever been associated in any way with the Unification church.\u0026nbspWe are grateful that the six victims in this tragedy are now under the care of the local authorities and pray they will be able to heal from their ordeal with time and professional help.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The 58-year-old is described as a furniture worker who also worked on yachts. He was regarded as “an absolute professional”, the report said.Willem Koetsier, a Unification Church member in Amsterdam, also told the paper that after Mr van Dorsten had left the group, he travelled to Germany where it lost track of him. Mr Koetsier said he thought the man “together with someone else” had since started their own cult.When police found Mr van Dorsten in the secret basement, he was apparently ill and in bed, having suffered a suspected stroke two years ago.\u0026nbspAccording to Algemeen Dagblad, at the time Mr van Dorsten joined the Unification movement with his brother in the 1980s, he ascribed “supernatural powers” to himself.His wife and the mother of nine known children died in 2004.\u0026nbspThree of Mr van-Dorsten’s children have come forward and said they left the family eight years ago.\u0026nbspIt is possible he has even more children, the newspaper reports.Before the family moved to the farm in Ruinerwold, they had reportedly stayed at a caravan park where the children were filmed performing cult rituals including walking in circles. This apparently attracted unwanted attention, leading them to move to the secluded farm.Mr van Dorsten’s children, all aged over 18, are now in the care of the Dutch authorities.Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

It shows how a black market has been set up to off the most wretched in Russian society – using unregulated social media platforms to connect buyers to sellers via unscrupulous agents.\u0026nbspThe exact scale of the illicit trade is unclear, but evidence points to an unhealthy demand. Every month, the most popular Russian search engine registers 85,000 searches of the term “buy a child” in Moscow alone.\u0026nbspFor some, no doubt, it is a way to cut out three years of red tape and complicated adoption law. Often, the women involved are in desperate situations. But the opportunities for abuse of the most horrific kind are also obvious.\u0026nbspThe prices quoted depend on the region and the child’s characteristics, the publication said. Non-Slavic children from the more underdeveloped regions of the Russian Federation are the least expensive. Slavs in Moscow and St Petersburg – the most. Court documents showed that in one case just 5,000 roubles (£60) swapped hands.\u0026nbspThe journalists were offered well-worked schemes to get around social services checks.\u0026nbspVladimir Putin to sign bill banning Americans from adopting RussianFor suspicious-looking men like the imagined Pavel Sarychev, the suggested route was getting the father of an abandoned baby to sign off on the adoption. For women, other options were suggested, including switching babies in the maternity ward under the watchless eyes of corrupted nurses.\u0026nbspThere was little need to worry about being caught, agents said. With corrupted people in all parts of the system working for them, not even a DNA test would stop the trade going through.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Syrian government is hostile to foreign\u0026nbspNGOs\u0026nbspand many remain at risk of arrest.International aid and medical agencies, including Medicines Sans Frontieres, Save the Children, Mercy Corps and DanChurchAid, all released statements saying their intentional staff had\u0026nbspto leave Syria, either partially or fully halting their activities there.The UN said this has disrupted the “supply change” of aid to much of northern Syria, which before the latest conflict was already home to nearly a million displaced people who depended on aid to survive.“Due to changes on the ground and insecurity some NGO partners have had to transfer international staff who were operating in the northeast out of the area, and others have had to temporarily suspend operations,” Hedinn Halldorsson from the agency in Damascus, told The Independent.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A slew of countries including the UK has also imposed arms embargoes on Ankara, to little effect.\u0026nbspBut despite the mounting pressure, Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan remained defiant, saying earlier: “We will never declare a ceasefire.”Back in Syria, meanwhile,\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspa rebel spokesman confirmed that the “operation is ongoing in\u0026nbspRas\u0026nbspal-Ain.” From the Turkish side of the border, ambulances could be seen in war-ravaged town racing away from the front,\u0026nbsptowards hospitals.A briefing paper released by the Turkish government said the town centre of\u0026nbspRas\u0026nbspal-Ain\u0026nbsphad been “cleared out of terrorists” along with 1,217 sq km of territory.Aid workers in Syria said international staff having to evacuate the country because of regime presence,\u0026nbspwould only see the humanitarian crisis worsen.\u0026nbspThe Kurdish Red Crescent (KRC)\u0026nbspcalled the sudden withdrawal\u0026nbspa “disaster” saying the KRC’s 1,000 or so staffers and volunteers were unable to shoulder the burden alone.“Coordination has almost collapsed since the international staffers had to leave. The burden was on them to secure cross border aid. We were also dependent on our partners to get funds, we need international doctors to support us,” the KRC’s Dr Sherwan Berry said.Turkey ‘effectively holding 50 US nuclear bombs hostage’ at air baseRussian soldiers filmed apparently moving into US Syria baseNine suspected Isis members escape from camp in Syria, says FranceMilitary veterans Tulsi Gabbard and Pete Buttigieg clash over SyriaHow Russia is filling the gap left by Trump’s withdrawal of US troops “We have such a load on our shoulders. We don’t have enough staff to man the hospitals, we lost a lot of clinics to shelling and bombing, we have 300,000 displaced people needing food, shelter, water and medical care. We are struggling to provide for them,” he added.He said that KRC ambulances had been targeted by Turkish strikes and several hospitals taken out of service because of the fighting.“Tens of thousands of internally displaced civilians are sleeping on the ground, lacking food, medicine and water,” he added.A senior foreign humanitarian professional, who asked not to be named for security reasons, said should the regime retain control of northeast Syria and the border\u0026nbspit would be “catastrophic” as they would not be able to return.\u0026nbsp“International aid agencies have been supporting hospitals in all the major towns and cities, they have been doing water tucking, bread distribution, rehabilitating schools, water stations and irrigations canals. They are the only actors working on de-mining,” the humanitarian worker said.Created with Sketch.Turkey launches offensive into Syria Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Turkish soldiers with armored vehiclesA woman flees with her children during Turkish bombardment on Syria\u0027s northeastern town of Ras al-AinThe first group of Turkish infantry prepare to enter Syria on the borderSmoke billows from targets inside SyriaTurkish armoured vehicles enter Syria in AkcakaleCivilians leave as smoke rises from Ras al-AinA multi-rocket launcher fires in an unknown location People wave as Turkish soldiers prepare to cross the borderGirls stand together in Ras al Ain townA woman walks as smoke billows following Turkish bombardment in Syria\u0027s northeastern town of Ras al-AinA Turkish army\u0027s tank drives down from a truck towards the border with Syria Turkish jet taxis on tarmac after returning to a military base in southeast DiyarbakirA Turkish armored vehicle drives down a road during a military operation in Kurdish areas of northern SyriaPeople sit on belongings at a back of a truck as they flee Ras al Ain townPeople wave as Turkish soldiers prepare to cross the border into SyriaCivilians flee with their belongings Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, right, speaks with Defense Minister Hulusi Akar, left, as they watch the operation by Turkish forces in Kurdish areas Smoke rises from the Syrian town of Tal AbyadTurkey-backed members of Syrian National Army prepare for moving to Turkey with heavy armed vehiclesTurkish soldiers with armored vehiclesA woman flees with her children during Turkish bombardment on Syria\u0027s northeastern town of Ras al-AinThe first group of Turkish infantry prepare to enter Syria on the borderSmoke billows from targets inside SyriaTurkish armoured vehicles enter Syria in AkcakaleCivilians leave as smoke rises from Ras al-AinA multi-rocket launcher fires in an unknown location People wave as Turkish soldiers prepare to cross the borderGirls stand together in Ras al Ain townA woman walks as smoke billows following Turkish bombardment in Syria\u0027s northeastern town of Ras al-AinA Turkish army\u0027s tank drives down from a truck towards the border with Syria Turkish jet taxis on tarmac after returning to a military base in southeast DiyarbakirA Turkish armored vehicle drives down a road during a military operation in Kurdish areas of northern SyriaPeople sit on belongings at a back of a truck as they flee Ras al Ain townPeople wave as Turkish soldiers prepare to cross the border into SyriaCivilians flee with their belongings Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, right, speaks with Defense Minister Hulusi Akar, left, as they watch the operation by Turkish forces in Kurdish areas Smoke rises from the Syrian town of Tal AbyadTurkey-backed members of Syrian National Army prepare for moving to Turkey with heavy armed vehicles“Our local partners and the UN cannot handle this alone” the worker added.Robert Onus, MSF Emergency Manager for Syria, said it was “impossible” to work in the current insecurity and they were “extremely worried about the safety of our Syrian colleagues and their families”.“Before the fighting, you already had hundreds of thousands of displaced people who were 100 per cent reliant on aid to survive,” Onus told The Independent.\u0026nbspHe said this was now compounded by fresh large-scale displacement, increased trauma burden from war, reduction in ability to deliver aid, as well as suspension of activities.“The crisis is already upon us, it is just about what magnitude it will take,” he added.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet -

The first is Brexit. The second is the ending of this rotten parliament.

But, perversely, it may have also cost them the game.There are not yet specic punishments in place for breaking the racism protocol but Uefa’s Disciplinary Regulations  state: “If a match cannot take place or cannot be played in full, the member association or club responsible forfeits the match.”So it could have been perceived as a home win for racism and defeat for England.Uefa’s woefully inadequate response to a litany of previous racist incidents meant it was left up to Tyrone to make a call.Cool-headed England manager Gareth Southgate later said all his players wanted to carry on.If Uefa bosses had spines, they should have abandoned the game and given the points to England.Players should be able to walk out on a game where mass racism is taking place without risk of forfeiting the match. If nations such as Bulgaria can’t police and steward racist fans, then Uefa should force them to play behind closed doors or exclude them from tournaments until they can.In the build-up to the game, the Bulgarians pointed out the English could hardly occupy the moral high ground.There have been a number of reports of players being racially abused at games here this year and stars are regularly subjected to racism on social media.I have reported on England games for The Sun for the past  years and the dedicated fans are a friendly and welcoming bunch.Most use the opportunity of foreign games for sight-seeing and immersing themselves in local culture.Yet a “stag do” following of younger yobbish fans attaches themselves to Three Lions away games in party destinations such as Amsterdam, Porto and Prague.Booze and drugs are swilled down and continental squares echo to the sound of Ten German Bombers and splintering glass.A minority of fans it may be, but they are still intimidating to locals and families. We have our own house to get in order, too.After the final whistle Tyrone stated that he believed England’s collective decision to stay on was the correct one, saying he was “proud of how we dealt with it”.Dignied in stark contrast to the far-Right nasties who had hounded him.His cry of “Hey, did you hear that ” must surely now be acted upon in football’s corridors of power.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We want the government to:Together, these changes will help Make Universal Credit Work.Join our Universal Credit Facebook group or email UniversalCredit@the-sun to share your story. Apply for an advance - Claimants are able to get some cash within five days rather than waiting weeks for their first payment. But its a loan which means the repayments will be automatically deducted from your future Universal Credit pay out.Alternative Payment Arrangements- If youre falling behind on rent, you or your landlord may be able to apply for an APA which will get your payment sent directly to your landlord. You might also be able to change your payments to get them more frequently, or you can split the paymentsyoure part of a couple.Budgeting Advance - You may be able to get help from the government to help with emergency household costs of up to £youre single, £youre part of a couple or £you have children. These are only in cases like your cooker breaking down or for help getting a job. Youll have to repay the advance through your regular Universal Credit payments.

The legal limit is mg.At Manchester magistrates court Leadbeater pleaded guilty to drink driving and was banned from driving for  months.The incident occurred when her Mustang was seen travelling along Chester Road.Nicola Durham, prosecuting, said: The defendant came to the polices attention after a CCTV operator highlighting concerns and notied them.They then located the vehicle and spoke to the defendant and came to the opinion that she had indeed consumed alcohol. A road side breathalyser reading in relation to that was mg but clearly that’s not the eventual reading and she was found to be mg at the police station.The defendant was off balance when she got out the car but there was nothing in relation to her actual driving. She has no previous convictions.In mitigation for Leadbeater, Ashley Barnes, told the judge: The reading of mg is in the lower end of the spectrum but it still comes as an enormous surprise to her - although she accepts the reading.You will have read she was slightly unsteady on her feet. She was driving in sliders which you wear on the beach normally.She had been out somewhere nice wearing nice shoes and took them off not as she did not want to drive in those nice shoes.

Weve found that excess fat accumulates in the airway walls where it takes up space and seems to increase inflammation within the lungs.We think this is causing a thickening of the airways that limits the flow of air in and out of the lungs, and that could at least partly explain an increase in asthma symptoms.According to the NHS, the main symptoms of asthma are:Although the above symptoms can have a number of causes, they are likely signs of asthmathey happen regularly and keep coming back, are worse at night or early morning, or seem to be in response to an allergen.The severity of the above symptoms can y between dferent people.When these symptoms suddenly worsen temporarily, it is known as an asthma attack.Asthma attacks can be caused by allergens, such as animal fur or pollen, cold air, exercise, chest infections or other irritants - such as cigarette smoke.Allergies and asthma often go together.Asthma caused by an allergic reaction is known as allergic asthma.There are now hopes that this initial finding will now lead to further studies on the relationship between asthma and high BMIs as well as research into whether the effects can be reversed by weight loss.European Respiratory Society president Professor Thierry Troosters, who was not involved in the study, said: This is an important finding on the relationship between body weight and respiratory disease because it shows how being overweight or obese might be making symptoms worse for people with asthma.This goes beyond the simple observation that patients with obesity need to breathe more with activity and exercise hence adding to their ventilatory burden. The observation points at true airway changes that are associated with obesity.Emma Rubach, Head of Health Advice at Asthma UK, said: “This study adds to growing evidence thatyou are overweight it can make your asthma symptoms worse.“This is because getting active boosts your lung power and reduces breathlessness.“You don’t need to run a marathon to be active with asthma, even doing gentle activity like gardening or going for a walk could improve your asthma symptoms.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I cant give up the responsibility my father has given me and worked so hard for. The Guzman era continues to reign.“I want to make it very clear, theres no successor to my father, not just anyone can fill these shoes. He is still giving orders.”The -year-old was the second of four children born to El Chapo’s first we María Salazar Hernández, but older brother Cesar was killed by a rival cartel in .A self-confessed playboy, Ivan constantly gloats about his party lestyle, surrounding himself with scantily-clad girls and posting pictures from exclusive nightclubs.On one picture, in which he is boarding a private jet, he wrote: “I distract myself with women, but always on top of business.”In another, the bachelor – dubbed “Ivan the Terrible” by one follower – crouches down in front of a silver Mercedes hugging a pet lion.Recent posts include a bottle of £ liqueur Don Julia , a £, Jeep Cherakona and a fleet of supercars with the caption Always thank God for everything he gives you.The swaggering crime boss is rivalled in his luxury lestyle by younger brother Jesús Alfredo Guzmán Salazar – known as Alfredo or Alfredito.Alfredo recently posted a picture of himself flying a private jet with the caption: “Ok plebs, Im leaving you behind.”He also posts pictures of his pet lion cubs with one sitting on the boot of his red Bentley.Like his brother, Alfredo is fond of weapons and posts pictures of guns as well as heavily-armed members of the cartel.In one, he holds an arsenal of weapons with the caption, “for those who want to step onto my turf, I give them my army”.In another, he took a gun to the cinema, posting a picture of popcorn and a gun with the caption, “Ive got my toy with me in case anyone wants to make things exciting.”Alfredo was indicted for drug trafficking in Illinois in  and in , he was kidnapped by a rival drug gang who held him at gunpoint in a restaurant before marching him out.El Chapo’s daughter, Alejandrina Gisselle, is staunch defender of her cocaine baron dad and once boasted, “Im beautul because of my mother, intelligent because of my father, and a murderer because of me”.In the week her father was sentenced, Alejandro launched her new line of clothing and accessories named El Chapo , featuring his face on ious T-shirts and tops.On her website she insists her father is “a friend of everyone,” a “willing leader” and “a humble orange vendor with many goals and great ambition.” El Chapos second marriage, to wanted drug runner Griselda Lopez Perez, produced three boys, Edgar, Ovidio and Joaquin.Although not his oldest son, Edgar was his fathers chosen successor but was kept out of the family business until he finished school.But at , against his fathers wishes he travelled to Chicago on a drug deal and on his , attempted to sneak back into his fathers compound in Culiacan in a red SUV.The car was reportedly fired on by El Chapos own men, as it wasnt recognised, and took  bullets, killing Edgar and his friend instantly.Like his half-brothers, Joaquin - who calls himself El Chino Anthrax - loves the high le.In one Twitter post he is pictured with Paris Hilton with the hashtag El Chinos babes.Another has a picture of a gold-plated, diamond-encrusted hand gun and he often posts pictures of himself clubbing as well as his pet tiger chained to the back of his luxury x.In contrast, Ovidio - whose arrest caused the eruption of violence this week - prefers the quiet le.His Twitter profile says: I am not into luxury and sports cars, I like horses and fine roosters.But he continues to be heavily involved in the cartel and often posts messages from the ranch in Culiacan showing a semi-automatic in his SUV, with messages like: Lets go to work because there are dogs that want to get to the ranch.He recently retweeted a message from the family business suggesting El Chapo still pulls the strings.It read: That the lord is confined does not mean that he does not continue giving orders.El Chapo’s third we , former beauty queen Emma Coronel Aispuro, married El Chapo in  and stood by him at his trial.The mother of twin eight-year-olds, Emali and Maria Joaquina, she frequently posts pictured of exotic holidays on her Instagram and recently threw a lavish barbie-themed party for the girls.Calornian woman Rosa Isela Guzmán Ortiz is widely believed to be El Chapos oldest daughter, born from an affair with a woman in Jalisco, according to his mother.Rosa has claimed that El Chapo visited her in the US twice and writes to her from prison.But, judging by his childrens lestyle, theres still plenty to go round. px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\" Credit: AP:Associated PressEl Chapos weand twin daughters at the New York trialOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Mr Johnson ed to London following dinner on Thursday evening in Brussels, skipping day two of the summit as he attempted to shore up support. Any hope of an easy passage was dashed after the DUP rubbished the fresh agreement. But as well as debating the new deal MPs will also try and amend the legislation. So far they have unveiled three amendments to the deal. But ious groups are furiously drafting further changes they want to table. The most signicant is by ex-Tory Sir Oliver Letwin. It would refuse to approve Boris Johnsonaposs deal in final form tomorrow.  Thataposs because of fears that eventhe deal is approved tomorrow, a no-deal Brexit could still happen by accident. This is a bit tricky to explain - but basically, tomorrow isnapost the final vote on the Brexit deal.MPs will get loads more votes on something called the EU Withdrawal Bill, which is an instrument used to pass the deal formally into law. The problem is thatthe Bill gets stuck or disputed, the aposBenn Actapos - which forces the PM to seek a delay to Brexitthereaposs no deal - will have lapsed because it has an October  deadline.  Sir Oliver fears that,the Withdrawal Bill somehow gets snarled up after October , we could be left in legal limbo on October .So his amendment would decline to approve the Brexit deal unless and until every single vote on the legislation is safely passed. The cross-party amendment has support from Labouraposs Hilary Benn, Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson, Plaid Cymruaposs Liz Saville Roberts and the SNPaposs Stephen Gethins. Meanwhile, two SNP amendments will also call for a general election and revoking Article  to cancel Brexit - but itaposs unclear whether they will even get called. Speaker John Bercow has the final say over what reaches the floor of the Commons.  Meanwhile a bid to use Saturdayaposs historic session to secure a second referendum is currently on hold - with campaigners looking to next week instead. Remain MPs had planned to tack on a bid to get a second bill. Yesterday they changed the rules surrounding Saturdayaposs sitting in order to leave open the possibility of both Letwinaposs amendment and one on a public vote. But they continued with frantic discussions to try and gameplay the most effective time to bring forward the vote. Boris Johnson finally agreed a Brexit deal with the EU on  October  - though it stills need approval from MPs and could face a narrow defeat. The -page list of amendments keeps a transition period up to  December  and the £bn orce bill. But it scraps the Irish backstop, an insurance policy designed at preventing a hard border between Northern Ireland the Republic. In the backstopaposs place would effectively be apostwo bordersapos in a hybrid system:Northern Ireland and Britain would share a customs territory - technically forcing customs checks on goods crossing the -mile border with the Republic. But in practice, to avoid checks at the border, the checks will instead happen when goods reach Northern Ireland on the island of Ireland. Critics say this puts checks across the Irish Sea - more of this below.  Northern Ireland and the Republic would share some EU single market rules - forcing checks on manufactured and agricultural products crossing the Irish Sea.The Northern Ireland Assembly - known as Stormont - will get a vote every four years on whether to let EU law continue. But this vote could be passed by a simple majority - denying the DUP a veto on staying under EU laws long-term.

But one day he woke up a completely dferent child, terrying his parents with distressing outbursts including: When we get home Iaposm going to take my clothes off and sit outside until I freeze to death. He refused to sleep in his room, saying he didnapost deserve to sleep in a nice comfy bed and would walk around the house looking for the most uncomfortable place to sleep. Jack would repeat meaning phrases or bark like a dog, and became very aggressive towards his mum - on one occasion jumping up and down on her neck laughing this evil laugh.    One Saturday he was due to play in a football tournament, but he became completely overwhelmed by anxiety and couldn’t get himself into the building. Psychiatrist mum Alison, , said: “When we got back in the car to go home, he just kept apologising over and over. He was saying, ‘I do not deserve to have friends,’ and, ‘I do not deserve to play football’. “Then that became, ‘I do not deserve to live’. He said, ‘When we get home I’m going to take my clothes off and sit outside until I freeze to death’. “We were really shocked as he’d never said anything like it before. “We were asking himsomething had happened. We thought maybe when he’d been out playing that a bigger person had done something awful to him. He kept saying that nothing had happened and he couldn’t explain why he felt like that.”    That night he kept asking his horried parents why they would not help him to die and, the following day, Alison discovered a note he had written saying: I’m really sorry I don’t want to live anymore. I want to be in heaven. Eventually, after four months, Jack, of Dumfries, Scotland, was diagnosed with PANDAS, a set of conditions which result in inflammation of the brain, causing a iety of neuro-psychiatric complaints, such as obsessive compulsive disorder , tics and eating disorders. Although Jackaposs condition improved within days of being put on a course of antibiotics, his parents are now determined to raise awareness of PANDAS - paediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorder - which is often misdiagnosed as a behavioural issue. Alison, who also has a daughter Cara, seven, said: “Jack was a really sociable eight-year-old. He loved playing football, doing gymnastics, martial arts and being with his friends. “But in January  that changed overnight. Terried in case he attempted suicide, his mum made an appointment with their GP, who made an urgent referral to the child and adolescent mental health services .  Recalling the appointment, Alison said: “He looked like a severely autistic child. He was playing with the toys on the floor and was in his own little world. He did not look like Jack, he looked like a lost little boy.    “They thought he might have been on the autistic spectrum, but before this there was nothing suggesting that. It was so sudden and made no sense.  “At one point he looked terried, his pupils were really dilated and we weren’t surehe recognised us orhe thought we were strangers.”  Over the ensuing weeks, Jack developed vocal tics and a stutter, as well as starting to regress - playing with baby toys and watching Thomas the Tank Engine, which he had not seen since he was three.  He would repeat meaningless phrases, screech, or bark like a dog and became sensitive to noise and smells.  Alison continued: “He was very irritable. We felt like we were walking on eggshells around him. He had really severe mood swings and really isolated himself. He couldn’t cope with people.  “One of us talking was enough to set him off and he could be extremely aggressive towards me. There was one moment when he was jumping up and down on my neck laughing this evil laugh and when he spoke it was like it wasn’t his voice. It was ashe was possessed.  “Throughout his ordeal, he was going to school, but there were times when he would really struggle. He would have a full blown temper tantrum at the school gates, like a two-year old.    “Most of the time he managed to hold it together at school, but he would come home like a coiled spring ready to explodeyou said the wrong thing.  But the person Jack was hardest on was himself.  Alison said: He developed a really restricted diet, just living off pasta and cheese for months and he would have to eat by himself, in a separate room.  “He stopped sleeping in his bed, saying he didn’t deserve to sleep in a nice comfy bed. He would wander around looking for the most uncomfortable place to sleep. Eventually, we managed to persuade him to stay on the sofa bed downstairs.  “It was such a severe change in him that there had to be an explanation.”  Desperate for answers, after taking Jack to see a paediatrician in March , he had an MRI scan and an electroencephalogram , which is used to find problems related to electrical activity in the brain.    But the results showed nothing unusual and it was suggested he could have an anxiety disorder, having ruled out autism.  “I know it sounds shocking, but I was hoping the MRI would show something that would explain it, said Alison. When it came back completely normal I felt strangely disappointed that my child had a normal brain.  “I thought Jack would be happy that his brain was normal, but he was completely devastated. He burst into tears and said, ‘This has made me feel worse that there’s no reason. This makes me want to die even more’.”  After conducting some online research, Alison came across PANDAS but, with medics reluctant to test for the still little known condition, she sought a second opinion from consultant paediatrician Dr Tim Ubhi at the Children’s e-Hospital, an online service providing expert paediatric advice to parents and their children.  After a Skype consultation in May , he diagnosed PANDAS and devised a treatment plan of antibiotics and ibuprofen - an anti-inflammatory painkiller - which Jack’s doctor agreed to.  “I felt like he was the first person to listen to me,” said Alison.  “Blood test results showed Jack’s stress antibodies were raised.  The way I explained it to Jack is that the antibodies had been attacking his brain rather than the source of the infection. “Dr Ubhi suggested it could have been caused by a strep infection at the back of the throat, because his strep levels were raised. Looking back, about a week before it happened, Jack was complaining of a sore throat , but that was it. “Now he was so happy to have an explanation for what had been happening. It made such a dference to know that there were other people with it, too.   Within a couple of days of taking antibiotics in May - after four months of torment - Jack was like his old self again.  Alison said: “Cara and I were going to the supermarket and he actually volunteered to come with us, which he hadn’t done for five months.  “We all walked around with huge grins on our faces. Cara was over the moon to have her big brother back. They were so close before this happened.”  But, after two weeks, he went down to a maintenance dose of antibiotics and started to deteriorate again - talking about running away and becoming homeless.  “All the thoughts about dying had come back. And then it became harder to get the medication in him, because he didn’t want to get better, he wanted to die,” Alison said.  “There was one occasion when he’d just come off them and out of the blue he held a kne to his throat and said he was going to die. We weren’t prepared for it, so his sister saw all this happening, which was awful.  “Now we are in this cycle of when he’s on antibiotics he is okay, but when he comes off them he deteriorates again.”  Alison also feels that, although doctors agree with his PANDAS diagnosis, it can be dficult to get his ongoing antibiotics prescribed, meaning that, at times, his treatment has been fragmented.  She said: I think partly because thereaposs no published studies demonstrating that long-term antibiotics are beneficial and thereaposs a reluctance to prescribe them because thereaposs concerns about us becoming resistant to them.  During a family break to the Haven Holiday park in Aire, Scotland, in July, Jack - off antibiotics at the time - was really struggling with anxiety and irritability, according to his mum.  “He would normally love to go on the go karts but he was too anxious, she said. There were times when he talked about running away and nobody loving him.  “He developed really weird obsessions, like he became scared of steps and stairs and of walking on seagull poo. We were by the seaside, so it would take us hours to get anywhere.”  One of the saddest consequences of Jackaposs illness has been the damage it has done to his relationship with Cara, who has become wary of the big brother she once so adored.

The legendary Mahendraparvata was feared lost forever, as scientists could not even agree where it was. It was hidden in dense jungle, but advanced aerial mapping has finally allowed its location to be identied after years of searching. But now experts say they can confidently state where temples and large palaces once stood, thanks to laser scanning. The city is thought to have been the first capital of the powerful Khmer Empire, which ruled over large swathes of South East Asia between the ninth and th centuries.    Its name means the Mountain of Indra, King of the Gods. Although archaeologists knew of its existence from ancient records, it has long eluded them because the terrain is so dficult. Exploring the area on foot has been incredibly dangerous because the evil Khmer Rouge, which ruled over Cambodia between  and , laid down landmines there. It was the location of the Communist regimeaposs last stand before it was finally defeated.    It is located in the Phnom Kulen highlands, around  miles north of Siem Reap. Damian Evans, from the French Institute of Asian Studies in Paris, told the New Scientist: The city may not have lasted for centuries, or perhaps even decades, but the cultural and religious signicance of the place has lasted right up until the present day. Even when it was the empireaposs capital, it was challenging for its inhabitants because it was so mountainous.

Promoters have welcomed the move as an opportunity for other producers who have access to a wider range of talent.One large firm, which spoke to the Tele on the condition of anonymity, said: “This is a very big positive#this is about partnership with promoters, and building bridges.”DF Concerts, the firm behind T In The Park and TRNSMT, is staging Bombay Bicycle Club, Bfy Clyro and the Libertines gigs at the Caird Hall before the year is out and previously expressed an interest in Slessor Gardens.The council’s approach to promoters comes after poor sales of tickets for recent shows.The latest gig at Slessor, DunDee s, failed to pull in as many punters as previous acts such as Little Mix, Olly Murs and Steps.There was criticism over scheduling of the s show as it was on the same date as a Madness gig in Montrose, which had been announced months beforehand.And Craig David’s Slessor summer show was moved to the Caird Hall, which has a quarter of the garden’s capacity.LHG claimed the move was due to “unforeseen circumstances”.Concertgoers were also angry after cut-price tickets were offered on discount website Itison just weeks after full-price briefs went on sale.Dundee City Council declined to expand on why it was now approaching other promoters, instead reissuing the same statement it provided to the Tele earlier this year.It said: “There is no long-term agreement or exclusivity agreement in place for Slessor Gardens with any promoters.“The council is continuing to carefully consider the future of the space as a venue.”Meanwhile, LHG, which previously said discussions had been “ongoing” regarding exclusivity, said it would “not be appropriate” to comment on discussions about future shows in Dundee.A spokeswoman said: “We remain committed to working with Dundee City Council and the city’s key stakeholders to realise our joint aspiration in ensuring Dundee remains a culturally vibrant and economically sustainable city.“We firmly believe a series of high quality, safe and appropriate concerts on Slessor Gardens is a key driver to help achieve this.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/03/barry-smith.jpg

to his coaching staff.The former Dundee, Aldershot, East Fe, Raith Rovers and Brechin City manager will bring a wealth of coaching and management experience to his new role and takes up the post with immediate effect.Following discussions, Gary Irvine has agreed to concentrate on his playing role at the League One club and long-serving Barry Sellars will be stepping aside from his coaching role and leaving Station Park.Sellars joined the club in a playing capacity under Ian McPhee nearly  years ago and, apart from a four-year spell back with home-town club Arbroath and one season up at Peterhead, he has served the Loons well in both a playing and coaching capacity since and has been a popular figure around the club.Weir has been hit by a further injury blow with midfielder Murray MacKintosh joining Dale Hilson and Andy Jackson on the sidelines after the ankle injury he picked up at Dumbarton in the Loons’ last outing failed to respond to treatment.MacKintosh has been ruled out for several weeks, while striker Hilson is to go for a scan on the leg injury he suffered against Falkirk a month ago and fellow-frontman Jackson is still recovering from a severe concussion.“Unfortunately, injuries appear to be a feature of this season so far,” Weir said.“Murray’s one is the latest and it will be a few weeks until I have a full squad

a trail for young players and, along with senior team-mate Cammy Kerr, is proving the perfect example for academy prospects says Dundee youth supremo Stephen Wright.The Dark Blues’ head of youth joined the club from Rangers in February and is delighted to have arrived at a time when young players are breaking into the first-team set-up.“It’s brilliant for everybody around here and it’s credit to Finlay Robertson to get where he is at this moment being just -years-old,” Wright told the Tele.“It’s great for these younger lads to see Finlay and see there’s a pathway thatyou’re good enough you’ll get an opportunity.“Especially at a club like Dundee, we need to produce our own players for the first team.“We also have Cammy Kerr, who came up through the ranks, and he comes in to help with the academy and the younger ones.“To have Cammy and Finlay as role models is brilliant for the youth set-up – hopefully, we can get a few more over the next few years.“The managerknows these boys well because he worked with them last year.“James knew how good Finlay was and there’s other guys on the fringes like Lyall Cameron, Josh Mulligan and a few more that James knows.“Credit to the manager for putting them in. He did that with Finlay and he’s still there which shows that,you’re good enough, you’ll get a chance, no matter what age you are.”He added: “I hope there are more coming through.“It’s always dficult to predict because young players all have potential and it’s about whether or not they fulfil that orthe pathway is there for them.“My job is to try to get the players through the system and into the first team like Finlay Robertson. I’ll keep doing that and,players are ready and want it bad enough, there are opportunities here.”Gordon Strachan arrived at the club in the summer and has already made a huge impact on the youth set-up, according to Wright.“With Gordon coming in as technical director, I’ve been lucky enough to spend a lot of time with him since he’s come in,” Wright added.“We share an office and chat about football all the time with Scott Robertson and Gary Irvine, who take the s. It’s great to tap into Gordon’s knowledge.“He’s been great for the academy because he wants to help the coaches as well as the players, meet the parents and all sorts. So, from a wider sense, it’s been fantastic for me and the rest of the guys.“Gordon is really passionate about youth development and has been looking at that for the last  years. Even though he was a manager, he was really interested in youth football across the world so we’re delighted he’s chosen to come to Dundee to make a dference up here. Hopefully, we can get the benefits of that along with the local kids.”Another major step forward for the club’s youth set-up has seen the academy move in to the Regional Performance Centre at Caird Park.Wright added: “The academy was in good hands before I came in. Everything was in place so I knew I was coming into something good with players on the fringes of the first team. There were things I wanted to look at, in particular facilities.“We have now managed to get into the new regional performance centre at Caird Park, which is brilliant. The whole academy is in there, we play games there and have rooms to do analysis and parents nights and dferent things.“We’ve worked hard, starting with John Nelms, to get the academy in there. Leisure and Culture Dundee have been great and we have two full-size astro pitches and everything you need for a modern-day academy. We are very fortunate and grateful we are in there.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/10/5da6f3264c79c0.36348135-540x564.jpg ","title":"george cran weekend victories can make it a successful start for dundee and united","story":"After yet another international break breather, it’s back to the crunch of Championship action in the city.This coming weekend brings an end to the first quarter of the league campaign – a great time to take stock of where Dundee and Dundee United are this season.Up until the last round of fixtures, it would all have been about how far ahead of the Dark Blues the Tangerines were.Their defeat and Dundee’s subsequent victory cut the gap to six points, however, with the coming fixtures having the possibility to see the dference cut even further.Even after all these years of covering football, it still surprises me how quickly football can change.Despite that, however, one bad result won’t alter my prediction of Robbie Neilson’s side winning the Championship, come the end of the campaign.The Tangerines have looked untouchable at times at Tannadice, knocking in  goals in just four matches at home with Lawrence Shankland getting  of them.Shankland joins the list of nine Dundee United national heroes to score for Scotland\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp shankland-joins-the-list-of-united-national-heroes embed #

The problem sustained against Kilmarnock at Rugby Park on August  ruled him out for five weeks.McKenna was drafted back into the Dons backline for the visit of the Hibees having had just two training sessions.As a result he was not involved in the Scotland squad which played Russia in Moscow and San Marino at Hampden in Euro  qualiers last week.McInnes believes the player benefited from spending time with club physios after hisagainst Hibs and is pleased McKenna has been able to get more training time under his belt during the international break.McInnes said: “Scott had a couple of days just with the physios after the game against Hibs.“That was to settle the injury down and do that work.“He’s now had the opportunity to put some back-to-back training sessions together.“Credit to him, he only had two training sessions before the Hibs game and he put himself forward to play.“Hopefully he’ll feel the benefit not just of the game against Hibs, but the training he’s had since.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.44999229-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.44999229-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.44999229-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.44999229-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"aberdeen fans sporting chance to see famous trophy ahead of euro 2020","story":"It has been held aloft by football superstars Cristiano Ronaldo, Iker Casillas and Zinedine Zidane and now the Henri Delaunay Trophy has visited the north-east.The cup will be presented to the winning captain at next summer’s Euro  international football tournament.Yesterday, Aberdeen Sports Village visitors had the chance to get up close and personal with the glittering prize.It was the centrepiece of a touring exhibition on the continental contest’s proud history.Named the Hampden Roar, the exhibition featured footballing artefacts from the Scottish Football Museum, including the shirt Ally McCoist wore when he scored in Scotland’s -

Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee.

Two men were paid to accompany Patrick the Fool on his journey from England to provide entertainment for the King and his guests while residing at Tarbert.Also recorded is a figure for #making a suit for the King at Tarbert#.  Bruce visited Tarbert on many occasions. His final visit was in the year of his death.Tarbert is believed to have been one of the earliest Royal Burghs in Argyll. An early reference as such was made in . It is also said to have had one of the earliest paved streets in Scotland.King James IV also had a close connection with Tarbert. The addition of the #keep# to the castle, part of which still stands today, was constructed at his direction. Whilst this work was underway, James summoned parliament to meet him here to discuss matters local to the area. This meeting took place on July  .Over the years, many travellers of note have passed this way and commented on Tarbert and its scenic surroundings.In  Thomas Pennant arrived by sea at East Loch Tarbert and described the scenery as #picturesque#.CGS Teighnmouthpassed through the Kyles of Bute in  and commented that #it offers no scenery worthy of notice#. He continued to note that #the romantic little harbour of East Loch Tarbert – with the overhanging keep of its ruined castle # form a scene singularly picturesque#. He became a frequent visitor to Tarbert.In  Lord Cockburndescribed the Kyles as #rugged and picturesque# but, arriving at his destination, exclaimed: #But Tarbert! East Tarbert! How is it that I had never even heard of that curious little bay. There it lay, calm and silvery, like a scene from a theatre. A striking and beautul spot.#In the modern era, many thousands of tourists visit Tarbert each year.

Around  resident berth holders and more than , visiting leisure craft during the sailing season add considerably to the numbers who arrive at Tarbert and appreciate the attractive surroundings.The present plans for the power line, however, as exhibited by SSEN, will present a view on entering the harbour despoiled by a line of monster pylons.The current proposal suggests that four or five of the -foot pylons will dominate the western skyline. The visual impact of this scheme as presently proposed will have a negative effect on the experience of everyone who lives in, or visits, Tarbert.Tarbert was designated as a conservation area in the s.

Through Debussy’s impressionist piece, Rinaldo Hahn’s Operatic journey and into Du Parc comforting his love with a dream like harp created by the piano.The duo then gave us a contemporary piece by Joseph Horowitz which comprised of snippets from the monologues of Shakespeare’s Lady Macbeth and the music tracks her descent into madness.

Perceptive, spirited and loving.\"Photographer Allan, who has been publishing his work since the s, spent decades in locations such as Vietnam, Morocco, Libya and Australia to produce unforgettable images.Since ing home earlier this year he has released photographic titles, Vintage Tractors and Scotlands Islands, before putting the final shots together for Edinburgh.Allan admits that Gerdas involvement has taken the publication to a new level. He said: \"My initial concept was to produce a comparatively modest format, aimed at the photographically conscious visitor.\"By good fortune however, in engaging with Gerda as co-author, the scope and spirit of the work has been widened and deepened.\"The poems featured in this book have interacted with my images penetrating the veneer that can often dominate the city.\"All those prestigious castings and fine masonry may, collectively, have created one of Europersquos most beautul cities, but there were struggles in its making, and so often a human price was paid.\"I hope, therefore, it proves thought provoking at the very least.Gerda, who is an award-winning actor, songwriter and director as well as a writer, added: \"This has been a fascinating and welcome collaboration ndash an opportunity to reacquaint myself with my beloved home city, and its many contradictions.\"Irsquove relished both the process of responding to Allanrsquos vibrant images, and the way in which the project unexpectedly developed: finding myself writing additional poems about aspects of the city which Allan then went out to photograph.\"The journey towards finding a visual and poetic narrative

That race took place over the course of last weekend.The series featured five rounds at dferent venues, and each race was set up like a car rally, with untimed uphill transition stages leading to ious timed downhill sections, the results of which were amalgamated into an overall race time. The stages ied massively in , from as little as  seconds to an absolute behemoth we endured at Laggan in April which took us  minutes to ride! The topography and trail surface dfered wildly from venue to venue but also from stage to stage, and the taped trails we raced down last weekend at Fort William epitomised this eclectic set-up.Stage  was the easiest and least technical track we have raced on all year, an entirely man-made sprint through flowing banked corners coated in compacted quarry dust. Of course you had to be careful you didn`t push too hard, it is all too easy to wreck a race run by hitting the deck on an easy stage. We assumed that the organisers were trying to lull us into a  sense of security with stage #and we were so right!Stage  started halfway down the legendary World Cup track , channelling riders through some savage rock gardens before cutting off to the right along a lung-busting fireroad before descending into another sculpted hardpack track which then erted down a horrendously muddy, freshly cut chute that was littered with roots big enough to swallow a bike wheel whole. Even walking down it was impossible.A big transition ride towards Torlundy took us to the top of stage , which was the famous Blue Crane trail running into Ridgeline. Both of these tracks are black-graded on a good day, but there is a huge dference between trying to ride these ‘for fun’ and then trying to race on them once  people have spent a whole Saturday skidding them to bits in the tipping rain! A lot of people fell foul of this stage, but we survived and we absolutely loved it.Stage  was a dferent animal altogether. We had tackled it fairly early on practice day and hadn`t had any issues with it, but the swarm of maniacs who had ridden it in the rain since our earlier visit had turned it into an absolute swamp and the ruts were so deep that I found it almost impossible to negotiate with my limited skills. Dave telling me afterwards that he had romped it didn`t help my mood one bit!The last  stages were so high up the mountain that we needed a trip on the gondola to get to them. The black graded Top Chief track is a fearsome animal that follows the best twisty bedrock line around the hill before plummeting several hundred feet straight down off it into the tree line below, where it once again becomes sanitised into a flowing, twisty and utterly hilarious serpent of a trail that had riders drting and whooping all the way to the carpark. The organisers had cleverly split the Top Chief track into two stages, as there is a long section of perched wooden boardwalk high up on the mountain that is great fun to ride but would be far too dangerous to race on. Stage  was therefore very short -taking most riders about  seconds to ride- while stage  was a  minute monster. What a way to finish a season!So how did we do David was fastest of the three of us, as he has been all season. He finished in a time of  minutes,  seconds. He races in the Senior category , so it is a tough school littered with sponsored riders and crazy kids. He finished th in seniors on the day, and th overall out of an entry of  riders. Having failed to finish the race at Laggan earlier in the year due to a mechanical breakdown, David has been constantly playing catch-up but he still managed to finish in a brilliant nd place overall in the seniors category for the season.Alex has ridden consistently all year and has managed to tread the fine line between wrecking and ruling perfectly at every round. He had one of his very few crashes on the last stage at Fort William which cost him a few seconds, but he still ed a very respectable time of : to finish nd in the Masters category. The Masters section almost always attracts the largest entry and it is full of well-heeled chargers on very expensive steeds, so for Alex to finish in th place in that championshipin his first full season is a highly respectable result.I have continually been either on par or just slower than Alex on nearly every stage of the year, and nothing changed here. I knowI`ve kept within a few seconds of him I have done just fine, and I managed my ride to achieve this perfectly right up until the last stage where a cruel puncture right on top of the hill put paid to any chances of a good result to finish the year. With  top s already in the bag for the season though , I managed to hold onto th place in the Grand Veteran`s championship which was some consolation for a day that finished with me feeling, well, a bit deflated.Competing in this series has been a brilliant experience for us. We have had some hilarious times racing our bikes through some of Scotland`s very best scenery, and we have loved camping out of the back of vans. The organisers at No Fuss Events have done an outstanding job of setting up a professionally run race series in some dficult locations and have always managed to tread the right side of a precarious line, providing us with stages that have been just barely on the rideable side of ridiculous!David Muirhead leads Alex Dickson down the rocky Top Chief track during Saturday#s practice.

A high-energy showing in Paisley saw the McFadyens-sponsored side run out convincing winners.With the match going ahead at the Kibble’s grass park despite the heavy rain overnight and during the week leading up to the game, the surface was in surprisingly good condition, allowing the Pupils to get into their attacking flow early on.Up against a home side not lacking in height and physical stature, the Pupils had to be ready to contend with some lofted early balls from back to front by the hosts, whose game plan seemed to be to get the ball to their forwards as quickly as possible, but the Pupils# defence of Fraser Wylie, Ross Souden, Ryan McConnachie and Stuart Crossan, stood up to the task well.The Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils quick passing and inidual pace and skill in the final third caused the hosts problems early on, and Ryan Gilchrist and Gregor McFadyen, and both had almost identical attempts to score, but snatched at their shots at the vital moment.However, the Kintyre Park side would not be denied for long, and scored after  minutes through a sharp passing move that released Gregor McFayden, who buried an arrowed shot from the edge of the box to continue his excellent goalscoring form.Then, the visitors made it - after  minutes, when an enterprising move out of defence found right-back Crossan, whose ball through to Johnny McCormick allowed the right winger to cut inside onto his left foot and release a thunderous first-time drive into roof of the net for a great goal, his second of the season.After seeing their deficit doubled, Carlton for their part put their Kintyre visitors under a bit of pressure from several corners and free kicks, but the Pupils’ defensive discipline continued to win over.Into the second half, the Pupils made it - when Donald McCallum scored another great goal, in a move started by Liam Renton, whose in-swinging corner was cleared to the edge of the penalty box where the ex-Dumbarton man McCallum made space to drive a deflected shot into the top corner of the net.At this point in the match, all three subs were used, with Ellis Robertson and Michael McKinlay replacing the excellent deep-lying midfield pairing of Ryan Gilchrist and Liam Renton, and Ross Brown entering in the fray in a direct swap with winger McCormick.The youngster Brown quickly got involved to create the Pupils# fourth goal, outpacing the Carlton full-back to draw out the last defender and square the ball across for Scott Souden to cheekily chip the ball over the home keeper into the net.The rampant Pupils completed the scoring in the th minute after hesitation between a Carlton defender and his keeper allowed McFadyen to nip in, touch the ball round the keeper to score a simple but well-earned second goal, for his brace on the day, and his fourth of the season.At the other end, the Pupils were determined to get their second consecutive clean sheet in league action, and while young keeper Alistair Ferguson spilled a deflected free kick in the latter stages, he bravely ed at the feet of the striker to smother his effort. The Pupils management noted how Ferguson’s kicking and distribution was first-class throughout the match.A Pupils spokesman said: ‘It was a great team effort, with our attacking players working together to cause problems all game. At the back, we defended high balls and direct play really well.’The Pupils are in league action again tomorrowwhen they welcome Argyll rivals Lochgilphead Red Star.

George reminisced: ‘It was announced at a Town Council meeting that the Royal couple was scheduled to visit. It was all to be top secret, but that didn’t happen. The next morning the #secret# was ulged in a queue in one of the town’s shops and the news was out.’With a smile that showed how fond these memories are to him, George continued: ‘The Royal Yacht Britannia was anchored out in the loch and a small boat brought the Queen and Prince Philip to the quay where my father was delegated to catch and secure the rope. They were then driven to the Town Hall and there was a huge crowd present.‘Campbeltown Gaelic Choir, conducted by Mr M G McCallum who was also a councillor, had a lovely surprise for the Royal visitors. Prince Charles had just been made Prince of Wales, so the choir sang ‘God Bless the Prince of Wales’. This was very well received, and the Queen said that she had not heard it before.’George and Mrs McMillan were present at a reception given by the Town Council in the Town Hall.

The prize he truly covets, of course, isa majority in parliament whether that happens off the back of a deal or no-deal is a mere moot point to this reckless PM.Despite a move to substantive negotiations, there is still no guarantee that a deal can or will be struck with the EU. ButMr Johnson does manage to wrest an agreement that the EU and Ireland can live with ndash one which will, in yet another surreal and eye-rolling twist to the Brexit debacle, basically be Theresa Mayrsquos deal all over again ndash it creates a dilemma for the opposition parties.How should they respond to a potentially dangerous situation wherein the PM gleefully passes the buck to MPs, daring them not to raty his deal as the clock ominously ticks down, setting up the next play in his intellectually bankrupt but politically expedient blame game Yet again, Nicola Sturgeon has shown sense and leadership by making clear that her MPs will not vote for it. Why would they  Ms Sturgeon has been consistent from the outset: her party will not vote for any deal that takes Scotland and the UK out of the single market and customs union, causing untold damage to the Scottish economy. And since the current prime minister favours a harder, more isolationist and ideologically right-wing Brexit than even that fashioned by Mrs May, it is surely incumbent upon all UK opposition parties to fight tooth and nail to save the country from such a disastrous and isive path.Thatrsquos why they have no option but to vote down Mr Johnsonrsquos deal and force a general election, the circumstances of which will be vital in determining how it can be framed. After all, itrsquos not just Mr Johnsonrsquos tenure that must be keep short, but his list of options.The Lib Dems under Jo Swinson wonrsquot vote for any deal, not least because ldquogetting Brexit done would render their new \"stop Brexit altogether\" mandate redundant.

The UK Supreme Court had earlier ruled that secession was illegal, and that by supporting it, the Scottish Government, which has been disbanded, had committed a crime equivalent to a declaration of war against the UKThe European Union has refused to comment on the imprisonment of the Scottish nationalists. A Brussels official said it was ldquoan internal matter for the United Kingdom...Incredible  Fantasy  Of course. We donrsquot behave like that in Britain ndash at least we hope not. But thatrsquos exactly what has happened in Spain. For the first time since the death of the fascist dictator General Franco, elected politicians have been seized, tried and imprisoned, with draconian sentences, for the crime of democracy. For organising a peaceful referendum in .:Protests erupt as Spain convicts leading Catalan separatistsThe democratically-elected Catalan President, Carles Puigdemont, is in Belgium fighting attempts by the Madrid state to extradite him. Nine Catalan politicians and independence activists have been sentenced in Madrid to between nine and  years for the archaic crimes of sedition and disobedience. The government of Catalonia, elected in a free and fair election, has been suppressed.The Catalan independence movement, like its counterpart in Scotland, has been entirely peaceful and democratic. Yet it has been subjected to some of the worst police violence seen in Europe for decades. Approaching , demonstrators were injured during the suppression of voting in . Another  independistas were injured on Monday.The European Union appears to have washed its hands of Catalonia. Brussels regards it as an internal matter. The outspoken Guy Verhofstadt, who has not been slow to comment on the ldquointernal affairs of authoritarian countries from Hungary to Hong Kong, has been silent on the most egregious violation of basic civil rights seen in Europe since the creation of the EU.The EU is supposed to uphold the European Convention on Human Rights. Its own Charter of Fundamental Rights includes, under Article , on political freedom: ldquothe right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association at all levels, in particular in political, trade union and civic matters.The imprisonment of elected politicians, who have never incited violence, is an offence against every citizen of the EU. These sentences should be overturned in the European Court of Justice in Strasbourg, and hopefully, they will be.But today there needs to be more than head-shaking by leaders of other EU countries. Politicians who routinely condemn Vladimir Putin seem unable to see the hypocrisy in failing to condemn Madrid. Liberal newspapers like theshow their ambivalence by reporting the fate of Catalan political prisoners as ldquoa warning to Scottish nationalists.Seriously  A warning of what, precisely  They are surely not suggesting that an unlawful Scottish referendum could result in anything remotely similar.:Former Catalan leader Oriol Junqueras jailed over independence referendumWhat should be deeply worrying to the UK Left is that the imprisonment of the Catalan independistas has been condoned by the Socialist Prime Minister of Spain, Pedro Sanchez. The reason: he canrsquot interfere with the law of the land. One hopes that the silence from Mr Corbyn does not indicate any solidarity with Mr Sanchezrsquos rigid adherence to undemocratic laws.Indeed, Spain is a lesson for radical politicians in the UK not to place too much faith in the efficacy of Supreme Courts. Those at the SNP conference whorsquove been talking about pursuing independence through the courts should take note. The law is politics by other means, and Supreme Courts are supremely political institutions.The fact that Lady Hale gave Boris Johnson short shrt over proroguing parliament doesnrsquot mean that the Supreme Court is going to be kind to Scottish nationalism. In , the UK Supreme Court dismissed out of hand the Sewel Convention ndash the right of Holyrood to withhold consent to any laws passed by Westminster that cut across the powers of the Scottish parliament. When the chips are down, the UK Supreme Court will always see the integrity of the United Kingdom as its first priority.:Letters: The EU needs to help Spain and Catalonia find peaceThe same goes for Brussels. Ms Sturgeon has condemned the behaviour of the Spanish government, but she should also be making clear her discontent with the EU. Brussels is deeply ambivalent about state repression, whether in France against the Gilet Jaunes, or against the Catalans in Spain. Even when the UK is out of the EU, it is naiumlve to expect that Brussels will necessarily support Scotlandit comes to a constitutional breakdown with Westminster.These are dark times. All the more so because of the double standards of liberal opinion in the UK. We continually hear warnings about impending fascism in Britain. Columnists warn about the threat to democracy from Tommy Robinson, from Boris Johnson, from Brexiters. But here is real fascist repression taking place right now in one of the largest countries in the European Union.Itrsquos time for European governments to condemn this wilful regression to authoritarianism. The Spanish state should be diplomatically shunned by the British Government until it releases these political prisoners, just as countries like Russia are shunned. Madrid must be made to realise that this kind of repression cannot succeed.By reviving the spirit of Franco in st century Europe, Spain has squandered any sympathy for its centralist cause. It is legitimate to argue against Catalan independence it is legitimate to fight elections opposing it. But by breaking heads, dismissing elected governments and then imprisoning peaceful politicians, Madrid has acted in defiance of international law. And it has made the case for Catalan independence unanswerable."},{"url":null,"title":"Rosemary Goring  A chance to make history but the Booker judges blew it","story":"I doubt the Booker organisers are so ecstatic. Since its inception in , the award has only twice before been shared. First was in , when Nadine Gordimer and Stanley Middleton were twinned, and again in , with Michael Ondaatje and Barry Unsworth. After that regrettable outcome, whereby both writersrsquo thunder was stolen, the rules were changed, vetoing this ever happening again.During rsquos final meeting, Florence and his team ndash Liz Calder, Xiaolu Guo, Afua Hirsch and Joanna McGregor ndash were reluctant or unable to make a clear-cut decision. Asking for advice, they were reminded of the rules. Gaby Wood, of the Booker Prize Foundation, reported that, ldquoThey were not so much ided as unwilling to jettison any more when they finally got down to two, and askedthey might split the prize between them. On being told that it was definitively against the rules, the judges held a further discussion and chose to flout them. They left the judging room happy and proud...Should they be proud  I donrsquot think so. That rule was in place to prevent exactly what is already happening. The impact on an author of winning this prestigious title can be dramatic, as last yearrsquos laureate, Anna Burns, made clear in her speech to the literati in Londonrsquos glitzy medieval Guildhall. Gaining the imprimatur of the Booker brings a blaze of international attention, and a Himalayan spike in sales that no sensible novelist would dare dream of, for fear of waking up to the grim reality of meagre royalties that make the living wage look like a Euro Lottery windfall.Margaret Atwood, a previous winner, hinted as much when accepting the accolade. More than anyone, she understands the stakes. This was attention she does not need, her career already illustrious, and she was gracious in acknowledging that. Perhaps she also knows The Testaments isnrsquot in the same class as some of her earlier work. It is not one of the best books Irsquove read this year, although one that is ndash Lucy Ellmannrsquos Ducks, Newburyport, which was shortlisted ndash was a strong contender for first place.Atwood, to my mind, was given her share of the trophy because of the hype around her long-awaited follow-up and its cult following, thanks in large part to the recent television series. But even had it been her finest novel yet, the judges have been cruel to Bernardine Eisto. She is the first black woman to win, a good news story by any standards. That triumph should have been shouted from the rooftops. What a great statement it would have been for her to have been selected, head and shoulders above the rest. Instead, a  that consisted of four women and one man did a disservice to a writer who deserved the full glory, and the full commercial boost, that this distinction brings.The make-up of the judging  is interesting, reflecting the need for greater ersity, and less male dominance, in literary decision-making. And yet this predominantly female group, drawn from a iety of backgrounds and disciplines, blew it. What might have been a historic moment, representing a signicant cultural turning point, has had its impact blunted, its signicance diminished.The reasoning behind this is hard to understand. With five members, it cannot be impossible to have a majority for one particular title. A resolute chair would usually insist on that, gradually eliminating books to reach a single choice. Previous judges have spoken of the angst and turmoil in that final meeting, as the clock ticks down to the ceremony that evening. Last-minute deals are struck, compromises conceded, arguments clinched. For the chair especially, blood pressure mounts at the thought of facing the cameras with a speech when as yet no name has been picked.The reasons for deciding the award on the day of the ceremony are obvious: fear of a leak ruining the live announcement. Yetit is possible to sign waivers in order to get hold of embargoed books ahead of publication, as happened with The Testaments, which was shrouded in Harry Potter-style secrecy, Bookerrsquos organisers can surely bind the judges to keep their choice under wraps overnight. If the final meeting could instead be held without a gun to the head, in itself a form of literary roulette, cooler heads and better counsel would prevail. Perhaps, like a jury in a murder trial, the five could be holed up incommunicado in a hotel until the award night arrives. Better still, they could simply promise to say nothing and then, for the space of  hours, keep their word. How novel would that be What this split decision suggests is that in the judgesrsquo minds, the entire shortlist was worthy of the prize, and they wanted to show as little favouritism as they could. Yet what is the point of a le-changing pound, rewardnot to anoint a standout victor  In effect, this attitude is an echo of the ideology that says we are all successes, and nobody should ever be declared a runner-up or loser in a race or an exam. By insisting on a double honour, ostensibly for big-hearted reasons, the judges have in fact ducked the tough responsibility with which they were charged.Whatever its impact on Atwood and Eisto, this two-hander feels horribly, tediously familiar. Just picture the scene, as the adjudication meeting dragged on for hours. Indecision, a mounting sense of impasse, endless, increasingly feverish discussions, and a leader who could not or would not break the deadlock. After this, a last-ditch soliciting of professional opinion, followed by a flagrant breaking of the rules. In this sense, at least, Booker rsquos unsatisfactory outcome is very much a story of our times."},{"url":null,"title":"no-deal-brexit-scottish-housing-shortage-follow-eu-exit","story":"More than half a dozen councils in Scotland have claimed that house building targets and ongoing development could be in jeopardya No Deal Brexit were to go ahead.Loss of labour from the European Union, reduction in EU funding and increases in the costs of supplies used in property development could put plans to build thousands of new homes across the country at risk.Council bosses in West Lothian, Perth and Kinross and Edinburgh are among those who included the warning in their risk assessments ahead of the UKrsquos exit from the European Union.Housing association bosses in Scotland say that many programmes are currently on hold as questions remain over future funding, asking for the Scottish Government to come forward with a long-term commitment.:How a No Deal Brexit will affect me: Scottish councils fears for EU exit revealedSally Thomas, chief executive of the Scottish Federation Of Housing Associations, said: ldquoAt present, some social housing providers have put development plans on hold, because the Scottish Government is yet to commit to affordable housing investment after the current programme ends in .

How long till citizens of the US will stop referring to the ldquoUK as ldquoEngland  Not any time soon.Malcolm Rankin, Seamill.IN the current furore over the punishment of Catalan politicians for their criminal activity in pursuit of secession from Spain , an important factor is being ignored by most commentators. This is that the primacy of unelected judges over elected politicians is a direct result of having a written constitution that must be enforcedthe rule of law is to be maintained.By coincidence, a written constitution is one of the demands of the  self-appointed sages from Scotlands elite who have set themselves up as superior to two million No voters with their Declaration For Independence.It is hard to see how they ndash or the SNP which also wants a statutory constitution ndash can complain about the principle of legal action against those who choose to flout that same constitution.Personally, I think the convictions are entirely in order, but the penalties are much too harsh: those found guilty should be surcharged for the waste of public money, banned from holding public office, and made to do some useful community service such as removing ugly secessionist graffiti.Peter A Russell, Glasgow G.DITCH. Open-plan. Excellent order. Never used. Free to good rhetorician.Donald M Manson, Prestwick.GUY Stenhouse certainly had a right old rant . \"Right\" and \"old\" as he resorts to old right-wing myths of \"loopy left\", \"politics of envy\", \"nanny state\" and \"dead hand of state control\". Another point of view might suggest rabid right, politics of greed, a caring, responsible state, and liberating the oppressed from the excesses of privately controlled power.It appears to be a pattern on the right currently to use emotive language to attempt to bolster otherwise failing arguments. The trouble is, evidence shows such an approach tends to lower the standard of debate.

The governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, has admitted there are “known errors” in the RPI system and last year called for the UK Government to stop issuing bonds linked to it.But that advice has come too late for many local authorities in Scotland which are now shelling out millions more in costs for schools that were built under private finance initiatives.Costs of other Scottish PFI schemes, from prisons to hospitals, have also been rocketing since the deals were agreed.A Scottish Government spokesman said PFI had left “taxpayers in Scotland liable for a £ billion legacy of payments”.He added: “The annual PFI repayment bill now exceeds £ billion – nearly five times more than the Non-Profit Distributingprogramme which we introduced and is proving far better value to the public purse.“The funding of public infrastructure has vastly improved since . “We are working to ensure PFI contracts which have been inherited provide the best value for money for the taxpayer – and to ensure savings are achieved from existing contracts, wherever possible.”The Scottish Government is understood to be eyeing a model of public-private partnerships pioneered by the Welsh Government.Like PFI, the so-called Mutual Investment Model sees private partners build and maintain public assets for a fee.But the deals do not include services like cleaning, which have proved costly through PFI. The model also involves the public sector as a minority co-investor, taking a share of the profits.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.donsidepiper webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Figures published by Facebook show that #. million was spent on political ads on Facebook or sister site Instagram.\"  Thousands spent on targeted Facebook adverts by Scottish politicians viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"DONS | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"DONS | Article Teaser\"Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard has pledged to ban any further public-private finance dealshis party takes power.“Scotland’s historical PFI deals have put unnecessary pressure on our NHS, our local government services and right across the public sector,” he said.“That is why I have been clear that the Scottish Labour government that I lead will introduce a ban on new PFI PPP NPD deals.“We will also take private contracts back in-house at the earliest opportunity to save the taxpayer money in the long term.”The JPI Media investigations team has been looking into PFI contracts across the UK.According to figures obtained from hundreds of public bodies, rocketing inflation and extra costs are set to add at least £ billion to the overall price tag of PFI schemes.Among its findings, the team found that:• An NHS maternity unit built and run by a private company was closed after just  years but is still costing the taxpayer millions of pounds• A police force is trying to think up new uses for a mothballed custody suite it is still paying for• Expensive maintenance contracts have seen one police force billed £ for an extra chair.Trade union leaders have called for urgent action.Unite assistant general secretary Gail Cartmail said the escalating costs of PFI were a “national scandal”.She said: “The money that has poured into the pockets of profit-hungry financial institutions and private companies could have been much better spent directly on public service projects and infrastructure. “PFIs are a rip-roaring example of out-of-control ‘bandit capitalism’.”"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"October ,  at : pmOrkney Islands Council has issued a safety reminder after a number of maritime distress flares were dumped at St Margaret’s Hope household waste and recycling centre.

As is tradition, an ensign, which has been tied to the wreck of the battleship was presented to a family member of one of the crewmen.

It will also give people an extra incentive not to litter.Zero Waste Scotland, who helped the Scottish Government design the scheme, is especially interested to hear from islands-based drinks producers, retailers, hospitality businesses, and other key stakeholders, such as tourism businesses.The draft regulations laid before the Scottish Parliament in September include a target of capturing  per cent of all scheme containers. Achieving that requires making the scheme accessible and practical for everyone in Scotland.In addition to this and six other island engagement events, the Scottish Government will complete an Islands Impact Assessment to ensure that any signicant unique impacts on island communities are captured and mitigated against. A webinar will be held after the final event to give people that could not attend a chance to learn more about the scheme.Jill Farrell, chief operating officer, Zero Waste Scotland, said: “We want to make sure that Scotland’s Deposit Return Scheme works for the whole of Scotland. That’s why we are visiting Orkney to speak with residents, businesses and stakeholders. We want to benefit from their insight into how this will work for the islands.“Making the scheme a success in Orkney will require dferent approaches from in Scotland’s cities. From logistics and transport, to cash flow and tourism, we look forward to discussing how we can work together to deliver a world-class scheme.”Alastair Nicolson, programme manager at Highlands  Islands Enterprise, said: “This is a very ambitious scheme that aims to make a real dference to people and communities in every part of Scotland.“For the scheme to work effectively, dferent approaches will need to be worked out and applied. Models of recycling that work well in large towns and cities won’t necessarily bring about the desired results in rural areas, including islands and remote mainland communities.“It’s great that the needs of islanders are being recognised at this early stage of the Deposit Return Scheme through this programme of events on the ground and online.”The Orkney engagement event will take place at The Orkney Hotel, Kirkwall, on Thursday October , from am to pm.To sign up to take part, visit http:bit.ly DepositReturnOrkneyA webinar will be hosted by Zero Waste Scotland following its series of island engagement events.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It states that rural and remote areas, especially those in The Highlands and Islands, have signicant populations at risk from the fallout of leaving the EU – with or without a trade deal.The report considers community access to services, working-age population, income deprivation, workers in #Brexit-sensitive# industries, EU worker migration and how many EU payments are received.Highlands and Islands representative Ms Todd said: “We always knew that Brexit would be damaging to Scotland but this new analysis really hits home the devastating impact that Brexit will have here in the Shetland Islands.“Families across Shetland will feel the impact of Brexit, with up to  per cent of the local population most vulnerable to the potential economic shock.“The SNP government will continue to do what it can to mitigate and minimise the impact on our most vulnerable communities, but this study lays bare the recklessness of the Tories in their blind determination to pursue Brexit at any cost.“Scotland never voted for Brexit and certainly not for the reckless extreme version now pursued by the UK government. It’s essential that we stop Brexit and go back to the people.”Ms Todd added that a report by the Institute for Fiscal Studies , also published this week, #found the UK is already £ billion worse off as a result of Brexit before we have even left the EU – with the UK economy .- per cent smaller than it otherwise would have been.#Over a million voters in Scotland voted for BREXIT, % of Shetlanders voted to leave, are their votes to be ignored  As a UNITED Kingdom we operate as a single unit well we did during two world wars. I find that Maree Todd’s concern about the potential economic effect that BREXIT could have upon Shetlanda bit of a cheek, coming from a party that currently has chalked up a deficit of £ billion for Scotland, due to irresponsible spending policies.Brexit, is nothing more than for the Tories to distance themselves from the EU, and to have a trade deal with the USA, and the, most likely, mass privatisation of most government responsibilities and duties of care going to US companies, where the Tories will benefit as shareholders of such companies. It is so typical of the Tories to put themselves first regardless to the devastating consequences of their policies and selfish agenda#s onto the people of the UK, especially those in society who struggle as it is. It will be a society of those who have and those who do not have. Where profit is the dominating principle which governs and controls those in power. Brexit, will make the UK, very much an unfair, unjust society for the majority of people. It will also have a great impact on smaller communities where the work-force is from the EU, and the economic circumstances putting many jobs and businesses at risk.Brexit, in all its forms, will cause more harm than good####not to mention poking the fires of xenophobia and racism in its wake.If Shetland is #among the most vulnerable to Brexit#, then presumably, it will also be #among the most vulnerable to Scexit# as we are guaranteed to be out of the EU with No Deal, should the SNP#s policy of Scottish independence ever become reality Tulloch undermines himself. As a UNITED Europe we acted as a single unit. Why should leaving one Union be better than leaving the other  He should reflect on the plain fact that it isn’t our European neighbours that are demanding we split from England against our stated will.“Take back control” my rear end.Peter Hamilton, we agree at last. You, at last, you admit to talking from your rear end!! Now it all makes sense.No Peter, it is the Tories. As I have previously mentioned, their agenda is nothing more than to privatise and hand control of the UK#s Health Care and and other Infrastructure to US companies, where the Tories will benefit mostly. The cost of living under Brexit, will most certainly increase, and the people most affected by it will struggle even more.The Tories, as they have always done, have only thought of themselvesand what they can gain regardless to the damaging consequences upon everybody  in society.Their policies and political motives are highly isive, and generally do more harm than good to society as a whole.Bad enough we have London Europe bleating how they will sufferwe leave EU, when frankly none of them venture beyond the M wall to see England.

However, in light of massive electoral fraud in the West Midlands and the South East of England, particularly in local government elections, the current administration has decided to tighten up the rules it is long overdue. Germany, France, Sweden, the Netherlands and Greece all require either a national ID card or a utility bill or bank statement as proof of residency which, especially in the case of Greece, have been necessary. Australia and Israel, and certain states within America have also tightened up the rules due to similar issues with fraud. None of the above measures have prevented honest citizens from exercising their democratic rights.The UK remains a country with low levels of voter fraud and the majority of the recent alleged voter fraud in the Midlands related to postal and proxy votes which voter ID at the ballot box will do nothing to solve.Carmichael an obstacle to democracy , says Anderson.#The government have sat on their hands in the face of the actual threats to electoral integrity: anonymous ‘dark ads’, dodgy donations and disinformation.

Typically dark , with intricate patterns, thebird is dficult to spot with the naked eye during the day. However, once aerial, with its buoyant but erratic flight, this bird is most conspicuous.One of those who had the opportunity to view the bird last week was RSPB site manager, Brad Robson.He said: “It really is a fantastic bird. It sits on branches during the day and then at night it flies about hunting insects.“To see a Common Nighthawk is very rare indeed in fact it is the first one recorded in Northern Ireland. There have been sightings in Ireland on just a couple of occasions.”Its appearance in Ballymena has generated huge interest with bird watchers coming over from the UK to see it.Brad went on to explain that the bird is likely to have ended up in Ballymena due to the recent Storm Lorenzo.He said: “The Common Nighthawk breeds across North America and then they migrate to warmer parts of South America.“During that migration some will fly out over the coast. However, when you get these big powerful weather systems which you see across the Atlantic at this time of year some of those birds can get caught up in the storms. They are then whisked off across the Atlantic and one of their first landing stops can be Ireland.“When a bird is travelling in a weather system it cannot feed so the faster the weather system is across the Atlantic the more chance of it surviving the journey. Some birds will often rest on ships, however, that is unlikely to be the case with this bird.”Brad said that whilst the sighting in Ballymena is “very rare” the storm did bring a some American birds to Europe, causing a lot of excitement among bird watchers.He added: “It was great to see the Common Nighthawk flying about hoovering up the insects and I think everyone there was pleased to be able to see it so easily.”According to nibirds it is now believed that the Common Nighthawk is an adult male due to the bright white throat, the thick white bars near the base of the primaries and the blackish primaries and has been present in the area since September . The common nighthawk measures . to . inches long and displays a wing span of to  inches. During migration, common nighthawks may travel , to , kilometres . According to nibirds it is now believed that the Common Nighthawk is an adult male due to the bright white throat, the thick white bars near the base of the primaries and the blackish primaries and has been present in the area since September . The enormous distance travelled between breeding grounds and wintering range is one of the North Americas longer migrations. The northbound journey commences at the end of February and the birds reach destinations as late as mid-June. The southbound migration commences mid-July and reaches a close in early October.While migrating, these birds have been reported travelling through middle America, Florida, the West Indies, Cuba, the Caribbean and Bermuda, finally completing their journey in the wintering grounds of South America, primarily Argentina.

I hope that they will make that decision as soon as possible.“There have been other large-scale applications that have been submitted after Casement Park, which have already been decided.

However, at a recent review hearing six months after the original fitness to practise hearing, it emerged that Ms Porter has not engaged with the NISCC.The review  heard that the NISCC wrote to Ms Porter on July  this year asking her to provide information about what steps she had taken to address the \"shocking\" and \"unprofessional conduct\" but she had not responded.It said: \"There is nothing before the committee to give it any confidence that the registrant has resolved or remedied the cause of her misconduct during the period of her suspension.\"The committee noted that the registrant had not engaged with the Council at all and was concerned that the registrant, still at this late stage, had not apologised for her actions. The committee was therefore of the view that there remains a risk of repetition of her previous misconduct, and that a finding of continued impairment was required on public interest grounds.\"During the original hearing, witnesses gave evidence to a fitness to practise hearing, with one claiming she often used foul language and a second former colleague said she described the mum of one family as \"fat\".A third witness told the hearing Ms Porter described the mum of one family in derogatory way, using words like \"stinking\", \"smelly\" and \"greasy\".A fourth witness said Ms Porter used the word \"paedo\" to describe the dad of one family, based on a photograph she had seen.Ms Porter faced two charges - that at some time between May ,  and March , , she used inappropriate or derogatory language in relation to service users, and that she also used an inappropriate sexual gesture in relation to a kinship carer.In its ruling, the fitness to practise  said: \"The committee determined that the facts found proved involved repeatedly using inappropriate and derogatory language about a range of very vulnerable service users and vulgar sexual gestures in relation to a kinship carer.\"This conduct occurred in the work place and the committee determined that it was serious.\"The committee ruled Ms Porters behaviour was \"deliberate and prolonged\" and said it \"was not a mistake or error of judgment on one occasion\".It determined that respect and compassion are fundamental tenets of the social work profession and Ms Porter had breached both of these, concluding that it amounted to serious misconduct."},{"url":null,"title":"dozens of drivers caught speeding on national slow down day","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The publication was produced by the Department for Communities Historic Environment Division .The report details how a “large enclosure” was uncovered within a housing development off the Skeoge Link Road in the Ballynagalliagh area of Derry. It was located on a relatively steep, south facing slope.The enclosure was constituted of  post holes with  posts forming a separate arc in the north-west corner of the site. The majority of the post holes were of considerable size, with half of them producing broken bits of pottery, also known as sherds, within their fills.Some of these have been identied as belonging to the Vase tradition of Bronze Age pottery and other sherds have been identied as coming from the Cordoned Urn tradition. The general date provided for the use of the site is – BC.A substantial rectangular Neolithic house was identied at Turmeel townland, Co. Derry during the archaeological investigation of the A road near Dungiven.It measured approximately m long and m wide and contained almost  sherds of Neolithic pottery. The building was constructed during the period when farming and agriculture were introduced almost , years ago.At the Glenshane Road near Claudy a Late Neolithic ritual site was discovered during a quarry extension. This consisted of a timber circle – large wooden posts with an outer fenced forecourt – which dated to circa  BC.Timber circles are likely to have been the focus of elaborate ritualised activities attended by large numbers of people.HED Senior Archaeologist Andrew Gault said: “These excavations have resulted in exciting and important new information about our past, from evidence of the homesteads of some of the first prehistoric farming communities in Northern Ireland to more recent urban archaeological remains and industrial heritage.“It is intended that ‘Unearthed’ will continue as a regular annual bulletin of the most signicant archaeological discoveries arising from development-led archaeology in Northern Ireland.”Discoveries in other parts of the country include a Bronze Age roundhouse at Rasharkin solar farm. It consisted of a post-ring, an internal heath, areas of stakeholes, and a segmented enclosure.Enclosed houses generally date to the Middle Bronze Age, c.  BC. Finds included a possible rubbing stone and several sherds of Late Bronze Age coarseware pottery.An th th-century tannery, a place where animal hides are tanned, was discovered within the centre of the site at Royal Exchange in Belfast. This site is located within what would have been the th-century core of the city, an urban industrial operation where leather would have been produced commercially.This was represented by a series of  tanning pits, the majority of which were constructed of wooden planks joined together by wooden dowels.Mr Gault concluded: “These new discoveries highlight the importance of archaeological mitigation in advance of development, as well as the signicant contributions made by developers and archaeologists in unearthing these new archaeological sites for the benefit of all in society.”googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshPhoto: Excavated Enclosure at Ballynagalliagh in Derry."},{"url":null,"title":"broomsticks ready spellbinding halloween fun foyleside shopping centre","story":"Feeling frightful about what to do this Halloween  Fear not, as Foyleside Shopping Centre has plenty of spellbinding family activities to keep you spooked from this Saturday th right through to the st October.To be sure to terry the whole family – there will be an array of ghoulish Halloween games, chilling treasure hunts and “‘”trick or treat’” challenges to sink your vampire teeth into.Or you can unleash your inner beast by mucking in for the monster soft clay workshop.Why not quench your bloodthirst with chocolate apple and pumpkin decorating  Oryou’d rather rise from the dead for the occasion, visit our professional Halloween makeover and face painting stalls!

When funding for the bypass has been confirmed, the piece of art will be fabricated.The news comes after it was confirmed recently that the Department of Finance is expected to approve the new roadrsquos economic appraisal by December which is viewed as a critical step in the process ahead of the required capital funding being released.While the required funding has not yet been made available, local politicians are hoping that it wonrsquot be long before contractors are on site.The Department of Infrastructure says the preparation of the schemersquos economic appraisal report is continuing with Department of Finance approval for the document due to be sought before the end of the year.In order to advance the bypass schemersquos state of readiness, preparatory work on contract documents is ongoing in a bid to minimise the time required to initiate a procurement competition, should funding become available for construction.As part of the proposed multi-million pound development, major new roundabouts are proposed at the Belfast Road junction with the Saintfield Road and at the Newcastle Road junction with the Downpatrick Road. A new bridge will be constructed over the Moss Road.It is also proposed that a section of the bypass will pass under part of the Crossgar Road with a  metre long bridge constructed to take traffic over Ballynahinch River.Overtaking lanes stretching almost  metres are proposed at either end of the bypass where the major new roundabouts are to be constructed, with the scheme also including a shared footpath and cycle lane.The bypass mdash which would be the single biggest road scheme ever constructed in the district mdash is expected to take in excess of  months to build, with roads officials insisting it will greatly benefit both strategic and local road users by reducing journey times and improving road safety.Roads officials are also confident that the schemersquos economic assessment demonstrates the bypass would provide a good economic ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/16th October 2019 Children.jpg","title":"Children from integrated schools listen talk  ","story":"A BALLYNAHINCH school played host to a conference to mark World Mental Health Day last Thursday.Over  young people from  integrated schools across the province converged on Drumlins Integrated Primary School to take part in lsquoListeningrsquo mdash an event organised by the Integrated Education Fund.The compere was BBC presenter Jo Scott ands guest speakers included Mr Richard Pengelly, Permanent Secretary at the Department of Health, and Kate Beggs, from the Northern Ireland Director of National Lottery Community Fund.Mr Pengelly said afterwards: ldquoYoung people are faced with a number of pressures including social media influences.

He and his we, who are committee members of the support group, have have always tried to integrate activities and sports for all of their three children.ldquoI didnrsquot want football to be a negative experience for my son or any other child, said Gerard. ldquoTeam sports such as football can be overwhelming for children with autism either in school or any local clubs but that doesnot mean they should not be able to participate.Gerard said that he has devised the five-week course which helps build up football skills at the appropriate level for each child.It will finish with a match of children playing against their parents in two weeks time.ldquoNinety-two percent of children with autism have a sensory processing delay so as coaches being able to communicate effectively to the children in a way that they can understand is important, explained Gerard. ldquoWe give the kids reward cards so they and their parents can see their progression which builds up to the match.ldquoThe parents are a brilliant support as some of the children would get very anxious but to have their parents there beside them makes it possible. With the added bit of theatre and drama we try to instil, it heightens the whole experience for them and helps to make memories for both.Gerard hopes to devise further sports courses for autistic children such as boxing.Aacuteine Sloan, chairperson, of the group, praised the contribution of the fathers, not just for helping their own children but for other local children with autism whose parents are members.She said: ldquoNot only is it fantastic that a programme of its kind is now available locally but that itrsquos down to two dads who took it upon themselves to fill the gap.ldquoDownpatrick Autism Family Support Group is % run by parents. Wersquore delighted that Gerard and Daniel have developed this programme so our children can have the same opportunities as their peers. The children can enjoy football in a relaxed and non-judgmental environment.Ms Sloan said that many children on the autism spectrum cannot attend the usual football sessions due to crowds, noises, dficulty following instructions and other considerations.She added: ldquoThis now gives these children the same chance as their peers.This is just one of the many programmes we have running at the minute.

The same player then had a glorious chance for a goal when he got in behind the Kilcoo full back line, but lsquokeeper Martin McCourt made a brilliant save.The lsquoPoint continued to see plenty of the ball with corner forward Aron DrsquoArcy foraging deep, but they wasted a few kickable frees before Kilcoorsquos Ryan McEvoy brought the sides level with a free in the ninth minute.Ross McGarry then found his range and exchanged frees with Paul Devlin before the Kilcoo marksman punished Warrenpoint for another defensive indiscretion with his second point in quick succession.Ryan Johnston started seeing a lot more of the ball for Kilcoo, but it was Warrenpoint who drew level the th minute with a well-taken score from Ruairi McCormack.McGarry pointed Warrenpoint into a - to - lead after  minutes, but Kilcoo responded immediately with a m free from McCourt.Ryan Johnston then went on a searing run down the right flank and bore down on goal, but flashed his shot wide of Gary McMahonrsquos far post when he really should have tested the lsquokeeper.Devlin and McGarry swapped frees as the interval approached, but their was still time for the energetic Aidan Branagan to bomb forward from his full back berth to point Kilcoo into a - to - half-time lead.Warrenpoint were certainly not overawed by Kilcoo and started the second half the same way they attacked from the opening whistle of the game, but it was Kilcoo who edged into a - to - lead after  minutes with another score from the rampaging Ward.A McGarry free quickly negated this score before Kilcoo received a bad blow when Darryl Branagan was black carded and replaced by Shealan Johnston in the th minute.McGarry converted the resultant free to bring the sides level, but the game was really opening up at this stage and McMahon prevented a certain goal at the other end when he saved from Aiden Branagan.Warrenpoint went straight back on the attack and McGarry gave them a - to - lead with  minutes remaining. Devlin then brought the sides level with a rsquo after a Jerome Johnston shot went perilously close.Ryan McEvoy and Anton Magill swapped scores to keep it all square going into the last  minutes, but Warrenpoint kicked for home when John Boyle majestically pointed his side into a - to - lead.Kilcoo responded with venom. Conor Laverty, who had been on the periphery of the game up until this stage, suddenly took centre stage.Nothing looked on when he received the ball about m from goal. However, he checked back inside his marker and somehow spotted Wardrsquos run from deep.An improvised flick-pass, albeit with the aid of a deflection, picked out the big midfielder and he made no mistake with an unerring finish past McMahon.That should have finished Warrenpoint off, but far from it.They immediately attacked in numbers and worked an opening for McGarry, but he sent his effort wide with the goal at his mercy.A McGarry free gave Warrenpoint some consolation and left a single point between the sides with  minutes played.The game was still anybodyrsquos, but consecutive scores from McEvoy and Jerome and Ryan Johnston seemed to put daylight between the entities with  minutes gone.Another McGarry free cut the deficit to three points as the game went into added time. Warrenpoint continued to bombard Kilcoo and further points from Donagh McAleenan and McGarry left a point in it, but Kilcoo won dirty ball when it mattered and ran the clock down to run out worthy winners.Kilcoo: Martin McCourt , Niall Branagan, Aidan Branagan , Niall McEvoy, Aaron Branagan, Darryl Branagan, Miceal Rooney, Ryan McEvoy , Dylan Ward , Anthony Morgan, Paul Devlin , Ryan Johnston , Eugene Branagan, Jerome Johnston , Conor Laverty.

In my book he was a true legend because of the person that he was. He has left a rich legacy both in a playing context and in the way he carried himself. His memory will linger on.Another colleague of the double All-Ireland winner, Conor Deegan, said he was left ldquonumb and devastated when he learnt of Eamonnrsquos passing.He added: ldquoWe are absolutely destroyed. Only a few weeks ago we were together at Croke Park. He took on the county job when it was not fashionable but nothing was ever about Eamonn there was just no ego with him. He just cared about the county. Itrsquos hard to believe that we will never see him again.Bryansford GAC mdash the Down manrsquos home club mdash which flew its flags at half mast following his passing mdash described Eamonn as ldquoa true legend of both club and county while Down GAA described him as ldquotrue son of Down.They said: ldquoEamonn has been taken from us too soon, we will miss you Eamonn but we will smile in the memory of the days that you gave us.Last Sunday, Eamonn Burnsrsquo sons Cathal and Thomas led the Down  team onto pitch in memory of father ahead of senior football final between Warrenpoint and Kilcoo at Pairc Esler, Newry.

The acts included opera with performers on horseback.ldquoThe horses were retired race horses which had been re-trained to perform in this show. There were breathtaking displays of riders with hoops and torches on fire, made all the more spectacular against the back of the floodlit castle.ldquoThe finale involved le-size inflatable horses, which were manipulated by dancers who moved with the music that filled the air. A spectacular display of culture for all to enjoy.On Sunday morning, the group viewed a historic presentation prepared by one of the historic and cultural associations in Lamorlaye.Ms Patterson explained: ldquoWe were then taken on a walking tour of the old Lamorlaye. The afternoon was free for the group to view a dressage display with ballet dancers at the Diane Stables. There was also a beautul show with Samurai warriors on horseback.ldquoThe activities just went on and on and the group was treated to a visit to a wine-making area in Gouvieux before being taken to the troglodyte quarter of Gouvieux and for a surprise dinner in a cave.The dinner was prepared by member of the committee and made all the more special because of the sing-song started by Herveacute Moula, chairwoman of the Lamorlaye Comiteacute de Jumelage, supported by Cllr Andrews and guests from Ballynahinch. The atmosphere was relaxed and this was the end to a lovely day.On the final day of the visit, the group was invited to view the facilities at the Golf du Lys, an exclusive golf course, which has facilities to host conferences, weddings and events, along with outdoor and indoor tennis courts, an outdoor pool and golf courses.Ms Patterson said: ldquoThe golf club has already hosted some players from Ballynahinch and they have asked uswe are interested in organising a reciprocal golf tournament with the local golf courses in Co Down.ldquoWe hope we will be able to take them up on this proposal when the French visit us in .ldquoOur final lunch was in a redundant factory complex which has been converted in to a stunning hotel and restaurant ndash testament to how an old property can be re-generated for the good of the community.ldquoThe programme for the weekend provided us with ample opportunity to meet up with those who had travelled over to Ballynahinch in July and to meet with some old faces from previous exchanges between Lamorlaye and Ballynahinch. It is our hope we will be able to sign a twinning charter with both the local council for the next five to ten years.Ms Patterson said that the two pilot exchange trips have shown the relationship is still as vibrant as ever, with new people getting involved on both sides.She added: ldquoWe are hoping to be in a position to host a small group over the St Patrickrsquos weekend and to take a small group out to Lamorlaye for the Bastille Day celebrations. We always welcome new families who would be interested in hosting French people and who would be interested in travelling out to France as part of the exchange.ldquoThose travelling pay for their own flights and the Rowallane and Slieve Croob Community Twinning Group has facilitated the visits through the generous support of Newry Mourne and Down Council. We would also like to thank Cllr Robert Burgess for helping us to revive the Lamorlaye Twinning Project and Cllr Andrews for representing the local council and accompanying the group to Lamorlaye and for his rendition of the Marseillaise in French..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/17944108.fostering-voice-child-new-principals-goal/resources/images/10563290.jpg","title":"bandstand adam doherty","story":"What genre genres do you consider your music to be How long have you been performing Where do you perform What is your favourite song to play and why What has been your biggest gig to date Any funny gig rehearsal stories Who are your major influences Do you write your own songs  What inspires your songwriting What would be your dream gig Best moment as a musician so far What is the most unusual venue you have played What is your lsquogo-torsquo encore song Whatrsquos the best thing about performing Do you always perform solo or do you also play with a band Do you have any gigs coming up Any last words This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The TUV, meanwhile, described it as a “betrayal”.The prime minister announced the agreement with Brussels yesterday and urged MPs to “get this excellent deal over the line”.But the proposed customs arrangements for Northern Ireland dfer from those for the rest of the United Kingdom. .ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button Under Mr Johnson’s deal, Northern Ireland will remain aligned with European single market regulations on goods. This means checks will be carried out at ports and airports on goods travelling between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. The DUP, whose votes could be crucial in determining whether the agreement will be passed by MPs in the House of Commons tomorrow, is emphatic in its opposition.Deputy leader Nigel Dodds said Mr Johnson had been “too eager by far” to come to an accommodation “at any cost” with the EU.And leader Arlene Foster said the proposals on gaining the consent of the Assembly on a straight majority basis represented a fundamental change to the Good Friday Agreement.UUP leader Robin Swann said: “This deal is worse than the one Theresa May brought forward at Chequers. It’s awful. It would put a customs and regulatory border down the Irish Sea and annexes Northern Ireland from the rest of the United Kingdom.”TUV leader Jim Allister said: “The inescapable reality is that a permanent regulatory and customs border cutting us off from GB puts us in a waiting room for Irish unity with the door locked from the outside. “The scale of the betrayal is shocking.”DUP reject Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal within minutes of it being agreed with EU Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingWrightbus: Green Pastures issue statement after bus building firm confirmed to continue in BallymenaThese are the emotional scenes at Wrightbus as news emerges up to , jobs have been savedIN PICTURES:  photos of the stunning N.I. home that is officially Irelands House of the Year Its official -

Ministers have attacked our independent judges. The Government is spending millions on an advertising campaign that appears to conflict with an Act of Parliament and all the meanwhile jobs, security and stability are put further and further at risk.Boris Johnson is playing Russian roulette with all of our lives over Brexit, and we cannot stand by and let him do it.The last three years have been a shambles, and it is clear we will now need to go back to the people for them to have the final say.That is why the case for a Peoplersquos Vote, where a credible deal is put to the British people, with the option to Remain, provides the best and most democratic ways of ending this crisis.Readers will know I think Brexit is a disaster for our jobs, security and international standing ndash and so would campaign resolutely to Remain in that scenario.Either way, I believe we need to heal some of the isions in this country and get back to focusing on the issues we all want to talk about.Despite the Brexit chaos, Irsquove continued to work hard on lots of other issues locally.It was a real pleasure to attend the Penarth Picnic at the weekend, and I want to thank Penarth Town Council, Production  and all those involved for a great event ndash showcasing the best of Penarthrsquos wonderful community spirit. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Yet, too many people across the UK ndash and here in Wales ndash are going hungry.It is shameful that in the sixth richest country on the planet people are struggling to put food on the table.A recent report by the South Wales Food Alliance has shown that  per cent of  to -year-olds ran out of food in the past year and , children in Wales are living in households for whom a healthy diet is increasingly unaffordable.In addition, the Trussell Trust has reported record numbers of people accessing its services. Last year, it provided over , emergency food parcels to people in crisis in Wales, , of them to children. A No Deal Brexit will be catastrophic for the countryrsquos most vulnerable households and would be an act of economic self-harm impacting many generations to come. This is why I am supporting the campaign for Food Justice.There can be no doubt that the causes of rising hunger are rooted in a decade of austerity, tax and welfare changes, and an economy that no longer provides a fair dayrsquos pay for a fair days work for too many.The food crisis that the UK is living through is likely to be signicantly worsenedwe leave the EU without a deal. The recently published government documents on Operation Yellow Hammer predict shortages of some fresh foods and an increase in the price of food by up to  per cent, as a likely scenario.The papers make for grim reading for the many hard pressed families who are already struggling to put food on the table.In Wales we are committed to eradicating food poverty but we need UK-wide action.The Co-operative campaign is calling on the UK Government to commit to zero-hunger by  and incorporate it into UK law.While many of the solutions to food poverty are the responsibility of the UK Government there is local action that we can take that can make a real dference.The campaign is encouraging councils across Wales to commit to playing their part by designating a lead member for food poverty, to draw up a food action plan, and to take inspiration from emerging community responses to food poverty.The good news is that there is a huge amount of work already going on in our communities by councils, churches, charities and food banks.For more information or to get involved in the campaign please visit www.party.coop campaign food-justice article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We have a long waiting list.ldquoWe have to make sure these are properties we have finance for and they are up to our standards as well. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This compares to five per cent of the population in , when  per cent of adults smoked.However, there has also been an increase in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape.:The National Survey for Wales shows that, in ,  per cent of e-cigarettes users also smoked cigarettes. This fell to  per cent in  .Across the UK the number of vapers who are ex-smokers reached . per cent in  with the main reason given for using e-cigarettes being to help them quit.Of those surveyed by ASH Wales,  per cent of e-cigarette users cited health as their main reason for vaping.Suzanne Cass, chief executive of ASH Wales said: ldquoThe rise in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape in Wales shows that many smokers are using e-cigarettes to quit.ldquoIndeed, when coupled with behavioural support e-cigarettes have been shown to be one of the most effective ways to give up smoking, enabling thousands of smokers in Wales to break a habit that destroys lives.ldquoHowever, with more than double the amount of people in Wales smoking compared to vaping, we still face a major challenge when it comes to changing peoplersquos behaviour and de-normalising what has become an entrenched habit in many of our most deprived communities.Despite the increase in the number of people vaping, the survey also revealed perceptions of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes have worsened.Now almost a third of people in Wales believe e-cigarettes are equally or more harmful than tobacco cigarettes.Suzanne Cass said: ldquoThere is work to be done when it comes to raising awareness of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes and addressing concerns about the safety of vaping.Since the survey was carried out, reports of a possible link between e-cigarette use and deaths from lung disease in America have led some medical experts to warn of the dangers of vaping.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention many of those vapers affected had used products with liquids containing cannabinoid products.E-cigarettes are regulated in the UK in line with a set of European-wide rules by the medicines regulator, the MHRA. The MHRA also monitors adverse reactions through its yellow card system, which to date has not identied serious respiratory problems similar to that found in the US.Meanwhile vapers in the UK are urged by ASH to only ever purchase e-cigarettes from reputable suppliers. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We were a mix of young people, parents and other concerned citizens of Penarth, and met outside Grfin Books.ldquoWe joined the young people who have been striking from school. In a year this movement has grown from Greta Thunberg by herself to millions worldwide.ldquoThe evidence on climate change is clear. Our actions through burning fossil fuels and demands for continued economic growth cause global warming and climate change. People are already suffering and nature, upon which we all depend, is collapsing. Governments need to be honest about this and act upon the crisis.ldquoWe were over the moon with the response from Penarth residents, who walked with us or cheered us on, the day really gave us hope that the message is seeping in and change can happen.

A former head of two other schools in Gwent, he is clearly proud of his school and all they have accomplished.ldquoItrsquos a wonderful school and everyone here has worked so hard to make it that way, he said. ldquoBut it does face challenges.Like other head teachers in Penarth, Mr Rees had signed the open letter to the Welsh Government calling for fairer funding for Vale schools earlier this year. He had discussed coming in to the school on weekends to clean the toilets himself to help balance budgets. But he is firmly optimistic.ldquoBetween kind donations and fundraising efforts from our PTA, renting out the school hall, and younger members of staff taking on some extra burdens we are just about able to balance our budgets, he said. ldquoTo be honest, next year might start looking grim, but wersquore keeping our heads high.ldquoWith that said, wersquove been working hard on incorporating new initiatives and the new curriculum, we have a great crop of pupils and staff morale is high. We are very positive here.ldquoItrsquos also our th anniversary this year, so we have loads of ex-staff and pupils coming through the doors to say hello, a celebratory PTA barbecue and more planned.Taking a tour around the school, this positivity is reflected in students and staff alike. Children seem genuinely excited to learn, smiling, waving and saying hello to Mr Rees.Evenlode Primary School itself has an interesting history.It was opened in  as the first open plan primary school in South East Wales.The population of the school has risen dramatically over the last  years, from  on roll in  to the present .The building itself, a maze of classrooms and corridors plastered in colours, has also changed to accommodate more pupils.Much of the semi-open plan design has disappeared, making way for more conventional classrooms.The school benefits from having a superb site with two playgrounds as well as a large playing field, a designated play area for Reception children, a wildle area, open access to the local tennis club facilities, a newly constructed lsquooutside classroomrsquo and adventure trail.One of the first stops was a hall used by its lsquoSaplingsrsquo Out of School Care, the pre and after-school club for children.Saplings provides childcare for around  children from all year groups, providing breakfast in the morning and looking after children from .am to pm when needed.There, the children can access a wide range of activities, switched up on a regular basis.These have included cooking, gardening, art, crafts, sporting activities, outdoor play and plenty more.A couple of pupils, part of the Saplings, are called through. They happily talk about their favourite part of the clubs. One says arts and crafts another, going outside and playing sport four more say the food.Saplings isnrsquot the only place the students can indulge in a little food.Pupils have set up a fruit tuck shop in the school yard, a group endeavour that students control all aspects of - from placing orders for snacks, selecting the products, handling finances and, of course, selling to their friends.A small group of budding merchants were excited to show me their wares, selling oranges and bananas at break time.There was plenty more to do outside, as well.Mr Rees himself taught fire-making lessons in their fire pit, while the school also made use of rope courses, and a newly refurbished gazebo.Bike racks could be found at the front and back of the site, with students encouraged to cycle to school.Sport is very high on the schoolrsquos agenda.ldquoWe have kids from the school representing us in cricket, rugby and tennis at a county level, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore also fielding regular football, rugby and netball teams, and we are pushing plenty of other outdoor activities - like our new ropes and outdoor assault course.ldquoWersquore lucky to have parents in this area who are incredibly supportive of sports, and we have some shining examples of sporting prowess in our children.ldquoWe think itrsquos a very important part of being a rounded and healthy inidual.The school doesnrsquot just focus on sport - they aim to nurture minds and souls too.ldquoExpressive arts is a major area of focus at the moment, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore lucky enough to have a drama specialist supporting us, helping coach the children through both acting and production.ldquoWe are even working with the Welsh Government on a production of H.G. Wellrsquos The Time Machine, to be held in our school hall.The hall had been built with money raised from selling off surplus land, with a further loan from the Vale council.It is tidy, modern, and neatly decorated, with a sophisticated looking lighting system - built with help from parents.ldquoWersquore very proud of the relationship we have with parents here, said Mr Rees. ldquoThey have been enormously helpful with our budgetary concerns.Evenlode is a school with a cheerful outlook, a happy student body and a strong working relationship between staff, students and parent alike.It deserves to go far. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

His father was West African and his mother was Irish.Billy was overlooked by rugby union. However he is recognised as one of the greatest ever British rugby league players.Elizabeth lsquoBettyrsquo Campbell, also born in  in Butetown, was the first black head teacher in Wales.Following a public vote on hidden heroines Cardf Council confirmed earlier this year that a statue of Betty will be built in Cardf - the first woman to feature in our capital city.On the weekend I will be on a question and answer  about institutionalised racism in Wales, across sport, the media, politics, and the world of work.I look forward to sitting on the  with Cllr Saeed Ebrahim, lawyer Hilary Brown, and Chisomo Phiri from EYST.As more and more Black History Month events take place across Wales, I cannot help but feel a sense of pride in how far we have come as a nation.I hope that these events continue to inspire the next generation of young black leaders as we still have so much more to change.To all my constituents, to everyone across Wales, I hope you all join in with the celebrations and festivities of this historic month, attend the events, learn about those that have trailblazed for us and make this a Black History Month to remember. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Their mother Emma, who was found straying by local authorities, gave birth to the  puppies shortly after arriving at the Rehoming Centre.One of the litter of rescue puppies hoping they wont be left in the lurchThe puppies, named after popular award-winning actors and actresses, are now more than eight weeks old and canine carers at the busy Rehoming Centre have been working hard to get them prepared for their potential new owners. The puppies currently available for adoption are named: Emmy, Brando, Legend, Jolie, Heath, Goldberg and Leonardo.Oonagh Phillips, Rehoming Centre Manager at Dogs Trust Ballymena, said: “The Rehoming Centre is no stranger to puppy residents however, we do find that Lurcher puppies tend to stay with us a bit longer. We hope to find this litter new owners soon, so they can quickly adjust to being part of a loving family.“Canine carers at Dogs Trust Ballymena have found there is often misconceptions about the Lurcher breed, with people often thinking they require lots of exercise. Lurchers actually don’t require any more exercise than a typical dog and many enjoy staying cozy and snuggling up for a snooze.“At such a young age they will all need homes where they will be given lots of care and attention, as well as ongoing support with their training. Families who adopt any of the puppies will be invited to join Dogs Trust’s Dog School at ious locations across Northern Ireland.”Dog Trust’s Dog School was launched in  to support dog owners and their pets through our reward based training methods, teaching valuable skills needed for everyday le. Dog School is just as much about supporting and guiding owners as it is about training the dog. Classes run over five weeks and each dog owner will receive training homework after the class to practise at home. It is important for owners to continue the training at home on a regular basis to practice what their pet has learned in class.If you believe a dog is for le and would like to find out more about the adorable Lurcher puppies, get in touch with the team at Dogs Trust Ballymena on  or visit www.dogstrust.org.uk our-centres ballymena.

Also, many of the immigrant families are moving where due the uncertainty of their status on the outcome of Brexit.”However Mr Buckley said: ”It is very sad to see that unfortunately Richmount Playgroup has had to close its doors. I would like to pay tribute to the staff and community leaders who had the vision to open up the playgroup.“Having liaised and worked directly with the the Playgroup committee, parents and the education authority to try and save the playgroup it became clear that under the current low numbers it was going to be hard to sustain.“The committee took the decision to inform parents that the playgroup would be closing. I understand this has been dficult for parents and staff involved.“I must stress despite what is being reported, at no time was it indicated by the committee, parents or indeed the Education Authority that this decision was Brexit related.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals. What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you  Believe in yourself, be flexible and above all when opportunities present themselves to you, grab them.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/2_web.jpg","title":"top  voice of business never stronger or more important","story":"Posted on Friday  September  by Ulster Business John Mulgrew, Michael Neill, Sarah Little and Len OHagan The voice of Northern Ireland’s business community has never been stronger and more important as industry attempts to avoid a hard Brexit, a gathering of top business leaders has heard. The Top  Northern Ireland Companies  dinner, with AL Goodbody, brought together some of top business chiefs making the list, to the grand backdrop of Queen’s University’s Great Hall. The event heard renewed calls for securing a deal on Brexit, and the restoration of Stormont, as we approach , days without a devolved government here. John Mulgrew, editor of Ulster Business, told those gathered: “On the precipice of Brexit, the voice of business has never been stronger or more important – further enforcing the need for a deal. Avoiding a hard exit. And retaining a strong trading relationship across the island. “But we should also take this opportunity to clearly note, that we are approaching , days since having a devolved government – up and running. “It affects you and your businesses, and it’s cited as the key reason putting off investment from overseas, and our own local companies, from making key investment decisions.” The Top  edition is an annual showcase of the leading and largest companies, located right across Northern Ireland. This year sales rose by almost %, approaching a combined figure of £bn. And for the eighth year in a row, poultry processing giant Moy Park has come in at the number one spot, with turnover of £.bn. Michael Neill, head of Belfast office at AL Goodbody, said: “What the Top  companies have achieved in the past  months in what can only be described as capricious circumstances is truly remarkable – but imagine what could have been achieved had we some semblance of ‘normality’. “My hope is that we find ourselves doing so in a Northern Ireland that is embarking on a new and positive era of opportunity, rather than picking up the shattered pieces of a ‘no deal’ Brexit for many years to come.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"firms must prepare for no deal as economic forecast revised down","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland firms must prepare for a ‘no deal’ Brexit – a bank chief economist has warned – as it downgraded its forecast for the economy to .%.  Danske Bank’s Conor Lambe said there were still a number of possibilities for what might happen over the next  days, with the UK due to leave the EU on October . Possibilities included a no-deal exit, a withdrawal agreement being reached, an extension of Article  period or a general election. But predictions were \"incredibly dficult\", he said. \"Businesses should behave prudently and use this time to ensure they are as prepared as they can be for a worst-case scenario, no-deal Brexit, in case it occurs at the end of this month,\" he said. The .% is down from the bank’s previous forecasts, delivered in June, that growth would hit % in  and .% in . In its latest Northern Ireland Quarterly Sectoral Forecasts report, Danske Bank said that the Northern Ireland economy likely expanded in the second quarter of the year, but the rate of growth over the first half of the year remained modest. “We have revised our forecast for economic growth in Northern Ireland downwards for both  and ,” he said. “This largely reflects the modest data for the first half of the year, increased Brexit-related uncertainty and the weaker global economic environment. “Assuming that a no-deal Brexit is avoided, we expect the Northern Ireland economy to grow by .% in  and .% in , below the .% we expect UK GDP to grow by in both years. “A combination of strong wage growth and more stable inflation is likely to lead to solid growth in consumer spending, but the lack of clarity around the UK’s future relationship with the EU is expected to continue holding back business investment.” It says the information and communication, and professional, scientic  technical services sectors are expected to be the fastest growing parts of the economy over the next two years. Meanwhile, output in the construction sector is forecast to rise by .% in  and .% in , while expected output growth in the wholesale and retail trade sector has been revised down to .% in  and .% in . Public administration and defence is continuing to have the weakest outlook of all the sectors of the Northern Ireland economy, with output expected to contract by .% in , and by a further .% in . “Over the coming weeks, a number of potential Brexit options are possible, including a no-deal exit, a withdrawal agreement being reached, an extension of the Article  period or a general election,” Mr Lambe said. “Predicting what will happen next in the Brexit process is incredibly dficult, but businesses should behave prudently and use this time to ensure they are as prepared as they can be for a worst-case scenario, no-deal Brexit, in case it occurs at the end of this month.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/BOI11_web.jpg","title":"bank of ireland uk empowering colleagues to support local communities","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by Ulster Business Paul Slevin, Alison Mitchell, Ian Sheppard, Sally Irvine, Christine Graham and Paul Magee With a purpose to enable customers, colleagues and communities to thrive, Bank of Ireland UK staff are building on a long history of supporting local charities and community organisations. Ulster Business speaks to Northern Ireland managing director Ian Sheppard, and learns more about how colleagues are being empowered to play an active role in the local communities where they live and work Bank of Ireland UK sees developing its colleagues and helping customers and communities to thrive as part of its DNA, according to Ian Sheppard, managing director in Northern Ireland.From key charity partnerships, to fundraising, volunteering, sponsorship and more, Ian says the desire for Bank of Ireland UK is to make a positive impact by empowering colleagues to make a dference.“When I speak to my colleagues, I hear how really active and involved they are in their own community,” Ian says. “There are so many examples and I never cease to be amazed by their passion and commitment.An important partnership for the bank is with Alzheimer’s Society, its flagship charity for the last two years. In that time around £, has been raised in Northern Ireland, but as Ian explains it’s about more than fundraising.“We realised that not only can we help them financially, but there are resources we can share and opportunities we can offer which can help to signicantly raise the charity’s profile and raise much needed funds.”One example in which the bank has supported Alzheimer’s Society in this way is through its own long-running partnership with Ulster Rugby.“We donated our advertising and promotion activity for a televised game at the Kingspan Stadium making the charity ‘Sponsor for a Day’. This included using their logo on the back of the Ulster Rugby jerseys, taking over the pitch side boards and inviting a group of people living with dementia, their family and carers to the game – helping to get their brand message out to not only a stadium with capacity of , people but to a much wider TV audience.”Alzheimer’s Society sees some fantastic people giving their time to help others. That’s no clearer than its Side by Side programme, which Bank of Ireland UK helps to fund.The photograph on the front of this edition of the magazine taken at the Grand Opera House in Belfast features Mary Dalzell a Side by Side volunteer, alongside Hazel Whiteside, who has been living with dementia for two years.They share a love of music, theatre and cinema and the Side by Side programme, which re-connects people with dementia to their communities by doing the things they love, has not only put a smile on both their faces but has had a positive impact on their lives.There are so many people impacted by dementia and Alzheimers in our local communities, and its touching so many people’s lives, taking this as our motivation, the bank now has almost , staff trained as Dementia Friends.The bank’s ‘Give Together’ programme means staff can take one day a year to spend the time working with a charity or community organisation of their choice. “This day can involve anything from gardening work to painting a youth centre,” Ian says“Beyond Alzheimer’s Society, colleagues are helping many other organisations such as Macmillan Cancer Support, Cancer Research UK through its Relay for Le Legenderry, the Wooden Spoon children’s rugby charity, and Space NI, which offers support services in health and social care sectors to the local community.” You canabout some of the good work colleagues have done further on in this feature.“We are also committed to reflecting the community by developing a erse and modern workforce – which is part-and-parcel of a progressive company,” Ian says. “It’s something that current and future employees expect in their employer. For us its part of our DNA, something that’s always been there but we are now putting a clear and visible structure around it,” Ian says.This has included being a founding member of FuSIoN – the Financial Services Inclusion Network which drives to support and promote LGBT+ professionals across the sector, becoming JAM Card members – allowing staff to knowcustomers with a communication barrier need ‘just a minute’, as well as recently being awarded the Diversity Charter Mark.“Our community involvement is something we are very clear about - something I’m passionate about and it’s an easy ask to get staff engaged. It’s very natural, and it has always been developed from the ground up,” Ian says.He believes this contributes to the huge numbers of staff doing their bit – enabling their own local communities to thrive.  ALISON MITCHELLA customer service manager for Bank of Ireland UK in Londonderry, Alison has worked for the bank for  years, but her motivation for fundraising and support for Alzheimer’s Society began in , following her mother-in-law’s diagnosis with dementia. Alison trained at her local hospital to become a dementia volunteer and learned so much she asked Alzheimer’s Society to run similar sessions in her own branch to enable staff to better assist customers with dementia.Sadly, Alison’s mother-in-law passed away in May of this year but to mark her passing and to raise vital funds in her memory, Alison took part in Alzheimer’s Society Cupcake Day. Initial plans to simply sell cupcakes within her own branch changed rapidly as colleagues from nearby branches heard of the event and wanted to support both Alison and the charity.  Faced with orders for more than  cupcakes, Alison requested a Give Together day, which is time given by the bank to both iniduals and teams to give back to their communities. Alison says: “I was in the kitchen from am to pm baking and icing but it was worth it. The event raised £, which Bank of Ireland UK matched doubling the amount raised to £,. “I could not have achieved that without the support of family, colleagues and the wider business. I was proud to raise the funds in my mother-in-law’s memory and I am proud to work for an organisation that not only values our role in the wider community but supports it too.” CHRISTINE GRAHAMChristine Graham has helped to raise funds for Cancer Research UK through the Relay for Le “Legenderry” event held in St. Columb’s Park, Londonderry.The Derry-based senior business manager for Bank of Ireland UK has personally been touched by cancer as she lost two close family members to the disease. Her young great niece was also diagnosed with a rare form of cancer in  and is now doing well, but seeing the impact a cancer diagnosis has on a family inspired Christine to get involved with the Relay for Le event.“Our event truly is ‘legenderry’,” she says. It is a -hour relay race that brings the whole community together to celebrate the lives of cancer survivors, to remember those lost to the disease, to fight back by increasing our knowledge of cancer and by raising money to fund le-saving cancer research.”In just three years the event has raised over £, for Cancer Research UK with Christine helping to raise £, in  – not only the most successful Relay for Le event in the UK this year but all funds raised in Northern Ireland stays here.  Christine values the support she has had from the bank who promote the event to the wider community and from her colleagues who enter teams.“Relay for Le is for all ages and stages, all shapes and sizes,” she says. It’s cross community and intergenerational and the atmosphere every year is electric.”Plans are already underway for Relay for Le  which promises to be another massive event. PAUL MAGEEPaul Magee, associate director of the corporate banking team, became involved with the Ulster Region Committee for Wooden Spoon, the Children’s Charity of Rugby, five years ago after he successfully completed the charity’s Four Peaks Challenge, reaching the summits of the UK and Ireland’s highest peaks. He is now an active committee member for Wooden Spoon, helping to raise funds to provide le-enhancing experiences for disadvantaged and disabled children. “All funds raised in Ulster stay in the region and benefit the children here,” Paul says. “For instance, we provided £, to the Mae Murray Foundation to buy specialist equipment for the first fully accessible beach in Ulster at Benone Strand. When we created the access to the beach, one parent was very emotional as he watched his teenage daughter in the sea for the first time. It’s those occasions where we’re responding to a need within the community that makes the effort worthwhile.”Wooden Spoon has funded numerous charity projects, most recently £, for a new multi-sensory room at Parkview Special School in Lisburn and purchasing a horse for Riding for the Disabled Association in Coleraine, a charity that enhances children’s lives every day.  With his passion for and involvement in Wooden Spoon, Paul is grateful for the support Bank of Ireland has given him in his role with the organisation, specically the corporate banking team who value his dedication to making a dference. He says: “The bank has been fantastic – I appreciate the flexibility the team offers in the lead up to events and my colleagues often attend Wooden Spoon fundraisers. I’ve also benefited from the bank’s Give Together initiative, which offers days of paid leave that employees can use for volunteering. The bank’s support has helped facilitate my commitment to Wooden Spoon, where I can really see and be a part of the impact the charity has on the local community.” SALLY IRVINEOver the last  years Sally Irvine’s coffee mornings have become a highlight in the office calendar, in turn raising more than £, for MacMillan Cancer Support and funding  days of specialist nursing care for cancer patients across Northern Ireland.Sally, a business lending and credit governance manager at Bank of Ireland UK, arranged her first Macmillan Coffee Morning in  following a colleague’s cancer diagnosis. She found herself wanting to do something to help people living with cancer and so took the plunge and decided to be a host as part of Macmillan’s biggest coffee morning fundraising event. From the outset, Sally had tremendous support from her team members and the wider business, and this has contributed to the ongoing success of the event.The bank plays a huge part in ensuring Sally can deliver the event each year by giving her support through their Give Together scheme.Sally says: “The coffee morning has become a very special occasion and a great day of fun where people from across the bank come together to have a wee cuppa and a cake and take time to catch up while raising money for a really important cause. One in two of us will face cancer at some time in our lives and I am passionate about continuing to fundraise to provide the specialist nursing care that’s so vital for those living with cancer.”Plans are already underway for this year’s Macmillan Coffee Morning and Sally is hopeful the annual fundraiser will continue to hold a special place in the office calendar.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: \"We’ve got a great new deal that takes back control — now Parliament should get Brexit done on Saturday so we can move on to other priorities like the cost of living, the NHS, violent crime and our environment.\" Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, said: “This agreement is a fair compromise between the EU and the UK. It is testament to the commitment and willingness of both sides to do what is best for EU and UK citizens. We now have a newly agreed Protocol that protects peace and stability on the island of Ireland and fully protects our Single Market. I hope that we can now bring this over the line and provide the certainty our citizens and businesses so deserve.” Michel Barnier, the European Commissions chief negotiator, said: “We had dficult discussions over the past days. We have managed to find solutions that fully respect the integrity of the Single Market. We created a new and legally operative solution to avoid a hard border, and protect peace and stability on the island of Ireland. It is a solution that works for the EU, for the UK and for people and businesses in Northern Ireland.” The DUP has said it could not support the deal brokered by Mr Johnson. So, what deal was agreed  A statement from the European Commission says: “In terms of regulations, Northern Ireland will remain aligned to a limited set of rules related to the EUs Single Market in order to avoid a hard border: legislation on goods, sanitary rules for veterinary controls , rules on agricultural production marketing, VAT and excise in respect of goods, and state aid rules. “In terms of customs, the EU-UK Single Customs Territory, as agreed in November , has been removed from the Protocol on Ireland   Northern Ireland, at the request of the current UK government. EU and UK negotiators have now found a new way to achieve the goal of avoiding a customs border on the island of Ireland, while at the same time ensuring Northern Ireland remains part of the UKs customs territory. This agreement fully protects the integrity of the EUs Single Market and Customs Union, and avoids any regulatory and customs checks at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. “Finally, the EU and the UK have agreed to create a new mechanism on ‘consent, which will give the Members of the Northern Ireland Assembly a decisive voice on the long-term application of relevant EU law in Northern Ireland. The Commission has been in close contact with the Irish government on this point.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
