To re-employ some of the 400 or so “grandmasters” – his term for the highly skilled and experienced factory workers responsible for creating garments – who lost their jobs in 2002. Thanks to soaring demand, there are now 30 people on the payroll. With a focus on sustainability and ethically made fashion, the future looked promising. Alongside initiatives such as “free repairs for life”, the brand has launched inventive ranges such as jeans made from banana fibres. Then Covid-19 struck.“If you’re a business owner who’s spent a decade or two building up your company, the idea of it all disappearing in the space of a month or so is heartbreaking,” recalls Hieatt. The announcement that the UK government would provide support came as a huge relief.But the company’s production line didn’t completely shut down during the crisis. Hieatt’s team used their skills to make NHS scrubs. “We thought we should try and do something, so we bought fabric and made stuff, giving that to the NHS,” he explains. Garments were sent to the Royal Free in London, as well as local hospitals. “The one good thing that has come out of this is a sense of trying to help each other,” Hieatt adds.With the production team now back in full swing, the company’s future looks positive, despite the challenges. “Demand still seems to be strong and we’re in a pretty specialised market – super-high premium denim,” says Hieatt. “People might not be buying much, but they do buy special things. It feels like we might just come out of this strongly …”Alongside running a firm set up by his grandfather and seeing his company’s castings crop up everywhere from sculptures to submarines, one of the things that Andrew Young is proudest of at his Kirkintilloch foundry is its low turnover of staff. Ever since Archibald Young set up his eponymous firm in 1959, by buying a secondhand furnace for £5, its workers have had a tendency to stick around.Step inside the foundry today and you could meet an employee who has worked at the firm for 41 years, having started as a 16-year-old. Or the thirtysomethings who joined as teen apprentices and haven’t left. Earlier this year, the economic fallout from Covid-19 threatened to tarnish this remarkable retention rate. “To lose any of our staff would be hurtful,” says Young, the managing director. “We’d do anything to stave off redundancies.”It’s a problem the third-generation firm averted thanks to the UK government’s multi-billion pound job retention scheme, which has so far protected 8.5 million workers and 1m businesses. Having furloughed 27 out of Archibald Young’s 29 staff in late-March – Young and a finance manager stayed on – everybody returned to work after just three weeks.The word foundries may summon up Peaky Blinders-style visions of fiery furnaces, twisted metal and ash falling over murky towpaths. But these factories that produce metal castings (objects made by pouring molten metal into a mould) form an industry valued at more than £2.2bn and employing 17,000 people. By recycling scrap metal into new components, foundries help boost the circular economy too. Over the past 61 years, the foundry has made doors for the UK’s iconic red telephone boxes and a bronze St Cuthbert statue for the Holy Island of Lindisfarne. Today, it produces castings for customers in marine, civil and general engineering, shipbuilding and mining. It also makes nickel bronze castings for the UK’s submarine fleet.“Yes, our stuff is found at the bottom of the ocean,” jokes Young. “But at least it’s still operating.”Given Archibald Young’s work in the energy sector, as well as for the Ministry of Defence, its business was deemed “essential” so all employees were able to return from furlough on 20 April.The story doesn’t end there. Although the company is currently busy, Young notes that its robust workflow is largely the result of staff working on contracts predating the Covid-19 pandemic. The future is less certain. “One of the reasons we came back in April is because our order book was pretty healthy, but that’s based on what customers required before entering shutdown,” he points out. “But it’s taking a dip now. General engineering will see things go quieter over the next quarter. Based on that, I can see the possibility of us utilising the job retention scheme again.”However, he doesn’t envisage placing the majority of Archibald Young staff on furlough as he did in March. Instead, he intends to rotate them. Under the job retention scheme, employers have the freedom to rotate their workforce (with the minimum of three weeks off, then three weeks on). It’s given businesses reassurance that most of their employees’ wages will be covered should demand wane. From 1 July, companies will also be able to bring furloughed employees back to work part-time.“Things aren’t over yet,” says Young. “The job retention scheme was absolutely helpful for Archibald Young and we’ll be dipping back into it, no doubt … Business has been reasonable to the family for 61 years, and long may it continue …”This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

She was in her element – her dress speaks to her sense of cultural pride’Her name is Joy and I photographed her outside one of the many African churches in south-east London. I had just finished photographing a mosque on the same bland industrial estate when I found the blue wall, then spotted Joy dancing in the church with her children. I thought: “That’s a portrait I’ve got to get,” and asked if she’d come outside and have her photograph taken.Her dress speaks to her sense of cultural pride. She’s in her element, in church, in a place where she can showcase her Nigerian clothes. When you put that across in the isive time in which we’re living, it paints a positive story about her identity as a Londoner, especially when you consider the wider context. Six countries in Europe have banned the burqa (16 worldwide) and Quebec has banned all religious symbols, but London has created spaces for people to celebrate their cultural heritage, and that’s special.Joy’s church is Christ’s Chosen Church of God. It’s one of several black-majority churches in streets where old warehouses are being used for Sunday worship. The services contrast with the mundane exteriors: worshipping God among the Nigerian community is a very celebratory experience. Outfits such as Joy’s are commonplace, and a good amount of the service is spent dancing and singing. I think that’s why so few people I approached for this project said no to being photographed – they are happy to do it when they feel good about themselves.I photographed Joy in August 2019, towards the end of a three-year project I called Sunday Best, which celebrates London’s religious ersity through portraits and stories of Londoners dressed for worship. My first idea was to photograph African churches in my area of south London, because the black teens in their Sunday best look so different from the negative stereotypes about hoodie culture. The project was shaped and expanded by events that unfolded thereafter.In June 2016, there was the Brexit vote, then the terrorist attacks in London in June 2017, which came just after I had a baby. I started to feel very pessimistic about bringing a child up in Britain, but after the Grenfell Tower fire I read all these tweets from people from other countries saying how much they admired the way the British – of all religions and races – pulled together in times of crisis. The lens through which other countries saw us seemed much more empathetic than how we view ourselves, and that made me want to reinforce a more positive vision of what it means to British.I chose to look at multiculturalism through religion because it’s so attached to national and cultural identity, and I sought out places of worship that served particular communities rather than particular denominations. The response I got came as a surprise, people saying: “We are British, and part of being British is being able to celebrate who we are. You don’t get this anywhere else in the world.” Such experiences built a celebratory and optimistic foundation for the project, amid a sombre national mood.As I went into the various places of worship, I became very aware of my own cultural misconceptions. I’m not religious, and I think that people like me sometimes think of religion in terms of ill-informed assumptions and problems. Take Islam. There are very narrow representations of Muslims in the media, but it’s a religion of 1.8 billion people. It can’t be represented by a few stereotypes. There’s a culture of fear based on a simple lack of understanding and knowledge that then breeds separatism and mistrust. But what religion brings to people’s lives in terms of a sense of belonging, companionship and community far outweighs the negatives. The religious people I spoke with talked about prayer and how much it helps with mental health.The religious ersity of London – and other cities such as Leicester, Manchester or Birmingham – should be celebrated. There are many different ways of telling stories of Britishness, but it’s the isive ones that are predominating at the moment. Instead of submitting to negative depictions, I want to use photography to show the best of who we are. • Sunday Best by Katie Waggett is published by Hoxton Mini Press.Training: BA graphic arts and design at Leeds politan University, and MA photojournalism and documentary photography at London College of Communication.Influences: Diane Arbus, Liz Hingley, Vanessa Winship, and my mother, Jackie Waggett, who was a painter and printmaker.High point: ‘Every time I come back with a portrait I’m proud of.’Low point: ‘Someone I adored died last year, and the way I found out destroyed me. I threw myself into photography, which became a kind of therapy for me. I try to hold on to the idea that a low point can also be creative.’Top tip: ‘If you want to photograph a stranger, smile as you approach. That sense of trust needs to be there from the start. It’s so simple, but many people who try to do what I do get turned down because they forget.’"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa503cfbab22bbd4119ff0ece72ea5022e39c6cd/0_0_1000_1004/master/1000.jpg?width=660\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e123d77dfdda93dfb4df0cfed8b70f1a 660w","title":"carnival sell cruise ships bookings coronavirus pandemic holiday","story":"Holiday company loses $4.4bn in three months during coronavirus crisisCarnival suffered losses of $4.4bn (£3.6bn) in three months, as the cruise company’s business was all but sunk by the Covid-19 pandemic.Revenues dropped to $700m from $4.8bn for the same March-May period in 2019, as bookings dried up and the corporation’s cruise lines suspended sailings after severe outbreaks onboard its ships.While many lines, including its British subsidiaries P\u0026ampO and Cunard, have said they will pause operations until at least the autumn, Carnival hopes some business will resume from late summer, with $475m banked in bookings for 2020 sailings. It retains a total of $2.6bn in customers’ cash, with many having accepted vouchers for future sailings in 2021.Many ships – with crew onboard – remain offshore and unable to dock because of restrictions imposed by governments. Carnival said 21,000 employees were still on its ships, about a quarter of its crew, but it expected to return most of them home by the end of June.The company warned it would face ongoing operating and administrative costs of about $250m per month once all of its ships are in “paused status”. Only 61 of more than 100 ships in the fleet have so far managed to reach harbour.The group plans to sell six cruise ships, which typically cost between $500m and $1bn new, as it seeks to adjust to an uncertain future.Carnival said it could not predict when normal business would resume. However, it “expects to resume guest operations, after collaboration with both government and health authorities, in a phased manner, with specific ships and brands returning to service over time”.It expects the first cruise holidays to return “will be from a select number of easily accessible homeports”, rather than the fly-cruise market, and that its fleets will be smaller.Carnival said it had raised more than $6.6bn this year in bonds and share issues to boost its liquidity.It said earlier this year that the sector may never fully recover, after being centre stage during the early part of the pandemic. Passengers on the Diamond Princess were confined to a cabin off Japan in February, while the Ruby Princess was identified as a key importer of Covid-19 to Australia.The cruise operator, which had to repatriate passengers at a huge cost, faces lawsuits from passengers on coronavirus-hit ships.In another sign of the industry’s struggles, the British cruise line company Cruise and Maritime Voyages said on Wednesday it was in emergency discussions with prospective investors and lenders after a potential loan deal collapsed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1867c017afda994be9ed512de2c361d9f245ed52/0_175_5446_3267/master/5446.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=592c55d6e88d41b5dca9b0f8452d38fc","title":"plans to turn house of fraser westfield into co working space west london","story":"Planning application for west London site reflects tough times for retailers and landlordsA branch of House of Fraser in one of London’s top shopping centres could be turned into a WeWork-style office space, in the latest indication of the tough environment for retailers and their landlords.An application to Hammersmith and Fulham council by the owner of Westfield London includes a plan to convert about two-thirds of the 104,000 sq ft (9662 sq metre) store into a co-working space.No operator has been lined up to run the office space as yet and Westfield is considering running the operation itself if no viable alternative emerges, according to Estates Gazette, the trade journal that first reported Westfield’s plans.Another department store chain, Debenhams, recently exited the west London shopping centre after Westfield refused demands for hefty rent cuts. The space is being converted into an outlet store for Harrods.The House of Fraser’s store will reopen this week. The shopping centre’s owner, Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield, said the planning application for the House of Fraser site was only in its early stages and there would be no immediate changes. It said the redevelopment was part of a strategy to include more interactive experiences at its shopping centres.The Westfield application is one of several under way around the country as the landlords of House of Fraser stores line up alternative uses after the chain’s owners have demanded steep cuts in rent or rent holidays.Landlords have sought permission to rejig House of Fraser sites in a number of other locations including Reading, where bowling and crazy golf are being considered as a replacement. A housing development is being considered at the Lakeside shopping centre in Essex, while there is a proposal to bring in office space and a gym at the Oxford Street site in London. Plans have been approved to demolish the store in Lincoln and build a four-star hotel.In Hull, where House of Fraser closed last year, the site is being redeveloped into a food hall similar to developments in Altrincham, Leeds and London.Landlords are having to be creative to fill space and find new ways to attract visitors as bricks-and-mortar shopping has become less popular. The pandemic has only added to fears for their future.House of Fraser’s closures come after Debenhams permanently closed dozens of outlets this year. John Lewis has warned it may not reopen all 50 of its stores. Smaller department store chain Beales closed all its 23 stores after collapsing into administration in January.Sara Boonham, director of retail at the property consultancy Gleeds, which is advising on possible redevelopments of a number of department store sites, said Covid-19 was accelerating change.“Towns and city centres were already undergoing a period of dramatic change, moving away from retail as the anchor. They will be further reshaped by the work from home revolution, with the retail scapes in such centres completely changing,” she said.Against this backdrop the situation is deteriorating for the traditional, mid-market department stores that have already been living on borrowed time as they continued to “be all things to all people”, Boonham said.She said landlords were looking at bringing in family entertainment, interactive leisure and wellbeing startups as well as live music, events and hospitality venues."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/045aae4f7fd13c5ca15e341410e5afe151ead59b/0_141_4593_2756/master/4593.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=900edb8e825bd9a2fe087a5cebc5b644","title":"uk firms slavery links racism cbi reparations greene king lloyds of london","story":"Call from CBI follows reparation efforts by Greene King and Lloyd’s of LondonBusiness groups have told companies they should examine their role in history after two big firms said they intended to make financial donations to minority communities in reparation for their role in the slave trade.Pub chain and brewer Greene King and insurance marketing group Lloyd’s of London both said they would make donations, amid intense scrutiny on the legacy of slavery in the UK and the continued effects of racism.Some of the UK’s most recognisable business names have said they are considering their historic links to the slave trade, including banks such as Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland, HSBC, Lloyds Banking Group and the private bank Arbuthnot Latham.RBS also said a newly founded taskforce would consider making donations to charitable groups in black, Asian and minority ethnic communities.The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) and the Institute of Directors (IoD) welcomed introspection from businesses with historic links to slavery, amid increased scrutiny prompted by recent Black Lives Matter protests and campaigns to remove statues of slave owners and imperialists.“Companies with a history of benefiting from slavery should carefully consider how they address their past,” said Matthew Fell, the CBI’s chief UK policy director. “Acknowledging and learning from previous wrongdoing is vital for organisations to take the right steps in future.“Creating real change must start now. As business leaders, it is our collective responsibility to recognise, condemn and eradicate racism in all its forms.”The CBI said companies should focus on increasing boardroom representation of black and ethnic minority workers and making sure that future policy challenges ethnic inequalities.“This feels like a significant moment. Businesses are reflecting on these issues in a deeper way than was common previously,” said a spokesman for the IoD.“It is the role and responsibility of directors to think about their company’s relationship with the community around them and it is right that they should consider acting now.”Progress from large UK companies on ethnic ersity has been slow in recent years. Only 53 of Britain’s FTSE 100 companies at the end of 2019 had at least one director from an ethnic minority, according to figures compiled in February for the latest annual review led by the City grandee Sir John Parker. In 2016 he said every FTSE company should have a board member from an ethnic minority by 2021.The IoD’s chair, Charlotte Valeur, last year accused FTSE 100 firms of “lying” when they said they were unable to recruit more executives and directors from ethnic minorities.Disparities in pay between white British workers and those from ethnic minorities remain a significant problem as well.Ruby McGregor-Smith, a Tory peer who is president of the British Chambers of Commerce, this week called for Boris Johnson to implement recommendations from a 2017 review she carried out, including forcing companies to improve their reporting of ethnic pay gaps.The prime minister has faced criticism for his decision to start another review of racial inequality, despite the government not acting on policy recommendations in previous reviews.Lady McGregor-Smith told the Financial Times: “The big gap is ethnicity pay reporting  … and that needs to change.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ebc613058941c55aa6960bfdec7a67d5413159e/0_91_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=05cd9092a96b627e7785a6a6013f5338","title":"uk working from home ons coronavirus businesses","story":"Many businesses reluctant to reopen during coronavirus pandemic, data suggestsHomeworking has become a way of life for almost half of British workers, according to official figures that show a jump in the number of people working away from their office or factory.As companies look to bring staff back from furlough, the figures show how employers have proved unwilling to open their workplaces and preferred to keep staff at home.The latest furlough figures show the wages of 9.1 million temporarily laid off workers are being subsidised by a government furlough scheme – up from 8.9 million workers a week ago – by 1.1 million employers at a cost of £20.8bn to the Treasury.But figures from the ONS’s business impact of coronavirus survey found that a return to work was already under way, even as more staff were being furloughed.The ONS said the increase in homeworking included people who were exclusively at home and those who commuted part of the week.A separate wellbeing study by the ONS found that the average level of anxiety across the population had fallen since March and the beginning of the lockdown, but households were more concerned about the recovery.The Eurobarometer consumer survey, which has been published every month since 1985 by the European commission, found that households were at their lowest ebb on record in their views of the economic outlook.In May, households registered a figure of -49.4 compared with the previous low of -47.9 in 2008."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a22afdf07b97fad521ac531eecf31e4afe7c9aa2/0_108_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fcfbf166f9871376784df7f7b9050bc5","title":"welsh chicken factory closed for two weeks over covid 19 in staff","story":"Fifty-eight coronavirus cases confirmed among workers at 2 Sisters facility on AngleseyThe UK’s main supplier of supermarket chicken has shut one of its factories for two weeks after an outbreak of coronavirus among the plant’s staff.Public Health Wales said 58 Covid-19 cases had been confirmed at 2 Sisters Food Group’s facility in Llangefni, Anglesey, which employs about 560 people.The firm, which has eight other sites in its poultry ision and supplies all of the main supermarkets as well as fast-food chains such as KFC, is no stranger to operating under reduced capacity.

Yet our new report shows they must believe we can deliver it• Ed Miliband is a former leader of the Labour partyThis is a moment of profound economic and social distress for the country. Bold action is desperately required to cope with the crisis. Yet we are six months on from another election that Labour lost badly.This is the backdrop for the Labour Together report on the 2019 defeat, which we are publishing tomorrow. Our report is clear that the party cannot abandon its commitment to bold economic transformation – indeed we believe there is a winning coalition to be built for it. To deliver that transformation, Labour must learn the deep lessons about why the public did not believe in the change we offered in 2019 and the deep roots of our defeat.There is a broad consensus about the immediate reasons for our defeat. Just like when I lost in 2015, issues of leadership mattered so, too, did the dramatic wedge that Brexit drove through our coalition and a sense that, whatever the popularity of inidual policies, our manifesto package as a whole was not seen as credible.However, our report concludes that these issues conceal much deeper forces. In 2019, the so-called red wall crumbled but the bricks had been gradually loosening over a long period through a combination of industrial change and alienation from the Westminster party. In the seats we lost in 2019, such as North West Durham and Rother Valley, the gap between the Tories and us had been closing for two decades.At the same time as we have lost our old heartlands, we have a new core vote, of younger graduates, mostly in our big cities. But they are not enough on their own to win us the election. Every leftwing party across Europe is facing a similar challenge, often recording historically low vote shares.The deeper forces that have led us to this point require deep thinking to lead us out, as Keir Starmer has said. Our task is to build a new coalition of younger, metropolitan voters, along with those in our former core vote who deserted us over time, as well as swing voters, including those in the south of England.Listening to voters does not lead to abandoning a belief in economic transformation. We are clear that people want real, profound change and Labour must be the agent of it.The party conducted detailed polling analysis of hundreds of thousands of people and organised a citizens’ jury, bringing together town-dwelling leave voters who had left us and urban remainers who had stayed. The shared concerns included investing in public services such as the NHS and education building social housing and creating decent jobs and fair taxation and redistribution.This sentiment for big economic change was seen in the Brexit referendum, among millions of leavers who felt neglected by politics and wanted an economic transformation that spoke to their community and town. This desire is still evident among leave and remain voters.Since my defeat in 2015, I have learned lessons about the appetite for greater boldness compared to what I offered. Today, the lessons from 2019 are that we must have change that people can believe in. People simply did not buy into the idea that the transformation we were promising last December would be delivered. Whatever our good intentions, if people think change won’t happen, they won’t vote for us.Winning the case for change is also about the work done in the years between elections, not the months before. Our report recommends that we use every part of our movement to rebuild the bonds that link us to voters. Unless we make our politics more relational, less transactional, we will be deeply vulnerable to simplistic, populist arguments from the other side.Our organisation and campaigning is not fit for purpose: our methods still owe more to the 1990s than the 2020s. And while we prided ourselves on digital innovation in 2017, the Conservatives were miles ahead of us last year. A top-to-bottom transformation is required.To make the most of our wider movement, we must put aside the factionalism and ision of recent years. We owe it to the people whom we represent to look outwards to the country rather than inwards.There is no consolation in defeat – only a country that has grown more unequal, more unfair and more ided. The Herculean task of winning the next election will require vision, imagination, discipline and unity. Every part of our movement must be part of it. We hope our report can be a starting point not just for winning an election but what really matters: a radical transformation of our country.• Ed Miliband is shadow business secretary and former leader of the Labour party"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/445b7b606d3cbbf8936fd1d82cfbfb4f436132d8/0_0_4275_2566/master/4275.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=46568d50e880a059260aa03e75623919","title":"premier league five a side public health","story":"The government sees sport not as a barometer of public health but as an asset, a source of soft power to be flauntedThe Premier League resumed on Wednesday night, and in most measurable respects was a resounding success. With no fans allowed inside stadiums, more than 3 million people tuned in to watch Manchester City beat Arsenal 3-0 on Sky Sports, almost double the broadcaster’s average television audience for the season. As with the early-evening game, Aston Villa v Sheffield United, viewers were given the choice of two audio tracks: one with fake crowd noise added, and one where the game unfolded in eerie laboratory silence.Neither was entirely satisfactory, of course, but for the majority of fans – not to mention the thousands of us who make an auxiliary living from the sport – it will have been infinitely preferable to no football at all. And given the 100-day layoff and the relative lack of full-contact training, the quality of the spectacle was surprisingly good, Arsenal’s entirely conceptual defensive display notwithstanding.An hour before kick-off, speaking at the government’s daily coronavirus briefing from Downing Street, the culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, was eager to associate himself with what he described as this “hugely symbolic moment” in the country’s return to normality. Describing it as the “best league in the world”, which merely confirmed that he couldn’t have watched very much of it this season, Dowden underlined the Premier League’s global reach, trumpeting its resumption as “a boost for our football-loving nation”.And yet, for me and so many others in our “football-loving nation”, Wednesday night usually has a subtly different connotation. It’s five-a-side night. And under normal circumstances this would have been a night for performing some extremely perfunctory warm-up exercises, turning out for my team Xmus Jaxon Flaxon Waxon in Division Three of the Vauxhall Powerleague, and only later catching up with the proper football.Of all the small graces we have been denied over the last few months, five-a-side is probably the one I miss most. It’s sport as ritual, from the inevitable late dash through rush-hour traffic to the post-match debrief over pints and breaded chicken strips, and one whose health and social benefits greatly outweigh the painful defeats and occasional knee prangs (most of which, admittedly, have stemmed from an inadequate warm-up). But as the Premier League rumbles back into gear and pundits breathlessly declare that “football is back”, our local five-a-side pitch – like most of this country’s grassroots sporting apparatus – currently lies dormant, and will do so until July at the very earliest.On one level this makes perfect sense, with the country still tentatively emerging from lockdown. Even so, the stark juxtaposition of public sport facilities lying empty while one of the world’s richest sporting leagues beats a path to restart offers some insight into how the government sees sport.It is – or at least should be – infinitely safer to run a recreational football game for 10 players and a referee than to organise a Premier League game with its cast of hundreds (a maximum of 300 people are being allowed to attend), its policing requirements, the fraught logistics of securely ferrying entire staffs around the country every few days, and the exhaustive testing regime required to test every player and coach twice a week until the end of the season.Of course, we all know what’s really driving this. The Premier League runs on broadcast revenue, and would have faced a potential bill of £762m had the current season not finished as scheduled. And despite being perfectly willing to use football to score cheap political points early in the pandemic – Dowden was critical of football clubs for using the furlough scheme, while the health secretary, Matt Hancock, urged footballers to “play their part” by taking pay cuts – the government has nevertheless pushed for the Premier League to resume as soon as possible.Why? Perhaps Dowden’s words offered a clue. “All but five countries” would be airing Wednesday night’s games, he beamed, “underlining football’s global reach and the soft power of UK sport”. And in this quietly revealing statement we glimpsed how the government really conceives of sport: not as a barometer of the nation’s physical or mental health, not as a genuine public good, but first and foremost as an asset, a source of soft power, a luxury good to be flaunted. In this view football exists only as a tool of influence: a populist bandwagon (which is why the government was so hasty to U-turn on its free school meals policy when Marcus Rashford intervened) and handy distraction.And so with that, football is back. Well, the important bits, anyway. As Manchester City v Arsenal played out their fixture at the Etihad Stadium, giant banners draped over the thousands of empty seats, a screen behind each goal displayed live reactions of City fans watching the game from their homes, arranged in a four-by-four grid. It was, in a way, the only real acknowledgement of the fact that this was once a sport for all of us.• Jonathan Liew is a sportswriter for the "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6cb7ef2acfae95576e33d488e9df85a3b1fe6a90/0_333_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8ecffdd7c0cd80796f92605b87894ccb","title":"the guardian view on tutors for all easier said than done","story":"The government’s plan to target catch-up funds at poorer pupils is welcome, but risks failure if it is rushed The best thing about the news that the government is to fund a catch-up programme of tutoring in England, to compensate for learning lost due to the pandemic, is the proof it offers that ministers recognise the problem. Something must be done to make up for the months of missed schooling if some children’s life chances are not to be permanently harmed. Since pupils were sent home in March, it has been obvious that the impact would fall unequally, with poorer children suffering more than those from better-off backgrounds because of vast disparities between resources (physical space, technology, parental education) at home.So it is good news too that the catch-up spend is to be targeted. Already, evidence suggests that pupils in the most disadvantaged areas are least likely to have engaged with remote learning, while private school pupils have received more online teaching than anyone else.But if the problem is clear, the solution is less so. Tutoring has been shown to be effective in boosting the results of low-income pupils. If spent wisely, a pandemic premium to top up their education could be an effective intervention. But delivering such a scheme will be an immense organisational feat.That is because calculating learning loss, and timetabling extra classes, is not a back-of-an-envelope job. Already, schools are wrestling with all manner of logistical challenges. There is no guarantee that lessons will be back to normal in the autumn (a parallel debate is taking place in Scotland, where Nicola Sturgeon has faced criticism). While schools, teachers and families have undoubtedly done their best in difficult circumstances, the pandemic has thrown a harsh light on the English system’s weakness. Successive governments, both Labour and Conservative, have weakened local accountability to the point where many headteachers have had nowhere to turn during the greatest crisis of their careers.From the delayed lockdown, to the lack of personal protective equipment and testing, to the now-abandoned tracing app, at every stage of this pandemic ministers have been shown up as poor planners. If they are serious about repairing the damage to education, they must now be patient.Building the right programme will take time. England’s tutoring industry, which is estimated to be worth £2bn a year, is barely regulated. If substantial taxpayer funds are to be spent on one-to-one or small-group coaching, this must be done properly. That means giving schools time to work out what is needed, while deciding which providers (including the schools themselves) are best placed to deliver this.It would make sense to put in place measures for three years, not one. A second wave of infections remains a possibility. Even without it, many children will need time to get back into the swing of school life. Those returning to their final year of school will require special consideration. But for the rest it is more important to get the recovery plan right than to rush."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e669cf04603860c73fd1138edfabe2889534f704/0_164_4320_2591/master/4320.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1dd214bd45caa6f0a57a15e31cbf9b0d","title":"i dont want to go to university next year what can i do instead","story":"If you’re planning to defer your university place until next year, you have gap year options in the meantimeOne in five students said\u0026nbspthey were willing to defer going to university in the event that, come September, uni isn’t back to normal, according to a recent poll by the University and College Union. That leaves a whole lot of school-leavers –\u0026nbsp120,000 to be precise – potentially twiddling their thumbs.\u0026nbspHistorically there has been a direct correlation between times of economic strife and hikes in student enrolment, so industry observers are sceptical that there will be mass deferrals. Then again, the sheer ubiquity of the catchphrase “these unprecedented times” suggests that nothing is certain. For the University Guys’ David Hawkins, rethinking your options involves having an honest conversation with yourself about risk versus reward. What were your reasons before January for going to university? How has the pandemic changed your circumstances, your motivations and your finances? To what extent will it continue to threaten your health?Of course, one reason for not going to uni this year might be that you’re simply unhappy with your A-level results. Retaking your exams in the autumn is possible, but bear in mind that the 2020 applicant cohort was going to be the smallest in 18 years, even before Covid-19 hit. Moreover, with the gap left by those international students who don’t take up their offers, universities will have seats to fill. While the government has warned against unconditional offers and lowering standards, admissions processes will potentially be more flexible. Clearing starts on 6 July, so keep an eye out. Most importantly, though, deferrals in 2020 will only result in greater competition in 2021. Not only will there be more people applying: if universities have to make cuts this year, there will be fewer places.The pandemic has led Griffith Smith, currently in year 13 in Hackney, London, to a switch from the anthropology degree he’d applied for to architecture. And then, in the light of the protests he has taken part in, to really questioning whether architecture was the right way to go too. “Seeing so much injustice in the world makes me, and many other people my age, want to get involved in politics.” His gap year plans – traveling around New Zealand – have been similarly shaken up. The same applies to studying abroad. Charlie Ball, Prospects’ head of higher education intelligence, says there are no nations telling students not to come in September. Australia is mooting a shorter quarantine period for students from as early as next month and New Zealand’s 14-day group quarantine for international student arrivals will double up as an induction period. But, Ball warns, if a second bout of coronavirus piggybacks on flu season next year, will you be OK being in lockdown that far from home? In Canada, McGill University has announced that autumn 2020 courses will primarily be delivered online, meaning you could in theory not even travel to Montreal to get stuck in. It can help to remember that everyone’s plans have been affected. As YouTuber Jack Edwards, who has just done his finals in English literature at Durham University, points out, “when a future employer or university sees we’re the class of 2020, it’s not like we’ll have to add a disclaimer. They’re going to know.” His advice is to seize the day and set up opportunities for yourself.Resit A-levels? You will be able to retake your exams in the autumn – most likely in November – either through your school, a sixth-form college or online, via the likes of Pearson Edexcel and Cambridge Assessment International.Work in the UK? You could apply to be a seasonal fruit picker (Pick For Britain), a courier (Hermes, say, or Citysprint) or a supermarket freshness specialist. The NHS contact tracing recruitment process has been paused, but given the fluid situation there, it’s worth looking out for future position call-outs.Travel abroad? While the UK governmental advice that all non-essential travel be avoided still holds, there are no countries expressly ruling out foreign arrivals from September. STA, StudentUniverse and other student-focused travel agencies are all taking risk-free bookings (no date changes or cancellation fees). For tours, work schemes and other activities check back in closer to the time, as they will be contingent on social distancing measures. And make sure you are aware of any visa requirements, and consulate or embassy closures.Study abroad? No countries are saying international students will not be able to come in September. Each university however is working out their own approach to social distancing and possible remote learning facilities in the event of a future lockdown. Pay close attention to how well the university you’re interested in communicates these plans with you. Bear in mind that the student loan is not portable outside the UK."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6eb18f731803a21d0003a823deb01a1210e5caf/0_119_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=101c493bc23e34bf1ead7c4e0e825742","title":"what its really like to be black in the fashion industry","story":"Models, casting agents and stylists tell us their experiences in the fashion and beauty worldsI grew up in Nottingham which is a hugely erse city. Everything I am comes back to home – I was blessed to go to a school with a majority BAME attendance and I was blessed to have friends who came from a range of erse backgrounds. We’d casually speak about our lives, teach one another our customs, talk about how our mums disciplined us, laugh at the differences – and it’s these exchanges and an interest in other people that inform my life and work today.Being constantly asked about “ersity” makes me feel like I’m always being typecast as someone who only casts people of colour and at the forefront of my work is a meaning and message of constantly pushing for change. Whilst this is somewhat true, and ersity is always present in my world, I’m actually only really doing my job. I live in London, one of the most culturally erse cities in the world, it makes sense for me to represent the faces I see around me. It’s all just second nature.Ideally, we will get to a place where ersity isn’t such a buzzword and fair representation is a given, but for real change to happen, these interviews and questions need to be directed at the bigger institutions, publications and fashion houses.We need to be questioning ersity and inclusion across their boards, committees and within their recruitment processes. Let’s unpack the systemic oppression of people of colour and the hierarchal nepotism that leads to a lack of opportunities for people of colour. So I yield my time and put it to the fashion industry to not ask me what I am doing in my work, but to look within itself and ask what they are doing.Fashion has always been a wonder to me, by the age of 14 I would buy the new glossies every month and study the cover all the way through to the back of the book. So you could imagine my excitement when I got accepted to study fashion journalism at the London College of Fashion.However, at 18, I learned the hard lesson that fashion wasn’t necessarily ready for someone who looked like me. At university, I was one of a handful of black girls on my course and I was often made to feel othered. Now I have to add at this time the prejudices I faced landed on a social-economical side as opposed to racism. I wasn’t racially abused outright, but my use of colloquial language and my style – of a working-class black girl from a council estate in Oxford – was often sniggered at during lectures.After university, I interned and worked for free as many of my peers did. Soon I landed my first job at a national newspaper. My old classmates referred to me as the ‘token hire’. Often as a black person in this industry, you constantly have to prove your talents and worth. Unfortunately, I often feel like a token hire. This isn’t because I lack talent, it’s because of the lack of people that look like me when I step into these spaces. I am often the only black woman, and if I am not, then somewhere down the line, I will be mistaken for that only other black woman. I could relay to you horror stories about things I’ve faced in this industry. I’ve been asked if I wash my hair – people have touched my hair out of the middle of nowhere! Models I’ve selected have been called too dark. My style is constantly put into an urban category. I get typecaste for certain jobs and looked over for others. Editors have stolen my ideas of representing blackness and presented them as their own. The list goes on.However, we have gone past the time when I think black people need to relive their trauma in a way to educate. If you open your eyes, you can see that systematic racism is prevalent in fashion. I ask you to look at your teams, do they reflect how multicultural the outside world is? Do you support black designers? Do you cast more than one black model? Do you have any black senior members of staff? If you answer no to any of those questions, then now is finally the time to change. I’m hopeful for change, but I hope it comes soon. It’s exhausting working for an industry you love that doesn’t love you.Working in the industry, I realised that as a black woman, and a young black woman at that, it was harder for my work to be taken seriously because I was considered inexperienced, despite my wide range of clients and a multifaceted body of work, I would still find challenges to be heard. Marie Claire wrote of me in an article: “At 21, Mariélle already has a resumé – shoots for British Vogue, Fenty and Nike – that rivals those of industry veterans twice her age.”Reading this, I felt conflicted, whilst proud of my resumé, and the work I have achieved, what is not seen are the emotional difficulties that I have had to push through. From feeling like I don’t belong on certain jobs, to being the only black person in the crew, or being put in a box: ‘She can do black makeup so let’s get her.’ I know black creatives will know the experiences I speak of. We all know. I won’t dwell on these points. These are difficulties, however, that I continue to push through to continue doing what I love.What I want now is for real change to happen. No more performative black squares, I want real change from these big corporations who are heavily influenced by black culture. Existing cosmetic brands need to start catering to black skin and not wait until there’s an uproar because they’ve decided to create 20 shades of beige and two “medium-deep” shades. Black skin cannot be an afterthought any more. Include us in the process.I know I am not the only black model to have experienced agencies stating that they already had enough black girls on their books or the idea of not wanting many that ‘look the same’, resulting in a particular favouritism for models with the look of the moment. Being 3 of 12 selected for a runway with these dynamics in mind, makes it more difficult for a genuine shift. These factors attached to token gestures of inclusivity are features that stagnate any real change or space for growth in an industry capable of presenting an array of black faces, if it felt compelled to.Being stereotyped is something I have experienced in my career and on occasion, over the years, I have censored myself in certain situations out of fear of being perceived as the aggressor, the a or rude. Which is uncanny, as an action will cause a reaction. I was told that ‘I should shave all my hair off so I can look like the other black models’ which would ‘help my career’. At the time I couldn’t believe what I was being advised to do in order for me to succeed. I politely said I will never cut my hair because black girls look beautiful with or without hair. In order for me to get work, to survive, I found myself conforming to ‘fit in’ with industry standards. But as time moved on this acceptance became more tiring and uncomfortable. A lack of knowledge of black skin tones and black hair has meant that for me not to look ashy – or have my hair damaged – I have had to bring my own products to shoots, in order to not be seen as ‘difficult’ which hurts when other models can just turn up to the job, without having to exert any additional labour.The industry is slowly ersifying, however, there are structural issues that still need to be addressed, especially, if we are going to work in an environment that does not present constant micro aggressions. The need for more black managers, directors, editors-in-chief, creative directors and more, in permanent positions, offers a way to create a systemic impact.I have carried the weight of being one of the very few black women in an office throughout my career, conscious that my mannerisms, outfits and work could either positively or negatively influence another black person getting the same role – because why else are there very few like me here or even in senior positions? I had experienced situations in which I had been overlooked for permanent positions, shielded from duties that would enhance my skills and sometimes when it came to pay was offered less. It hurts, as not only did I feel that I’d worked hard, I had more experience. Often when I began to consider the details, the only real difference was the colour of my skin.However, I’d soon come to find a seat at the Matchesfashion table starting my journey in the company as a PR intern in 2015, supporting both the womenswear and menswear teams, looking after UK, Europe and international press. While my experience may not echo that of others who have worked at Matchesfashion I know the love and support I have received from my team is unique to the industry that we are in, not in a ‘we know you are black so feel we have to be nice to you’ way but one based on opportunities guided by meritocracy and genuine love and care. Importantly I feel like I have been listened to, my voice is always welcomed, and I’ve been given the opportunity to develop my ideas and plan events both local and international.I hope that my story shows that there are allies that will support you, and people who are willing to mentor and advise. I do hope that one day a young black person can see an industry where they are welcome, where their ideas are listened to, are employed and promoted not to fit a quota but because of their talent and experience. To know that ersity is more than just a headline.Racism in fashion is more passive, so a common experience I have is being the token black guy or a choice between me or five other guys that ‘look like me’ as designers don’t like to include ‘too many’ PoC in their projects. I’ve had an interesting experience as a black model working in the fashion industry. I like to look at the positives in things so the fact I can inspire others with the things I’ve done is something I appreciate.It has been challenging and it does test my patience in many ways, but it gives me the feeling of accomplishment when I do things that were pretty much impossible for black models not so long ago. Diversity is an important term in fashion and it is necessary. Models need to represent all backgrounds in these clothes they’re on the runway in as there isn’t just one type of customer who purchases these pieces.I just feel that sometimes designers use “ersity” for marketing as its due to be featured in press and that’s something I don’t support. I hope the fashion industry refreshes their mind on what ersity really means and start seeing people for people rather than what audience they might trigger or their closed-minded definition of beauty."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c1c4de45072c5025b92daa74a6b12c6a91b9dd0/120_0_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6cffe7cd71dd4659ad08e898ef31026c","title":"disclosure laverne cox netflix documentary trans representation","story":"A history of Hollywood’s problematic transgender stereotypes and tropes is explored in an eye-opening new filmIn June 2014, Time magazine featured Laverne Cox, star of Netflix’s Orange is the New Black, on a cover that proclaimed America’s “Transgender Tipping Point”. Cox, a black transgender actor, was at the forefront of a wave of mainstream media depictions of transgender people, from the critically acclaimed Amazon series Transparent, to the bestselling memoir by Janet Mock, to fashion campaigns by the likes of Barneys featuring transgender models. In the six years since Cox’s Time cover, mainstream depictions of trans or non-conforming gender have proliferated – there’s Hunter Schafer in the HBO coming-of-age drama Euphoria, the non-binary character Taylor Mason on Showtime’s Billions and the Netflix show Pose, set in the ballroom scene of 1980s New York.But while mainstream visibility is welcome and influential, especially for as historically marginalized a community as transgender people, one should be wary of celebrating representation in which “a few people are elevated and the majority of people are still struggling”, Cox says in Disclosure, a Netflix documentary she executive produced on the history of transgender representation in American media.“My own life is such a profound example of what representation can do,” Cox told the , noting countless stories of trans people she’s met who transitioned, or came out to friends and family, or decided to stop living stealth, after seeing her character on Orange is the New Black. But in the same context, “trans people have experienced unprecedented levels of violence, and this legislative assault in state legislatures and on a federal level that is unprecedented”.This visibility paradox was on stark display during the week of Disclosure’s release, which kicked off with a Black Trans Lives Matter rally in New York attended by tens of thousands of people and 25,000 people in a Los Angeles march – an unprecedented public display of solidarity in the face of systemic violence against transgender people of color. The week prior, two black transgender women were killed within 24 hours — Dominique “Rem’Mie” Fells in Philadelphia, and Riah Milton in Liberty Township, Ohio.The supreme court affirmed federal civil rights protections for LGBTQ+ citizens this week, preventing 26 states to still allow employers to fire trans employees for their gender – days after the Trump administration announced it would roll back healthcare protections for transgender people.The seesaw of news tests the utility of visibility, as “we see time and time again that as marginalized communities get mainstream attention, backlash ensues”, Sam Feder, the director of Disclosure, told the . While the process of re-examining decades of trans representation in media for Disclosure was “really cathartic”, especially “seeing it in context that’s held and driven by trans people”, Feder said he “didn’t want to lose sight of the fact that visibility is not the goal, it’s just a means to an end”.Still, in unspooling over a century of representation, Disclosure reveals how tropes, stereotypes and recognition thread and bake into the present, for better or for worse. With commentary from a bevy of transgender entertainment figures including Trace Lysette, Jazzmun, MJ Richardson, Candis Cayne and Tiq Milan, Disclosure revisits early Hollywood, when cross-dressing was illegal yet numerous silent films featured men dressing in women’s clothing. Misleading, dangerous or problematic depictions and stereotypes have existed just as long, such as the terrible trope of trans characters as psychopathic killers – from Murder! in 1930, Beyond the Valley of the Dolls in 1970, and Psycho in 1960 to the serial killer Buffalo Bill in Silence of the Lambs in 1991 – which primed audiences to respond to transgender people with fear.That historical thread clearly runs into another headline in recent weeks: Harry Potter author JK Rowling’s essay of transphobic misinformation. Having already addressed Rowling’s comments as “deeply problematic” and the burden of representing a marginalized community in public – “The ‘ide and conquer’ method of pitting women’s rights against the rights of trans people has been a very effective tool for iding marginalized people,” she told the Daily Beast – Cox declined to add more on the Rowling essay, other than to support actors from the Harry Potter franchise, including Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Eddie Redmayne, who have publicly refuted Rowling’s views.“Go Emma, go Daniel, go Eddie,” Cox said.Disclosure, as a film on the history on anti-trans or misleading depictions in popular culture, could “enlighten JK and folks who are like-minded to the roots of their patriarchal fantasies”, Feder added.In numerous examples, the cumulative effect of which is devastating and damning, Disclosure reveals a minefield of depictions toggling between the extremes of tragic victim, butt of the joke or spectacle, but rarely grounded person. The tropes range from dangerous and destructive to well-meaning but clumsy, including: the transgender violence victim narrative in cop and medical shows an obsessive focus on talk shows and news programs with surgery and body parts, and audience assumptions that any question, no matter how invasive is fair game the assumption that disclosure – the reveal of oneself as transgender – must be a storyline, one accompanied by feelings of betrayal and mistrust men reacting to trans women with visceral disgust and cis actors playing trans characters to critical acclaim, such as Jared Leto winning the Oscar for Dallas Buyers Club, Chris Sarandon in Dog Day Afternoon and Redmayne’s Oscar-nominated turn in The Danish Girl.What to do with this litany of problematic, often downright transphobic depictions? Feder and Cox called for context, not censorship, in light of the conversation recently reignited by HBO Max’s decision to temporarily remove Gone With the Wind from its streaming service, pending a note from black historians on the film’s racist depictions and glorification of the Confederacy. Problematic portrayals are “an educational opportunity”, said Cox. “I’m not a fan of chucking art to the side. I’m a fan of critically engaging with it and having conversations.”Both said it’s important to understand the origins of ideology and stereotypes as a roadmap for fixing and dispelling them. “It’s so important for us to be clear about where this started,” said Cox. And looking to the future, Feder said, “what we need is more – the more we have, the less harmful these clumsy representations will be”.“We need more trans folks working behind the scenes – directing, producing, below the line positions, just more,” Cox added. “And more representation in positions of power.”Janet Mock’s multimillion-dollar Netflix deal, for example, is a step – “but it’s just one person. We need more of that.”The size and visibility of recent protests give Cox a “tremendous amount of hope”, she said, “but it is about what comes next. It is about keeping this energy to change policy, to redirect our budgets and our cities away from policing and toward education, housing, employment opportunities for those who are most at the margins.”Representation, said Cox, can “change some hearts and minds, it can inspire people, but it needs to be combined with efforts to shift ideology and institutions and public policy – and, again, the material conditions of people’s lives”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90f42973e24802459e6c5a30001c251b30754b9b/0_0_4086_2451/master/4086.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3b618e8183fb427b2063fdc281cb08de","title":"sam riley control moment my life good ian curtis berlin marie curie","story":"He made his name playing Ian Curtis then found himself in Disney films with Angelina Jolie, but has his current turn as Marie Curie’s husband really taught him how to make a bomb?Science wasn’t Sam Riley’s thing at school. Instead, he stared out of the window dreaming of becoming an actor or a rock star. But for his latest role – as Pierre Curie alongside Rosamund Pike’s Marie in the biopic Radioactive – Riley read some textbooks. And during the shoot, a professor taught them how to use the Curies’ 19th-century lab equipment so they looked authentic.So could he make a bomb? “Probably, if I looked online,” he says.Really? Yikes. The film, without apportioning blame, makes the connection between Marie’s work in discovering radioactivity, and the atomic bombing of Hiroshima half a century later. Riley, it turns out, thinks I’m saying “bong”, of which, he confirms, he has already made several. He’s refreshingly unguarded, droll, funny, has very high cheekbones. And he does sound as if he has lived a bit.The voice! It’s extraordinary. Here, in a London hotel just before lockdown, he’s a young-looking 40-year-old in black polo neck and jeans. Then Riley opens his mouth, and he’s a gravelly old geezer. It’s as if his vocal cords have been loosened and allowed to rust prematurely. “I was in a pub rock band,” he gasps. “I always had the smallest amp so I sort of destroyed my voice to make myself heard. And, y’know, the other stuff …” Setting out, Riley looked more likely to be a rocker than an actor. He did the National Youth Theatre, but failed to get into drama school. His band, 10,000 Things, supported Babyshambles, and Riley once got mistaken for Pete Doherty in Dundee. They were signed but their album was panned in the NME and “the music sort of went tits up”.Then his acting agent told him about a movie production that was “looking for an unknown actor to play a singer in a band”.The film was Anton Corbijn’s Control, about Ian Curtis of Joy Division, which was released in 2007. Riley didn’t play Curtis: he tore open Curtis’s tortured soul and occupied it. It was a spellbinding performance that won him a ton of awards. Was it also a curse for his debut role to be so career-defining? “I don’t see it like that. It launched me so far up the food chain and I got every job since largely thanks to that one. If people recognise me in the street it’s usually for that, and I am incredibly grateful. It changed my life in that it gave me a career as a leading actor, I met my wife, I went to Berlin. It was the moment when my life turned good.”Riley’s wife is Romanian-German actor Alexandra Maria Lara, who played the journalist with whom Curtis had an affair. Their six-year-old son is, he reports, defiantly German. “When I told him to put a scarf on, he said: ‘Maybe it’s cold for the English.’”The Berlin move also changed his career. He wasn’t in LA or even London. “I didn’t then play Spider-Man, and go into the stratosphere, where I’m screamed at at comic cons. Assuming that is what I would have wanted to happen.”Did he? “I spent so many hours at school daydreaming about being a movie star and the closer I got to any sort of fame the more frightened I was of it,” he says. “It’s always a mix if I watch Graham Norton and see how they scream at certain contemporaries of mine, part of me goes: ‘Ooh that would be nice,’ and the other part of me thinks I’m happy I can wander around freely and still get work.”He thinks some of his films – Brighton Rock and On the Road perhaps – might have been more successful at another time. “But as far as I’m concerned I’ve had a fabulous career. I’ve worked for 14 years with some amazing people.”These include Angelina Jolie, his slightly incongruous co-star in the Disney Maleficent films. “The first time I was so terrified – not terrified of her, but of the whole thing. People kept disappearing off the set, I was thinking: I wonder if I’m going to make it through this film.”And what’s Jolie like? “I wonder if you ever really know. She was always super nice with me, we got on really well … but we don’t hang out,” he says, laughing. “It was really incredibly impressive to watch a woman or person have that much confidence and power in a system like that, in a Disney system.”We speak again, over the phone, three months later. Riley has been at home, watching films, writing music, trying to keep his son occupied. “It’s been bizarre. We’ve realised, my wife and I, that we won’t have a time like this again with our family, so close to one another.”He’s has been amazed by how differently Germany and the UK have been affected by coronavirus. Of the lower infection rates and fatalities in the former, he says: “If you park incorrectly here in Berlin you’ll have people coming out of shops telling you. In the time of a pandemic that is quite useful. The Germans are so civic-minded.”Soon, their cinemas will reopen. There will be screens between seats, almost certainly no popcorn, but at least Radioactive will get a theatrical release. Riley was talking to his agent about it the other day. “He’s only got one client on his books with a film in cinemas. We never imagined I would be that client!”• Radioactive is out now on digital platforms and on DVD on 27 July in the UK "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/937e48fd458fc0e53543d612cdacf319fe434ad7/0_158_4750_2850/master/4750.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=530465b8af954bc7526838bd4650c3ba","title":"food live animal markets new york coronavirus","story":"Amid the coronavirus, calls have grown to ban the erse US markets that stock and slaughter live animals. But is that wise? John Harry was in the mood for chicken curry, so he walked two blocks from home to pick out a couple of birds.His destination was a squat warehouse surrounded by auto body shops, a scrapyard, and a school bus depot in the working-class neighborhood of Richmond Hill in Queens, New York. Inside was riotously loud, with the cries of chickens, duck, quail, guinea fowl and the tender pigeons known as squab, jostling for space and pecking seed in tall metal cages. In another room was a pen with lambs and goats butting heads and chewing alfalfa.The warehouse smelled powerfully of feathers and droppings, but Harry, a Guyanese construction worker in his 50s, seemed unfazed. He pointed out two broiler hens to a man in overalls who grabbed them, hung them by their legs from a scale, then carried them into a room strewn with feathers and drew a knife across their throats.“You can put your rice to boil, come get a chicken, be home before it burns,” Harry said. “Can’t get fresher than this.”The market he frequents, Madani Halal, is one of more than 80 in New York City that stock live animals and slaughter them on demand for customers. The markets are considered vitally important in many immigrant communities for cultural, religious or health reasons, contributing to the erse culinary landscape for which New York is famous. Since the 1990s the number of markets has nearly doubled, concentrated mostly in outer-borough immigrant neighborhoods. But since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, widely thought to have spread from a live animal market in China, a group of New York lawmakers has sought to shut these markets down, fearing that they pose a disease threat.Bills currently before the New York assembly and senate have requested an immediate moratorium on all live animal markets in the city. If passed, they would see the markets closed until a proposed new taskforce investigates concerns about public health and animal welfare in the sector.But critics of this plan, including researchers and community activists, say it unfairly targets immigrants, and is unlikely to reduce the risk of disease. They argue that it blurs issues of health and animal rights while overlooking the wider harms of industrial meat production.“This isn’t about food safety,” said Richard David, an activist from south Queens, home to a large number of the city’s live markets. “This is about food justice.”Some so-called “wet markets” in Asia, named for the common practice of hosing them down with water, stock exotic wildlife alongside live animals, providing a potential nexus for diseases to spread. This has led to growing calls around the world to ban them, even though the precise history of the coronavirus pandemic, widely thought to have originated at a seafood market in Wuhan, is still unclear.But the term “wet markets” has become confusing in the process, mixing up wildlife consumption with less exotic traditions, such as the poultry markets of New York. This has led to a situation where, in the rush to create a safer food system, culturally significant food practices, which pose comparatively minor public health risks, are coming under threat.In New York, animal rights groups have begun campaigning vigorously on issues of food safety, including staging protests outside markets. A recent petition by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) urges officials to shut down “blood-soaked slaughterhouses” in New York, specifically referring to the facilities as “wet markets” in an accompanying video. Peta has also urged the World Health Organization (WHO) to denounce live animal markets globally. The WHO has resisted these demands, saying that live markets provide food and jobs for millions of people.“Nobody is in favor of unsanitary markets,” said Nevin Cohen, a professor of public health at the Cuny Urban Food Policy Institute. “But instead of the kneejerk reaction of shutting them down, there are other policy tools, such as updating regulations or increasing enforcement.”These could include more frequent inspections and harsher penalties for non-compliance, he explained. “Banning these markets would eliminate some of the cultural ersity of our food system,” Cohen added. “It potentially sanitizes the city, in a bad way.”On a recent weekday morning, Awadh Radhakrishen, a parking garage attendant from Guyana, waited outside Madani Halal for his order. “You see everything here,” he told me. “You know what you’re eating.” But with supermarket chicken there was no way of telling, he said. “It might have been killed two weeks ago, two states away.”Live markets were a fundamental facet of New York’s culinary landscape until the rise of refrigeration in the 20th century. Modern supply chains physically distanced consumers from producers, increasingly shielding them from what the American food writer Michael Pollan has called “the shame of killing”. For this and other reasons, such as urbanization and rising incomes, meat consumption increased massively. At the same time, the harms of meat production multiplied, from toxic runoff at feedlots to the slaughterhouses that have emerged as Covid-19 hotspots, predominantly for low-paid immigrants and people of color.While that supply chain remains largely invisible, establishments like Madani Halal are wide open to public scrutiny. “It’s easier to pick on the little guy,” said Imran Uddin, the market’s owner.A big man with a full beard, Uddin left a career in advertising 20 years ago to take over the business from his father, a Bengali immigrant who began selling poultry in 1996. Uddin’s customers come from far and wide: the Caribbean, Latin America, China, south-east Asia. There are Punjabi Sikhs who buy and slaughter their own chickens, observing religious custom, and old Italian men from a different era in the neighborhood, when it was home mostly to European immigrants. “I see fewer of them each year,” Uddin said.Like all New York live markets, Madani Halal is licensed by the state department of agriculture and markets, subject to random inspections – of the animals and facilities – about once a month. Yet Uddin says he is in favor of even stricter regulation, conceding that some markets “cut corners”.According to the bill before the New York senate, inspectors have issued “a litany of violations” at live animal markets, including sidewalks with blood and feces and “allowing grime to accumulate on butchering equipment”.“Many of these markets can and should be improved,” said Krishnendu Ray, an associate professor of food studies at New York University. “But calls to eliminate them serve only to invoke disgust against the small practices of small people – while leaving intact the very large systems that are threats to health, animal welfare and the environment.”While organizations like Peta also campaign against industrial meat production, those corporations are vastly more powerful and less sensitive to activism.“If the alternative to these markets is mass-produced meat, we’re talking about displacing risk elsewhere, not reducing it,” said Cohen.Uddin recently drafted a petition for his customers, placing it on a clipboard at the cashier’s window. It reads: “I implore our representatives to reconsider the support for this new bill and empathize with the different cultural, ethnic and religious communities you represent.”So far, a few hundred people have signed, he said. Other customers had declined, wary of drawing attention to their immigration status. The petition by Peta has nearly 50,000 signatures. “People fear what they don’t know,” Uddin said.Uddin got into his truck and drove across the neighborhood with a delivery. Gousul Anwar, a Bangladeshi man who runs a dollar store in Manhattan’s Chinatown, was at home due to the pandemic he came to the door barefoot and in a shirt that read “Don’t panic”. He’d been buying meat from Uddin for more than 15 years, he said – and before that, from Uddin’s father. So had Anwar’s cousin, a slender man with a long beard who was sitting outside his apartment across the street. He waved and greeted Uddin warmly in Bengali. Both cousins were growing potted plants – tomatoes, peppers – fertilized with manure from Madani Halal.With only minor modifications, the scene resembled a kind of farm-to-table fantasy: the owner of a family business, delivering food and organic waste to customers he knew personally, providing a functioning, affordable alternative to the industrial meat system. Except in this case the participants weren’t virtuous middle-class shoppers, but working immigrants – “the fabric of New York”, Uddin called them afterwards.“They’ve left behind friends and family,” he said. “They work multiple jobs – the jobs Americans don’t want. And at the end of the day they want something that reminds them of home.“Those people are my customers,” he went on. “It disturbs me that people want to take this away.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac37115d26899d62409bee11952af30f564ec7e4/0_175_3424_2054/master/3424.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6faaf9d601dabe2b5b398f511dd0d495","title":"how to find a good rose wine for under eight pounds","story":"From peachy Spaniards to lemony Italians, there’s a wine here to delight every palate. And no, we haven’t forgotten FrancePerhaps the surprise is more that a lot of rosé – especially the fashionably pale Provençal style – isn’t cheap. The average spend at Waitrose is £8.16 a bottle, more than for other still wines. So what can you get for under that?I had to plough through a fair number to kiss my prince, but there are some good buys under £8, and not just those on promotion. True, Provence is a struggle but the rest of southern France can even deliver under £7, as can neighbouring Spain and, occasionally, Italy.\u0026nbspThis peach-coloured Spanish rosé is, surprisingly, also peachy flavoured – almost as if it did have peaches or nectarines in it. Soft, rounded and voluptuous, the wine to sip on a warm afternoon or drink with a fat squidgy burrata.Ignoring the slightly irritating “proudly vegan” labelling, given a lot of wines are suitable for vegans nowadays, this is a satisfyingly characterful rosé. Frutti without being tutti. Brownie points too for some interesting pairings, including fried okra with spices, quinoa salad, and tomato and olive crostini. And, er, vegan in case you hadn’t got the message.The name and slightly girly-looking bottle may put off the brosé brigade (that is, men who drink rosé) but this is a convincing Provence drinkalike – pale, crisp and attractively citrusy. Have a glass with some prawns or smoked salmon.Fruité is the right word for this deep-coloured rosé, which is full of redcurrant and raspberry flavours. Despite the modest alcohol, it is quite gutsy and more of a barbecue than a picnic wine. And proof, at this price, that the Wine Society can and does compete with the supermarkets.You have to go for the mix-six deal to get this Italian rosé for under £8 but you would be mad to buy from Majestic on any other basis. A delicate, pale rosé with a fresh lemony bite that would be perfect with a plate of linguine and prawns with a fresh tomato sauce.\u0026nbsp This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

You can have a go at them while I step outside to work them off… Beaten into the lawn of my back garden, hard against the low wall up from the patio, are two footprints of dying grass. They mark the spot where, five times a week, I have been placing the step block that has become the replacement for my gym habit. I have literally climbed the height of a Himalayan mountain. I now view that murdered lawn as a visual sign of my atonement. Because the furious activity outside the door to the kitchen has been matched by my activity in it. I have cooked things I normally would avoid.\u0026nbspI eat them here, and work them off there. The outcome is that I have nailed three key dishes. And so, as a public service, and not in any way as a feeble justification for my outrageous kitchen habits, I shall now share them with you.First up, the oven chip, forever the sad relation of the proper deep-fried item, lacking in crispness outside, fluffiness inside and hope. They are a reminder of what you’re not eating. Here’s the solution. Cut the potatoes into chips. Cook in salted boiling water until almost done. Drain, and spread them out on kitchen paper on a tray in the fridge for at least two hours. When you’re ready, put the oven to at least 220Cgas mark 7 and put an oven tray in there with close to a centimetre of vegetable oil for about 15 minutes until it’s smoking. Introduce fridge cold chips to very hot oil. Turn them every 10 minutes until chip heaven is achieved. It should take about 45 minutes. Drain on kitchen paper. Sprinkle with sea salt. Eat them. Thank me.Onwards. One day, about 3pm, my neighbour Marc texted me a picture of pork belly with gloriously crackled skin. I was baffled. He was working from home. Was he about to have lunch? Nope. He had roasted it on high for 40 minutes and wanted me to admire it. That was followed by nearly three hours on 130Cgas mark ¾ and 15 more minutes back on high. Finally, he rested it under foil for an hour. He sent me pictures all the way through. I later tried this method and sent him pictures. In lockdown I have been exchanging pictures of roast pork with my neighbour. If you cook pork belly this way you too will send pictures to your loved ones. It’s that good: perfect crackling, soft collapsing meat. Thank me again. Or thank Marc.Finally, I have discovered that spaghetti should be braised. Yes, really. I made pork meatballs from equal amounts of ground pork and Toulouse sausages pulled from their skins. I seared those in a cast-iron casserole, removed them, and slow cooked an onion in the seasoned fat. I broke up the dry spaghetti and turned it in the onions and fat, before topping up with double the volume of chicken stock from a cube. (So 300g of spaghetti needs 600ml of stock.) I placed the meatballs back on the top and put it in the oven preheated to 180Cgas mark 4, lid on, for about 10 minutes. I took off the lid and returned it to the oven for a further five minutes. I did all this because I was in lockdown and bored. What was the worst that could happen? If it was lousy, I’d make the family sandwiches. It wasn’t lousy. It was gorgeous. The spaghetti soaked up all the stock and became a rich buttery tangle, but still with bite. Thank me one final time. There you go: chips, pork belly, spaghetti. That’s at least two key food groups covered. The good ones. This is my gift to you from lockdown. Now do excuse me. There’s a step block requiring my attention.Jay will post pictures of these triumphs to his Instagram account: @jayrayner1"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0afdda0eeb7980edac26cab0b14c73f041c48ca4/130_0_3824_2296/master/3824.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=502486e0ba66f0146acd04b3c9400c85","title":"football fans premier league return","story":"It was not the best night for Hawk-Eye or David Luiz.

The camera moved to show an Asian man before zooming in on a bottle of antiseptic handwash.“I feel very, very sorry that Dele is not playing,” Mourinho said. “He’s a player that works so, so hard during all this period and he’s really frustrated that he cannot play the first match. I don’t think he deserves a one-match ban compared with wrong behaviours at much bigger dimensions that happened during this period without any consequences.“I don’t like these kind of contradictions. It’s for everybody or it’s for nobody and it’s quite unfair for a kid who made a mistake and apologised for it … I really don’t agree with it.”Mourinho was asked to name who he was thinking about in terms of people who had broken the lockdown rules and he brought up his own breach – when he was pictured with the Spurs midfielder Tanguy Ndombele on a common in north London, together with a couple of other men. At that point, people were permitted to exercise outdoors only with members of their own household.The manager said he had “spent two minutes” with Ndombele, “nothing more than that”, trying to teach him how to use the “wifi GPS” vests with which the club monitor player performance.“The pictures taken in the park of me speaking with a little group of young men … they were not my players, they were players from a Championship club. I was there at the right distance having a little talk with them and the pictures gave the idea I was with my players, which was not true. It was still a mistake.”Mourinho is waiting to hear whether he will lose another player to suspension with an FA panel still to rule on Eric Dier’s charge for entering the stands after the FA Cup penalty shootout loss at home to Norwich on 4 March. Dier wanted to confront an abusive fan who had become embroiled in an argument with his youngest brother. The FA has given no updates and, in the meantime, Dier is expected to start in central defence against United alongside Toby Alderweireld.Mourinho said Harry Kane, Son Heung-min and Moussa Sissoko would start against United after recovering fitness but there is a doubt over Giovani Lo Celso, who had a groin injury before the shutdown.Mourinho discussed the stark reality of Spurs’s financial situation, acknowledging how clubs such as United and Chelsea were effectively operating in different markets. “We are going, as always, to be very balanced,” Mourinho said. “But I expect us to do some little important things … to improve in two or three positions.”Jan Vertonghen, who is out of contract on 30 June, is expected to sign a short-term extension to keep him at the club for the final matches of the season, before leaving for Italy or Spain."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a054c61c5dfec9fa02cd355aa60302dc81b9a8f0/777_0_6114_3670/master/6114.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0c6f497cf1ea4429bbdf26e8d73842ea","title":"a night at eibar where the best seats are well in the house la liga sid lowe","story":"On Indalecio Ojanguren street are two blocks of flats that tower over Ipurua, meaning fans still got to watch the actionA small boy was waiting for the two buses carrying Athletic Club’s players as they turned the corner and edged up the hill towards Ipurua. When they pulled over outside, he clambered down from a grass bank and on to his dad’s shoulders for a glimpse of his idols that neither he nor anyone else was going to get inside. Just across the road, a couple of people had gathered by the gravel bowling court sheltered under the AP8 motorway as it thunders past the ground. And down at Bar Terraza, where framed Eibar shirts line the wall, four people played cards at a table in the corner. Meanwhile, outside the bar next door two kids in green Eibar kits kicked a ball against a wall where a banner had been hung reading: “Football – fans  nothing.”And that was pretty much that.In the buildup to Wednesday’s Basque derby between Eibar and Athletic, the club handed out almost 400 flags to be hung from balconies, houses and shops around town, and there was a lot of blue and red around. But while the place was all dressed up, it had nowhere to go. Likewise, an hour before kick-off the siren from the old Alfa factory rang out but rang hollow. It was a call to work before, to footballing arms now, yet there was no battle to go to, no place to be. On the biggest day of the year, the stadium remained closed to supporters even the shop did, prohibited from opening on match day.“This should have been played in March, the ground would have been full and the whole town would have been a party,” Eibar’s CEO told El Correo. Instead it was quiet, even in bars and supporters’ clubs. For the second time this season, but not the last, Eibar played behind closed doors and it couldn’t have happened for worse games: the derby against Real Sociedad, postponed after the collapse of a landfill in nearby Zaldibar, and now Athletic. Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen https:audio.guim20200519-55307-gnl.fsof.200520.jf.MUGala1993.mp3 This was important: Athletic were chasing their diminishing hopes of Europe, while Eibar had slipped within two points of relegation. It was also supposed to be special for the town and the two managers, close friends. Athletic’s Gaizka Garitano is the coach who first took Eibar to primera – where, miraculously, they have resided since – and the player who almost took them there a decade before under the club’s current manager and his opponent José Luis Mendilíbar.Mendilíbar has been Athletic manager as well and the men, both Basque, understood better than most what was missing. “The people are irreplaceable in football you can take everything out but not them,” Garitano had said. “It’s not the same without fans,” Mendilíbar insisted.And yet this was actually the only game in Spain’s top flight where there were some fans. There could have been 377,759 fans watching Week 29 live in the end, maybe 100 did, and all of them were watching Eibar and Athletic draw 2-2 where the best seats in the house were, well, in the house.On Indalecio Ojanguren street, No 1 and No 2, are two blocks of flats that tower over the stand at Ipurua, barely seven or eight metres back from the touchline. There are 15 floors and all the way up the side are small balconies, maybe three metres across and mostly packed with people – and ham, wine and tortilla – from where flags hang and where you see everything, the stadium settled deep in the Ego valley. From where, in the silence, you hear everything too, starting with the curious combination of Nellie The Elephant and Darude’s Sandstorm, and ending with Mendilíbar sent off for something he said. It is, says El País, the nearest thing to a real game in these strange days. “VIP boxes,” Diario Vasco calls them.From the 14th floor, looking down vertically over the pitch, the view couldn’t be better – a real-life tactics cam. Only when the ball goes up in the air, seeming to head straight towards you and when the VAR intervenes is the view anything less than perfect. Looking straight down, beyond the hands poking out of the balconies like condemned men behind bars on a prison row, patterns appear clearly. The derby is always a game that’s “dog faced”, says Mendilíbar, who clearly hasn’t met the right dogs, and there’s some of that: it’s tough and it’s intense. But there’s more too, an enjoyable game unfolding below.As the players come out, there is applause from above. Some look up and wave. The anthem plays and there’s a minute’s silence. Then the game starts with Marko Dimitrovic making an early save that’s just as astonishing when it’s watched back later, applause from every floor. There are shouts and laments, appeals too. Everyone does their bit. A lorry hammers past on the AP8 and, seeing the ground below, beeps out its support. It’s not long before another one does the same, and another. Below the flyover, there are four goals: one scored with a nose, another with a knee and two from the spot thanks to VAR, only the system’s not working for one of them so they have to find referee Prieto Iglesias another screen.The first one happens early, just eight minutes in. As Prieto Iglesias returns signalling, someone on the floor below figuratively “shits on the milk”, then mutters something about his mother which only intensifies when Raúl García scores to put Athletic in front. Kike García equalises on 19 minutes, running face-first into a cross, blood seeping from his nostrils as he celebrates. Athletic’s impressive start is forgotten. From wide, Eibar bend balls into the box, one after the other, and Garitano gets increasingly agitated. “Hostia!” he shouts, voice ringing round the valley, frantically pointing forwards. But as the second half progresses Eibar have his team “bottled in”, just as he warned they might.“We spent pretty much the whole of the second half in their area,” says a broken-looking José Ángel “Cote” afterwards and he’s not far off. Fabian Orellana, Pedro Leon and Sergi Enrich get closer, the shots racking up: 12 by the end. And with 12 minutes left Escalante tumbles, pulled by Dani García. “Penalty!” Indalecio Ojanguren street shouts, sending Prieto Iglesias off to see from down there what everyone saw up there. The delay is long but eventually he agrees. Orellana scores and Eibar lead, stepping further from the bottom three, just not for long.“We should have seen it out,” says Kike García afterwards, but they can’t. Within three minutes, Iñaki Williams clatters into Dimitrovic but the move is allowed to go on, finally ending with Asier Villalibre given a free path to knee in the cross. “It wasn’t even that hard to defend,” Cote complains later “foul!” everyone complains now, but the complaints go unheard. Still Eibar press. Some would have accepted a draw before, but not like this. And in the 96th minute, Quique García, only on the pitch for four minutes, gets the chance to win it deep in Athletic’s area. The shot, though, skids just wide, a “Gah!” heading down the building.Eibar have picked up twice as many points at home than they have away, but things may be different now: those two derbies behind closed doors have brought them a single point. Way down below, the players embrace. Up on the balconies, the only supporters to watch football anywhere in Spain applaud before turning round and heading back into their homes.• Kindness and hospitality wonderfully expressed in a conversation, a single phrase: “Do I need to bring anything?” “All you need to bring is hunger.” Eskerrik asko.• Atlético Madrid scored almost a third of their away goals in a single night. Mind you, El Sadar without fans isn’t really El Sadar and Osasuna without El Sadar really isn’t Osasuna. Still, this 5-0 win was impressive – and unexpected – from Atlético. Especially João Félix and Marcos Llorente, the man who now has a dog called Anfield, after that night. The last time anything was real.• Martin Braithwaite sat on the bench as his new teammates unsurprisingly defeated his former Leganés ones 2-0, although they were made to struggle more than most anticipated. If you thought the emergency signing rule didn’t make much sense when Barcelona bought Braithwaite, how about this: Celta have just signed Nolito back as an emergency replacement because of an injury to … a goalkeeper.• Goodbye Rubi Tuesday? Not this Tuesday, anyway. The week’s craziest game finished 2-2 between Betis and Granada, with a wild finale where Betis turned it round late and then lost their lead again. Rubi, on the ropes, survived … just. But Betis haven’t made a secret of the fact they’ll pull the trigger as soon as they can."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4236fa14930ddf2de650188ae86c7a1e9d60235b/0_178_7819_4692/master/7819.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d5b325f7d5c989d7aea435def2d5f6d4","title":"covid clearout charity shop lockdown coronavirus scope communities","story":"Many of us have missed the likes of Scope just as much as Primark or John Lewis. We spend a day with happily returning customers, donors and staffThere’s a new purple wheelie bin on Walthamstow High Street in north-east London, outside No 210, and it’s filling up fast. Michael Armstrong and Louise Craven have just put a bag of books in. “We’ve got several bags from lockdown tidying and we’re going to bring it in one bag at a time,” says Michael. He doesn’t sound like he’s from north-east London. Because he isn’t – he’s originally from California. He came here 40 years ago, “for the weather”, says Craven, his partner, drolly.Her irony maybe backfires a little today. It’s a glorious day in Walthamstow – the high street is pretty much Sunset Boulevard minus the palms.Among the books is what Armstrong describes as “some rather odd poetry journals”, a study of American architecture and The Glass Room by Simon Mawer, which they have both read and recommend.They’re not getting thrown away but recycled, hopefully reread. Because No 210, set between a betting shop and a fish bar, is a charity shop belonging to Scope, the national disability charity. This week, like other non-essential retailers, charity shops in England were able to open for the first time in almost three months, to customers and for donations.Another bag goes into the purple bin. This one contains a brown jacket from Ben Odamtten, who says it’s too small for him. There’s also a card holder and two pairs of shades in his bag. And I have donated a couple of bags, mostly of outgrown children’s clothes. I wanted to bring the popcorn machine, too, but my family wouldn’t let me. No one needs a popcorn machine.Scope’s area manager, Lara Woolston, explains the new process. Donations go from the purple bin into heavy-duty bin bags, which are labelled with the date, tied up with giant rubber bands, taken to a room above the store and left for 72 hours to minimise any risk of infection. Safety of staff, volunteers and customers is Scope’s priority, I’m told, often.The acting shop manager, Celia Mullins, is up here, busy clearing out bays that can be filled in date order. Quarantine for donated clothes, books, CDs, sunglasses etc is going to be stricter and better organised than it is for arrivals at UK airports. There’s already a lot of stuff up here, but if it fills up there is an overflow storage unit in Barking.They have done a lot on the shop floor, too, putting in all the necessary safety measures. It has all been unmuddled and decluttered the rummage boxes – with things, such as toys, that kids would play with – have been removed from the floor. “We’re trying to limit the number of times people need to touch things,” says Woolston.Fitting room? Not any more – it’s taped off like a crime scene. Buy it if it doesn’t fit, bring it back. And there’s a one-way system, with arrows on the floor, plus “sneeze screens” at the tills. Customers are offered hand sanitiser along with a mask and gloves on entering. “It’s been a long time since we’ve been able to welcome our wonderful community through our doors,” says Woolston. For the moment though, they are only allowing one person – or one family – in at a time.It’s the same story across the whole sector: the pandemic makes no allowances for good causes. The chancellor Rishi Sunak’s £750m bailout fund for charities didn’t come close to replacing lost income, not just because of shops being closed but also because of the cancellation of other means of fundraising – the London Marathon and the Great North Run to name two massive ones. Street-funding, too, as well as the possibility that people are more likely to give to NHS charities at the moment. A study published last week found that one in 10 charities faces bankruptcy by the end of the year as they struggle with a £10bn shortfall caused by a perfect storm of massive income reduction and rocketing demand for their services. “It’s been a devastating loss of income,” Scope’s head of retail, Debbie Boylen, tells me over the phone. “Because it’s been at a time when disabled people need us the most.”I could have spent the morning at any charity shop and the picture would have been similar. I’ve come to Scope simply because it’s where we usually bring stuff to. That said, my local branch isn’t among the first wave of 16 shops around the country opening as lockdown eases, so I’ve travelled across London. Hence just the two bags: there’s plenty more to come at home, under the stairs, from our own Covid clearout. Boylen thinks it’s not just us. “Everybody I speak to is saying the same, that they’ve been clearing out cupboards and wardrobes over the past few months.”Each bag is worth, on average, £20 to Scope 81 bags would, for example, allow it to run its Parents Connect support programme, for parents and carers of young disabled people in Leeds, for a week.The bin is soon full, the contents bagged up and taken up to Mullins to be placed in quarantine. This system for dropping stuff doesn’t allow gift aid to be claimed for donations, says Woolston, so they miss out on that, but it’s unavoidable with the only-one-in-the-shop policy. That may be relaxed, but for now gift aid donors can’t be expected to queue.As well as the purple wheelie bin, that’s the other new thing outside No 210: a queue. Beautifully spaced, orderly, patient, not as long as the ones outside Asda and Lidl down the street but undeniably a queue. It seems the appetite not just to donate but to shop in charity shops is alive and well. “I’ve missed it,” says Shahnaz Khan, one of the first people in. “You can get so many nice things from here, and the people are very nice.” She comes out with a pink handbag.Alan Donoghue, who used to work here and is queuing on a mobility scooter, says it’s a good way to pass the morning. “It does you good mentally, and also sometimes there might be stuff that you want.” He’s not after anything specific, though he’s always on the look out for tea towels, fridge magnets and commemorative plates.Is anyone here for something specific, Woolston asks the queue. “Tennis racket,” says a man named Mike Anderson. He tells me he’s started playing a bit in order to start seeing people. He has been borrowing his friend’s girlfriend’s racket but now is the time to take responsibility. Two minutes later, Woolston is back out of the shop with a choice of two: Anderson opts for the more expensive, a Slazenger for a fiver. The deal is done on the street. “Probably illegally,” laughs Woolston.Anderson is chuffed enough with his purchase. “Charity shop, so, you know, standards are slightly lower,” he says. “But it looks lovely, it’s got its own cover if anybody saw me walking towards a tennis court they would think I was going to play tennis, which is half the battle won, isn’t it?”Nina Bright doesn’t shop anywhere but charity shops, except for socks and underwear. So she hasn’t bought any clothes for three months. She’s just happy to be out looking and isn’t bothered about the queue. “It’s fine – I’ve got nothing else to do,” she says. Nor is she bothered that, once she does get inside the shop, she doesn’t find anything to buy. She dismisses it as “the lottery of thrifting”.Maybe Odion Edgal will be more successful. She’s on the hunt for books she ran out over lockdown. “I miss books a lot – I need something to read.” She finds something – not Armstrong and Craven’s odd poetry journals or American Architecture, but Camp David, David Walliams’s 2012 autobiography. For £2. “That’s why I come – I can’t afford to go to Waterstones.”There have been 56 bags of donations in Walthamstow. Not quite enough for a week of Parents Connect, unless there are some treasures in there – a Mulberry handbag perhaps – and Woolston and Mullins won’t know for another couple of days, when they can open up the bags. Maybe those poetry journals will turn out to be rare treasures and can be sold at auction for millions. Maybe.It’s going to pick up further as more charity shops open and people realise this, and then get their acts together to get down there. I know of several bags destined for a purple bin in the near future one of them might just have a kitchen gadget snuck in there. Maybe someone does need a popcorn maker – just not me."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee4e8a2e87ee7a4e4b170ca03bdcbe702f95afba/0_44_4194_2519/master/4194.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3d2e3846079ee0893d89fdf12d1a43a8","title":"michael collins michael mchale review wigmore hall clarinet","story":"Wigmore HallBBC Radio 3The clarinet’s turn to shine in these online recitals brought familiar works sprinkled with rarities, such as Saint-Saëns’ Clarinet Sonata, in a finely balanced performanceThere might be no harps or harpsichords, trumpets or trombones, but woodwind instruments have been respectably represented in the Wigmore Hall’s current lunchtime series. After the recitals by the oboist Nicholas Daniel and flautist Adam Walker came clarinettist Michael Collins, who was partnered by Michael McHale in Saint-Saëns, Weber and Poulenc.There was nothing particularly adventurous in their programme, but the Saint-Saëns’ Clarinet Sonata, at least, was a rarity – a late work, composed in 1921, the last year of his life. It’s typically fluent and generally good-humoured, apart from a sombre slow movement in the unusual key of E flat minor, whose opening seems so growlingly pictorial it could almost have been a movement Saint-Saëns had left out of his Carnival of the Animals.Collins gave it a fabulously sleek and stylish performance, and he delivered one of the flashy staples of the clarinettist’s repertoire, Weber’s Grand Duo Concertant, with the same easy aplomb. Poulenc’s Clarinet Sonata, another late work, with more than a family likeness to his sonata for flute, which Walker had played the previous week, has rather more depth – it’s dedicated to the memory of the composer Arthur Honegger, and the delicate central Romanza seems very much personal remembrance. This performance got its bittersweet balance exactly right, but never forgot that there’s always a bit of twinkle in Poulenc’s musical eye.• Available on BBC Sounds and Wigmore Hall Live Stream.

He replied: “Do you know what? I understand this sense of frustration, of restlessness, which is driving the Black Lives Matter movement.“I’ve got say, on this take the knee thing – which, I don’t know, maybe it’s got a broader history but it seems to be taken from the Game of Thrones – feels to me like a symbol of subjugation and subordination, rather than one of liberation and emancipation. But I understand people feel differently about it, so it’s a matter of personal choice.”The comment brought criticism from other MPs. David Lammy, the shadow justice secretary, tweeted: “This is not just insulting to the Black Lives Matter movement, it is deeply embarrassing for Dominic Raab. He is supposed to be the foreign secretary of the United Kingdom.”Diane Abbott, a former shadow home secretary, said: “‘Taking the knee began in 2016 with American athletes refusing to stand for US national anthem. They were protesting police brutality and racism. But Dominic Raab thinks it comes from Game of Thrones!!!”Ed Davey, the acting Liberal Democrats leader, told the BBC that Raab should offer “a fulsome apology”, adding that the comments “show the foreign secretary doesn’t really have a grasp of a key global movement”.Anne Soubry, the former Conservative MP, tweeted that Raab was “an embarrassment to our country and the party I used to be proud to be a member of”.The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, is among those in the UK who have adopted the pose. Some police officers have also done so at protests, and Premier League footballers and officials took the knee on Wednesday before the first games since the pause in the season caused by coronavirus.The use of taking a knee began in 2016 when Kaepernick, then a quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers, opted to sit on the team bench rather than stand for the pre-NFL game rendition of the US national anthem, in protest against racism and police brutality.Kaepernick, who was joined by other players, later decided to pose on one knee, saying this made the same point while showing more respect to military veterans. Among those he took advice from was Nate Boyer, a former Green Beret who also played in the NFL.Kaepernick’s actions led him to be frozen out of professional sport, and he was criticised by Donald Trump among others. Following the recent BLM protests, he could now return to the NFL, with even Trump saying this would not be a problem for him.Raab, when asked whether he would take the knee to show solidarity with BLM, said: “I’d take the knee for two people: the Queen and the Mrs when I asked her to marry me.”On the subject of his wife he added: “By the way, she disputes that. I had this conversation with her last night. I’m sure I did, but we’d obviously had too much champagne at the time. But I’m certain I did.”Responding later on Twitter, Raab said: “To be clear: I have full respect for the Black Lives Matter movement and the issues driving them. If people wish to take a knee, that’s their choice and I respect it. We all need to come together to tackle any discrimination and social injustice.”Boris Johnson’s spokesman said the prime minister had no comment on the issue. “The foreign secretary was very clear he was expressing a personal opinion, and he has tweeted about it,” he said.Raab’s Game of Thrones theory is not the first time he has expressed unusual views. In 2018, as Brexit secretary, he prompted criticism and some mockery for saying he had only recently appreciated the importance of the Dover-Calais crossing for UK trade."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/908181c3ed5f0c96e68487b2d226b0febc989d0e/0_317_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dc61c6c1313f3a6ac36d02ebef436349","title":"dysfunctional toxic culture led to labour defeat major report finds","story":"Exclusive: party has mountain to climb to return to power, says Labour Together reviewLabour has a “mountain to climb” if it is to get back into power, according to a major review of the 2019 general election defeat, which paints a picture of dysfunctionality, toxicity and drift inside the party’s election-fighting machine.Negative perceptions of Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership, doubts about the manifesto and the party’s ambivalent Brexit stance reinforced each other in a “snowballing” effect to deliver December’s catastrophic result, the 150-page report by the party group Labour Together argues. However, it was also the product of two decades of demographic and political change that hit the party’s traditional base, and could endanger more Labour seats in 2024.“Labour’s electoral coalition had been fracturing for a long time and was broken in 2019. We were rejected by many of the communities we were founded to represent,” says the report, seen by the . “We lost all types of voters everywhere compared with 2017, except in London.”Using interviews with senior party figures, as well as previously unpublished polling and new analysis, the report identifies significant shortcomings in the election campaign, which followed 18 months of debilitating parliamentary wrangles over Brexit.• Labour “went into the 2019 election without a clear strategy of which voters we needed to persuade or how”, and failed to settle on a coherent message with the power of 2017’s “For the many, not the few”.• “It was unclear who was in charge” of the election campaign, and relationships were soured by years of infighting which had created a “toxic culture” and “significant strategic and operational dysfunction”.• Labour was outgunned by the Tories in the digital war, with messages poorly coordinated and most of them failing to reach beyond the party’s base.• Helped by their clear “Get Brexit done” message, the Conservatives succeeded in turning out 2 million previous non-voters, accounting for two thirds of the increase in their vote share.• Labour’s seat targeting was “unrealistic” and “not evidence-based”, and many candidates felt they did not receive enough support from the national party.Labour Together was set up to unite MPs and activists from different traditions, a number of whom – including the former leader Ed Miliband, Steve Reed, Lisa Nandy and Jim McMahon – have been given prominent roles in the shadow cabinet of Corbyn’s successor, Keir Starmer.The 2019 Election Review was prepared by a 15-strong panel of commissioners, including Miliband, the Manchester Central MP, Lucy Powell, James Meadway, who advised the former shadow chancellor John McDonnell, and the Birmingham Ladywood MP, Shabana Mahmood.They find that Corbyn’s leadership was a “significant factor” in the 2019 result. His public approval ratings collapsed at around the time a group of Labour MPs including Luciana Berger and Chuka Umunna left to found the Independent Group, citing antisemitism within Labour and its Brexit policy.The report says: “‘Stop Jeremy Corbyn’ was a major driver of the Conservatives’ success across all their key groups including previous non-voters, and among all the swing voters Labour lost to the Tories.”Had Corbyn been as popular in December as he was two years earlier, Labour’s vote share could have been 6 percentage points higher, the analysis finds.When it came to Labour’s radical manifesto, launched at an upbeat rally in Birmingham, the analysis found that inidual policies were popular, but doubts about the leadership stoked a perception that the package as a whole was not deliverable.A Datapraxis analysis of YouGov data found that “many came to the conclusion that the manifesto as a whole was unrealistic, risky and unlikely to be delivered. This undermined the positive response to inidual policies, making them seem less credible.”It shows that 2017’s better-than-expected performance masked the fact that Labour’s vote share had continued to decline in a string of heartland seats – many of which the party went on to lose to the Conservatives two years later.“Despite now representing fewer constituencies than at any time since 1935, Labour cannot afford to be complacent about the seats it currently holds,” the report says.And if Labour fails to “reverse its fortunes in Scotland in a significant way” it will have to win a swath of English seats, right up to Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg’s in North East Somerset, to secure a majority.Starmer, who became Labour leader in April, has so far announced few new policies, instead focusing on strongly criticising aspects of the government’s coronavirus pandemic response.The forward-looking section of the Labour Together review is based partly on a “coalition-building” workshop, bringing together “urban remainers” from London and Manchester, and leavers from towns in Lancashire and Yorkshire.Carried out by the consultancy firm Britain Thinks, the exercise identified common ground, including a “strong and unifying desire for economic transformation of their lives”.“This was particularly notable in relation to issues which affect their personal security and lives issues ranging from social housing and rent controls, to decent pay and living standards, as well as significant investment in their local infrastructure and amenities, like high streets, town centres and decent employers,” the report says.It recommends that Labour focus on trying to build a coalition around the idea of transformational economic change rooted in voters’ own lives and problems, and combine this with rebuilding “trust and credibility” in the party.“We believe there is a way ahead for Labour to win the next election, but the road is hard and the journey will not be easy,” it concludes. Starmer and Labour’s new general secretary, David Evans, are expected to pay close attention to the report.Allies of Corbyn insist Brexit – not his leadership – was the overriding factor behind the election result, and lay some of the blame at Starmer’s door for pushing the party towards a pro-referendum position. They are irked that the report’s authors did not interview several key figures, including party directors Karie Murphy and Seumas Milne, the former general secretary Jenny Formby, and Corbyn himself.Jon Trickett and Ian Lavery, the two most outspoken proponents of Brexit in Corbyn’s deeply ided top team, said: “Let’s be clear, people lost trust in Labour after failing to deliver change after 13 years in government. This was brought to a head when the party ignored the democratic vote for Brexit it was the excuse that allowed loyal Labour voters to finally break with a party they felt had been ignoring them for far too long.“Time and time again we warned the shadow cabinet that yielding to the pressures for the party to become more pro-remain and supportive of a second referendum would inflict damage on Labour’s election chances.”A Labour spokesperson said: “We thank everyone who contributed to this independent report. Its attempt to understand the challenges and opportunities facing the Labour party is welcome and we will read it carefully. By harnessing our collective skills and energy we will build a party and a movement that wins again.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f36a8b4ece836161a7672b3ce57b666d539e142/785_808_5879_3528/master/5879.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d32726dd38f6136d26d32ac501f853ba","title":"radical proposals in lib dem policy review suggest shift to the left","story":"Free broadband among ideas in Build Back Better, edited by leadership hopeful Layla MoranThe Liberal Democrats could make a decisive shift to the centre left, shedding the final legacies from the party’s period in coalition, under a review of policy ideas overseen by the leadership hopeful Layla Moran.A new booklet, Build Back Better, edited by the MP, is billed as a modern equivalent to the Orange Book, a 2004 collection of essays from Lib Dem figures – including the former leaders Nick Clegg and Vince Cable, and former cabinet minister David Laws – which pushed the party towards a centre-right, markets-based stance.In contrast, Build Back Better, with contributions from more than 40 Lib Dem MPs, members and supporters, includes essays advocating ideas such as a universal basic income, free broadband, and commandeering private health resources to clear a backlog of NHS operations caused by coronavirus.Many of the contributors to the Orange Book went on to serve in the 2010-15 coalition with the Conservatives, a period followed by three generally disastrous elections for the Lib Dems.Moran, the Oxford West MP and education spokeswoman, is seen as the joint favourite to win the party leadership battle, alongside Ed Davey, the interim leader.Davey contributed to the Orange Book and took part in the coalition, and while he has unveiled radical plans of his own, such as a £150bn investment in the green economy, Moran is keen to place herself as the choice of the party’s centre-left.The third confirmed contender is the Bath MP Wera Hobhouse, who is seen as an outsider.Work on the book – which does not form part of Moran’s leadership bid – began two months ago, when the leadership race was postponed because of the coronavirus crisis. The competition has since resumed, with a new leader due to be announced in August. Many of the contributors, who include Cable, are remaining neutral on who they support.Moran said the book was devised to define the party’s “liberal response to coronavirus, so I didn’t really think in terms of positioning”. However, she added, a common theme emerged: “What it shows is we are a party of the centre left – that is where our beating heart lies.”This amounted to a move away from the ideas of the coalition, Moran said, lamenting what she called an overly slow evolution of ideas in the following period.“I think we need to send a signal to both other parties and to the electorate that we are moving on from not just coalition but the last five years,” she said. “It’s very clear that at the next election the positioning is going to have to be to take seats off the Tories. That’s the obvious thing.”She said the Orange Book was seen as a concerted shift to the centre-right. “When people read this, they’ll see it’s a shift to the centre-left. It didn’t set out that way, but it seems to have been the natural response of party members who are writing.”Several essays are about a green recovery from the impact of coronavirus, with Cable arguing for a new and more ambitious green investment bank. Others tackle the rise of technology and the idea of a digital bill of rights.One essay, by a former councillor, Paul Noblet, calls for not just a universal basic income, but universal free services, such as broadband, water and energy.Moran stressed that while the ideas were some way from becoming party policy, she hoped the review would bring a boost to the process of rethinking what the party stands for."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6f3bbce794d03ad12996c7729d4a1ceb21b96333/1302_1181_9703_5824/master/9703.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2c98bbfc7abce133c1694934fc599f0c","title":"can sharing a family playlist bring harmony at home","story":"Spending quality time with her partner and kids, Kala Paul-Worika uses Spotify Premium’s Family streaming feature and gets everyone singing along to the same playlistThere’s rarely a day that passes without music being played in our household. It’s the backdrop to everything from Saturday-morning pancakes to extended family get-togethers.\u0026nbspI grew up with my Nigerian parents, listening to a mix of jazz-infused African highlife, UB40 and Madonna. Along with my sisters and brothers, I loved to go through my dad’s vinyl collection in the living-room cabinet – while Stevie Wonder’s Happy Birthday would be pulled out for every anniversary celebration.My husband and I met dancing in a West End bar to 90s R\u0026ampB – think Faith Evans, Blackstreet, Puff DaddyDiddy and Ginuwine, interspersed with a touch of house, dancehall and reggae. Yep.So it was more than interesting to spend the week using Spotify’s Premium Family plan, where our music tastes and those of our two children could come together on the exclusive Family Mix feature.With the Premium Family subscription you can have up to six Premium accounts for family members living at the same address.The Family Mix then picks a selection of songs and genres that anyone on the plan has listened to, and creates a playlist.To a certain extent, my Jamaican husband and I have similar tastes when it comes to music – he will basically listen to anything with a reggae “riddim” put over it – whether it’s Beenie Man, Celine Dion or Westlife.But alongside the likes of Whitney Houston, Boyz II Men and Mark Ronson, a few surprises did pop up and I couldn’t help but wonder if there was a hidden message he was trying to convey. Like most people, the type of music I listen to depends on my mood, so when the Family Mix revealed hubby had been listening to You Win Again by the Bee Gees, I couldn’t help but smile, taking it that he had conceded defeat after a recent disagreement.\u0026nbspThe last time I played the Bee Gees to my daughter, she was six and it was less How Deep Is Your Love and more Tragedy. Their infamous high-pitched singing style did not sit well with her and she recoiled in horror asking: “What is that?”, followed by “Make it stop!”She’s now the grand old age of 10 and teetering on the edge of that weird “not quite a teenager but I want to give you the attitude of one” stage. Luckily, this time around, she had less of a profound reaction and allowed the song to play until the end.Her personal taste in music is the result of a mix of influences: her peers, favourite YouTubers and what’s popular on the online interactive gaming app, Roblox. Being younger than 13, I’m still choosing the songs for her on my profile, and that definitely came in handy when she attempted to add some of Melanie Martinez’s more unsavoury-themed songs to her playlist. Whatever she does choose still feeds into the Family Mix, so nothing is lost from her sharing my account.My youngest recently turned three, and we had a little boogie to the Family Mix in the dining room as he enjoyed his birthday breakfast. The planned barbecue was put on hold thanks to the good old British weather, but we still managed to enjoy ourselves. The Family Mix was in full flow, throwing up hits from Destiny’s Child, Janet Jackson, 112, Ariana Grande, Anne-Marie and Years \u0026amp Years – a mix of old-school classics which my tweenager enjoyed, and some more current hits for her to sing along to at the top of her voice.She always fails to reign in her surprise at seeing me singing along to artists of the moment like Billie Eilish. I mean, as her mum, I couldn’t possibly be that cool, right? We also had fun with the option to change up the tempo of the Family Mix depending on your mood, or the occasion.A moon sign represents the option for a chilled and laid-back selection, then simply tap on the sun for something a little more upbeat and fast-paced – clicking off either takes you back to the standard mix.Our week is up, but you can guarantee we’ll still be tuning in for some family listening.Spotify Premium gives you music without the interruptions.

It prosecuted 661 people for animal abuses and gave out more than 48,000 advice and welfare notices to help owners improve how they care for their animals.“We know this is a really difficult time for our staff and the proposals we are putting forward have not been taken lightly. This is an incredibly challenging time for charities – the current crisis has exacerbated an already difficult financial situation our organisation faces,” the chief executive, Chris Sherwood, said.“We are a large animal charity offering many welfare services for pets, wildlife, farm animals and research animals both here and abroad. We are the only charity with a team of inspectors across England and Wales going out 365 days a year, rescuing animals and then caring for, treating and rehabilitating those animals, sometimes for many months on end, which is incredibly costly.”Charities in the UK lost almost a third of their expected income during the first two months of lockdown, according to the Institute of Fundraising (IoF) and Charity Finance Group (CFG), with donation levels over the year expected to plunge by nearly half as the recession takes hold.Caron Bradshaw, the chief executive of the CFG, said: “This isn’t about the survival of the institution of charity, or inidual charities, but the devastating impact that this will have on those who rely on the services charities provide.”Peter Lewis, the chief executive of the IoF, said: “The government urgently needs to review and enhance its emergency support for charities, with a further bespoke package of support, an extension to the job retention scheme specifically supporting those charitable activities which are still unable to take place, or both.”The survey is broadly in line with an analysis published last week by the charity Pro Bono Economics that estimated a £10bn shortfall for the sector by Christmas.In April, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, announced £750m of extra funding for frontline charities across the UK, a move that was criticised as not going far enough to save many third-sector organisations from collapse."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40fe22cc97619bbf6caaa3b96ef0f6590f8af1f1/553_117_2947_1769/master/2947.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=50e9bdf5ceca3d28009839201f3f7189","title":"two in five uk adults feel lonelier under lockdown finds survey","story":"Two in five adults in the UK feel lonelier under the lockdown amid the tight limits it has placed on social contact, new research has revealed.Survey results by the British Red Cross paint a stark picture of Britain as a society where a substantial minority lack regular face-to-face interaction and feel alone and uncared for.“The coronavirus crisis is exposing how a lack of meaningful connections can increase feelings of loneliness, and many people fear they will become lonelier in the future,” the British Red Cross said.The survey was undertaken by pollsters Opinium between 12 and 15 May, when the full range of lockdown restrictions was still in place.The government has acknowledged that the pandemic has been accompanied by a rise in loneliness. Earlier this week the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport set up a £5m fund to award grants to charities and local groups to tackle the problem.Zoë Abrams, the British Red Cross’s executive director, urged ministers and the NHS to increase the number of people going to see a GP who are offered “social prescribing” rather than drugs or psychological help.It involves people being encouraged to take up new social activities, such as dance, bowls, bingo or gardening as a way of having more social contact. It is widely seen as a useful way of reducing isolation, loneliness and depression.“For many, life before lockdown was lonely already. We want to make sure no one is left behind as restrictions ease,” said Abrams.The survey also found that people from BAME backgrounds, parents, young people, people with long-term health problems and those on low incomes were more likely to feel lonely.Earlier this month the  revealed that scores of people who have died at home during the pandemic have lain undiscovered for up to two weeks.That prompted Prof Martin Marshall, the chair of the Royal College of GPs, to lament the existence of “an epidemic of loneliness” in Britain.Claire Murdoch, NHS England’s national director for mental health, said: “It is vital that people do not undervalue their mental health during this really difficult time, and reaching out to talk to someone is a small gesture that can make a world of difference.

As the 30-year-old has risen to the level of multi-major champion, he has simultaneously discovered his voice. The entertainment level is generally high.Koepka was shooting from the hip again after signing for a four-under-par 67 to open the RBC Heritage in South Carolina. Coverage of the PGA Tour’s spectator-free return has been boosted by some players wearing microphones. Not so Koepka, who replied “I do” when asked if he had thoughts on the concept. He duly let fly.“I don’t understand why they want us to wear a mic when there’s a boom mic that stands 10 feet away from every shot that I hit,” Koepka said. “If the announcers would just shut up and listen, you could hear every word that we’re talking about. I don’t understand what the thing is. Half the time the lady’s holding a boom mic, and she’s listening to everything we’re saying all the way down. If they would just shut up, they could hear everything.”After a sluggish start to 2020, Koepka’s clubs are finally talking again. Yet Koepka finds himself trailing Ian Poulter by three after day one at Hilton Head. The Englishman produced a blemish-free scorecard and back nine of only 31.Poulter’s pandemic approach was interesting. He played only four rounds during the Tour’s 91-day suspension, instead spending his time on detailed range sessions. “I’m not one that plays round after round after round after round to feel that I need to be ready to play golf,” Poulter said.Poulter stopped short of echoing Rory Mcllroy’s stark remarks about European players who have opted not to travel to the US for the PGA Tour’s restart. The world rankings system began with the US events and has triggered controversy. “What’s the right and what’s the wrong thing to do in this scenario when you’ve got 16 of the top 20 players playing here this week?” Poulter asked. “It feels a little unjust to the guys in Europe that aren’t playing, but how can you not have world ranking points in a tournament like this when you’ve got this level of field?”McIlroy admitted to not feeling entirely settled during a round of 72. This marks his first visit to the RBC Heritage site since 2009. “I can remember not being that comfortable around here back then,” the world No 1 said. “It’s still sort of the same. I’m just not comfortable trying to pick lines and really committing to shots. I just wasn’t as committed today as I need to be around here.”Viktor Hovland signed for a 65. Jordan Spieth’s 66 was one for the ages the Texan made a triple bogey on his third hole and played the front nine, his second half, in 29. “I really enjoy playing this golf course,” Spieth said. “It’s one of the cooler courses. I haven’t had necessarily a ton of success but I also haven’t played it very often.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a583b76bf0dab70cbc6a77b9d69b32fb57cf6f8/0_168_4362_2618/master/4362.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7da833cb101d72ec4e40d62b62d049fe","title":"rfu may urge england fans against singing swing low slavery","story":"The Rugby Football Union is conducting a review into the singing of Swing Low, Sweet Chariot by England supporters, admitting that many of them are unaware of its origins as a song about slavery.England fans have previously been criticised for “cross-cultural appropriation of a US slave song” by academics, and the Black Lives Matter movement has brought renewed focus on its airing at Twickenham and matches abroad.Maro Itoje recently described the background of the song as “complicated” and the RFU – aware that the lyrics are plastered all over Twickenham – is set to take action. The union told the  it is reviewing the song’s “historical context” and acknowledged the need to educate supporters.The RFU did not rule out urging supporters not to sing the song altogether at a time when institutions in England with historical links to slavery are coming under increasing pressure to act.Sell-out crowds will not return to Twickenham in the short term but the RFU’s chief executive, Bill Sweeney, is optimistic England could host up to 40,000 fans this autumn if the government relaxes its physical distancing rule to one metre.An RFU spokesperson said: “The RFU has stated we need to do more to achieve ersity and we are determined to accelerate change and grow awareness. The Swing Low, Sweet Chariot song has long been part of the culture of rugby and is sung by many who have no awareness of its origins or sensitivities. We are reviewing its historical context and our role in educating fans to make informed decisions.”It is believed the song was first sung at Twickenham when Martin “Chariots” Offiah was playing in the 1987 Middlesex Sevens tournament. The following year it became a popular refrain among England supporters when Chris Oti scored a hat-trick against Ireland. The song’s origins are rooted in US slavery however and it is believed to have been written by the American slave Wallace Willis around the 1860s.England players have often spoken of the lift they get from the crowd when Swing Low, Sweet Chariot echoes around the stadium and supporters were urged to sing it during the haka when England last hosted New Zealand in November 2018. During his time as national captain, however, Dylan Hartley admitted he was unaware of the song’s origins and a number of other England players have said the same.This week Sweeney vowed to increase ersity within the RFU following the appointment of Genevieve Glover as chair of the union’s ersity and inclusion implementation working group. There has never been a black member of the RFU’s 14-strong board and of the 55 council members only Maggie Alphonsi is black. “We have undertaken some very good initiatives at the grassroots level to encourage more erse participation however, that in itself is not enough,” said Sweeney. “We need to do more to achieve ersity across all areas of the game including administration.”The RFU was also one of a number of sporting bodies to sign a statement pledging a commitment to tackling inequality within sport. “The appalling death of George Floyd, the global protests that have followed and the powerful message of the Black Lives Matter movement has made every section of society take notice and confront an ugly truth,” said the statement.“Systemic change must be made at all levels so that we can become truly reflective of our wonderfully erse society. We can no longer rely on black role models at the elite level speaking out, we must join together to become better and to support every member of the sport and recreation community.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2a3728a74a5b0eb5fa15e243acbb58c86ce0aa3/392_105_3668_2201/master/3668.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=448bdfbc844bca4b6f8dd568050fa03b","title":"talking horses varian can boost vintage royal ascot with pierre lapin horse racing tips","story":"Roger Varian’s incredible meeting looks set to continue in the Commonwealth Cup in which he fields Pierre Lapin Roger Varian’s incredible Royal Ascot looks set to continue in Friday’s big race, the Commonwealth Cup, in which he fields Pierre Lapin (3.35). While he is the least experienced in the field after just two runs, he could also be called the most promising on the strength of his Mill Reef success at Newbury in the autumn.Both starts have come on a sound surface but he is a half-brother to Harry Angel, who won a Haydock Sprint Cup on heavy ground and was also beaten less than a length in this race three years ago. Pierre Lapin looks the right favourite but Southern Hills could be a source of each-way value, having won the Windsor Castle here last year.1.15 Tim Easterby has made a steady start to the season but one horse he had cherry ripe for resumption is Art Power, who built on last year’s promise with a five-length success at Newcastle on racing’s first day back. The grey looks leniently weighted.1.50 Softish ground is a new challenge for most of these juvenile fillies but Mahale is one of those more likely to cope.

He should know a lot more this time.3.00 He was a beaten favourite on his reappearance but Elarqam’s run looks a lot better now that the winner, Lord North, has followed up in the Prince of Wales.

Time will show that to have been a really tough task and they pulled seven lengths clear of the rest. The chestnut can give Andrew Balding a second consecutive Queen’s Vase.4.40 Balding has another big chance in the Duke Of Edinburgh with Good Birthday, who ran on well to be third in Lord North’s Cambridgeshire last autumn.

Despite being LA born and bred, he isn’t one for the party lifestyle that some of his contemporaries in the industry enjoy. He doesn’t drink – “the idea of losing control is anathema to me” – and is at his happiest walking in the countryside around his house. “I’m joyously anonymous,” Logan says.And eschewing glamorous events means he has plenty of time to pore over a 1937 LA city council traffic study, from which the idea for Penny Dreadful: City of Angels  sprang.Yet City of Angels is anything but dry –\u0026nbspa supernatural thriller circling around a Mexican-American family, a Nazi-sympathising German immigrant played by Rory Kinnear, and the battle between Santa Muerte – the guide of the dead – and her sister, the evil demoness Magda\u0026nbsp– played with stunning dexterity by Natalie Dormer in a number of different guises as she hides among her mortal victims. So where do the freeways fit in?And yet, while the aim is no doubt noble, any attempt from a white writer to address issues of racial injustice is bound to attract some criticism, especially in writing characters of different ethnicities. It is an issue Logan has sympathy with, even as he dismisses the very notion of cultural appropriation. “I categorically reject the idea that artists cannot speak in voices other than their own,” Logan says emphatically. “The balkanisation of the imagination is a very, very dangerous thing. Writers and performers and singers have to be able to dream very freely. And sometimes that takes you to places away from yourself, otherwise we’re into a very anaemic and cannibalistic cultural landscape.“But having said that, verisimilitude is important. I didn’t pretend to be an expert on Mexican American culture. I brought experts in. I hired Latino writers and directors and production designers. My producing partner, Michael Aguilar, is Latino. And finally I went to José Rivera, a wonderful playwright and screenwriter, who wrote one of our episodes, and asked him to do a pass through all 10. Just to say what’s not authentic, what doesn’t ring true. So philosophically, I completely reject the idea of there being any such thing as cultural appropriation. But the practical matter as a responsible human being, you have to be careful and cautious and work.”Lest Trump-supporting Americans think they have an ally in the culture war, it’s worth considering Logan’s background. A gay man, brought up in the 1960s by strongly religious yet supportive parents, he has been horrified by the turn American politics has taken over the past five years. And while religion, and specifically Mexican folklore, is a huge part of his latest project, faith is not something he has ever embraced. “It presents very interesting opportunities for a heightened magical realism,” Logan explains. But as anything other than a storytelling device, Logan has little time for it.\u0026nbsp“I grew up with a very complicated view towards what religion is,” he says. “It was always fraught with social politics in my family. When people turn against science and facts, for faith, that’s a treacherous road. Faith and belief is a deep human need, but it’s not real in any objective sense as far as I’m concerned. Human beings have to accept the consequences of how they behave,. Any fig leaf that an established religion, or even a folklore religion, offers, is dangerous.”So with cultural appropriation and religion both dismissed, Logan is set for cancellation by all sides of America’s partisan politics.\u0026nbspIt was that deep sense of ision, of a country running out of control, that prompted his desire to look back at the past of his home city. “Like many people, I naively assumed that a sort of secular liberal humanism was the coin of the realm,” Logan says. “And then everything began to change, so, so shockingly. I felt helpless. And I wanted to say something about it as a writer. I was struck by the parallels between what I see going on in the world now, and what was happening in a very particular time in Los Angeles’ story.\u0026nbsp“You’re seeing a worldwide resurgence of dangerous political extremism, and atomistic nationalism and irresponsible political demagoguery. And in this country, a particularly virulent form of racism, demonisation of ethnic communities, the Mexican community. And all of that was very much in the air in late 30s in Los Angeles. Like many writers, starting with Shakespeare, the idea of examining the present through the lens of the past has always been something that really excited me.”Shakespeare often crops up in our conversation. Logan describes the first time he saw Laurence Olivier’s Hamlet as the “liminal event” of his life, which sparked a lifelong love of theatre, London and, perhaps surprisingly, drew him towards genre projects such as Star Trek (he wrote the 2002 film Star Trek: Nemesis, a dream come true as the TV series was his favourite show as a child), James Bond and Penny Dreadful – a CV one might not expect of a lauded playwright.\u0026nbsp“I was living in San Pedro, California, and my dad, who loves literature and was raised in Belfast on real poetry, made me sit down and watch a movie with him. And I didn’t want to do it, because who wants to sit with dad and watch a movie when it’s a nice Saturday and you wanna go out and play? But it was Olivier and Hamlet, and those two and a half hours changed my life.“On one hand, it has the genre elements that I loved – ghosts that were scary and the greatest sword fights ever put on screen – but it has this other thing. And that other thing was Shakespeare, the poetry and the character. And I became, at eight years old, obsessed with Shakespeare. It led me to the theatre and once I was in it, I suddenly knew the place I was meant to be my whole life, because I felt comfortable. I was an asthmatic child, I was gay. Our family moved all the time. So I didn’t have friends from childhood. But, doing a high-school show, I felt I had a tribe, and that has not changed from from that day.”Logan is worried about the future of theatre once the pandemic passes – but he is slightly more optimistic than most. “I look at history, when London theatres were closed repeatedly in the Jacobean era for plagues,” he says. “They always came back with incredible robustness. Creators and the audience are desperate for new stories and new interaction. Because what’s amazing about theatre and what I miss so desperately now is the art form, where everyone’s breathing in the same way, when everyone’s holding their breath at the same time. That to me is the most sacred moment I could possibly imagine. Film and TV are beautiful, but they’re zombie art forms. Once something is done, it exists that way, unchanging. What makes theatre so exciting is every performance is different.“Any event like this, that stops train of progress for a second and allows people to think about how they interact with their work with their family, with their loved ones and community, is an incredibly valuable thing,” he says. “We’ve learned something important about touch, about human interaction on a primal level. I hope it will make people more responsive to the occasional whisper and the occasional bit of poetry and the occasional walk outside for no reason without their iPhones.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5762506c6003f475cda817411c0759c4a5fd3ef/0_32_2260_1356/master/2260.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a5ec59d1ae3f999a0ab6c5506c146977","title":"kentucky democrats senate charles booker amy mcgrath mitch mcconnell","story":"Charles Booker is less of a long shot to beat Amy McGrath, a centrist former marine fighter pilot, as the Democrats’ pick for a Kentucky Senate seat after weeks of anti-racist protestsAmy McGrath’s nomination was supposed to be a done deal.In the 24 hours after she announced her candidacy last July, the former marine fighter pilot raised $2.5m, a record for a Democratic Senate candidate. She had name recognition from a failed 2018 congressional bid and became more familiar soon when she was hosted on late-night comedy shows, held up as the person who could finally unseat the Senate majority leader – and liberal bete noire – Mitch McConnell.McGrath had said some things that appeared to show an openness towards Donald Trump, but there are those in deep-red Kentucky – where Trump won by 30 points in 2016 – who would say the only way a Democrat can win a statewide race is by being a centrist and wooing Trump voters.She was endorsed by the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee and as of the end of March she had roughly 200 times the amount of cash on hand as each of her two progressive, grassroots challengers did. It looked like it was in the bag.Her closest challenger, seen as a distant long shot, was Charles Booker, a progressive 35-year-old African American rookie state representative from Louisville’s predominantly black West End who advocates for things like universal basic income, the green new deal and, now, reimagining law enforcement and cutting back police funding.But in late May, mass protests erupted in Louisville over the police killing of Breonna Taylor here in March. Booker began showing up at the protests, standing out in his suit in crowds that were dressed for the heat and expecting confrontations with riot cops, and even got teargassed alongside protesters.“When this moment happened with Breonna Taylor, I knew where I needed to be at,” he told the  in an interview. “People were grieving, mourning in the streets in real time … And my response to that was to be there with them.”The things Booker had been speaking about – how difficult it is living in the neglected parts of the city and the state – started to resonate with a broader audience. His popularity and name recognition have grown quickly. Suddenly, like a handful of other insurgent candidates around the US, the protests were lifting up politicians who could channel their energy, cause and passion.“When you have an event that’s all anybody can talk about and you have a candidate that seems omnipresent within that event, it can’t not change the dynamics of the race,” said Matt Erwin, a Democratic strategist in the state.Others agree. “I think early on I would say it was not going to be competitive, that McGrath was going to be the nominee,” said Anne Cizmar, a professor of government at Eastern Kentucky University. “But I think now Booker is a competitive candidate to potentially win the nomination.”There is little polling data available, but  last week alone, Booker secured endorsements from Bernie Sanders, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Kentucky’s two biggest newspapers. And in an eight-day  earlier this month, he raised nearly triple the amount of money was able to in the first three months of 2020.To Booker, the issues he talks about are personal. He’s black. He’s from the poorest part of Louisville and the state. He’s a type 1 diabetic who says he’s had to ration insulin to put food on the table for his family.His cousin – who was murdered in Louisville four years ago – was a good friend of Breonna Taylor, the 26-year-old ER tech whose death sparked protests here. On 1 June, a national guard soldier shot and killed David McAtee – known as YaYa or “the barbecue man” – as troops and cops tried to clear a crowd that was violating curfew. McAtee’s barbecue stand is just blocks from Booker’s home and a place he knew well.He told the  that when he was in college, a cop once pulled him over in his neighborhood for making a rolling stop and approached his vehicle with a gun out. These days, as he drives to the state’s capital, he says he regularly passes young men his age lying on the ground, surrounded by police.“Just seeing it, just it being a regular part of how we’re treated, has definitely left a mark on me and helps me see why we need to completely reimagine public safety,” he says of his encounters with law enforcement.He added that institutional and structural racism need to be addressed so that members of poor communities and communities of color “are not treated like a deadly weapon before being treated like a human being”.McGrath is a sharp contrast to Booker.She talks about making healthcare and education cheaper, but not free. She touts the fact that her husband is a Republican and that she is a gun owner. At the race’s sole debate, held the same day Trump delivered a speech in which he called on governors to “dominate the streets” and threatened to use the military to quell protests, McGrath again spoke of how she’d be willing to work with Trump on some issues if he was re-elected.“I think that’s what people want,” she said. “Wouldn’t you want that in a senator?”She said would also stand up to the president when it’s right for Kentucky.How much of a chance Booker has in the 23 June contest is still debated.“I think he has a shot, but it’s a really long shot, to be quite honest with you,” said Dewey Clayton, a political science professor at the University of Louisville. Booker has momentum, he added “but we’re in June now, I don’t know if it’s going to be enough time before the primary for him to make up what he lacks as far as exposure and getting the message out there.”On Saturday, Booker’s campaign released internal polling data – the only polling data made public for this race to date – that showed McGrath leading him by 10 points. Among those who hadn’t yet voted, however, her lead was down to seven points.Regardless of who wins the primary, beating McConnell in November is seen as a difficult venture.But despite McConnell’s continuing unpopularity and the close poll numbers, experts remain cautious.Clayton, the University of Louisville, professor, said he expects McConnell to win in November, adding that him being one of the most powerful men in the country “gives a lot of Kentuckians a sense of pride, whether they agree with him or not”.Erwin, the Democratic strategist, was more optimistic about voting McConnell out.“I think any Democrat has a fighting chance against the least popular senator in America,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/004b0ae485ad3fcb184ac010410370c3b125aa77/0_0_5166_3102/master/5166.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ea497a06cb4799b5a2830c69d02086ab","title":"navajo nation coronavirus lockdown arizona","story":"Tribal leaders fear rise in coronavirus infections in neighboring states including Arizona and Utah threatens to undo progressThe Navajo nation has been forced to reinstate lockdowns to shield its people from major coronavirus outbreaks outside the reservation, especially in Arizona, where cases are surging.The Navajo, the second largest Native American tribe, has been severely affected by the pandemic with 322 confirmed deaths as of Wednesday – more than 16 states including Kansas, Nebraska and South Dakota. The death toll equates to a death rate of 177 per 100,000, higher than any single US state.New cases and deaths have been declining over the past couple of weeks, thanks to public health measures such as widespread testing, which led to travel restrictions including a weekend curfew being lifted at the start of June.However, tribal leaders fear the rapid rise in cases in neighboring states, especially Arizona but also Utah, threatens to undo their hard-won progress in containing the spread.Complicating the issue is the fact that the Navajo nation is a food desert with only 13 grocery stores, and a third of residents do not have running water, which forces people to travel to neighboring states for basic items.Navajo nation president Jonathan Nez said at a virtual town hall earlier this week: “Arizona relaxed its preventive measures, and the number of cases and hospitalizations continue to drastically increase. We cannot put our nation in the same situation. We will continue to rely on science and data as we fight this pandemic.” A 57-hour lockdown has been ordered for the next two weekends, with only essential travel permitted. Face masks must be worn in all public spaces.“A second surge, a worse surge, may put a lot of pressure back on our healthcare system and our healthcare workers,” said Nez.As Nez reinstates public health measures to avoid a new surge, Doug Ducey, Arizona’s Republican governor, has stood by his decision to reopen for business.The state began easing restrictions on businesses in early May and lifted its statewide lockdown order on 15 May, even though there was no consistent downward trend and rapid testing is not widely available.“It would be preposterous to think that people going out aren’t increasing the positive cases,” Dr Murtaza Akhter of the University of Arizona College of Medicine told Cronkite News. “One of my concerns is whether people are ever going to take public health emergencies seriously.”Ducey’s critics have accused him of making coronavirus policy choices in response to Donald Trump’s visits to Arizona, with little regard for the science and public health data.Amid growing pressure from city officials and frontline health workers, Ducey on Wednesday said he would allow local mayors to mandate wearing masks in public, but refused to implement a statewide order.Coronavirus cases are increasing in 20 states including California, Florida, Alaska and Idaho. In response, tribal leaders across the US continue to enforce strict lockdown measures even as governors ease public health controls in favor of reopening for business.In Montana, which reopened to tourists on 1 June, the impact of coronavirus remains relatively low, with 630 confirmed cases including 20 deaths, but numbers are on the rise. The state’s eight tribes, including the Crow and Blackfeet nations, have not relaxed shutdowns or stay-at-home orders, partly in order to protect their vulnerable elders, who are revered as s of Native culture and heritage."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9389da9d4c95aefd3eb6b377d8360e26b10e7c7a/125_0_4375_2625/master/4375.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=23e1a0c068d6ef55ce3e9f46be411a04","title":"has time in lockdown made you want to approach life differently","story":"If this experience has given you a chance to take stock and make some changes, we want to hear from youHave you made a significant change to your life after living in lockdown?Living in lockdown has put everyone under strain, but it may also have given some of us time to take stock, work out what we really want from life, and make some long-awaited changes.If you have made a significant change to your life as a result of lockdown, we want to hear from you.

It is the first fatal confrontation since 1975 and the most serious since 1967, and so can be expected to have a powerful galvanising effect on the populations of both countries, already primed by a constant stream of nationalist rhetoric.There is a long history of such encounters ever since the two nations fought a short war there in 1962. After that conflict a Line of Actual Control (LAC) was declared, but there is no agreed line and limited control, as the events of recent weeks have confirmed. Thus far at least, both Indian and Chinese forces have stuck to an agreement not to carry firearms on patrol near the LAC.Beijing has put out a string of statements blaming India but giving no hint of Chinese casualties, estimated in the Indian press to total 43, including some deaths. In the past, such accounting has come decades later, if at all, from a regime that tightly controls information. For that reason, the only detailed accounts to have emerged so far have come from the Indian press.What is clear is that there will be more of these clashes without a clear change of direction and an attempt to agree on where the LAC should be, and how both sides should behave around it. Both Narendra Modi and Xi Jinping have built their images as warriors for national greatness.In his remarks on Wednesday, Modi warned the sacrifice of the soldiers would not be in vain and that India is capable of giving a “befitting reply” if provoked.China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, after speaking to his Indian counterpart Subrahmanyam Jaishankar on Wednesday, issued his own warning, that India should not underestimate “China’s firm will to safeguard territorial sovereignty”.In the broadest terms the deadly brawl in the Galwan valley was the latest symptom of an increasingly aggressive Chinese policy on territory and borders, of the sort that has been playing out among the rocks and reefs of the South China Sea.Over the decades China has been more assertive than India in building infrastructure around the LAC, with roads and bunkers. In recent years, India has been trying to catch up, in particular with a road to the Daulat Beg Oldie (DBO), the highest airstrip in the world, with feeder roads leading off it. China has been trying to push back against that Indian construction work, so that its creeping occupation of the Galwan valley goes unchallenged.Since May, Chinese troops appear to have stopped their Indian counterparts from approaching areas where both sides have patrolled over the years. And Beijing has sent in reinforcements. What distinguishes the current confrontation from previous incidents is not just the death toll but the fact that there have been standoffs in multiple locations.“This kind of territory is incredibly hard to hold, but also to move multiple troops over,” said Tanvi Madan, director of the India project at the Brookings Institution. “So it’s not considered to be something that just happened on the ground. It’s clearly a decision made by the Chinese at a more senior level.”It is not just about bragging rights over crags. China has built a road, Highway 219, linking Tibet and Xinjiang, that passes through territory near the LAC that India considers its own. India’s foothold at the DBO airfield, on the other hand, allows its forces to look down at the Karakoram highway linking China and Pakistan.The timing of the incident may be connected to the weather. The melting snows of spring provide an opportunity for aggressive moves. The pandemic may also have played a role. It led to India putting off military exercises, and an extra motive for Beijing to look for distractions from its own failures in governance.The deadly clash happened at a time and a place where officers from both sides were trying to negotiate a disengagement of forces. Neither government wants this to escalate, and the foreign ministers on Wednesday agreed on resuming the disengagement process. But the fact that there has been significant loss of life, at least on the Indian side, makes the situation much harder to defuse.“Now domestic politics and public opinion, especially nationalist pressure to avenge their deaths and escalate, becomes a dangerous force,” Vipin Narang, a security studies professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said. “It will be hard for India at least, with a relatively open media, to de-escalate as easily now.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9622ea25f7d73ddbf3c07bd35f1b7cad56e1c4c3/0_244_5032_3020/master/5032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f81b8feee25793043e705772c2ee585","title":"african countries drop covid 19 curbs in effort to limit economic harm","story":"Fragile economies relax measures despite rapid rise in infections on continentGovernments across Africa are abandoning restrictions imposed to prevent the spread of Covid-19 in the hope of limiting damage to their fragile economies, despite a rapid rise in the number of cases of the virus across the continent.Strict lockdowns have inflicted significant suffering on hundreds of millions of people who live without regular employment in overcrowded housing, and undermined public finances in already poor nations.The World Health Organization recognised last week that restrictions on movement and economic activity had “taken a heavy toll, particularly on the most vulnerable and marginalised communities”. Many also fear the continent’s extensive programmes fighting HIV, tuberculosis and other diseases will be starved of resources.The WHO has previously said the Covid-19 pandemic could smoulder in Africa for several years after killing as many as 190,000 people in the coming 12 months.Even the economies of more developed countries on the continent have been badly hit.South Africa, one of the most industrialised economies in Africa, will take six years to recover from the lockdown and ongoing restrictions, according to some estimates.The country’s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, announced on Wednesday that hotels, restaurants and hair salons would be allowed to open by the end of the month, and that non-contact sports could resume. All would be expected to respect strict hygiene and physical-distancing regulations.Ramaphosa also cautioned in a televised address that South Africa had between a third and a quarter of all coronavirus cases on the continent - more than 80,000 - and that half had been confirmed over the past two weeks.“What was once a distant disease is coming much closer,” he said.The picture is mixed across the continent. Countries such as Namibia and Gambia, are reporting very few new cases, but numbers are climbing rapidly in others, including Ivory Coast, Cameroon and Ghana.Many governments lifted the strictest restrictions several weeks ago, but most recognise that weak health systems are unlikely to be able to cope with a big wave of infections. Many are seeking local solutions to contain specific outbreaks.Sudan has extended its lockdown in the state of Khartoum, which includes the capital, until 29 June, and authorities in Nigeria’s commercial capital Lagos have pushed back a planned reopening of places of worship.More than 200 positive cases were recorded in Kenya on Thursday, the highest daily total to date. Ten people died of the disease. Officials blame a failure to abide by physical-distancing and hygiene rules for the surge in infections.There are now 268,662 confirmed cases on the continent and more than 7,000 deaths. Low testing rates mean the true extent of the spread of Covid-19 is still unclear. Many governments have struggled to get the necessary supplies.“We should not mask the challenge we still have with testing,” Dr John Nkengasong, the director of the Africa Centres for Disease Control, said on Thursday. “We have to scale this up aggressively so we can get ahead of the pandemic.”Some modelling has suggested a risk of hundreds of thousands of unnecessary deaths if efforts to tackle HIV are sacrificed for those against coronavirus, the executive director of UNAids, Winnie Byanyima, said.“If the financial pressure forces African government to drop health services, HIV services prevention, treatment and testing in order to fight corona … which is what we see happening on the ground … we have estimated that within six months we could have additional Aids-related deaths of up to half a million,” Byanyima said.The lockdowns have also led to a surge in gender-based violence. Ramaphosa said cases of the abuse of women and children in South Africa had increased dramatically.“It is with the heaviest of hearts that I stand before the women and the girls of South Africa this evening to talk about another pandemic that is raging in our country, the killing of women and children by the men of our country,” he said.“I am appalled at what is no less than a war that is waged against women and children of our country. The women of this country are raped and killed by men. These rapists walk among us, they are in our communities. They are fathers, brothers, sons and our friends. They are violent men who have no regard for the sanctity of human life.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f75e863a923d391d9761d0ac11ac15889356543/0_205_5405_3245/master/5405.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fb87cce653186b3fdf16da2a1b27e2a2","title":"canada loses bid un security council seat justin trudeau","story":"Second failed attempt to win seat raises questions about messaging and clarity in Canada’s foreign policy, experts sayWhen Justin Trudeau was first elected in 2015, he promised that his victory would help Canada vault back on to the world stage, and reclaim a global influence that had eroded in previous years.“To this country’s friends all around the world, many of you have worried that Canada has lost its compassionate and constructive voice in the world,” Trudeau told a raucous crowd on election night. “Well, I have a simple message for you. On behalf of 35 million Canadians: we’re back.”But Trudeau’s marquee foreign policy gambit has ended in disappointment, after Canada lost its bid for a temporary United Nations security council seat. In a single round of voting on Wednesday afternoon, Ireland and Norway secured the required two-third of votes, edging Canada into third place.It was Canada’s second failed attempt to win the seat, and experts believe it raised serious questions about the messaging and clarity of the country’s foreign policy.Ahead of the vote, Trudeau tempered expectations, telling reporters that regardless of the outcome, Canada was “moving forward and leading the way” on issues such as climate change and a feminist foreign policy. But in the final days, the PM and his team mounted a frantic effort, phoning leaders in India, Pakistan, Mexico, North Macedonia and Fiji, to secure votes.For those closely watching the campaign, the last-minute push was likely too late – and the messaging from Ottawa too confused.It was only in February, months before the vote, that Trudeau and a small delegation visited Senegal, Ethiopia and Germany to pitch Canada’s candidacy. The prime minister had a planned trip to the Caribbean to court regional leaders, but scrapped the visit amid a wave of protests at home.“If you had five years, why would you wait so long for these trips and meetings? You need a really long runway to build goodwill and relations with other states that would get to the kind of guaranteed outcome of a security council seat. It’s not an easy thing to do,” said Mark Kersten, deputy director of the Wayamo Foundation.Norway and Ireland, meanwhile, had been laying the groundwork for their campaigns for years, and on Wednesday secured 130 and 128 votes respectively. Canada took 108.Canada had spent more than C$2mn on the effort, far more than Ireland. But the money was hampered by an unclear message.“We’re supposed to have a feminist foreign policy. To me, that means that every single decision that’s relevant to Canadian international relations should be examined through its gender dimensions,” said Kersten.“Are we doing that? I don’t necessarily see that with Saudi Arabia or our relations towards China.”Meanwhile, Canada’s public commitments to human rights and economic equality, were severely compromised by its defence of the engineering giant SNC-Lavalin, which has admitted fraud and bribery in Libya.For decades, Canada branded itself as a peacekeeping nation, drawing on a long history of intervening in conflicts around the world. But those efforts have eroded significantly in recent years, and current commitments are at a 60-year low.“There definitely is a big gap between rhetoric and reality,” said Thomas Juneau, a professor of international affairs at the University of Ottawa.Canada’s mission in Mali, its largest in nearly a generation, lasted one year.“The mission really reinforced the perception that we wanted to ‘tick a box’ – as opposed to really doing the heavy lifting,” said Juneau.Trudeau’s interest in the security council was seen as a way to draw a contrast with former PM Stephen Harper, whose lack of interest in courting the UN culminated in Canada’s first ever defeat for a seat on the security council in 2010. The rare loss – to Portugal – was met with shock and dismay in Canada.Wednesday’s surprise defeat, is likely to raise questions about the government’s effectiveness in managing its messaging abroad.“Another foreign affairs failure for Justin Trudeau. Keeps the streak alive! He sold out Canada’s principles for a personal vanity project and still lost. What a waste,” tweeted outgoing Conservative leader Andrew Scheer.Juneau held out hope that the loss would prompt a re-examination of Canada’s “dilettante” foreign policy.“There’s more scrutiny. And that’s important – because in this country, there’s a limited scrutiny of foreign policy.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/002af2157a0a2175725fb37d05f9ff7486a43313/0_313_2420_1452/master/2420.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=18ff538654ca43d9b1179bad82a2f8bd","title":"imran farooq three men sentenced for of pakistan exile in london","story":"Pakistani court gives MQM party members life sentences for stabbing political rival in 2010A Pakistani court has convicted several men over the murder of a prominent exiled politician in north London 10 years ago.Dr Imran Farooq, 50, was repeatedly stabbed and bludgeoned with a house brick in Edgware as he returned home from work on 16 September 2010. The killing of Farooq, a founding member of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM), sparked rioting in his native city of Karachi.On Thursday a court in Islamabad found Mohsin Ali Syed, 35, guilty of murder and conspiracy to murder and sentenced him to life imprisonment. A second man, Muhammad Kashif Khan Kamran, 40, was convicted in his absence of murdering Farooq and is wanted by Pakistani authorities. Both men are Pakistani nationals.Two other men, Khalid Shamim and Moazzam Ali, who are in jail in Rawalpindi, were also convicted for their involvement in the killing.The court additionally issued an arrest warrant for Altaf Hussain, who heads the MQM party, declaring he had ordered the killing. Hussain has denied any role in the killing and maintains that Farooq was like a brother to him.As well as Kamran, two other men – Iftikhar Hussain and Mohammad Anwar – were named as fugitives to be arrested by Pakistani or British authorities.Farooq had been living in exile in the UK since 1999. He left Pakistan to avoid arrest in connection with several legal cases against him in Karachi and later sought political asylum in Britain. His membership of MQM had been suspended at the time of his death.MQM, long accused of using extortion and murder to cement its grip on power, was accused for years of fomenting ethnic violence in Karachi.Scotland Yard’s counter-terrorism command, SO15, investigated the killing, speaking to more than 4,000 witnesses and collecting more than 4,500 pieces of evidence.Exhibits in the trial included CCTV footage that showed Syed and Kamran around Edgware in the days leading up to the attack. Syed was recorded watching Farooq using a cash machine on the day of the killing. Syed was also spotted entering a 99p store on 14 September and purchasing a pack of knives that matched those recovered at the murder scene.On Thursday Scotland Yard gave further details of its investigation. It said: “A forensic review of the items recovered from the scene was carried out in October 2014. A partial thumbprint, which had been found on a knife that was found hidden in a bush near Dr Farooq’s home, was reprocessed and forensic officers were able to confirm that it matched the print on Syed’s UK student visa application.”Both Syed and Kamran, who were connected to MQM, fled on a flight from Heathrow to Colombo, Sri Lanka, late in the evening after Farooq’s murder and travelled on to Karachi several days later. Pakistani authorities arrested Syed in 2015 the trial began last year.The UK’s high commissioner to Pakistan, Christian Turner, paid tribute to the “ground-breaking legal collaboration” that led to Syed’s conviction. “Today’s conviction marks a team effort between law agencies in the UK and Pakistan working together to get justice for the murder of Dr Imran Farooq,” he said.Richard Smith, the head of Scotland Yard’s counter-terror operation, said: “This outcome would not have been possible were it not for the incredible dedication, skill and determination of the investigation team who for almost 10 years have never given up in the pursuit of his killers.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a620de9e55901579508eecf7e0256edd52a4285a/0_135_5568_3342/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=941ae3d3b01dc2774bf441c809f57aa4","title":"raab betrays his ignorance of the origin and meaning of taking a knee","story":"Linking to Game of Thrones disregards Colin Kaepernick’s protest and what it inspiredThe foreign secretary Dominic Raab’s assertion that the act of taking a knee appears to be “a symbol of subjugation and subordination” that originates from the TV show Game of Thrones showed a startling level of ignorance of the genesis of the protest adopted by the Black Lives Matter movement.When the then NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick took a knee during the US national anthem before a game on 1 September 2016 to highlight racism, it began a protest that would reverberate around the world.Other NFL players followed in his footsteps, as did players in other US sports including Megan Rapinoe, who played for the women’s national soccer team.While many applauded Kaepernick’s action – he also announced he would donate $1m to charitable causes – it was controversial, not least with the then presidential candidate Donald Trump, and made global headlines.While Kaepernick failed to land an NFL contract for the following season, prompting accusations he had been sidelined for political reasons, the protests in the league became far more widespread. Trump, now president, said players should be fired for kneeling. Two members of Congress took a knee in the House in support of the NFL players, as did celebrities and even police officers.At around the same time, Bernice King, the daughter of the murdered civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr, tweeted a picture of Kaepernick taking a knee with Eric Reid, the first NFL player to join him in the protest, alongside that of her father kneeling in prayer outside the Dallas County courthouse in Alabama on 1 February 1965 during a peaceful demonstration. She captioned the two images: “The real shame and disrespect is that, decades after the first photo, racism still kills people and corrupts systems.”However, the image was a far cry from the defiant gesture today. The academic and novelist David Dabydeen described it as “docile and supplicatory (reflecting nothing of the frequent fierce rebellions by enslaved people in the New World plantations)”.Neither the image of King nor the slave provided the inspiration for Kaepernick, however. It is often forgotten that his initial protest was to remain seated for the national anthem, mirroring a 1996 protest by the NBA basketball player Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf, who took the same action citing US tyranny.It was Nate Boyer, a white former NFL player and army veteran, who advised Kaepernick to take a knee instead of sitting down. Boyer told National Public Radio: “In my opinions and in my experience, kneeling’s never been in our history really seen as a disrespectful act. I mean, people kneel when they get knighted. You kneel to propose to your wife, and you take a knee to pray. And soldiers often take a knee in front of a fallen brother’s grave to pay respects. So I thought, if anything, besides standing, that was the most respectful.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83ff9fcdf00c34d4076bfbadddff79ee2eaec72b/0_0_2904_1743/master/2904.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02f583604afa578418553f059b4949b2","title":"russian priest who called coronavirus a pseudo pandemic seizes convent","story":"Father Sergei Romanov who was banished by church leaders in April says he will only be removed by forceA rogue Russian priest who denies the existence of Covid-19 has seized a convent in the Urals region and announced he will only be removed by force.Father Sergei Romanov stormed the Sredneuralsk convent this week, after being banished by church leaders in April for protesting the closure of churches due to the coronavirus epidemic, which he called a “pseudo-pandemic”.He was backed by Cossack fighters who were guarding the convent’s perimeter, according to regional media. The mother superior and nuns had left the convent “in order to avoid unnecessary strife”, the regional diocese said in a statement. No one has been harmed as of Thursday evening.Romanov is a leader of an Orthodox religious cult of “tsar worshippers” and has legally changed his last name to that of Russia’s last imperial dynasty. He helped found the Sredneuralsk convent in the early 2000s not far from the site where the Bolsheviks buried the tsar and his family in 1918 and tried to dissolve them in acid.A former police officer, Romanov served 13 years in a prison colony for murder before joining the clergy and building a following among firebrand Orthodox believers centred at the Sredneuralsk convent, as well as other sites near Yekaterinburg, where the royal family was executed in 1917.The fundamentalist group has prominent followers among politicians and sport figures and launched vehement protests against the 2017 film Matilda, which depicted an affair between tsar Nicholas II and ballerina Matilda Kshesinskaya. There were several arson attacks targeted against the film’s director and a man drove his car into the facade of a cinema.Romanov’s raid was preceded by an ecclesiastical court hearing on Monday for violating public health orders and publicly cursing other priests who closed their churches due to coronavirus.“I will not leave the house of the mother of God,” said Romanov, referring to the convent, during the religious court. “My heart is calm, my conscience does not reproach me. They, that is the clergy, politan Kirill, will have to take the monastery by storm.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7baed359211a8a0a1d0d75d7a7bd0975e3752465/0_187_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6b546a88ced88041f4e761e4ffef9c54","title":"shielding muslims receiving pork items in england food packages","story":"Government accused of being insensitive to vulnerable people with religious restrictionsThe government has been accused of “cultural and moral insensitivity” for sending pork sausages and bacon to clinically vulnerable Muslim families who are shielding during the coronavirus pandemic.Pork products, including tins of beans and sausages and lentil and bacon soup, which are forbidden for Muslims, have been sent to the most at-risk households under a £104m government contract run by a private firm.Tins of Fray Bentos meatballs and chicken pies are included in the generic “care packages” sent to people who cannot leave their homes due to coronavirus, including those from Muslim, Sikh and Jewish communities, many of whom only eat meat prepared in accordance with their religions.The Labour MP Imran Hussain said his most vulnerable constituents were having to choose between eating and their religious or ethical beliefs.In a letter to Robert Jenrick, the communities secretary, Hussain wrote: “I want to be clear that this is unacceptable and deeply insensitive to our religious communities.“The inclusion of these products is also not just culturally and morally insensitive, forcing some in the most vulnerable positions to choose between compromising religious or other sincerely held beliefs and eating, but yet another display of the structural and institutionalised racism in our society – where the views of minorities are either not considered at all or regarded as not significant enough to warrant intervention.”The food boxes are delivered to people considered “extremely clinically vulnerable” due to underlying health conditions, meaning they cannot leave their home and cannot rely on help from family or friends.The government said more than 3m food boxes, or 290,000 a week, had been delivered under its contract with the wholesalers Brakes and Bidfood, which launched at the end of March.It said the boxes were standardised and might not meet dietary or religious needs, but added: “All boxes provide appropriate levels of nutrition for one person for one week. People with special dietary needs which are not met by the packs they receive should contact their local authority for further help and advice.”Other products in the packages include coffee, tea, biscuits, cereal, fruit, potatoes, pasta, pasta sauce, canned fish and canned vegetables. The meat products usually make up four or five tins, or a significant portion of someone’s weekly food, according to charities.Hussain was alerted to the issue when a community group in his constituency, Bradford East, noticed dozens of unopened tins of meat products outside people’s houses this week.Bradford Moor Pass said it collected more than 40 meat tins on one day. People did not want to complain or appear ungrateful but also did not want the items to be wasted, it said.A Pass representative said he contacted Bidfood, which delivered the boxes, and was told it was “one box fits all” and there were no vegetarian, halal or kosher alternatives.When approached by the , Bidfood said its role was to pack and deliver the boxes and that inquiries about the contents must go to the government.Bidfood, one of the largest food wholesalers in the UK, was awarded a £104m government contract in March along with Brakes, another distributor, as part of a £208m initiative to deliver food to the most vulnerable. The companies said at the time the boxes would “contain the same items, irrespective of whether they receive the delivery from Bidfood or Brakes”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6bb97e93ac064f1869f791c459aab534e662a6da/0_141_4209_2527/master/4209.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=40a746ef60a0adf7d78def77ff24d615","title":"uk poised to abandon coronavirus app in favour of apple and google models","story":"NHS to switch to alternative design by tech giants, says Matt Hancock in latest U-turnThe government has been forced to abandon a centralised coronavirus contact-tracing app after spending three months and millions of pounds on technology that experts had repeatedly warned would not work.In an embarrassing U-turn, Matt Hancock said the NHS would switch to an alternative designed by the US tech companies Apple and Google, which is months away from being ready.At the Downing Street briefing, the health secretary said the government would not “put a date” on when the new app may be launched, although officials conceded it was likely to be in the autumn or winter.The idea behind the NHS app was that it could trace anybody that a person with coronavirus symptoms came into close contact with by using the Bluetooth connectivity on a standard smartphone, and notify them to self-isolate.Ministers had insisted on using a centralised version of the untested technology in which anonymised data from people who reported feeling ill was held in an NHS database to enable better tracing and data analysis. This version was not supported by Apple and Google.That was because the design of Apple’s iPhone operating system is such that apps quickly go to sleep when they are not being used and cannot be activated by Bluetooth – a point raised by experts and reported by the  in early May.The Department of Health and Social Care refused to say how much had been spent on the effort, although official records show three contracts worth £4.8m were awarded to the developer VMWare Pivotal Labs for work on the app.Silkie Carlo, the director of the privacy charity Big Brother Watch, said: “This just shows what a mess the centralised data-hungry approach was. Government was wrong to waste precious time and millions of pounds of public money on a design that everyone warned was going to fail, and now we’re back at square one.”Hancock had been particularly enthusiastic about the NHS app and had at one point said it would be “rolling out in mid-May” across England. Officials had denied the Apple-Google alternative was being evaluated, although on Thursday it was revealed that in fact work was going on to assess it from 6 May.On Thursday, Hancock said the alternative was not ready either because it could not measure distance accurately. In some cases it cannot distinguish between phones 1 metre and 3 metres away – even though one is inside and one outside the current 2-metre physical distancing limit.Experts say an app would be useful to track the potential spread from an infected person on public transport or in any other situation where they come into contact with people they do not know. But the distance measurement problem means it cannot be relied on to make decisions about who should self-isolate.When asked whether he had unwisely stuck to the wrong approach, Hancock said: “I’m from Newmarket, we back both horses.” He went on to argue that testing the Apple–Google alternative for several weeks meant the government could make the leap from one system to another with confidence.Contact tracing is one of the most basic planks of public health responses to a pandemic\u0026nbsplike the coronavirus. It means literally tracking down anyone that somebody with an infection may have had contact with in the days before they became ill. It was – and always will be – central to the fight against Ebola, for instance. In west Africa in 2014-15, there were large teams of people who would trace relatives and knock on the doors of neighbours and friends to find anyone who might have become infected by touching the sick person.Most people who get Covid-19 will be infected by their friends, neighbours, family or work colleagues, so they will be first on the list. It is not likely anyone will get infected by someone they do not know, passing on the street.It is still assumed there has to be reasonable exposure – originally experts said people would need to be together for 15 minutes, less than 2 metres apart. So a contact tracer will want to know who the person testing positive met and talked to over the two or three days before they developed symptoms and went into isolation.South Korea has large teams of contact tracers and notably chased down all the contacts of a religious group, many of whose members fell ill. That outbreak was efficiently stamped out by contact tracing and quarantine.Singapore and Hong Kong have also espoused testing and contact tracing and so has Germany. All those countries have had relatively low death rates so far. The\u0026nbspWorld Health Organization\u0026nbspsays it should be the “backbone of the response” in every country.Apple did not immediately comment but in a statement on Thursday night, Google said: “We welcome the announcement from the UK government today. We have developed an Exposure Notification API with Apple based on consultation with public health experts around the world, including in the UK, to ensure that our efforts are useful to authorities as they build their own apps to limit the spread of Covid-19, while ensuring privacy and security are central to the design.”Earlier this week Italy and Germany launched their own apps nationwide based on the Google-Apple model. The Italian app has been downloaded 2.7m times, while the German app was taken up 6.5m times on Tuesday, its first day.Speculation about the fate of the NHS app had been circulating for weeks after Hancock’s mid-May deadline was missed. On Wednesday, James Bethell, a junior health minister responsible for the app, told MPs it would not be ready until the end of the year. “We’re seeking to get something going for the winter, but it isn’t a priority for us,” he told a parliamentary committee.At one point it had been hoped that Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland would also use the app, which is intended for England in its revised form. But the repeated delays had prompted the other nations to reconsider.Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, said: “This is unsurprising and yet another example of where the government’s response has been slow and badly managed. It’s meant precious time and money wasted.“For months, tech experts warned ministers about the flaws in their app, which is why we wrote to Matt Hancock encouraging the government to consider digital alternatives back in May.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/240e72f321aac345f3e4e07fd9ac5685dffc480f/0_0_5568_3712/master/5568.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=fdfbd410cf626de76aeea1af9f115e34","title":"coronavirus live news brazil cases near 1m as who hails steroid treatment hope","story":"Johns Hopkins says 450,435 have died WHO condemns Napoli football fans’ celebrations as ‘reckless’ Beijing expert says new outbreak under controlWe’ve launched a new blog at the link below – head there for the latest:Dan Tehan, Australia’s minister for education, has also spoken about the government wanting to shake up the university sector including doubling the cost of an arts degree.What we want to do is first make sure that we’ve got additional places in the system because we know as a result of the coronavirus pandemic we’re going to see more demand for places in the higher education system and also we want to incentivise students to undertake courses that will give them the skills to take the jobs of the future.“We need young Australians to help us grow our economy through the devastation of the coronavirus pandemic and what this is all about is incentivising people to look at teaching, to look at nursing, to look at allied health, to look at engineering and to look at IT because we know that the jobs of the future will be in those areas.”The survey conducted by The Institute for Policy Studies and the National Domestic Workers Alliance includes responses from 800 workers.Half of those surveyed said they were afraid of seeking assistance from the federal or local government due to their immigration status.Just as the pandemic hit the US, the Trump administration’s public charge rule, which allows the government to deny green cards and visas to immigrants who rely on public benefits, took effect.Dan Tehan, Australia’s minister for education, has been asked about the future of the wage subsidy JobKeeper scheme while speaking to the ABC.

The 22-year-old from Milnthorpe in Cumbria is passionate about illustration, but also wants to stay true to his ideals about the type of work he aims to produce, rooted in skate culture. “The prospect of having my work published nationally felt so distant,” he says. But Chris’s work, along with that of seven other young creatives, will appear next Saturday, 27 June, in a supplement published with .Your Voice. Your Way is being created by young people aged between 18 and 25 from across Britain who feel strongly that they and their contemporaries need to be heard when it comes to shaping the future. “I am driven to uncover how our world is steered,” says Chris. “And how, not just as creatives, but as people, we can change it.” Commissioned by Levi’s and  Labs team, the magazine aims to give a platform to the unheard, and amplify their voices.“Their generation has what I’d call a positive stubbornness,” says Jason Kyriacou, the UK marketing and experience director for Levi’s. “An uncompromising attitude to what they believe in and the courage to act on it.”Now, that attitude is needed more than ever. When  Labs and Levi’s started recruiting for the project, in the first months of 2020, issues surrounding climate change, shifting identities and inclusiveness came up in nearly every application. What gave the project even more urgency was the outbreak of Covid-19.Suddenly the future was ever more uncertain, and the assembled contributors – all with little or no media experience – had to adjust to working on the project remotely and contacting their mentors from  Labs using video meetings.Writer Kiera Moran, 24, has had the unusual experience of self-isolating before, and writes about the experience of seeing her five-year-old son through cancer. She started writing up late at night, caring for her child. “Sleep deprived at 5am, I have spilled my heart out,” says Kiera, from Merthyr Tydfil. “My voice is honest and unassuming. Coming from a working class background, I feel I am familiar and welcoming, with a story hidden behind nightmares. I was excited to have such an amazing opportunity. I hope to develop my writing and use what I’ve learned in future work.”Another writer, Anna Marshall, 21, from Durham, drew on her experience in climate activism for the project. “I want to contribute to a fresher and more daring version of professional journalism,” she says. “I was buzzed to see what we could make together,” she says. “And I was excited to work with talented people who are dedicated to what they do.”For the other two writers, Ayat Mohamed, 18, from London, and Sam Carrick, also 18 and from Gosport, the project was a chance to think about their place in the world and how they and others are viewed. “I hope someone reads it and feels understood,” says Ayat.Illustrator Vicki Jones, 21, from Birmingham, was keen for her work to be seen by the people she depicts, often women of colour. “The message I’d like people to take from my work is to be proud of who you are regardless of skin colour, facial features or hair type,” she says. “To just love the way you look. I am passionate about this message and I want others to feel that they can be heard too.”For the two photographers, Milli Ahern, 23, from London, and Fanny Beckman, 25, lockdown meant the biggest adjustment, forcing them to think creatively about what they could shoot in and around their homes, and they responded with positivity. “I was beyond excited when I found out I was chosen to work on this zine,” says Fanny, who is from Malmö, Sweden, but lives in London. “To get advice from people in the industry I have always dreamed of being part of means a lot to me.”“We received hundreds and hundreds of applications,” says the project’s casting editor Anna Fielding. “Every single person who applied had something important to say. The eight collaborators have exceptional clarity of expression and a real drive to see a new world. They’ve been inspirational to work with.”Although it has never been easier to self-publish work, or create a social media presence or a podcast, it’s difficult to be heard among so many others doing the same.The reach of an established newspaper still matters, as does being heard by an audience beyond your peer group.  Labs and Levi’s were happy to turn over creative control and act as supporters and signal-boosters. The hope is that the conviction and passion displayed by these eight will inspire others to find their voices. The collaborators were paid for their time and work, and will be mentored for six months by  Labs staff.Beyond encouraging young people to speak out and push for positive change, the aim is to let the world see the power of their potential. “We want to create a platform that this team perhaps otherwise wouldn’t have had. And then to put it in front of people who might not otherwise read it, because it would have been in places they wouldn’t normally look,” says Jason.The team may be only eight strong, but they represent their generation and they represent Britain. Do look at what they have to say: it contains the seeds of our future.Use Your Voice ...The zine created for the Your Voice.

The older you get, the more likely you are to get it.”The Donegal GP said he understands that some older people may be apprehensive about returning to normality due to the virus, but his advice is to “get out, get active and pound the streets”.“An exercise bicycle isn’t much good for you in terms of bone health. Your bones respond to the stresses of walking so if you are walking – weight-bearing exercise – your bones are responding to the stresses of walking.”Broken hipsDr Coyne added that bone health is “incredibly important” as you grow older.“The stats are that if you break your hip, you’ve one chance in four of being dead in 12 months, that’s worse than many cancers,” he said.“If you break your hip, you have two chances out of four of having lost one element of daily living, be that being able to climb the stairs, being able to get in or out of the bath, being able to dress yourself. You may lose independence because you’ve broken your health.”Dr Coyne also advised those who were already diagnosed with the condition to continue with their medication, and to attend a GP for any injections they may require.Asked if the lockdown could cause a surge in cases of osteoporosis, Dr Coyne said it is a disease that develops over decades as opposed to months.However, he acknowledged that there had been a lack of diagnoses in recent months as the scan used to diagnose iniduals with the disease was not in operation due to social distancing requirements.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4282760.1592508176!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"plan for schools places of worship nail bars to reopen in north unveiled","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTeachers will return to work from August 17th, and are to maintain a 2 metre distance between themselves and pupils. Photograph: iStockPlaces of worship in Northern Ireland are to reopen from June 29th and hairdressers, barbers and nail bars from July 6th as part of further significant easing of the coronavirus restrictions announced by the Northern Executive on Thursday.The North’s First Minister, Arlene Foster, said these were “indicative” dates which were dependent on the virus “remaining under control” and would be confirmed nearer the time as long as the reproductive rate of the virus – referring to how many other people a confirmed case went on to infect – remained under one.Ms Foster also announced details of the Executive’s plan for pupils to return to school which she described as a “major step forward towards normality in our schools”.Pupils in the final year of primary school and in school years 12 and 14, as well as vulnerable children in all year groups, will start school a week early, from August 24th, with the remainder returning the following week.If physical distancing was still required, Ms Foster said, the Executive had agreed on the basis of scientific and medical advice that “schools plan on the basis of 1m distancing between pupils”. Inidual classes up until year 10 will also be regarded as a protective bubble.Teachers will return to work from August 17th, and are to maintain a 2m distance between themselves and pupils.Ms Foster said the Education Minister had indicated that this would “allow the school attendance pattern to return close to normality”. Guidance is to be issued to schools on Friday.The Executive’s objective, she said, was to “see a full-time return to classroom learning for all pupils as soon as possible when safe to do so”.ChildcareChildcare will also reopen to all families, not just the children of key workers, from July 1st, and there will no limit to capacity with the exception of registered childminders. From July 29th they will be able to provide childcare to four families, and this will rise to five families in August.Plans were also announced for summer schemes for children with special educational needs and summer programmes for the children of key workers.A summer food scheme will be established for up to 10,000 young people, and a business case has been put forward to allow the Executive to extend free school meal provision over the holidays.The Department of Health in Northern Ireland announced on Thursday that, as of June 16th, the R rate or reproductive rate of the virus was between 0.6 and 0.9. The seven-day rolling average of new cases was eight.No further coronavirus-related deaths were recorded in the North on Thursday for the seventh time in the last 12 days. The total number of fatalities reported by the department stands at 543.One person tested positive for the virus in the last 24-hour period, and 1,027 tests were carried out. In total, there have been 4,863 confirmed cases of the virus in Northern Ireland.ShieldingIniduals in Northern Ireland who have been instructed to shield will no longer need to do so from July 31st, as long as the rate of community transmission remains low.Letters will be issued to the 95,000 people in receipt of shielding advice to inform them of the planned change, the department said.The Deputy First Minister, Michelle O’Neill, said the evidence presented to the Executive on Thursday had been that “community transmission is low”, and this gave “some headroom to enable us to signal our intention to make further easements, conditional easements, as per our plan”.“This is a positive development for the economy as well as the wider wellbeing of the population,” she said.Archbishop Eamon Martin, the Catholic Primate of All Ireland, welcomed the decision to reopen churches in Northern Ireland, and said it was “particularly helpful” that this would take place at the same time as in the Republic. “Parishes in cross-Border communities will be able to plan together for a safe return to Mass at the same time,” he said.“I have been heartened by the amount of preparation which is already ongoing in our parishes to ensure that our sacred spaces will be as safe as possible when we begin to gather again together in prayer.“I expect that we will be beginning in a cautious way at first, and there will be a need for ongoing patience and careful monitoring of the situation.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4282816.1592514124!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"two thirds of speakers at green meeting favour entering coalition","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGreen Party deputy leader Catherine Martin told the online convention  she was cognisant of the many shortcomings in the programme for government. Photograph: Dara Mac Dónaill Two-thirds of Green Party members who addressed a nine-hour special online convention on Thursday spoke in favour of entering government. More than 70 of the party’s members participated in the online convention which was watched by some 2,000 members. Most attention focused on the speech of deputy leader Catherine Martin at the start of the convention. Ms Martin had opposed a coalition with Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil but had then led the Green Party negotiating team. While she indicated support for the programme for government when the parliamentary party voted on Monday night, the depth of that support was not known until yesterday. In the event, Ms Martin endorsed the programme strongly and unequivocally.However, she said she was also cognisant of its many shortcomings.Some 238 members applied to speak, with two-thirds of them indicating support for the deal. Party leader Eamon Ryan, who was the final speaker, argued the plan was transformative. “A change in economics is coming. Neoliberalism is in decline. The Green New Deal is on the rise,” he said.Mr Ryan said the commitment to end direct provision would give “everybody their front door”.Speaking for a second time, Dublin Central TD Neasa Hourigan, who was on the negotiating team but is voting no, argued a coalition with Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil would produce the “most fiscally conservative government in a generation”.Of the draft programme, she said: “It fails to tackle housing and homelessness. I believe it will make them worse.”Referring to suggestions the party might “miss the boat” by not going into government, she said: “That boat may be the Titanic.”Earlier, the three TDs who abstained in the parliamentary party vote on Monday night all argued against the programme. Ms Hourigan outlined concerns about a lack of new taxes, arguing there was “no magical money”. She said the two larger parties had rejected a spate of changes to tax measures including a wealth tax, expansion of section 481, flight tax, poverty-proofing of budgets, public banking, a site value tax, a windfall tax to stop speculation and country-by-country reporting on their tax spend by large companies with a turnover above €750 million. Francis Noel Duffy argued against the Land Development Agency, which he said was motivated by profit, while Patrick Costello insisted the programme fell short on many social-justice criteria. However, some members supporting a coalition arrangement asked what the alternative might be. “I am not aware of a credible alternative to government at this point,” said one Cork-based member. There was praise from speakers on both sides about the 7 per cent emissions reductions, the ‘wins’ on cycling and walking, as well as a commitment to end direct provision.ShortfallsThere was acceptance also in both camps that there had been shortfalls on housing, carbon tax (the absence of fee and idend), animal welfare, live exports, the Palestinian issue, deficit reduction and health. Strong views were expressed as to whether or not the coalition would be one of austerity. Dublin West TD Roderic O’Gorman said: “The Green Party will not be part of austerity. It will be part of a government that promotes a national green stimulus to restart our economy.”However, later Cllr Lorna Bogue said: “This is an austerity programme for government. There can be no doubt about that.”One of the negotiators, Ossian Smyth, told the meeting that the M20 motorway to Cork would not proceed during the five-year term and also threw doubt over the Galway bypass. Those assertions were quickly contested. The American-based developer of the proposed liquid natural gas facility in Shannon indicated it proposed to proceed with the project, despite the programme committing to scrap it. Other parliamentarians including Marc Ó Cathasaigh, Pauline O’Reilly and Joe O’Brien spoke in favour of coalition. Mr O’Brien said the document was not a detailed project-management statement."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Kim Yo-jong\u0026rsquos criticism of Seoul illustrates her seniority and potential to become rulerBatons wrapped in barbed wire used in high-altitude brawl in which 20 Indian soldiers diedNZ officials tracing 320 people regarded as \u0026lsquoclose contacts\u0026rsquo of pair who returned from UKClash on Himalayan border is the most serious since 1967, why now and what next?Any moves to invalidate peace deals posemajor setback to Moon\u0026rsquos efforts for more lasting reconciliation with NorthFirst loss of life in area for decades as \u0026lsquoviolent face-off\u0026rsquo between troops elevates disputeLatest in a series of threats from the Kim regime since diplomacy with US broke downFierce criticism as editor of influential Rappler website faces up to six years in jailChile replaces health minister as deaths spiral while global cases exceed 7.6 millionSocial media giant says China ran network of accounts to spread misinformationTwo years after Trump-Kim summit minister says peace hopes are now \u0026lsquodark nightmare\u0026rsquoThere had been repeated calls by the Maori community to remove statue of John HamiltonLam warns city cannot afford further \u0026lsquochaos\u0026rsquoalmost 9,000 aged 11- 84 arrested in protests over past yearDecision marks a setback in relations amid efforts to persuade North to give up nuclear weapons programmeSouth Pacific nation of 5m declared it was coronavirus free on MondayHospitals feel the strain as lockdowns are eased despite fears of a spike in infectionsHolidaymaker said he stumbled into abandoned well after being chased by wild dogMan (60) dies some 500 miles north of Sydney after board-riders pull him to shoreLarge crowd gathers shortly after legislature outlaws insults to China\u0026rsquos national anthemTrump administration has presented China with \u0026lsquoopportunities\u0026rsquo on the world stageStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4282393.1592477259!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"kim jong un s sister takes a wrecking ball to south korea relationship","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tKim Yo-jong: In North Korea, future top leaders must build credentials as someone who can stand up against South Korea and the United States.  Photograph: Jorge SilvaPOOLAFP via Getty ImagesWhen North Korea decided to join the 2018 Winter Olympics in South Korea and kick off a giddy period of rapprochement on the peninsula, its charm offensive was fronted by a smiling face: Kim Yo-jong, the only sister of the North’s top leader, Kim Jong-un.Now, as Kim threatens to extinguish the fragile détente with a new cycle of bellicose actions and military provocations, it’s his sister who is again speaking for the nation, this time heaping scorn on South Korea – a signal of her deepening clout in the hereditary regime.“It was sickening to listen to his speech,” Kim Yo-jong said of the South’s leader, Moon Jae-in, in a statement on Wednesday, referring to his message this week calling for peace on the Korean Peninsula. “He seems to be insane, though he appears to be normal outwardly.”“So I decided to prepare a bomb of words to let it be known to our people,” she said.In North Korea, few leaders other than Kim Jong-un can issue first-person statements like that. But Kim Yo-jong (32), who is her brother’s top spokeswoman and policy co-ordinator, wields far more power than is suggested by her age and meagre titles: first deputy departmental chief in the ruling Workers’ Party and an alternate – not a regular – member of its Politburo.‘Revolutionary blood’Her influence in a hierarchy studded with ageing generals and party secretaries derives from the “revolutionary blood” coursing through her body. She is a granddaughter of Kim Il -sung, North Korea’s founder, who is still revered as a godlike figure in the North.That makes her a potential candidate – even in the North’s deeply patriarchal culture – to replace her brother, who is believed to be 36, should he die or become incapacitated.Kim Yo-jong’s systematic rise adds a sense of continuity to North Korea’s succession plans, analysts said. In North Korea, future top leaders must build credentials as someone who can stand up against South Korea and the United States.“What we see right now is North Korea working out a contingency succession plan in case Kim Jong-un’s health goes bad,” said Yoo Dong-ryul, a North Korea specialist at the Korea Institute for Liberal Democracy in Seoul.“The problem with Kim Yo-jong as successor is that she is a woman and is still too young,” he added. “So her brother is helping her lead the offence against South Korea and establish her leadership so she can dissipate any reservations the hard-line stalwarts in the military and party might have about her.”Kim Jong-un’s long absences from public view in recent months have spurred speculation about whether he was seriously ill, what might happen to the North’s nuclear arsenal and who would succeed him if he became incapacitated. If he had to give up power, none of his three children – all believed to be preteens – are old enough to take over.Kim has an older brother, Kim Jong-chol, who is said to have been considered by their father to be too effeminate to lead the highly militarised country. He has never been seen in public with his younger brother.In 2017, Kim had his half-brother, Jong Nam, assassinated in Kuala Lumpur. He also executed his uncle Jang Song Thaek. Kim has another uncle, Kim Pyong Il (65), who was recalled home last year after decades of serving as a low-key ambassador to Eastern European countries. But after being away for so long, he has no power base in Pyongyang.Kim’s aunt, Kim Kyong Hui, Jang’s wife, is ailing. All this leaves Kim Yo-jong the most likely hereditary successor if her brother dies before his children grow up, analysts said.Swiss schoolsShe and Kim Jong-un attended schools in Switzerland as teenagers. But the outside world had seen little of her until she appeared beside him during the funeral of their father, Kim Jong-Il, in 2011.Some experts in South Korea say she is married to Choe Song, who is said to work at Office 39, a secretive agency that manages funds for the Kim family. Choe is a son of Choe Ryong Hae, who holds the most senior party titles after Kim.Kim Yo-jong grabbed global attention when she became the first member of the Kim family to cross the border into South Korea, attending the opening ceremony of the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics, in 2018. Later, she was at her brother’s side at his summits with Moon, President Donald Trump and President Xi Jinping of China.She stood next to Kim Jong-un when he signed a joint statement with Trump after their historic first summit on denuclearising the Korean Peninsula, held in Singapore in June 2018. Secretary of state Mike Pompeo was her US counterpart during the ceremony.Kim Yo-jong apparently lost her Politburo job as Kim replaced his foreign policy team after the collapse of his second summit with Trump, which was held in Vietnam in February 2019. But this year, with Kim shifting to an increasingly hostile relationship with Seoul and Washington as his diplomatic efforts with Trump stall, Kim Yo-jong’s stock began rising again.Since March, she has been issuing statements under her own name, lashing Moon’s office for its “imbecile way of thinking”. She praised a letter that Trump sent to her brother in March, calling it a “good judgment” but not enough to improve ties.Liaison officeSince last week, North Korea’s state news media has depicted her as the orchestrator of a rapid-fire series of statements and moves that have raised tensions on the Korean Peninsula. On Tuesday, the North blew up the inter-Korean liaison office in the border city of Kaesong, and a day later, the North Korean military threatened to resume drills along the disputed western sea border with the South.Kim Yo-jong’s offensive claimed a first political casualty in South Korea on Wednesday. The unification minister, Kim Yeon-chul, stepped down, taking responsibility for the deterioration in relations with the North, which has followed the South’s failed efforts to mediate between North Korea and the United States.The North’s sudden turn toward animosity with the South – and, by extension, the United States – may reflect a desire to unify the country in the face of an economy further hobbled by the coronavirus pandemic and of a deepening need to push for concessions on international sanctions, said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul.Placing Kim Yo-jong up front in North Korea’s growing confrontation with Seoul and Washington may also give Kim “diplomatic flexibility” if he wants to change course, Easley said.Whatever the motivation behind the growing tension, it has made one thing clear: Kim Yo-jong’s consolidation of her position as the true No 2 in her brother’s government, said Lee Seong-hyon, an analyst at the Sejong Institute, a research centre in South Korea.“As she leads the offence against South Korea like a general, it silences those old hard-liners in the Politburo who may think she cannot be the leader,” Lee said. – New York TimesHistoric meeting between US president Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-unStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"World community urged to reject move to intensify \u0026lsquoprofound human rights violations\u0026rsquoAmple evidence uncovered of movement\u0026rsquos widespread persecution of Yazidi minority and other ethnic minoritiesSarah Hegazi\u0026rsquos simple gesture at a concert led to outrage, persecution and heartbreakDemonstrations against prices and wages erupt in Sweida and spread to DeraaAnnexation would be incompatible with international law, Maas warnsTerror group ramps up attacks as crises including coronavirus provide opportunityGovernment pressed to speed up talks with IMF and donors to secure funds and halt slideBritish-Iranian woman seeking release after first furlough from jail in Iran since 2016Police and security force officers killed in roadside bomb and gun battleHealth authorities confirm more than 3,000 new cases on two consecutive daysOpponents warn that US-backed plan would lead to independent Palestinian stateWar and coronavirus-ravaged country to get $1.35bn from UN and Saudi ArabiaTension rises in region with Israel planning to extend sovereignty to Jewish settlementsGiven lack of other options, authorities used restrictions as main tool to fight pandemicFormer cabinet minister Saad al-Jabri was strategic architect of Saudi counter-terrorism effortsPrime minister claims allegations are a \u0026lsquodeep-state\u0026rsquo, left-wing political witch-huntLong-serving politician will become first sitting prime minister in Israel\u0026rsquos history to stand trialPA president cites imminent threat of Israeli annexation of parts of the West BankFirebomb attack on home claimed the lives of a couple and their 18-month-old sonWHO forecasts coronavirus will kill 42,000 and infect most of 28 million populationStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4282768.1592506325!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"london less reserved now that covid 19 has torn the skin off the world","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tShops and businesses around London are slowly beginning to reopen but months in lockdown has changed the environment. Photograph: Matt DunhamAP PhotoIt was not so much a garden as a small, walled patio but as three of us sat around a large table eating fish and chips, we knew we were within either the spirit or the letter of the lockdown law, even if we were not sure which. My friend Johnny had chosen the menu earlier that day when he saw that his local fish and chip shop had reopened and he was eager to give them whatever business he could.It’s a story repeated all over London and one friend after another this week has talked up the merits of their favourite burrito stand or sandwich shop just back in business but with no customers. With most office workers still working from home, the entire economy that provides them with lunches, transport, dry cleaning and other services is struggling to come back to life.But Johnny’s concern for his local businesses reflects something else that has changed in London during the lockdown as the traditional reserve that governs relations with neighbours has crumbled. James, who was also at the fish and chip supper, said he had spent 12 years avoiding anything more than breezy cordiality with the other residents of his flat block.He was particularly keen not to get too close to the woman who lived directly below him, who seemed to be quite sociable and fond of a drink like himself. He was afraid that if he started talking to her, they might decide to have a drink together in one of their flats and soon it could become a routine that would be hard to put a stop to. And what would he do then?A serious pyrophobe who will rush home from anywhere if he thinks he left the radio plugged in, James also believed that his neighbour smoked in bed and would one day burn the house down.It started with the weekly 8pm clap for the NHS, when they found themselves on the street outside waiting for the din to begin and she told him she had found a Waitrose that was always empty and had everything that was in short supply, from eggs to toilet roll.When the lockdown rules eased, James and his neighbour started to go for socially distanced walks in Regent’s Park, slurping very strong gin and tonics from runners’ water bottles. They now have a weekly date in a garden space they have commandeered and James says he regards her as a friend.In my building, we traditionally avoid anything beyond the shortest greeting apart from at a drinks party in the lobby once a year which only a handful of us go to.During the lockdown, I would check with the hall porter every day on the health of some of the older neighbours, particularly a funny, clever couple in their late 80s, both of whom had to go into hospital before Christmas. One sunny day when I asked after the couple, he waved towards the bleak, concrete courtyard outside.“They’re out there drinking a bottle of rosé,” he said.And there they were, she in a yellow cotton frock and he in pink shorts and a blue and white striped shirt, each of them with a glass of wine and a book in front of them. Other neighbours were scattered around the usually deserted courtyard, some on their laptops, others apparently doing nothing at all.As the lockdown has eased, the lobby has become the communal space its architects probably intended and everyone is talking to one another in a way we never have before. For some, it’s probably the loneliness of working from home alone with none of the casual daily interactions of office life that have pushed them across the Rubicon of getting to know their neighbours.But something else is happening too. A psychiatrist told a friend of mine that coronavirus has “torn the skin off the world”, leaving us more vulnerable than before to our feelings and fears. And in London, many people’s greatest fear is that the economy will not recover and that they or many of the people they see every day will soon be in deep trouble.Before Johnny went to the fish and chip shop the other day, he met the builders who have made his life hell for the past few years, drilling from 6am until late in the evening. His campaign against them, which included hectoring the contractor over the phone late at night, got so far out of control that the police spoke to him about it.When he asked them if they’d like him to move his car out of their way, they told him how sorry they were for all the nuisance they caused.“No don’t, I’ve changed,” he told them.“Please make as much noise as you have to for as long as you can. I’m just happy that you all have a job.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com\"/polopoly_fs/1.4192672!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_940/image.jpg","title":"us democratic","story":"The process to choose the Democratic nominee to take on Donald Trump in November’s US presidential election is well under way.States across the country are in the process of choosing\u0026nbsptheir preferred candidate, either through a primary contest or a caucus.

However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role. These are senior members of the party – governors, former members of Congress, etc. Their 771 votes come into play if the convention is contested, which is\u0026nbspa possibility.Notably, six of the candidates were asked during a debate in Las Vegas on February 19th if they would support the idea of a candidate winning the nomination if they secured a plurality but not a majority of the delegates. All but one – Sanders – said they were opposed to this. The issue may become a headache for the Democratic Party as the primary process progresses."},{"url":null,"title":"air bridges negotiated enable us go foreign holidays july 4","story":"Families could be free to go on foreign holidays from July 4 under plans being drawn up by ministers.Boris Johnson is expected to announce on June 29 that deals have been put in place for so-called air bridges with a “small number” of countries with low levels of coronavirus.It would mean tourists being able to go on holiday without having to spend 14 days in quarantine when they return.Foreign tourists would also be able to come to the UK without having to self-isolate on arrival.Groups would be restricted to those living in the same household - which can now include one other person who lives alone - unless the Government relaxes rules on social distancing before then.Tourists would have to abide by the rules on social distancing in the country they travel to, meaning that countries with similar restrictions to the UK are likely to be first in the queue.Government sources said ministers wanted to set up the first air bridges to countries that are “most advantageous” to the UK economy, which are likely to include popular destinations such as France, Spain, Greece and Portugal.Boris Johnson had been expected to discuss an air bridge to France when he met Emmanuel Macron in Downing Street yesterday, but Number 10 said the issue “didn’t come up” in their meeting.It is understood to have been discussed between officials from the two countries instead.One source said France was “high up” on the list of countries that will have air bridges, also referred to as travel corridors.A Government source said: “The plan is to announce a small number of air bridges on June 29th, though it won’t come into force until July 4. Obviously it will depend on factors such as the scientific advice and the level of coronavirus infections at the time.“The Foreign Office will also have to change its travel advice before then because that remains a block on people going abroad for holidays.”The Foreign Office is currently advising against “all but essential international travel” making it all but impossible for holidaymakers to obtain travel insurance until the advice is changed.Dominic Raab, the Foreign Secretary, is less enthusiastic about air bridges than the Transport Secretary, Grant Shapps, who has been pushing for them for weeks.Tory backbenchers have put huge pressure on Mr Johnson to scrap the quarantine policy, which applies to all travellers arriving in the UK apart from a small number of exemptions including hauliers and those arriving from Ireland.In his meeting with Mr Macron Mr Johnson discussed the ongoing trade talks with the EU over a post-Brexit trade deal, and told the French President it “does not make sense” to have prolonged negotiations into the autumn.They also discussed the conflict in Libya, the Middle East peace process and the proposed Chinese national security law in Hong Kong, which would be a breach of the joint declaration on Hong Kong’s future signed by Britain and China before the handover of the former colony in 1997.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"contact tracing app situation uk height incompetence","story":"Mr Wales has claimed he can launch a German-style contact-tracing app in the UK within ‘two weeks’, as he blasted the NHS’s aborted effort as the ‘height of incompetence’.Jimmy Wales, who founded the online encyclopedia in 2001, said he could build a version of the app that runs on Apple and Google’s software at ‘zero cost to the taxpayers’ if the NHS agreed.His offer came as the Government axed its attempt to build its own version of the contact tracing NHS app yesterday to switch over to the Apple and Google model, which has been adopted by most other European countries.“This contact tracing app situation in the UK is the height of incompetence on so many levels.”The American entrepreneur later added he could “roll it out in 2 weeks time” using the software already made available by Apple and Google.Germany, who were referenced by Mr Wales, launched their contact-tracing, based on the Apple and Google version, on Tuesday after ditching their own version back in April.The UK Government has not set a new date for when it’s new contact tracing app, which uses the bluetooth connections on people’s phones to register when they come into close contact that could spread the virus, will be released.

at its heart - family.The President, greeted warmly by the Prince of Wales for the ceremonial arrival, spoke movingly of the Royal Family’s long friendship with his country, embodied by the Queen and her memories of wartime London.Britain in turn, said Prince Charles, harbours the “greatest possible fondness for France and her people”, with the “ties that bind us together” so closely intertwined.The time for politics was later first there was history and an endearing, enduring gratitude from one President to the British people.At its centre was the 80th anniversary of General Charles de Gaulle’s rallying Second World War cry to France, broadcast by the BBC from 1940 London urging his people to resist Nazi occupation.Now seen as a seminal moment in French history, it merited not just a post-lockdown visit with all the challenges of the new socially-distant era, but no less than the Legion d\u0027Honneur for the city and people of London.Mr Macron’s day started in Paris, hearing the recollections of 99-year-old veteran and “Companion of the Liberation” Hubert Germain, during the visit to the Ordre de la Liberation museum.A short flight to RAF Northolt, in a Dassault Falcon 7X decorated in the national colours of France, was followed by a ceremonial arrival outside Clarence House, where the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall were waiting.Under grey skies with umbrellas at the ready, the trio greeted with a knowing “namaste”, skipping the customary handshakes in favour of Covid-19-friendly procedure.Standing a careful distance apart, a ceremonial guard of honour from Number 7 Company Coldstream Guards were joined by the Band of the Coldstream Guards for the national anthems of France and the UK.As ever, when the Royal Family is hosting, it is the details that matter: the Chanel shoes worn by the Duchess in a nod to their French guest the distinctive green French Order of Agricultural Merit fastened proudly by the Prince.Both Mr Marcon and Prince Charles wore the small red pin badge of the Legion d’Honneur.Inside Clarence House, a meeting saw the Prince show exhibits from Second War War history amid half an hour of conversation. By mid-afternoon, Mr Macron laid a wreath at the statues of Charles’ grandparents, King George VI and the Queen Elizabeth in the Mall, later recalling how they stood by their people in London during the Blitz.In Carlton Gardens, the site of De Gaulle’s appeal, both the Prince and the President laid wreaths in tribute to the General in remembrance of his famous address: I call upon all Frenchmen who want to remain free to listen to my voice and follow me.In reciprocal speeches, Mr Macron thanked London for giving his Second World War countrymen a voice and platform to fight the Nazi occupation, while the Prince praised the enduring cross-channel links as important now as ever.In French, Mr Macron spoke movingly about how “Britain gave shelter to France”, inspiring the “soldiers of the shadows”.Delivering the “infinite thanks” of the French to London with the Legion d’Honneur, he pledged: “We will carry on writing together the tale of two cities.”The Prince, who delivered half of his own speech in French, reciprocated the sentiments, speaking of the “deep affection” between countries standing together then and now as they “face new threats and challenges”.After official photographs, Mr Macron was steered to Downing Street and the Prime Minister for what appeared to be a jovial socially-distanced meeting punctured by thumbs-ups, pointing and comic gestures in front of the cameras.And, as the visit drew to a close, a show of Franco-British unity in the skies: a fly past from the Red Arrows and their French equivalent, La Patrouille de France.It honoured the anniversary of the ‘Appel’ and, Mr Macron said, the helping hand from the “modest heroic spirit” of Britain that forever changed the fortunes of his nation.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"exclusive church england bank england apologise historic slavery","story":"The Rev.

Not that long ago it had statues of French officials – of which only one remains, hidden in a consulate garden. It had, a bit earlier, statues of Christian saints and Roman dignitaries, of which there is no trace. Before that, it must have had statues of Phoenician deities. All have been destroyed, and with them visible proof of the complex history of North Africa.There is nothing new about submitting statues to the trial that their subjects escaped. In the Roman Empire, when a Caesar fell out of public grace and was murdered, his successor’s first thought was about statues. Faces were erased, then redrawn in the new emperor’s image. Tearing down statues is not new, either. People re-evaluate the past, but when it comes to re-evaluating iniduals, things get trickier. How much did a person’s representation owe to its own time? Frankly, almost everything.Cecil Rhodes was not particularly loved in his own day his wealth was admired, but not his half-avowed homosexuality. He might have been too forward-thinking, for what business of his was it to create a scholarship that could be awarded regardless of race or creed? The language of his will is clear and obvious: “no student shall be qualified or disqualified for election to a Scholarship on account of his race or religious opinions.”If Rhodes was the racist we assume he was, then surely he knew what “race” meant? Five years after Rhodes’s death, in 1907, in the wake of the election of the first black Rhodes Scholar, Alain LeRoy Locke, the Rhodes Trustees argued that when Rhodes used the term “race” he might have meant “Dutch, English, Jew, and the rest.” Perhaps Rhodes was simply more progressive than his trustees, and than most people of his time.Rhodes endowed my college at Oxford, Oriel, with the means to further its work and fulfill its vocation as “The Provost and Scholars of the House of the Blessed Mary the Virgin in Oxford, commonly called Oriel College, of the Foundation of Edward the Second of famous memory, sometime King of England”. Rhodes is included in the daily college prayer said after dinner in hall, and in the yearly benefactors’ service. Does that mean that we, as a community, condone the horrors he engaged in? No of course not.History is an unyielding judge. A time will come when people will shrug their shoulders at the weariness of this overwrought generation of Britons who, having locked themselves up for more than two months, emerged to fight statues and ghosts. To remove any statue now would say: “up to June 2020, we were racist. But now, lo, we are washing our hands in the blood of our statues, we are not racist anymore.”It is alright for hands to be dirty. No hands are clean in history. The first colonisers of North Africa wiped out all its Christian and Jewish heritage, and thrived on the slave-trade. They had black slaves as well as white slaves. Any neutral view of history tells us that oppression is a matter of military power, and not of race. When I first arrived in France I found the presence of religious statues beautiful. They spoke about the past of a country I wanted to settle in, a land I wanted to become organically part of. France took me in as I took it in, with its complicated past and the painful pages of its history. Then I came to Oxford.I took Oxford in as it took me in I sincerely hope that I was admitted because I write quirky ideas about French authors who were hated in their days, then rehabilitated, and then hated again. I am at home here, walking down the High Street with Rhodes on one side and the Blessed Virgin Mary on the other. I hope Oxford did not take me in because of how my “ethnic background” makes the ersity quotas look better.I never felt more at home than when the city was deserted because of coronavirus anyway, I had nowhere else to go. To some, Oxford might be a Harry Potter setting to be enjoyed while they enhance their CVs to me, it stands as the last place on earth where people would dedicate their lives to the pursuit of truth.I will not say that as an African I am oppressed by Oriel’s statue of Rhodes and by the buildings Oxford owes to imperial largesse, nor that I feel incomplete, as a Catholic, by the absence of statues in some of the other niches. I do not wish to change a single stone of Oxford, because I love it. I love it as much, and maybe more, than I love any city I have lived in before.There is no shame in loving the country you belong to. We immigrants love it, too. It is possible to criticise a country and the people who built it, while still loving it. Without a French presence in Morocco, I doubt I would have had any chance to enjoy an international academic career, let alone as a woman. My mother insisted that I should be educated in the French system my grandmother’s pride was that I ended up teaching French to French teenagers.Could I decolonise myself? No nor do I wish to. I am proud of what the complicated past of colonialism made me. I feel no guilt about it, and the last thing I need now is the apologies of a French person feeling sorry for me.White guilt is unhelpful and condescending.

Nasa has made a map of its trajectory, showing where the annular phase of the eclipse will be visible, weather permitting. Millions more will be able to witness a partial solar eclipse, though unfortunately for sky gazers in the UK and US it will not be visible.Details of object that smashed into Moon during lunar eclipse revealed“It’s much more important to watch the weather forecasts a day or two before the eclipse and choose a location with the best chance of a cloud-free sky during the eclipse.“Good weather is the key to successful eclipse viewing – better to see a shorter eclipse from clear sky than a longer eclipse under clouds.”A live stream of the eclipse will be broadcast by Timeanddate, allowing anyone to watch it no matter where they are in the world.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas from fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telescope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

This year, they will be doing so virtually, for the first time ever.Apple updates its software platforms every year, and has all but confirmed that each of them will be receiving new features this time around, too.Apple to hold WWDC event –\u0026nbsphow to watch and whenWhat leaks there have been have suggested that the changes might be largely what are expected, and there have been few of them. In recent years, the company has looked to crack down on New WatchOS tools are expected to concentrate on fitness, for instance, with some rumours suggesting the company might finally integrate sleep tracking. iOS could further improve the home screen that serves as the centre of the iPhone and iPad, changing it from just a grid of apps into a slightly more dynamic page, with widgets and other rich features.How dramatic and substantial those changes are could depend largely on how well Apple\u0027s engineers have been able to work remotely, and how well that is likely to continue – Apple is notoriously not set up for remote working, and has had some trouble adjusting to life under lockdown. As such, some of the more major changes may be held back.The company might also be keen to focus on performance and stability rather than radical new features, given that the latest versions of iOS and MacOS have both come under scrutiny for bugs and other issues. All of Apple\u0027s big platforms are now relatively mature, and so bigger features are perhaps unlikely.But the biggest of all the updates isn\u0027t going to be about software – or not purely. Instead, rumours have suggested that Apple could be about to finally unveil its switch to ARM processors, and away from Intel.Announcing this at a software conference would make perfect sense, given that developers will have to work to ensure that their apps and products work with Apple\u0027s new architecture.Such a change has only happened once before, nearly 15 years ago, when it switched from PowerPC to Intel. Back then, its Mac business was much smaller and other products like the iPhone did not even exist, and it was simply switching between two different third-party companies – meaning that this change is likely to be even more significant.Created with Sketch.Gadget and tech news: In pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.125 Gun-toting humanoid robot sent into spaceRussia has launched a humanoid robot into space on a rocket bound for the International Space Station (ISS).

It could also bring changes to the platforms in other ways, since the hardware will be more akin to the iPad and iPhone than it has been in the past.In the days and weeks running up to WWDC, Apple has faced criticism over the ways it runs its platforms from both regulators in the US and Europe, as well as the developers and companies who make apps for them. Critics have argued that the company abuses its dominance on the iPhone and of the App Store, which it has used to unfairly promote its own services and take a cut from transactions that developers say they don\u0027t deserve.Apple has already responded to these concerns a little, with a new report that suggested most of the revenue facilitated by the App Store isn\u0027t actually passed through Apple\u0027s payment systems. While that did not specifically address either the antitrust investigations or developer disquiet, it appeared to be specifically aimed at those who argue that the company is acting unfairly.The company might choose to address it again as WWDC continues. As well as the keynote that kicks off the week, it also holds sessions with developers, during which it might choose to address those frustrations.Of course, the threat might not be quite so bad as it would be if WWDC were being held in real life: there won\u0027t be the opportunities for developers to get together and discuss these issues, or any response to them. But the event nonetheless serves as an organising point for developers, and discussion of the terms of their work with Apple.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Mr Uddin is one of a number of suppliers who say that Sir Philip’s fashion empire has refused to pay for millions of pounds worth of orders, leaving them struggling to pay workers and keep the lights on.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMr Uddin told The Independent that he was forced to shut down production two weeks ago because cancelled orders meant his cash flow had dried up and he could not pay money owed to suppliers of materials. He said he is now paying out $25,000 per day in costs but has no income, and now fears that without an urgent resolution he will have to close his doors for good.The Bangladesh Export Processing Zone, where Denim Expert’s factory is located, has suspended Mr Uddin’s import and export permissions because of unpaid rent and utility bills. Goods that were due to be shipped out in February and March have been sat in containers at the port incurring charges each day.“With payments virtually suspended since the outbreak started, there has been a catastrophic impact upon the cash flow of our operation, which functions on very low margins at the best of times,” Mr Uddin said. Millions of garment workers facing destitution as demand dries upHe now has potential orders from other companies pending but does not have the cash available to fulfil them because of money tied up in goods produced, or currently in production, for Burton, an Arcadia Group company.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailAccording to campaign group Traidcraft, around 70 per cent of the cost of the garments is for the raw materials that go into them. Most manufacturers take this material on credit and pay it off when buyers pay them for the finished goods, meaning that when money is not forthcoming they quickly run into problems. Arcadia said it had no direct relationship with Denim Expert but confirmed that it did have outstanding orders for the company’s goods via a third party which buys jeans from a number of factories.Following media coverage of Mr Uddin’s problems with Arcadia and other buyers, an Arcadia representative contacted Denim Expert but no agreement has been reached. The company offered to buy some of the goods but not until August, an offer which Mr Uddin said he could not accept. An Arcadia spokesperson said the group was “in ongoing discussions” with its suppliers, including Denim Expert, to come to an agreement about the cancelled orders. The group has been in financial difficulty in recent years, narrowly avoiding administration in June 2019 after landlords backed a rescue deal at the last minute. Under the deal, 50 stores were earmarked for closure and 1,000 people lost their jobs. Former Debenhams employees raise money for Bangladeshi workersWhy coronavirus could add fuel to fast fashion’s fireRenting could be the trick to help me curb my fast fashion habitsLike the rest of the fashion retail sector, Arcadia has also been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic and lockdown, which forced all non-essential stores to close on the 23 March.Mr Uddin is one of hundreds of suppliers to the fashion industry facing imminent closure after months of unpaid orders.While some buyers, including H\u0026ampM and Zara, have honoured the majority of contracts and paid for orders, others such as Asda, Arcadia and Edinburgh Woollen Mill have demanded steep discounts or failed to pay for goods altogether.According to data published in April by the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA), the Arcadia Group cancelled £9m worth of orders in Bangladesh alone.Usually in manufacturing industries like this, whatever the buyer wants, you have to accept. That’s how it’s been for the last 100 yearsGlobally, the group, which is owned by Sir Philip’s wife through a holding company in Monaco, cancelled as much as £100m, according to The Worker Rights Consortium (WRC).Mr Uddin added: “I am not interested to work with Arcadia any more. I want to get rid of them as a buyer. Usually in manufacturing industries like this, whatever the buyer wants, you have to accept. That’s how it’s been for the last 100 years.“I have made up my mind. I only want to work with the people who are fair and responsible.”Fiona Gooch, senior policy advisor at Traidcraft Exchange, said: “It is terrible that factories are having to close in Bangladesh, and other garment producing countries, through no fault of their own. “By refusing to pay up, brands like Philip Green’s Burton Menswear are putting thousands of workers, mainly young women and their families at risk of destitution. “Philip Green is a millionaire. Like other fashion brand owners, he can easily afford to pay for the finished clothes that they have previously ordered, and the fabric bought to make future orders for them.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But the bank’s purchasing programme provides some useful insurance against itAs the saying goes: “A billion here, a billion there – soon you’re talking serious money.”How about hundreds of billions?The Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee has voted to increase its asset purchase scheme by another £100bn. This comes on top of the £200bn it committed to purchasing earlier in the year.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWhat does that mean?The dirty truth about washing your handsWhat is the difference between Covid-19 and the common cold and flu?Can face masks really protect you against coronavirus or flu?The UK government’s four stages of fighting coronavirus explainedWhat are symptoms of coronavirus – and where has it spread?The first thing to note is that the bank will now be purchasing £300bn of UK government bonds in 2020.That’s roughly equivalent to the projected deficit of the UK government in the current financial year to pay for all its emergency coronavirus-related spending, including the jobs furlough scheme.It’s not quite correct to say that the bank is funding the state’s spiralling deficit during this crisis.The projected public-sector net cash requirement is actually more than £400bn and private investors will have to buy the debt first and then sell to the bank.Yet it’s abundantly clear to everyone in the financial markets that the bank is acting as an effective backstop for government’s borrowing.Does that matter?It certainly matters for UK government bond investors.They know they can be confident that when they buy UK government bonds – known as gilts – from the Debt Management Office they will be able to sell them on to the bank.That removes any fear that they will be stuck holding bonds that no one else wants to buy.This should stabilise the market for UK government debt, meaning that it can continue to borrow to support millions of ordinary British workers and businesses.It’s far from clear that there was any danger of a crisis in the UK government bond market. But the bank’s purchasing programme provides some useful insurance against it.Will it help the economy directly? The bank says the asset purchases should help support demand – or spending – in the economy. The evidence here is somewhat mixed. It’s plausible that purchases helped do that in the immediate wake of the financial crisis. But the power of successive rounds of asset purchases to support demand directly seemed to weaken.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In part that’s because previous warnings of an inflationary spiral proved unwarranted.It’s also because the Bank is no outlier it’s doing pretty much the same as other big central banks such as the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank. The Fed has effectively promised unlimited bond purchases in this crisis.£100bn is serious money in anyone’s book. But the reality is that, in the world of central banking in the era of Covid-19, it’s nothing particularly special.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

A further 38 per cent believe their company could operate “largely effectively” and another 24 per cent “somewhat effectively”.While the government is increasingly coming under fire for the way it has handled the outbreak, more business leaders back its response that criticise it.Half (48 per cent) said the government’s response to coronavirus when it comes to business has been good, compared to 38 per cent who said it has been bad, and 13 per cent who said neither.Respondents were largely pessimistic about the economic outlook.

Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by email“As partial lifting of the measures takes place, we see signs of some activity returning,” said Mr Bailey in the press conference.But he added: “We don’t want to get too carried away by this. Let’s be clear, we’re still living in very unusual times.The minutes of the MPC’s meeting warned: “While recent demand and output data had not been quite as negative as expected, other indicators suggested greater risks around the potential for longer lasting damage to the economy from the pandemic.”Voting against further stimulus measures, Mr Haldane said that the recovery was happening “sooner and materially faster” than had been forecast in May.Data on payments suggest consumer spending started to recover in May and June, and the housing market has recently begun to pick up, the bank said.Official figures released last week show that gross domestic product (GDP) slumped by a record 20.4 per cent in April as the country endured a full month of lockdown conditions, and has now contracted by a quarter since the Covid-19 outbreak began.The UK economy is forecast to be hit harder than that of any other developed nation.The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said last month that UK output will shrink 11.5 per cent this year or 14 per cent if there is a second wave of coronavirus cases.The extra £100bn stimulus announced on Thursday will be used to buy gilts – UK government debt – with purchases to be completed by the end of 2020.Government spending has soared to cover the cost of schemes to support businesses and jobs. Public sector borrowing is expected to surpass £300bn this year.The bank says the asset purchases should help support demand – or spending – in the economy, which has fallen dramatically during the pandemic.There had been some speculation that the bank might cut its key benchmark interest rate to below zero for the first time.But there was no discussion of this in the MPC minutes.At the press conference Mr Bailey said that it remained an option but stressed there was no reason to expect it to be introduced imminently.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

He joined Google as CEO in 2001, when the company had back several hundred employees, and became its executive chairman in 2011 when co-founder Larry Page became CEO. Schmidt stepped down from his chairman role in 2017.“There\u0027s no question that information from Huawei routers has ultimately ended up in hands that would appear to be the state,” Mr Schmidt added in a BBC Radio 4 documentary.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSchmidt continued to say that Huawei represents a challenge to the United States because of the quality of products it is manufacturing.“It\u0027s extremely important that we have choices,” he said. “The answer to Huawei... is to compete by having a product and product line that is as good.”China \u0027trying to use Huawei to drive a wedge\u0027 between US and UKIn response, Huawei denied these allegations. “It is simply not true,” Victor Zhang, Huawei\u0027s UK chief told the BBC.The US government has yet to reveal evidence that Huawei is compromising its technology at the behest of the Chinese state.In some cases, it has argued that lack of evidence points to China’s motives, with US officials comparing it to a Trojan Horse that must be inside the gates before revealing its true intentions.Schmidt also said that he underestimated China’s potential as innovators, but denied that state-directed investment is inherently better than the free market.“That they\u0027re very good at copying things, that they\u0027re very good at organising things, that they throw large numbers of people at it. But they\u0027re not going to do anything new. They\u0027re very, very good at stealing, if you will, our stuff.

They are putting it in a different way, it is state-directed in a way that is different from the West. We need to get our act together to compete.”Instead, Western companies need to invest more into research funding, have greater collaboration between the private sector, the state, and academia, and open its doors to talent from around the world, he said.Mr Schmidt also warned against the rise of nationalism and protectionism around the world. “Once you erge these global platforms, you don\u0027t get them back,” he said.The comment comes after Donald Trump renewed an executive order against Huawei and other Chinese companies, stopping US firms including Google from working with them.“We benefit from having a common platform of interchange... and I worry that by building these platforms separate, the countries will understand each other less, Mr Schmidt said.”China\u0027s going to dominate whether we couple or decouple. They have the resources, they have the money, they have the technology. The question is do they operate on global platforms or do they operate on their own platforms? The more segregated the platforms are, the more dangerous it is.”“It is in the West\u0027s interest that every technology platform has Western values in them.”Schmidt previously advocated for Google to work with the Chinese government to create a censored search engine. “In 2010, I was in favour of remaining in China because I believed they would be better to stay in China and help change China to be more open,” he told the BBC.Google since ended its work in China, codenamed Project Dragonfly, last year.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.World Health Organisation (WHO) experts have emphasised the need for a successful test, track and isolate programme to be in place to avoid a possible second wave of Covid-19 infections in the autumn.Dr Hans Kluge, the WHO’s European regional director, said contact tracing and quarantining people who may be infected with coronavirus was an “essential element” in mitigating a potential second wave.The comments come as MPs were told on Wednesday that the highly-anticipated NHS contact-tracing app may not be ready until the winter and “isn’t a priority” for the government. The app is currently being piloted in the Isle of Wight.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSpeaking at a WHO briefing on Thursday, Dr Kluge said it is possible for a second wave to occur when autumn begins, in the same way flu cases peak towards the end of the year.“It’s well possible that when the autumn starts and we have also the seasonal influenza, there is the possibility of a seasonal effect on the virus – but we’re not sure yet – that then we will see a second wave.Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?“So the lesson is that we have to implement what we know works – at the core of the strategy is to find as early as possible, isolate, test suspected people from Covid, and if needs be treat them without any stigma or discrimination.“At the same time, (governments need) to track and quarantine contacts – contact tracing is an essential element of this strategy,” he added. “But there is no single solution.”The Department of Health said on Thursday that 5,949 people testing positive for Covid between 4-10 June were referred to the tracing scheme, of whom 4,366 were contacted and provided details of their movements – likely representing only a small proportion of the actual number of people infected.Dr Kluge warned earlier this week that the UK remains in a “very active phase of the pandemic” and urged caution in lifting restrictions.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by email“As partial lifting of the measures takes place, we see signs of some activity returning,” said Mr Bailey in the press conference.But he added: “We don’t want to get too carried away by this. Let’s be clear, we’re still living in very unusual times.The minutes of the MPC’s meeting warned: “While recent demand and output data had not been quite as negative as expected, other indicators suggested greater risks around the potential for longer lasting damage to the economy from the pandemic.”Voting against further stimulus measures, Mr Haldane said that the recovery was happening “sooner and materially faster” than had been forecast in May.Data on payments suggest consumer spending started to recover in May and June, and the housing market has recently begun to pick up, the bank said.Official figures released last week show that gross domestic product (GDP) slumped by a record 20.4 per cent in April as the country endured a full month of lockdown conditions, and has now contracted by a quarter since the Covid-19 outbreak began.The UK economy is forecast to be hit harder than that of any other developed nation.The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said last month that UK output will shrink 11.5 per cent this year or 14 per cent if there is a second wave of coronavirus cases.The extra £100bn stimulus announced on Thursday will be used to buy gilts – UK government debt – with purchases to be completed by the end of 2020.Government spending has soared to cover the cost of schemes to support businesses and jobs. Public sector borrowing is expected to surpass £300bn this year.The bank says the asset purchases should help support demand – or spending – in the economy, which has fallen dramatically during the pandemic.There had been some speculation that the bank might cut its key benchmark interest rate to below zero for the first time.But there was no discussion of this in the MPC minutes.At the press conference Mr Bailey said that it remained an option but stressed there was no reason to expect it to be introduced imminently.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Nasa says most neutron stars are billions of years old.Neutron stars are dense clusters of material that are remnants of a star going supernova and exploding.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe latest star is a specific kind of object known as a magnetar, and it is the youngest of them ever to be seen.The material in a neutron star is so dense, that Nasa says a teaspoon of the material would weigh four billion tons under the Earth’s gravity.It was spotted on 12 March, after releasing a massive burst of x-rays. Studies conducted by the European Space Agency\u0027s XMM-Newton observatory and Nasa\u0027s NuSTAR telescope were then able to confirm its age.Radio blasts with \u0027regular rhythms\u0027 coming from spaceIts x-ray emission became at least 10 times brighter than normal, but these instances happen very rapidly so scientists have to be swift to observe the activity.There can be a sudden increase in brightness over a few days, that’s followed by a gradual decline over months and years.“This object is showing us an earlier time in a magnetar\u0027s life than we\u0027ve ever seen before, very shortly after its formation,” said Nanda Rea, a researcher at the Institute of Space Sciences in Barcelona.This particular star is located in the constellation Sagittarius and is relatively close to Earth - only about 16,000 light-years away.Using that measurement, scientists were able to calculate when the light we were seeing started to be emitted.Many scientific models suggest that the physical properties stars like these change as they age, being the most active when they are younger.Newly-created samples are rare, however, so it’s likely data gathered from Swift J1818.0-1607 will be used to help refine these models.In addition to X-rays, magnetars can release huge bursts of gamma rays, the highest energy form of light in the universe, and steady beams of radio waves, the lowest energy form of light in the universe.Neutron starts which emit these radio waves are called radio pulsars, and Swift J1818.0-1607 is one of only five known magnetars that are also radio pulsars.“Each time you find one it\u0027s telling you a different story. They\u0027re very strange and very rare, and I don\u0027t think we\u0027ve seen the full range of possibilities.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Two of the stores – in Ross-on-Wye and Leominster – reopened on Monday 15 June.“Being able to shop in person, especially at smaller independents, is a joy,” owner Andy Rossiter, pictured above, says. “I think lockdown made a lot of people realise that they don’t want all their shopping to just land at their door, but booksellers also know they need to work hard for their audience. It’s not simply a case of just opening your doors.”Rossiter has been busy preparing the stores, moving fixtures and checkouts so that staff and customers can socially distance while browsing for books.Carry out a risk assessment: employers will need to carry out Covid-19 risk assessments in consultation with their workers or trade unions.Maintain social distancing: employers should redesign workspaces to maintain social distancing between people and stagger start times.Manage transmission risk:\u0026nbspemployers should look into putting barriers in shared spaces, creating workplace shift patterns or fixed teams.Reinforcing cleaning processes: workplaces should be cleaned more frequently, paying close attention to\u0026nbspdoor handles and keyboards.“We have installed Perspex screens at till points, bought hand sanitiser stations for the entrances to our stores and placed tape and signage throughout so we can clearly indicate the social distancing rules within our stores,” he says.The bookshops have reopened with less members of staff and they have limited their opening hours from their pre-lockdown seven days to just five. Rossiter has also been consulting staff and getting their input on the UK Government’s coronavirus advice.“Our trade body, the Booksellers Association, has been brilliant at reading and interpreting this advice to make it bookshop-specific and releasing it in digestible and accessible weekly bulletins, he says.“Booksellers love serving customers, and we’ve been serving our local community for a decade, so seeing those regulars again and having that relationship start to return to normal will be fantastic.Surinder Josan, owner of All Seasons DIY, a family-run shop, explains how he has used strict safe workplace measures to keep his shop doors open and his businesses afloat.“All Seasons DIY is a family-run shop which was established over 40 years ago, run by myself, my wife, and my mother. My son and daughter work in the shop around their university studies as well,” Josan, below, says.The family decided to shut the shop when school closures were announced. But after just a week they decided to reopen the business in order to serve the local community, who relied on the store for essential food and other items.“In order to reopen, we had to reassess how we both serve and interact with our customers,” Josan explains. “We adopted several new measures to comply with social distancing to keep both ourselves and our customers safe.”These new measures they adopted included safe distance markers outside the shop, to limit the number of people in store at any one time, installing screens at the checkout areas, encouraging contactless payments, lowering the minimum card spend to £1, and offering hand wipes to customers.“The number of customers who have come in and complimented us for it is unbelievable. They say when they come here they feel really safe,” Josan adds.Blend Coffee Co is an independent coffee shop based in Portslade, East Sussex, near Brighton. The two directors behind the business, Oli Crawley and Tom Jennion, have introduced a range of measures so they could confidently reopen for staff and customers.“Our primary concern is to keep people safe, so to make sure our coffee shop was ready to be reopened we implemented a number of safer working measures,” says Crawley.These new measures included a deep clean of the shop prior to reopening, implementation of a new ordering layout and adopting a new policy which stipulates that no customers are allowed inside the store.Working alongside Crawley and Jennion are a further three members of staff.“Only the directors returned to work to alleviate any pressure on our barista team feeling they need to work,” says Crawley. “This also allows an operational analysis of all our new protocols to ensure they are efficient and safe.”The checkout system has now been moved to the front of the shop, Blend now only accepts card payments and there is a new waiting area outside the shop.This plan was developed after we undertook a risk assessment and analysis of the premises to ensure that customer-staff interaction could be maintained and sustained in a safe manner. We ran a test prior to reopening to ensure that our new measures would work and allow us and our customers to stay safe,” adds Crawley.For further information from the UK Government on how employers, employees and the self-employed can return to work safely, click hereThis is Government advice for EnglandWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Unfortunately, not long after her return, jobs began to get cancelled because of the intensifying Covid-19 crisis.She started looking for something else right away – and is currently living and working on New Moor Farm in Southminster, Essex, working with asparagus, having swapped fashion for food.Though a far cry from a usual career, Philip is enjoying her new setting. “Right now, I live on site on the farm, in one of the caravans in the orchard. It’s nice,” she explains. “The community is amazing. There are so many different characters on the farm. Everyone is really friendly and we’re all here for the same reasons: to help and to work.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHer day-to-day routine varies. “Most days I’m up at five, start working at six on the farm, in the packhouse,” she says. “Generally, I’m doing a little bit of everything, so I’m helping on the line, bundling, helping customers, grading – just helping out wherever I can.”Philip is among Brits across the country working on farms in order to help the industry continue despite the many obstacles presented by the Covid-19 pandemic.The temporary closure of much of the food and hospitality industry has left huge quantities of fresh produce at risk of going to waste. The pubs and restaurants that would usually purchase large amounts of vegetables remain shut and travel restrictions have prevented pickers from overseas working on the farms.Join the Pick For BritainThat’s why the Government is urging fit and healthy people looking for work across the country to get involved. The Pick For Britain initiative is helping to bring workers and employers together to ensure the farming industry can continue.From furloughed employees whose contracts allow them to work during this time, to university students on their summer breaks, it’s a great opportunity to earn money and meet new people – while helping Britain’s food industry during these unprecedented times.The growing season is only just getting started, so from now until September, bringing in the harvest requires a major effort. Visit pickforbritain.org.uk to find out moreEat seasonal and local vegBut that’s not the only way to support the industry right now. Simply eating more in-season local produce will help to prevent wastage.A wide range of vegetables are currently being harvested in the UK. These include asparagus, cucumbers, mushrooms, courgettes, spinach, summer squash, radishes, beetroot and tomatoes – and buying and cooking with this seasonal veg is a great way to contribute to the farming industry.​In need of some recipe inspo?

All the famous faces, including a picture of Sir Peter, are “fans” of the Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group.Each fragment will be signed by the artist and auctioned on Bidsquare, with bids starting at £325. The auction will be live until midnight on 26 June.The idea originated when London Advertising approached Sir Peter about the project as it wanted to use the mural to raise money for organisations helping people during the pandemic.Sir Peter, who also designed artwork for Paul Weller, Ian Dury and The Who, said: “I’m very happy that the Mandarin Oriental mural can be used a second time to raise money for such a wonderful purpose.

But organisers stepped up after the lockdown began and started providing 5,000 meals a week to families in Poplar struggling to afford or access food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesDizzee volunteered as part of his work with Kitchen Social – the Mayor’s Fund for London programme providing food for children across the capital during the school holidays. “I was given an amazing opportunity to visit and help out Kitchen Social at Bygrove Primary School in Poplar, who are providing free food, books and school equipment to kids in the local area where I grew up,” he said.“Thank you to all the amazing people I met and thanks to the Mayor’s Fund for London for connecting the dots.”How to support our campaignBygrove Primary School is also receiving vital supplies from The Independent’s Help the Hungry campaign appeal partner The Felix Project.The food surplus charity, which delivers to hundreds of food banks and community projects across London, began helping the school at the start of the crisis by dropping off one or two trays of fresh produce and staple items each week.The charity has since increased the supply from one or two trays of food each week to 40 trays to help organisers cope with the huge demand.Mark Causton, manager of the school’s initiative, said: “The Felix Project have been an immense help – I can’t praise them enough. We know we’ll need to carry on this work right through the summer, so we rely on all the fresh food they’re supplying.”Mr Causton added: “We’ve seen a lot of parents furloughed or losing work over the past couple of months. In the case of some families struggling to afford to buy shopping, this is one of their only sources of getting food for their children.“It was really great to have Dizzee Rascal here helping out. He got stuck in, and got on so well with all the volunteers and all the families. It was just nice to see a smile on a lot of people’s faces.”The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis – find out how you can help here.

Figures from the Independent Food Aid Network (IFAN) show a 175 per cent rise, with both charities reporting this their “busiest period ever”. Furthermore, a survey by the giving platform Neighbourly of 900 charities and community groups providing food to the vulnerable found that 70 per cent expect the situation to get even worse in the next six to 12 months.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Independent proprietor Evgeny Lebedev paid special tribute to the almost 6,000 ordinary iniduals who have dug deep to contribute to our appeal. He said: “Time and time again Londoners have shown that they are capable of immense generosity and community spirit in this period of crisis.“To all those that donated, bought and bid — I salute you.”Morgan Stanley said the bank and its employees in London had made the donation as part of their global Covid-19 response.How to support our campaignClare Woodman, head of Morgan Stanley EMEA, said: “The Felix Project plays a vital role in distributing food to people in need, especially those severely impacted by the pandemic. I am proud our employees in London are supporting them as part of our Covid-19 Hunger Relief Campaign.”Another substantial donor was Partners Capital investment group, which donated £95,287.John Collis, head of Partners Capital, Europe, said they “selected The Felix Project as one of our charities to support during this difficult period as it is one of the most impactful charities in London today”.Heads down for quiz nightThe original Top Gear trio — Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May — will tonight host a special Zoom quiz in aid of our appeal partner, The Felix Project. Participants in the Quintessentially Foundation’s “World’s Greatest Quiz Night” will face five rounds of questions devised by Nicholas Shearing, questions producer for top British TV quiz shows Pointless, Debatable and Impossible. May, who has driven Felix vans delivering food to vulnerable Londoners throughout lockdown, said: “At least in this stay-at-home pub quiz version, it will be easy to cheat.” 7.30-9pm. Tickets £10: thefelixproject.orggreatestquizOur appeal was also boosted by the silent auction, in partnership with Quintessentially Foundation, which closed this week with 135 bids placed for 36 lots and raising almost £40,000.The most highly prized lots were two tickets to a Liverpool FC game, four tickets to the Euro 2021 semi-finals, a video-chat with Spurs coach Jose Mourinho, a private guitar lesson with singer-songwriter Ellie Goulding and a helicopter lesson.The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis – find out how you can help here.

After paying rent and all her bills from the universal credit she receives at the beginning of the month, she now finds she has just £4.30 left over for food and nappies for the rest of the month.How to support our campaignSo she is almost entirely dependent on school vouchers available for her oldest two children (£15 per child per week) to buy absolute essentials, and one weekly food package dropped off by the Sufra food bank.“I don’t mind going hungry sometimes, so long as my kids have food,” said Ms Sarri-Gonzalez. “Sometimes I might have just one main meal for myself in a day. There was one point during lockdown I didn’t manage to eat anything for myself for two days, almost three days. But I always set the table for the children – I keep things as normal as possible for them.”“It’s so difficult at the moment. So stressful. I’m hoping when the kids go back to school later in the year I can go back to work and make things easier somehow.”The Independent’s Help the Hungry campaign appeal partner The Felix Project has quadrupled the volume of surplus food it gets out to people in need since the crisis began.The work remains as urgent than ever. The most recent YouGov poll for the Food Foundation charity shows over 1.5 million people in households with children have been unable to access food for economic reasons during the lockdown.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Watching parents struggle to put food on the table and go without food themselves is devastating.”Rebecca Archer and her partner – who have three girls aged eight, six and three at home in London’s High Barnet – have found it difficult to afford enough food during lockdown. “The shopping I do is costing a lot more with them at home all the time,” she said.Once the bills are paid and the main weekly shop is done on a Monday, the couple finds they have about £50 left to get through the week – about half the amount they usually had before the pandemic hit.The family has recently taken advantage of two £15-a-week school vouchers they get for their two oldest girls, and receive some cooked meals from their neighbour Katie-Louise Barber – a volunteer delivering food using The Felix Project’s supplies.“It’s been a real strain. Thinking and worrying about money all the time isn’t easy,” said Ms Archer. “I never thought I’d be worrying about having enough for the children to eat. There was one point we just didn’t have enough for the pre-paid gas meter, so we had to go without that for more than a week.”The Trussell Trust, which runs the country’s biggest network of food banks, has warned food charities cannot cope “indefinitely” with the huge spike in demand for help caused by the pandemic.A coalition of anti-poverty charities had written to the chancellor asking for an emergency income support scheme that would increase child benefits and end the five-week wait for initial universal credit payments.Anthony Cotterill, leader of the Salvation Army in the UK, warned: “It’s years since we have seen poverty to be such a real and present danger for so many people. We are approaching a poverty tipping point.”The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis. Find out how you can help here.

Viruferrin has been scientifically proven to block 98 per cent of similar viruses to Covid-19, including influenza and Sars.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe snood-like coverings can be worn for up to 50 hours before they need washing, and their effectiveness only drops to 96 per cent after over 200 hours of wear.The face coverings are cut and sewn together by Cookson \u0026amp Clegg in Blackburn, which is run by Patrick Grant, star of the Great British Sewing Bee. He is also behind a campaign to get Britons making their own coverings, The Great Community Sew.How to support our campaignThe coverings, which retail at £20, are different to medical grade PPE used by NHS workers. However, due to the protein coverings they are more effective than standard face masks at protecting wearers from viruses.There was a buzz at the Royal Park Felix Project depot when boxes of Virustatic Shield coverings arrived.David Clark, who has been volunteering for three years, said: “I think it is important to wear these face coverings when you’re delivering to members of the public who potentially come into contact with vulnerable people.”Mr Clark dropped off some coverings to Ian Breen, centre manager at Acton Homeless Concern, which serves hot meals five days a week to those in temporary accommodation or on the streets. Mr Breen said: “It is fantastic to have a delivery of some masks for free. It is important to protect those working here and the people who use our centre.”Gretchen Fisher, from Ealing, who has been volunteering for four years, added: “I wear them whenever I go out as you have to protect others.” Mantas Keblis, the depot manager, said that having “extra precautions” would help food reach more people in London. “Everyone really likes them.

And today, because of the enormous generosity of Virustatic Shield, whose innovative anti-viral snoods we’ve also been producing, 10,000 of London’s most vulnerable people will receive a vital face covering, delivered to them via The Independent’s fantastic campaign.Which star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day It is now mandatory to wear face coverings on public transport, but these coverings are in short supply.That’s why we started The Big Community Sew to encourage people to make face coverings for their friends and neighbours, and by doing so preserve vital supplies of PPE for NHS workers and care home staff who are fighting this virus on the frontline.The science behind face coverings is simple: they help prevent the wearer from unwittingly spreading the disease.

As soon as it became possible for Alison to lodge her amendment, the upsurge in public support has been momentous.William Hague calls on UK and China to fight illegal wildlife tradePlea to Boris Johnson to lead G20 drive for global wildlife trade banHundreds of animals need new homes after zoo closesMan arrested over death of pregnant elephant in Kerala“Different reasons given by the grouse shooting industry for the supposed need to control mountain hares, such as the prevention of looping ill, a disease carried by ticks, have been successively discounted and animal welfare has taken precedence.”Figures from the Scottish Government show 26,000 mountain hares are killed on average every year on grouse shooting estates, said Revive, a coalition for grouse moor reform. Last year, the conservation status for hares was downgraded to ‘unfavourable’ due to declining numbers.Max Wiszniewski, campaign manager for Revive, said: “Iconic mountain hares are in decline and only legal protection will prevent their numbers falling. Today common sense has prevailed and the Scottish Parliament has voted overwhelmingly to pass this amendment.“There is a circle of destruction that surrounds grouse moors and this includes the mass killing of this iconic mountain hare. The intensive management of grouse moors in Scotland, it would seem, stops at nothing to maintain the land for a single species no matter what the impact that has on wider ecology.”However, the decision drew criticism from the Scottish Gamekeepers Association, which defends the interests of gamekeepers, wildlife managers and rangers in the country.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The system has failed them.

It has four core beliefs: family, integrity, teamwork and success – all integral pillars of its Reconnection to Recovery and Resilience programme.Put together by Sharon Gray OBE and the federation’s head teachers, it’s designed to welcome pupils back to class after lockdown. “Everybody in the Embark community has done their bit,” says Gray, a headteacher for 20 years, mostly in special schools supporting youngsters experiencing social, emotional and mental health difficulties and schools going through challenges.“It’s been all hands on deck,” executive headteacher and Trust leader of Embark’s schools Matthew Crawford adds. “Even two weeks into lockdown we were thinking about our children returning to school, whatever date that may be.”Safety at school1. Anyone who is unwell or been in contact with somebody showing coronavirus symptoms should stay away from schools, colleges and childcare settings2. Hands should be cleaned more often than usual with soap and running water for at least 20 seconds and dried thoroughly. Alternatively, hand sanitiser or alcohol hand rub can be used3. Promote the ‘catch it, bin it, kill it’ approach to coughing and sneezing4. Clean frequently touched surfaces regularly using standard products, such as detergent and bleach5. Help to minimise contact and mixing by altering classroom layout and timetablesWith regards to physical changes that parents and pupils can expect to see in corridors and classrooms, Embark is working with Government guidance and undertaking a thorough, bespoke risk assessment for each of its schools. “It can’t be a one-size-fits all approach,” Crawford stresses.According to Anna Upton – head of the 240-pupil Chaucer Junior School in Ilkeston, Derbyshire – questionnaires were sent out to reconnect with parents, through which they could express concerns and suggest ideas about the return to classrooms.According to Upton, staggered breaks and how drop-offs will work were important issues that were flagged in questionnaires. “But the risk assessment the Trust has put in has allowed us to make a comprehensive plan and we can communicate that to the parents,” she explains.“What the Trust have done with the programme is to implement nine stages which support our schools to open as safely as possible, supporting the staff parents and the children. The risk assessment means that I, as a headteacher, can do what’s right for my school.”Chair of trustees Sarah Armitage emphasises the importance of teamwork based around a guiding principle: families first. We look after families, so we reach out we talk.” she says.“Then there’s teamwork. Let’s harness the power of the team so it’s not the headteacher sitting by themselves with all these things to think about – that load is shared.”Armitage’s back-to-school outlook is optimistic too: “We have created something with this programme that we hope will be massively beneficial. Our role as leaders is to keep that going, carry on putting emotional needs at the heart of everything we do, because then children are able to learn and benefit – and move through this crisis.”Information in this article applies to schools in England only.

Please consider a contribution or subscription.Wearing face coverings is to be compulsory on public transport in England from 15 June, with fines for those who refuse, transport secretary Grant Shapps has announced.Speaking at the daily Downing Street press conference, Mr Shapps said the move was designed to prevent an upsurge in coronavirus infections as the country moves to the next stage of lockdown relaxation, with non-essential shops allowed to reopen.Mr Shapps said wearing a face covering would be made a “condition of travel” on public transport, allowing passengers to be refused carriage if they do not comply, with the British Transport Police called in to deal with those resisting the rule where necessary. Face coverings are not currently included in the Health Protection Regulations which give the police legal power to take action over lockdown breaches. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMr Shapps said: “As of Monday 15 June face coverings will become mandatory on public transport.“That doesn’t mean surgical masks, which we must keep for clinical settings. It means the kind of face covering you can easily make at home. There will be exemptions to these rules for very young children, for disabled people and those with breathing difficulties.”He added: “We need to ensure every precaution is taken on buses, trains, aircraft, and on ferries.”Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?“With more people using transport, the evidence suggests wearing face coverings offers some – albeit limited – protection against the spread for the virus.”Frontline staff such as bus drivers will also be required to wear face coverings, and Mr Shapps said the government will work with devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to try to make the change nationwide.The announcement was welcomed by London mayor Sadiq Khan, who has long lobbied for mandatory face coverings on the capital’s Underground system.“I’m pleased that our lobbying has paid off and the government has finally seen sense and made it mandatory for people to wear face coverings on public transport,” said Mr Khan.Mick Whelan, general secretary of the train drivers’ union Aslef, agreed: “This is a sensible step. We have been working closely with the government to ensure that agreed increases in services on Britain’s train and Tube network is done in a safe and controlled manner, to help spread the loading, and maintain social distancing for the safety of passengers and staff.“The instruction to wear face coverings to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus will ease the concerns of people travelling, and working, on the transport network.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive updates on politics every morning by emailHowever, scientists are ided over the value of homemade face coverings.Dr Antonio Lazzarino, of the department of epidemiology and public health at University College London, warned that their use might encourage people to wash hands less and to make more use of buses and trains, where face coverings will offer no protection against them being infected by touching handrails contaminated with the virus.“It is now commonly accepted that face coverings provide very little protection, if any. But one clear, logical, widely accepted side effect is that face coverings may give an excuse to easing other more important measures,” said Dr Lazzarino.“Will more people use the Tube or buses because they will feel more secure given that everybody wears a face covering? This will increase the risk of transmission.“Will people be able not to contaminate their hands and the handrails by not touching their face coverings and not touching the handrails while standing inside buses and trains? This seems to be impossible to me. Face coverings can therefore be a vehicle of infection, rather than a barrier.”But health care professor Prof Trish Greenhalgh of the University of Oxford said: “Face coverings aren’t 100 per cent effective, but they’re not zero per cent effective either.“I’ve seen evidence that a double layer of cloth is between 60 and 90 per cent effective in stopping the spread of viral-laden droplets coming from the wearer, and also that the same mask is also 30-50 per cent effective at stopping virus particles getting to the wearer. You can argue about the exact percentages, but overall, if everyone wears a face covering when they’re at close quarters, transmission is going to go down dramatically.”Dr Simon Clarke, associate professor in cellular microbiology at the University of Reading, said: “This policy will add more burden on the general public to prevent the spread of Covid-19. This is much more complicated than ‘wash your hands for 20 seconds’ or ‘stay at home’. We are asking the whole population of Britain, with no prior experience of mask-wearing, to overnight become competent makers, wearers, and maintainers of PPE.“I have seen no new evidence to suggest why the government is reversing its previous policy, and ignoring its previous scientific guidance and the guidance of the WHO. I’m left wondering if this is a political decision, rather than one based on science.”Labour’s shadow transport secretary Jim McMahon said: “This is just another example of the government being slow to act. Two months ago, Labour immediately backed the Mayor of London’s call for face coverings on public transport to be compulsory. Yet only now Tory ministers are acting.“Two months after first raising this with government we are still yet to hear whether drivers will be issued with gloves, masks, and other PPE items as standard, what specification this PPE should be and, if there isn’t sufficient PPE, whether buses should still run.“We can’t go on like this. We need a comprehensive transport plan to get our public transport moving, to protect staff and to protect passengers.”Network Rail chairman Sir Peter Hendy said he expected most passengers to comply with the requirement to wear face coverings.“I am not expecting a huge upsurge in railway staff having to police this,” he told the No 10 briefing. “I am expecting sensible passengers to do their duty and look after themselves and others.”Mr Shapps said that if people refused to comply they could be fined under new provisions in the national rail conditions of travel and the public service vehicle regulations for buses.“It is a condition of travel. You cannot travel unless you are wearing a face covering,” he said. “There will also be other powers so it could ultimately lead to fines. I very much hope we won’t be in that situation.”He said he did not expect enforcement action to be required on a regular basis, saying: “I expect the vast majority of people won’t need to be forced into this, because wearing a face covering helps protect others and most people simply want to help defeat this disease.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

So if no movie makes more than that on that specific day, we become the number one movie in America.”He said they had chosen to cap the number of screenings because they had to actually purchase the tickets to make the operation “legitimate”.A behind-the-scenes video shared by Tabach shows the two men attending their “premiere” dressed in tuxedos and enjoying popcorn.All the movies and TV shows coming to Netflix this monthFigures published by Box Office Mojo show that Unsubscribe was the top film in the US on 10 June, having brought in $25,488 – meaning Nilsson and Tabach’s plan was successful. ”We saw an absurd loophole in the system that at any other time would be impossible to exploit and thought it would be funny,” Nilsson told Patch.“Last year, the number one film at this time was The Secret Life of Pets 2. This year, it was a $0 budget horror film made over Zoom.”Unsubscribe was number three for the week ning 5 June to 11 June, also according to Box Office Mojo.The film is now available to rent on video-on-demand.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In Vietnam, rats are caught in rice fields – some traders breed them in farms with other live animals.For years scientists have warned that the wildlife trade – including wet markets that sell live animals – can harbour infectious diseases such as coronaviruses.The origins of the current Covid-19 pandemic remain contested. However, experts suspect that the disease started in bats and was transferred to another animal before being passed on to humans.The study, published in the bioRxiv journal ahead of peer-review, found six known coronaviruses in samples taken from three southern provinces in Vietnam between 2013 and 2014.New York rats feel the pressure of city livingPositives increased significantly along the supply chain.

In reality, Russian authorities struggled to enforce the ban, with Telegram moving to hide traffic behind mobile IP addresses. In often clumsy attempts to block access, regulators ended up switching off large chunks of the internet, including banks and even Gmail.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesEarlier this week, it was reported a number of government agencies had asked Roskomnadzor, Russia\u0027s media and internet regulator, to lift the formal ban on the messenger to allow them to use it legally. On its part, Roskomnadzor said the U-turn was made possible by Telegram\u0027s willingness to help their efforts to counter terrorism and extremism. Telegram update will add secure group video callsIn early June, Pavel Durov, Telegram\u0027s founder said that his team had developed ways to catch and delete extremist and terrorist content.The dispute between Russia and Telegram revolved around the app\u0027s commitment to end-to-end encryption, which keeps messages safe as they are passed over the service. Such technology means that it is not possible for companies to read messages in transit, and that only the sender and recipient are able to access them.Russia argued that this should not be possible, and that Telegram should store the keys to unlock and read those messages within Russia. That would allow them to read any messages they wanted to, which authorities argued was necessary to stop terrorism and other problem content.Roskomnadzor did not indicate how the two organisations had been able to overcome that issue. It did not say whether it now had access to those messages, or what changes had happened to the platform.Telegram and Mr Durov – who regularly uses the platform to communicate with its users – are yet to publicly comment on the decision.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And it couldnt come at a greater time of need: with our nation on the brink of the worst ever holiday hunger.The Covid pandemic has had a devastating financial impact on families up and down the country, with millions now struggling to keep a roof over their heads.Parents are, understandably, racked with anxiety over job losses, loved ones health and school closures, which have seen classrooms lie empty for  weeks.And this week, with the summer holidays looming, they faced another worry: how would they feed their children without free school meal vouchers Its a fear Rashford has bravely alleviated.The Man Utd star made an impassioned plea to the Government to prioritise Englands most vulnerable kids by extending the vouchers scheme over the six-week holidays.Under the programme, the families of around . million children eligible for free school meals are given £ a week in vouchers to spend in supermarkets to keep their kids fed.This is not about politics this is about humanity, Rashford wrote in an open letter. Political affiliations aside, can we not all agree that no child should be going to bed hungry The footballer was speaking from real experience: growing up in a low-income household in Manchester, his own family relied on free school meals and breakfast clubs.Today, a similar hand-to-mouth existence is being lived by millions of children across the country. And, in recent months, its been compounded by the coronavirus outbreak.Despite the Governments excellent furlough scheme, , Brits have lost their jobs during lockdown, with unemployment now set to hit the three million mark.As Rashford rightly observes, many families are living on a knes edge, gripped with fear over how they will pay their bills, cover their rent or even put food on the table.This is proven by new data from The Food Foundation, showing that food insecurity in households with children has nearly DOUBLED since the pandemic began.The research also reveals more than , youngsters have been forced to skip meals during lockdown because their family couldn’t access sufficient food.As Chair of the Commons Education Committee, I was delighted when, earlier this year, the Government extended its free school meals scheme for the Easter and May half-term holidays.Yet, like many, I believed its decision to halt the programme for the summer break was wrong.In my view, this was for three key reasons:Firstly, the vouchers have been a leline for many poverty-stricken families during the Covid lockdown. With further worrying and uncertain weeks ahead, these families need consistency.Secondly, and closely linked, is that millions of parents are struggling financially at the moment - something that may be exacerbated in August, when furlough contributions change.Feeding their kids over the summer will push their already stretched budgets to breaking point. Yet these youngsters desperately need, and deserve, nutritional meals.Thirdly, around three million children are at risk of holiday hunger every year .Extending the scheme was simply the right thing to do.It was also relatively easy: yes, its coming out of a £ million Covid Summer Food Fund, but unlike other schemes, it isnt bureaucratic and its understood by parents across England.It also goes to those who need it the most.Studies have shown that food poverty doesnt just impact on childrens health: malnourished kids are less likely to perform as well in the classroom as their better-off peers.This can shape the course of their adult le.England is already facing an educational Ice Ageschools cant open in September - by which point, children will have been out of education for six months.Despite parents home-schooling efforts,  per cent of teachers in the countrys most deprived areas have suggested their students are learning for less than one hour a day.And some , youngsters don’t have access to a computer or tablet at all.Its why Ive called for Alan Turing catch-up summer camps to be set up in school buildings, village halls and marquees - anywhere that can be used to educate our kids.Its also why, despite being a Tory MP, I publicly announced I would vote with Labour today and call on the Government to extend free school meals over the summer.To use a football analogy, it felt strange going to play for the opposite side. But like Rashford, I knew that impoverished families across the UK deserved more.Fortunately, Boris has seen sense, too.Amid this crisis, we need a bold vision from the PM about our childrens education: what are we going to do to get them learning again  How will we get them back to schools We need an exciting, confident agenda, because the next generation depends on it. With todays move, Boris has shown these families that, yes, we do mean business.As for Rashford, he has done as much -not more - for disadvantaged families than any politician. Hes brought a vital issue onto the national stage in a dignied way.Unlike virtue-signalling celebrities who fly on a plane from Los Angeles then go on about saving the environment, he has practised what he preaches.And in doing so, hes shown himself to be a nation icon on and off the pitch.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Well, the majority anyway.Be it scientist “Professor Lockdown” flouting his own advice, or Boris’s svengali Dominic Cummings bending the rules he helped make, the rot set in a couple of weeks ago and has now caused an undeniable fissure between the state and its initially compliant citizens.Yet, while thousands are blatantly breaking social distancing rules at parks, protests and shopping areas, many of them are still being furloughed — at vast taxpayer expense — to “stay home” from work.Whereas common sense dictates that being in an office that’s been health and safety-ed to the nth degree is a far more protected environment than any of the above.And what about schools  The majority of learning for GCSEs and A levels takes place in years  and  respectively, yet government plans for the \" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"reopening of secondary schools remain “unclear”, with some reports saying they might not evenin September.Meaning that — on top of GCSEs and A levels being cancelled this year — hundreds of thousands of pupils will be in no position to take them next year either.If teenagers can gather in large, cheek-by-jowl groups at their local park, then surely ing to school isn’t beyond the pale  It might even be safer.As for the hospitality industry, well, not only is the two-metre rule killing it but pubs, in particular, face the galling reality of remaining closed while their beer gardens are used by hordes of people who’ve bought booze at the local supermarket.Enough already. Time, surely, for the Government to open its eyes to what’s happening around the country and exercise some common sense.Of course those who are vulnerable should continue to take as many protective measures as they wish, including remaining furloughed or off schoolnecessary.But the majority should nowto work or schooland start to get Britain back on its feet, both economically and psychologically.SCIENTISTS say that intelligent le could exist on as many as  planets in our galaxy.But they reckon aliens won’t visit Earth because of the distance.The two-week quarantine rules won’t help either.HOLLYWOOD actress Sharon Stone has revealed she was struck by lightening while doing the ironing.What a terrible shock.No, not the estimated billion volts that propelled Sharon across the kitchen, silly.The fact that a movie star was doing her own housework.TATLER magazine’s \" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"controversial article on The Duchess of Cambridge proved that snobbery is still alive and kicking in certain sections of the British “upper” classes.Dredging up the age-old “doors to manual” jibe at Kate’s mother Carole, a former member of cabin crew, it also resurrected ancient, alleged whisperings among chinless wonders of her being “NQOCD” – not quite our class, darling.This week, Rosalind Mann died, after a -year career taking photos of posh “girls in pearls” for Country Le magazine.When asked the criteria for posing, she replied: “We never featured anyone whose house had a number.”There’s snobbery in the US too, but it’s largely centred around money, rather than class.In the compellingly vacuous Netflix series Selling Sunset, about a high-end estate agency in Hollywood, the buzz phrase is: “Millionaires have views, billionaires have compounds.”Sadly, I have neither.IN the next James Bond movie, No Time To Die, it’s reported that the legendary spy has a young daughter with Lea Seydoux’s character.Could this see those famous blue trunks being replaced by a papoose It’s tricky waters for Bond fans, with  per cent telling a recent poll that they think it’s a mistake to make the famous philanderer a family man.I’ll reserve judgment until the film is released, but suffice to say, tackling villains such as Le Chfre, Blofeld and Raoul Silva is child’s play compared to dealing with a toddler in meltdown.A PUNTER has placed a bet on Newsnight presenter Emily Maitlis becoming PM by the end of .A spokesman for bookmaker Coral said: “The bet took us by surprise but someone’s convinced Maitlis could be the perfect match for No!”Presumably they’re not taking bets on which party she’d stand for as that would be too obvious.RICKY Gervais says that wherever he is in the world, he always frequents Italian restaurants because: “I know it’s going to be good and the same.”We have a similar issue at Moore Towers where – whether we’re at a Greek, French, Chinese, Italian or Japanese restaurant – the Bloke will spend aeons studying the ious culinary delights on offer before ordering “steak and chips” pretty much every time.THE stylist and “best friend” to Meghan Markle, Jessica Mulroney, is embroiled in a race row after appearing to threaten the livelihood of black lestyle blogger Sasha Exeter.Jessica, who has apologised, has now been dropped from regular TV slots and, while the pair have reportedly spoken in private, the Duchess of Sussex has yet to support her friend publicly.Something tells me that, aside from saying: “I need to do better” regarding race and injustice in society, Jessica is about to learn another valuable lesson.Hard times will always reveal true friends.CLOTHING website Missguided has been heavily criticised by shoppers after using slim models to market its plus-range of clothes in sizes  to .One said: “This screams, ‘we want to profit from plus-sized iniduals without representing or supporting them in any way’.” Very true.Equally, those ads for accessible baths showers targeted at the elderly but featuring a woman in her forties with the agility of a mountain goat.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But given this country is facing its worst recession in decades, now is hardly the moment to be sinking taxpayer cash into overseas vanity projects with no possible benefit for Brits. If Boris is determined to stick to David Cameron’s pledge to splash . per cent of GDP on foreign aid, then let’s thank our lucky stars it will now be spent wisely.THREE cheers for Marcus Rashford, a magnicent role model who yesterday won his campaign to make sure Britain’s poorest kids get one square meal a day over the summer. We know it will have been tough for the PM to swallow his pride and U-turn. But it was the right thing to do:  parents struggling to feed their children need all the help they can get right now. And £million — the cost of extending free school meal vouchers during the holidays — is a drop in the ocean when you consider the overall cost of lockdown.We like Rashford’s style, too. How refreshing to see a celebrity using his fame to articulate a powerful argument with such authenticity. NEW unemployment figures make for grim reading. The number of people claiming  jobless benefits more than doubled to hit .million in May — the  highest level since . And because the furlough scheme is masking the true extent of the crisis, we fear the worst is yet to come. Scientists are trained to think about public health  in the narrowest sense. So their instincts tell them to keep Britain in lockdown for as long as possible. But elected politicians know that  poverty and  mass unemployment kill just as surely as the virus. It’s time they showed some leadership and started easing restrictions in earnest. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Government’s decision not to pay for the vouchers was mean-spirited and cheap.But you do wonder about a government which decides upon a policy — and then changes it as soon as a top footballer opens his mouth.Next week, Michael Gove decides to extend trade negotiations with the EU after an intervention by Harry Kane. And lockdown is lted completely when Kyle Walker says he wants to go to another house party.Still, Rashford was right and deserves credit. And he’s right, too, that the Government could go further in helping those of us who live in poverty. The pandemic has thrown the Government off course.It was bound to. But Boris and Co must remember why they were elected last December. They got a huge mandate from our country’s very poorest regions. The areas that usually support the Labour Party.That was partly because of Brexit, of course. And partly because the then Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn , was about as effective as a recently gassed badger.But it was also because Boris promised those former Labour heartlands what they wanted to hear.A closing of the ide between rich and poor, and between London and the rest of the country.Jobs, investment in new industries and transport infrastructure.He might think we’ve all forgotten. But we haven’t. The latest poll shows Labour only five points behind the Conservatives.The honeymoon is over.Boris could begin by increasing the minimum wage for people aged  and over. It is low wages, far more than unemployment, which is keeping people mired in poverty.It wouldn’t cost the Government very much at all. It would also provide a much-needed boost to the economy.An increase in free childcare from  hours per week to  hours would also enable those struggling to make ends meet to get out of the house and work for longer.Shortly after last December’s election, Boris turned up in the North East to give his thanks.He once again promised that the region would be rejuvenated.There’s been good news on some fronts — the Nissan plant at Sunderland, for example, won out over its rival in Barcelona. It will stay open, despite the loss of  jobs.But more needs to be done to attract industry to the North and the Midlands.So far as I can see, the Government has done nothing. OK, it’s had a few problems on its hands.But when this pandemic has passed, the Government will need to intervene to help our economy — the private sector alone cannot do it.And the place to start is away from London — in the places where the new breed of Tory voter lives.Marcus Rashford’s intervention was timely and needed. This Government needs to know the poor are watching and waiting. Waiting for action, waiting for the promises of last year to be delivered.THERE is a stupidity about the woke crowd, trying to ban everything, which defies belief.An old episode of Fawlty Towers was pulled. Because it had some disturbing and potentially offensive racial material in it.But as the star of it, John Cleese, tried patiently to explain – it was SATIRE.The character of Basil Fawlty was the subject of the humour. He was mocked for his idiocies. That’s why we laughed.The episode has now been reinstated – but the moron caravan has already moved on. Now they’ve got it in for Mahatma Gandhi. Racist! The bloke who fought for India’s liberation from British colonialism.Was he a racist  Yes, without much doubt. He took a pretty jaundiced view towards Africans. But the good he did easily outweighs the bad.And believe me, there isn’t a single person born before  who didn’t possess views which today’s society would consider offensive. Regarding race, or gender, or homosexuality. Not one.Why can these people not understand that the past was dferent  And that we judge its heroes in a dferent light There was a really nasty battle between the two sides, with many dead – the first time since .China continues to bully its neighbours and oppress its own people.In this battle, I know whose side I’m on.THE Government has not done much right recently.But at least Boris and Co are binning the Department for International Development.It is to be stripped of its status and merged with the Foreign Office.With any luck, this will mean we will not be giving away any more hard-earned taxpayers’ money to countries like India, which has its own space programme so is clearly not short of a bob or two.Or China – a nasty, totalitarian state and the second richest country in the world.In the last round of spending, we actually bunged money into a programme to help Chinese people improve their diets.Nope, not kidding.I wonderit mentioned anything about it maybe not being a great idea to eat bats Various studies have suggested these donations are worthless and often counter-productive.I think, right now, we need to spend money at home, no SCIENTISTS from Japan have predicted that within  years we will be able to understand what animals are thinking. We will be communicating with them.Uh-oh. Not sure that’s good. Imagine a chat with a wasp . . .“Hi, Mr Wasp. What you doing ”“I’m crawling up your window. What’s it to you  And it’s Ms Wasp, as it happens. I’ve transitioned. So don’t misgender me. Now, p*** off before I sting you on the neck.”Worse with cats. “LOVE you  WTF, I’ve never even liked you. You’re mugs, humans. Just put the food out and give me a warm place to sleep and I’ll purr for a bit to keep you happy. Now, excuse me. I’m going to sleep on the roof of the shed for six hours.”But I might start watching it now as the cast all seem to hate each other.The soap has been torn apart by rows over the Black Lives Matter debate.Lysette Anthony has taken loads of flack and her co-star Rachel Adedeji has described her as “actual trash”.Hmm . . . somehow I suspect the show will not be anywhere near as interesting as the row.NOT everything about lockdown has been bad. Far from it.My we hasn’t been to TK Maxx for three months, for a start. There’s a mercy.And we’re not using cash. There’s little indication we will need to use cash ever again.Those people who aren’t on the breadline have saved money.And then there’s offices. Will we really go back to that awful daily commute, when the vast majority of jobs can, these days, be done at home  Just think how many homes we could createwe converted all those empty offices into flats.Offices were created because we needed a place to store paper files. Don’t really need that now, do we The Government should encourage firms to move to home-working, when – the stats suggest – employees are a lot more productive.IN France – a country almost as badly hit by Covid- as the UK – the schools will be reopening on Monday. By law, no arguments. Full curriculum.Over here, meanwhile, there are suggestions that some schools will not be opening until JANUARY and will not open properly for a year.

It’s just easier than trying to do the school work.“It’s a way of escaping from everything.“I’m worried the teachers will be disappointed in me because I haven’t done enough work.“I’m worried I’ll fall behind and have to resit the year when all my friends go on.”And he is not alone. A study by University College London revealed that two million children have done barely any schoolwork at home.Since March, around  per cent of pupils have done none, or less than an hour, a day. And just  per cent put in more than four hours a day.Finn’s mum Kerrie, , a former secondary school teacher, admits she only ever sees her son at meal times.The single mum, who also has daughters Imogen, , and six-year-old Elodie, has found it hard to juggle home-schooling with working full-time as a social worker.She says: “When lockdown started I thought I’d be able to manage, especially because I used to be a teacher.“I was really motivated and ordered lots of stuff on Amazon to help. I think because the kids could see I was motivated it rubbed off on them.“But as time has gone on it’s become more dficult and challenging. I can’t give  per cent to my job and  per cent to teaching my kids. It’s just not possible.”Now Finn usually gets up around .am, has breakfast then switches on his games console — and stays up until midnight.Kerrie says: “I tried to get Finn to do schoolwork. With not enough computers for me and the kids to work, I even set written work for him.“But I couldn’t make him do it, no matter how much I encouraged him.” As we report today, more than , child health experts have signed an open letter to Boris Johnson demanding the Government publishes a clear plan to get all youngsters back to school as soon as possible or “risk scarring the le chances of a generation of young people”.The letter, organised by the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, warns children are “suffering enormously” from a lack of access to exercise, vaccinations and mental health support.m have done under an hour’s work a day, experts warn PM it will ‘scar a generation’This is par­ti­cu­larly concern­ing for Clare Cashion, , when it comes to -year-old daughter Libby.Clare, a civil servant from Worcester, who is also mum to Ollie, , Lochlan, four, and two-year-old Cullann, says: “Libby has gone from being a  hardworking student to a changed character, so I do worry about her wellbeing.”Libby now stays awake until am and usually gets up at about lunchtime. Instead of doing schoolwork, she spends most of her time talking to friends on social media.She says: “At first we didn’t know what we were supposed to be doing, and because there wasn’t proper work or anyone to check your work and because you can’t just ask questions, I didn’t want to do it.“When I did do it, I didn’t get any feedback, and then my friends would tell me they hadn’t bothered, so I just thought, ‘What’s the point ’.“I’m a huge worrier and I am concerned about falling behind, but I’d rather stay up and talk to friends on my phone. That’s when everyone is online.“Mum tries to make me do more schoolwork but it doesn’t work. There just doesn’t seem much point at the moment. “I’d just like to go back to school.”In a report last month, government advisory body Sage warned lockdown had caused a “shock” to kids that will last the rest of their lives and affect work opportunities.The report also confirmed the risk of children catching coronavirus was “much lower” than adults.Yesterday, MPs on the Education Select Committee accused teaching unions of running a “disgraceful political campaign” to keep classrooms closed by “cherry picking” evidence to make parents fear schools are “death traps”.Chairman Robert Halfon asked: “Can you explain why parents and children can have access to Primark over the coming weeks and months but not to schools ”For Libby and Clare, it will be a big relief when schools can reopen. Clare says: “School has now started online lessons, so one week they’ll be live, and  Libby has taken part in some, but the following week it’s just emails and sometimes they have to cancel.“I think Libby struggles with not knowing exactly what’s expected.”Finn is just as desperate to get back in the classroom.He said: “I really want to go back to school because it’s a lot easier to learn in a classroom with a teacher explaining the work, and I miss my independence.“I’ve found it really dficult being at home this long.”To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

An estimated one in five adults and one in six children dont get enough vitamin D - a problem that its feared could be being exacerbated by the lockdown. One study by Anglia Ruskin University found that European countries in which vitamin D deficiency is prevalent have seen elevated death tolls since the start of the pandemic. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, part of the Department of Health, has now announced a rapid evidence review looking at the trend, thereported. The results of the review are set to be published in the coming weeks. The Scientic Advisory Committee on Nutrition, which advises Public Health England and other government organisations on nutrition, will also complete a report. Heightened vulnerability caused by a lack of vitamin D could be part of the reason that both the elderly and certain ethnic minority groups have seen higher fatality rates from the virus.Melanin, the pigment that makes a persons skin darker, lowers the skins ability to produce vitamin D in response to sunlight exposure. The bodys ability to produce the vitamin also diminishes as a person gets older.  In April, Public Health England advised Brits to begin taking vitamin D supplements to help maintain bone and muscle health during the lockdown.Earlier this month, the Scottish government also recommended that anyone from an ethnic group with darker skin should begin taking the supplement. Officials are said to be discussing whether the supplement could be prescribed in hospitals to help mitigate the impact of any second wave.Professor Adrian Martineau of Queen Mary University, currently leading a study into the vulnerability to coronavirus of people with dferent lestyles, told the \" href\"https:www.the world  jun  uk-ministers-order-urgent-vitamin-d-coronavirus-review\" target\"_blank\" rel\"noreferrer noopener\" that the benefits of vitamin D could be considerable. Vitamin D could almost be thought of as a designer drug for helping the body to handle viral respiratory infections, he said.

So we have to make sure in that review...the virus is under control enough to make the change and to replace the  metre rule,that is the conclusion, with something that makes it easier to do, for instance, getting people back to school.Northern Ireland has now dropped guidance for people who were shielding because the threat of becoming severely ill from the virus was so high. Health Minister Robin Swann said people should still be cautious when out and about and follow strict social distancing.The news comes as: Children in reception, year one and year six are currently back in schools in England, with all students expected to be back in classrooms by September.Boris Johnson announced a full review into the metre rule in England earlier this week, as hospitality industry leaders piled pressure on the PM to relax the rule. Downing Streets Chief scientic adviser Sir Patrick Vallance has said the  metre rule can be relaxed in some circumstances. He said earlier this week: There are times in which this can be changed and that evidence of course can then be the basis of a policy decision on what the right distance is that should be mandated or put forward as the rule to follow. To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But when the coronavirus crisis struck, the two of them were plunged into compulsory lockdown on the beautul -acre isle off the Pembrokeshire coast. With only seabirds for company, the situation has left them even more isolated than usual. Sylwia, who is using her spare time to learn the ukulele, says: “Every few weeks we take our boat to collect our online supermarket order from friends, and we alternate cooking duties. “You need to be OK with being in isolation, and not being able to just pop to the shops. You have to plan ahead and be able to enjoy the changes in the weather.”  In normal times, Skomer attracts up to  visitors a day, drawn by the chance to see the island’s wildle - but coronavirus cut this off virtually overnight, and the Wildle Trusts was faced with having to withdraw the wardens. However, thanks to a grant from The National Lottery Heritage Fund – part of a wider £m National Lottery allocation to help good causes affected by the pandemic’s impact – Nathan and Sylwia can continue protecting Skomer’s unique bird habitats.  National Lottery players have raised £m which will support good causes through the coronavirus.

Their work involves collecting data on breeding seabirds, including puffins and Manx shearwaters, and helping to protect them from other species – humans among them. “The island is really fragile,” says Nathan. “Puffins and shearwaters nest in burrows, so the ground is like a honeycomb. It’s important that people stay on the paths.”  Both are missing their families on the mainland, though. Nathan is also craving ice cream, while Sylwia pines for fresh strawberries. Meanwhile they, and two other wardens, have been sharing their work online via video blogs. And despite the crisis, the pair are counting their blessings.  “We know how lucky we are to have a job on a remote island,” says Nathan. “We appreciate all the support from The National Lottery and the people who play it.” “It’s a very special place to work in and it’s definitely a privilege,” Sylwia adds Next we hear from another duo who have been separated from their loved ones in lockdown in Slough and find out how theyaposve been making the most of it too...

The Mirror understands the app under testing on the Isle of Wight only detected Android phones % of the time - and iPhones just % of the time. Conversely, testing of the system offered by phone manufacturers was accurate % of the time. But itaposs thought the built-in framework struggled to detect how far away another phone was - a crucial element of the test and trace procedure. Ministers were warned in May, when it was announced the Government would be pursuing its own system rather than Google and Appleaposs framework, that the phone manufacturers wouldnapost let third party apps use the bluetooth connection while the phone is locked. The built-in system works in the background - allowing a much greater rate of tracking contacts between devices.

The Health Secretary originally promised the app, which has been under testing on the Isle of Wight, would be rolled out across the nation in ‘mid-May’. The version under testing on the Isle of Wight has not been set up to tell anyone to self-isolate - instead warning them to pay careful attention to social distancing guidelinestheyaposve been close to someone who has reported symptoms.  Mr Hancock told Brits it was their “duty” to download it in large numbers in order to combat the spread of Covid-.

The Foreign Secretary said he thinks itaposs a symbol of subjugation and subordination - and bizarrely claimed the gesture against police violence was from the Game of Thrones. He added: [I] take the knee for two people - the Queen, and the missus when I asked her to marry me. After Labour branded the comments insulting and deeply embarrassing Mr Raab issued a statement on Twitter. He said: To be clear: I have full respect for the Black Lives Matter movement, and the issues driving them. If people wish to take a knee, that’s their choice and I respect it. We all need to come together to tackle any discrimination and social injustice. The Prime Ministeraposs official spokesman said: The Foreign Secretary was very clear he was expressing a personal opinion. He added: I think heaposs spoken about how he respects the fact that people may wish to take a knee and he said we all need to come together. Asked for the PMaposs own view of taking a knee, the spokesman added: Heaposs set out his views on the protests and the very strong sentiment which has been expressed over the past few weeks. Heaposs spoken about it at . And weaposre in the process of setting up the race commission in order to set out a positive agenda for change. The comments by the UKaposs chief diplomat - who is Boris Johnsonaposs deputy - sparked a fresh row over the governmentaposs response to Black Lives Matter protests.  Kneeling in protest for black people was popularised as a gesture in  by former San Francisco ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick. He knelt in protest against police brutality during the national anthem, prompting a furore over civil rights in the US. Kaepernick later said: I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of colour. “To me, this is bigger than football, and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.” But asked by TalkRadio todayhe would take a knee, Mr Raab said: I understand this sense of frustration and restlessness which is driving the Black Lives Matter movement. Iaposve got to say on this taking a knee thing, I donapost know, maybe itaposs got a broader history but seems to be taken from the Game of Thrones, feels to me like a symbol of subjugation and subordination rather than one of liberation and emancipation. But I understand people feel dferently about it so itaposs a matter of personal choice. Asked againheaposd do it he said: [I] take the knee for two people - the Queen, and the missus when I asked her to marry me. It is not clear why Mr Raab thought the gesture was from Game of Thrones - although the show does include people kneeling in subjugation to a new ruler.  Twitter users accused Mr Raab of being ignorant and said his comments were absolutely disgraceful... white privilege in Ultra HD. TV host Piers Morgan tweeted: Unbelievable.. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab thinks taking the knee is from Game of Thrones. This Government continues to shame us to the world. Shadow Justice Secretary David Lammy tweeted: This is not just insulting to the #BlackLivesMatter movement, it is deeply embarrassing for Dominic Raab. He is supposed to be the Foreign Secretary of the United Kingdom.  Labour MP Diane Abbott said: “Taking the knee began in  with American athletes refusing to stand for US national anthem. “They were protesting police brutality and racism. “But Dominic Raab thinks it comes from Game of Thrones!!! Lib Dem leader Ed Davey said: The fact our Foreign Secretary, who is also now going to be in charge of our aid budget, is totally ignorant about a global movement against racism is as shocking as it is concerning. SNP MP Stephen Flynn tweeted a ‘face palm’ emoji adding: “He says he ‘understands’ but then goes on to say that he thinks take the knee comes from Game of Thrones. “How can the actual Foreign Secretary not know about Colin Kaepernick ” "},{"url":null,"title":"hairdressers reopen within weeks northern","story":"NewsHairdressers to reopen within weeks in Northern Ireland as lockdown rules relaxedShielding guidelines will be \"paused\" from the end of July, and more children willto schools as social distancing rules are reducedShareCommentsByMikey SmithPolitical Correspondent:,  JUN Updated:,  JUN News \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The announcement was one of a series of lockdown relaxations announced by the executive on Thursday. It came alongside plans to reopen schools to more pupils by the autumn - and reduce the social distancing guideline from m to m for pupils. And shielding will be “paused” at the end of July. Ministers also detailed plans for childcare providers and child minders to resume full services as the summer progresses, with all parents being allowed to use childcare from July, not just key workers.

Away from childcare and education, guidance advising people in high-risk categories to shield during lockdown is to be paused at the end of July. A provisional date for hair salons, barbers and nail bars to reopen has been set for July , while church services are set to resume on June . There were no further coronavirus-linked deaths in the region on Thursday, leaving the total recorded by the Department of Health at . Mrs Foster said the plans for ato classrooms would be kept under review during the summer in line with latest data on Covid-. I do very much welcome the progress today as a major step forward towards normality in our schools, because it has been a very tough time for our children, for parents and of course for the teachers who have been supporting them remotely, she said. And I know that everyone wants to get back to classroom teaching.  She added: Our objective is to see a full-timeto classroom learning for all pupils as soon as possible when safe to do so. In the event that physical distancing is still required when schools , the executive, following scientic and medical advice, has agreed that schools plan on the basis of one-metre distancing between pupils. After advice from the Department of Health and the Public Health Agency, the Education Ministerhas advised that one-metre distancing will allow the school attendance pattern toclose to normality. Deputy First Minister Michelle OaposNeill thanked teachers for their efforts during lockdown. The contribution that teachers have made over the course of recent months in the most challenging circumstances has been exceptional and we really, really commend all that you have done in trying to keep our children educated throughout this period, it hasnapost been an easy journey for you all, she said. She added: The objective is to have schools opened on a full-time basis and to make sure that all pupils are back into school for classroom-based learning in a way that is safe to do so.

But on May  the Department of Health told the Mirror: There is no alternative app. It was revealed today that the contact tracing app - which was developed in-house despite experts warning it wouldnapost work - only identied % of contacts on iPhones.The Health Secretary insisted it worked well on Google Android devices - but blamed Apple for refusing to change their rules to allow their app to work.Mr Hancock defended the decision to abandon developing the NHSX app in favour of joining forces with the Apple and Google project. At the Downing Street press conference he said testing on the Isle of Wight uncovered a technical barrier. We found that our app works well on Android devices but Apple software prevents iPhones being used effectively for contact tracing unless you are using Appleaposs own technology, he said. He said that the NHSX app was better at measuring distance than the Google Apple model. As it stands, our app wonapost work because Apple wonapost change their system, but it can measure distance. And their app canapost measure distance well enough to a standard that we are satisfied with. Appleaposs iOS operating system blocks third party apps from creating bluetooth connections while the phone is locked - a measure in place for security and battery le reasons.  Ministers were warned this was the case as early as May , but pressed ahead with the development and testing of the app. Today it was revealed the app only identies % of contacts on Android phones and % on iPhones. Conversely, using Apple and Googleaposs own system correctly identies % of contacts. But the government says it doesnapost measure distance well enough for the NHS to use it at present. Mr Hancock said: We have agreed to join forces with Google and Apple to bring the best bits of both systems together. We will share our algorithm and the work that we have done on distance calculation and combine that with their work to deliver a new solution. That would bring together some of the best minds to find a solution to this global challenge. On May , the Mirror contacted the Department of Health about claims the app was on hold while the government considered an alternative app. In response, a spokesperson said: The NHS contact tracing app is not on hold – and it would be completely wrong to suggest otherwise. There is no alternative app and the NHS continues to work constructively with many other organisations that are helping to develop and test the NHS COVID- App.  But today Mr Hancock claimed the Department had been working on both systems from the very beginning. He told the Downing Street briefing: No, actually quite the contrary, Iaposm from Newmarket, we back both horses. We took the decision in May to start building the Google-Apple version as well and then because we built both we could test both. And actually the best way to get new technology going is to test dferent approaches. Far better to go with both versions and now weaposve got problems with both versions but thereaposs parts of each that can come together to build something thataposs stronger than either version.

The Commons Committee on Standards today found he made three breaches of the Code of Conduct for MPs. The watchdog said he was late to registering changes to three companies in which he had shareholdings should have registered his five unpaid directorships in  and should have declared his and his brother’s unpaid directorships to the International Trade and European Scrutiny committees when he joined them. In a damning judgement, the Committee said Mr Fysh did not act in bad faith - but there were aggravating factors once a probe began. The Committee said Mr Fysh took a deprecatory and, at points, patronising tone towards the Parliamentary Standards Commissioner and raised unfounded questions about their objectivity. There were also unnecessary delays when he did not respond to requests in a timely manner - including missing four deadlines to reply. Mr Fysh accepted the conclusion about his shareholdings and apologised, but not the two conclusions about his directorships. That meant the matter was elevated from the lower-level Commissioner to MPs on the Commons Standards Committee. In total, the inquiry that began in October  took almost two years to complete.

With travel overseas remaining problematic,  per cent plan to spend their main summer break enjoying their own personal outdoor space instead. Sixty per cent, of the , people polled, admitted they have appreciated their gardens more during lockdown than before, with a third putting this down to missing out on their cancelled holidays. Many are sprucing up their outdoor space in anticipation of their aposholidayapos, with half of the eight per cent who own a hot tub or swimming pool, purchasing it during lockdown. The research was commissioned by BISHTAand SPATAto launch its aposeverydaycationapos campaign. It also found those polled have enjoyed an average of eight hours a week in the garden during lockdown, with  per cent saying this is more than usual. Overall,  hours - more than  full days - are enjoyed in garden spaces during the typical year. This amounts to almost two years of their lives in their outdoor area, with more than £, spent on making it look good and al. Chris Hayes, managing director for BISHTA and SPATA, said: The figures from the research highlight just how much time is enjoyed in a garden, whether thataposs playing with our children or pets, to exercising or eating. Outdoor space is clearly an essential part of a home - now more than ever with holiday restrictions likely to continue this year.  This year is certainly no ordinary summer and holidays - and even staycations - have become aposeverydaycationsapos - with that holiday feeling enjoyed in your very own garden even during a working week. We want to help people make the most of their summer break, establishing that holiday feeling in their own garden. And installing a hot tub or pool in your garden can recreate a summer holiday without the hassle of travel. Thereaposs nothing more aposholidayapos related than a swimming pool, and you donapost even have to leave your home to take a dip.  The research also found that over the course of the average adult letime, a total of  barbecues will be hosted in the garden, with the equivalent of four months spent sunbathing. Garden owners will also spend  hours a year exercising in their green space - a total of  weeks during their adult le. A further  hours are taken up with al fresco dining in the summer months - a total of  weeks over a letime. An eighth have even worked from there, with  per cent taking video calls from the garden. But more than a quartersaid the increased time outside recently has made them consider giving their garden a make-over, with more than a third using the time to update it.

The home in County Tyrone, Northern Ireland, looks ordinary from the outside, but inside it is packed with newspapers dating back to , stopped clocks, a half-smoked pipe, and the owneraposs shoes left by the bed years after the property was vacated. Photographer Rebecca was invited in to see the decaying cottage after its owner died and she was left in awe of the haunting scenes within the perfectly preserved home. The cottage was lived in until  by the last of three brothers, who kept all of their family history, alongside tins of food from the early th century left unopened on the kitchen shelves.A man only identied as Dessie was the last to live there, leading aposa solitary le among the relics of the pastapos before moving into a home in  and passing away two years later. Rebecca, who owns the Abandoned NI website sharing photos of the derelict houses she explores, was allowed in by the owner to get a record of the incredible space before it was knocked down to make way for a new build. She said she was left gobsmacked by what she found, with old books, magazines, papers and photographs littered around the farm workeraposs cottage and left untouched. A clock on the mantel piece is stuck showing ., a pair of glasses are left ready to pick up and a rusted OXO tin has been left open, with two pocket watches stored inside. Hundreds of handwritten letters fill the drawers, and three kettles are sat on the stove, next to a cup which appears to have been placed there just before it was abandoned. Old books and newspapers including the Mid Ulster Mail from  were left sitting in the living room which had been shut off for more than  years, alongside one newspaper which reported the aftermath of the sinking of the Titanic in . Upstairs there remained rotting bedclothes, a bed pan on the floor and a flat cap left hanging on the end of a bedframe. Rebecca said she initially wasnapost surethe interior would be very interesting, but she has now created an exhibition based on the lives of Dessie and his family.  She said: I have to admit I saw the outside and wasnapost sureit was worth it. As soon as I opened the door I was blown away. I went into what I thought was a wee cottage and itaposs basically a social history museum. The cottage first appeared on maps in  and Rebecca began researching the family to help piece together the puzzle in all of the photographs. After talking to people to find out more about Dessie, she said: Among many things he was a fabulous cook, many friends still talk about his famous soda bread which he cooked over the original stove. He was a hearty farmer, milking cows to produce milk and butter.It was reportedyou stayed for dinner in the house and you finished up, you were given another dinner for seconds.No one left with an empty stomach. One of the mysteries Rebecca was able to solve was personal items belonging to an Edwin McQueen, who she was able to discover was married to Dessieaposs mum. He worked as a policeman, and a certicate from  and a framed picture of him in his unorm was found in one of the bedrooms.

The Wild Planet Trust said it could no longer afford to reopen its Living Coasts site in Torquay, Devon, due to the huge cost of the coronavirus lockdown. It means  jobs are likely to be lost, while staff at Paignton Zoo and Newquay Zoo - which are owned by the same trust - are also at risk. The Devon site was home to a range of animals, including South American fur seals, African penguins, macaroni penguins, sea ducks, pied avocet, redshanks, black-necked stilts, ruffs, and terns. In a statement the trust said it regretted having to make the decision to close, but the attraction was no longer viable. It wrote on the Trustaposs website: Falling visitor numbers and the forced closure of all its zoos due to COVID- has meant that it has had to look at its cost base and make efficiencies. After nearly twenty years of operation the site also needed substantial maintenance that the Trust is no longer in a position to afford. It now means animals will have to be moved - but it is not yet clear how long this will take.  The site is home to a penguin beach, a tropical mangrove swamp, and underwater viewing areas. The statement said: The next stage is to find homes for the animals. Living Coasts is part of a world-wide network of zoos and aquariums and we will be looking for homes for the animals within them once movement restrictions have been lted.Most of the animals kept at Living Coasts are marine species that will need specialist facilities. Living Coast is confident that good new homes for the animals will be found, but at present it is unclear how long this process may take. Following the announcement, the British and Irish Association of Zoos and Aquariumstold The Independent: “This is a huge blow to the conservation community and another devastating impact of the coronavirus. “BIAZA’s thoughts are with everyone at Living Coasts and the Wild Planet Trust at this challenging time,” it added.

They felt closing the borders was the key, Jordan adding: “As long as people keep sticking to good hygiene.” Rikki Dunnage, who co-owns the bar with Edd Cox, said: “Everyone has been waiting three months for the taste of a proper pint!” Bushy’s brewery has delivered ales in milk cartons during lockdown. Boss Martin Brunnschweiler said: “It has kept our heads above water.

While the exact impact the vitamin can have is not yet known, the Scientic Advisory Committee on Nutrition began studying the potential impacts last month. At the same time the National Institute for Health and Care Excellenceis conducting a “rapid” evidence review on vitamin D in the context of Covid-. Last month Anglia Ruskin University in Cambridge found a crude relationship between vitamin D levels and high mortality rates. For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE. People in countries like Italy and Spain, where the elderly tend to avoid strong sunlight, were more likely die to die from the coronavirus than those in northern European countries, where cod liver oil and vitamin d supplements were more regularly consumed. Dr Lee Smith, Reader in Physical Activity and Public Health at Anglia Ruskin University, said: “We found a signicant crude relationship between average vitamin D levels and the number COVID- cases, and particularly COVID- mortality rates, per head of population across the  European countries. “Vitamin D has been shown to protect against acute respiratory infections, and older adults, the group most deficient in vitamin D, are also the ones most seriously affected by COVID-. “A previous study found that % of people in institutions, such as hospitals and care homes, were severely deficient in vitamin D.  We suggest it would be advisable to perform dedicated studies looking at vitamin D levels in COVID- patients with dferent degrees of disease severity.”  The UK does not fare well when it comes to vitamin D consumption however. One in five British adults and one in six children is lacking in vitamin D, thanks to poor diets, indoor lestyles and lack of sunshine. Experts have expressed fears that the lockdown and months of indoor living have cut levels even further. Some ethnic groups are at higher risk, because their skin is less able to produce the vitamin in response to sunlight, while the elderly are typically less efficient at vitamin D production.

Bradford East Labour MP Imran Hussain branded the government as culturally and morally insensitive following the revelations.He also described the situation as another display of the structural and institutionalised racism. The scheme is being operated by a private company which won the £m government contract to drop off vital food supplies to “extremely clinically vulnerable”. Fray Bentos meatballs and chicken pies were just some of the items to be included in the packages, which were to be the same for each household.But irate families say they were given tins of beans and sausages and lentil and bacon soup following the blunder, reports the .Eating of pork is forbidden in Muslim, Sikh, Hindu and Jewish religious traditions. Hussain first became aware of the issue after local charity Bradford Moor Pass noticed dozens of unopened tins of meat products outside family homes.  A Pass representative is reported to have contacted Bidfood and were told there were no vegetarian, halal or kosher alternatives. Some million food boxes had been sent across the UK from March after two companies - Brakes and Bidfood - were awarded a lucrative government contracts. In a letter to Robert Jenrick, the communities secretary, Hussain wrote: “I want to be clear that this is unacceptable and deeply insensitive to our religious communities.

A coroner ruled the death as an accident. But the coroner wrote to TUI declaring: There is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. Mr Copelandaposs son, Owen, has since slammed TUI over his dadaposs death. He said: My dad’s accident was quite simple really - he tripped on a step. We appreciate that accidents happen but you couldn’t see the step because it was covered in carpet. My mum is lonely and deeply upset. She blames TUI. As his son as well as his Power of Attorney I want to get answers on his behalf – he would’ve demanded answers so it’s up to me to do that now.  The Copeland family is pursuing a civil case against TUI. Their lawyer, Victoria Cox from Slater and Gordon, said: Nothing will bring Mr Copeland back. Mr Copeland’s inquest and the coroner’s request to TUI to make some simple, low-cost changes to the steps will help prevent future accidents. An inquest into his death ruled he died after an accident. However, in a report to prevent future deaths sent to the chief operating officer at TUI, the coroner highlighted a number of concerns surrounding his death. The report from Durham and Darlington assistant coroner James Thomspon read: During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you. During the course of the evidence heard at the inquest, a witness described the step s Mr Copeland fell on were covered in carpet so as to make them dficult to recognise them as steps and dficult to dferentiate the change in the floor level at the venue.

At the heart of this would be a mobile app Health Secretary Matt Hancock said would allow the tracking of Covid- on a mass scale. The latest figures show the programme has failed to reach more than a quarter of people who tested positive and the app has been ditched after it was found not to work. Other countries moved quickly to work with Apple and Google to develop a tracing app. The UK, contrary to what the Health Secretary said yesterday, decided it knew better. Once again, the Government has been found wanting. Time and again since the outbreak, ministers have made boastful promises but then failed to deliver on them. This incompetence has not just wasted public money – it has cost lives. We are beating the world only when it comes to the multiple failures by this Tory administration and the mounting number of fatalities. Best of British Dame Vera Lynn was the voice that gave our nation hope amid the horror of war. It was a testament to her enduring appeal that her classic hit We’ll Meet Again became the anthem not just of the Second World War but the coronavirus crisis  years on.  Throughout her  years, she epitomised the best of British spirit, whether mucking in with troops in Burma or doing her charity work.

Grace Meachim, , and James Meachim, , were adamant they would only have three children and James was even on the waiting list for a vasectomy in December last year.But when Grace had woken up in the early hours of the morning to take a paracetamol and have a cup of tea, she was suddenly bursting for the loo. The sales advisor, who still had periods, felt the sensation of her waters breaking and let out a terried scream. James and their eldest son Tyler, , called for an ambulance but Grace welcomed little Sienna at their home. Both mum and the lb .oz baby were assessed at hospital but deemed healthy. Within seconds of getting to the toilet, my waters went. It frightened me so much I screamed. It was so surreal. I hadnapost had any build-up to it at all, no pain, nothing, Grace, from Littlehampton, West Sussex, said today. When Iaposd gone to the loo, I didnapost feel like I was going into labour at all. After three previous pregnancies, I know what that feels like. There was a big gush then there was pressure and a mass down there.  I knew then what was happening and I went into shock. All I can remember thinking is aposoh my god, is this really happening apos. My husband and our eldest came running down. James called the ambulance and I was shouting aposthereaposs something comingapos. He told the operator aposI think itaposs a baby but sheaposs not pregnantapos. As soon as he said that he had to throw the phone to Tyler because I screamed aposquick, catch itapos. Within seconds James had his hands down the toilet catching the baby, it all happened so quickly. It was very strange, it was like something out of a movie.  But Grace and James are adamant their wonapost be fth child. James remains on the waiting list for the snip. Grace added: I just kept saying aposIaposm sorryapos to my husband because weaposd been dead set against any more children. James was waiting to be booked in for a vasectomy and Iaposd planned to up my hours at work so we could start saving for a mortgage. Weaposd had the boysapos birthdays in September then it was the lead up to Christmas so Iaposd done loads more drinking than usual. Iaposd also been on strong painkillers for a bad shoulder so they kept us in for a while to make sure she was okay. She was perfect and a really good size, I have no idea how I hid that.  She was such a nice surprise, she is that little bit extra special to us. And we definitely know sheaposs here now, she is really coming out of her shell. We wouldnapost change it but itaposs definitely no more kids now. Iaposve told James he needs to chase up his snip as soon as lockdown is over. Once over the shock, the parentsapos loved ones rallied together to make sure that by the time Sienna came home later that day, Grace and James were equipped for their new arrival. The couple were gted a Moses basket, clothes and nappies which Grace says gave them some much-appreciated time to adjust to suddenly becoming parents-of-four. Grace said: The paramedics were gutted when they turned up because it would have been their first home birth, not that I could have given them any notice. Everyone then started to giggle about what had just happened and Tyler called my mum to tell her Iaposd had another baby.

Sterling Higgins, , had called law enforcement for help, but then wound up dead in their custody. Now footage has shown how officers put him in a chokehold and stood on him in a Tennessee jail, according to a new lawsuit. Higgins died in police custody last March after he was allegedly pinned to the ground and choked for just under eight minutes and then shackled to a chair at Obion County Jail in Union City. His family say he suffered from paranoid schizophrenia, and had called police saying he thought someone was following him and wanted to kill him and steal his money. All four police officers seen in the footage deny any wrongdoing.  The footage obtained by campaigners shows fresh angles of the incident in the Tennessee jail house. Higginsapos case has come to the fore again more than a year after his death after his family filed a wrongful death lawsuit, and as Black Lives Matter protests continue around the world. The protests erupted after the death of George Floyd in the state of Minneapolis. The unarmed black man died after a police officer was filmed kneeling on his neck for nearly nine minutes. The case led to widespread global outrage, becoming a flash-point for demonstrations seeking justice over his death and wider issues of racial discrimination around the world.  The BLM protests have spread to the UK, where a focus on Britainaposs bloody slavery and colonial past has led to statues being toppled, and clashes with far-right marches. The deaths of Floyd and Higgins are among recent high profile cases involving accusations of police brutality concerning choke-holds. According to police records, Higgins dialed  from a convenience store on March , , and told officers that somebody was following him, wanted to kill him and steal his money. But instead of being assisted, Higgins was arrested for criminal trespass and - following his death in police custody - one of his jailers was promoted.  Police had instructed Higgins, who according to his family suffered from paranoid schizophrenia, to leave the shop. But when officer Robert Orsborne ed and found him still there, he was arrested. Higgins was taken to the Obion County Jail where the disturbing CCTV camera footage was filmed. The videos, captured by two cameras, show Higgins staggering into the facility and grabbing at Mary Broglin, a female corrections officer. Broglin pushes Higgins and when he pushes her back, officer Waylon Spaulding appears to tackle him to the ground. Spaulding then appears to hold Higgins by the throat as Orsborne stands by. At one point, Orsborne appears to stand on top of Higgins’s body.  Footage from a camera at the other side of the facility shows Higgins’ legs flailing before becoming limp. Another jailer fetches restraints to bind Higgins. The video clips were submitted in a wrongful death lawsuit filed in federal district court in Tennessee by Higginsapos family. The lawsuit alleges that Higgins was pinned to the ground and held by the throat for just under eight minutes. All of the defendants have denied any wrongdoing. In a handwritten statement, Spaulding said that Higgins had tried to spit at him, so “I… put my hand under inmate Higgins’s chin in an attempt to keep him from spitting on any other officers.”  Orsborne told investigators that he put a foot on Higgins’s leg and then stood on the leg shackles to restrain him. The video appears to show officers dragging Higgins into a chair at .am and spending just under five minutes chaining him to the chair. Throughout, Higgins appears completely unresponsive. At .am, a jailer appears to check Higgins’s pulse. Orsborne also checks Higgins’s pulse and calls for medical assistance.  Four medics arrive at the jail fteen minutes later and Higgins is laid on the hallway floor as they attempt to resuscitate him. At .am, he is wheeled out of Obion County Jail on a stretcher and taken to a local hospital where he is declared dead at .am - just over an hour after he arrived at the jail. The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation determined that none of the officers involved were responsible for Higgins’ death. An autopsy declared his cause of death as excited delirium due to a methamphetamine overdose. However, the autopsy also noted that Higgins had suffered multiple blunt force injuries including damage to his head, neck and torso. None of the officers in the video were placed on administrative leave.  Orsborne was reassigned to school resource officer at Union City Middle School last August. He told a local radio station that he was thrilled with the new role and looked forward to being a “mentor. He said: “It’s a chance to influence kids, a chance to be a mentor. “I’ll be an authority figure, but, hopefully, one the kids feel like they can trust and come to with whatever issues they might have.”  Spaulding was promoted in December , eight months after Higgins’s death, from jailer to deputy. The videos were released after three community activists submitted two Freedom Of Information requests when they became suspicious of the circumstances surrounding Higgins’ death. Bobby Gordon, , Amber Freeman, , and Joshua Freeman, , said that they only received the video in October after multiple delays. Joshua said: “When we heard about Higgins dying at the county jail, it immediately didn’t sit right, so we started asking questions.”  Bobby added that the medical report stating that an officer lay across Higgins’s body raised his suspicions. He said: “We immediately knew something was wrong and when we read the initial report that confirmed our feelings. “Something’s not right there - you don’t just lay across a man and he dies.” Amber believed the video shows a murder. She said: “I see a black murder. “The video doesn’t have any audio but they had to have known that Higgins was fighting for his le.

I went through all the main ones until I remembered the Divergent cover had the same color scheme, but not quite the same design. Close, but no cigar, he wrote.  He continued: I enlisted my friend Wesfor help, who found a clearer screenshot and zoomed in and it felt even more familiar but we couldn’t quite place it. Mullally then looked up the filming date for that particular scene in the movie and researched which Broadway shows were playing at the time, thinking it could have been part of an ad for a musical. He found nothing, but he wasnapost ready to give up just yet.I started watching random YouTube videos and looking for images from April  in Times Square. No clear view of the poster.

Most restrictions will be relaxed from Friday, unless stated otherwise.Seeing families and friends Shopping, eating and drinking out Working or running a businessSport, culture and leisure Getting around Health and social careGatherings and occasionsThe next review date is on July  and there will also be an update on remaining phase two actions, including reopening outdoor areas at pubs and restaurants, on July .To progress from phase two to phase three, the World Health Organisation#s six criteria must continue to be met, as was the case for moving into phase two.In addition, the R-number would need to be consistently below one and there must be a further sustained decline in infectious cases.Hotels, pubs, restaurants and visitor attractions are preparing to open their doors again from next month, after Rural Economy and Tourism Secretary Fergus Ewing set a target of July  for the lting of restrictions.The Tele is Dundee Born and Read, and is committed to providing news to our communities.Right now that’s more important than ever, which is why our key content is free.You can chose to support us and access premium content by subscribing to the Eveningfrom just £. a month. blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

Players pick up on that.“Having Gordon Strachan and Jimmy Nicholl’s experience is fantastic as well.“We might have our playing experience but they have  years more experience in the game than any of us. That’s invaluable.”Irvine and Mackay work closely together at Dundee – but it’s not the first time they have worked together.Dee first team coach, Mackay, was brought to St Johnstone by Derek McInnes while Irvine was the Perth side’s first choice right back.In the end, Mackay went on to be come a club legend at McDiarmid, while Irvine moved on to Dundee.But there are no hard feelings from Irvine, who has loved every minute of his time at Dens Park.He said: “Dave Mackay came in from Livingston in [St Johnstone’s] first season in the SPL to add competition for places. I was unfortunate because I’d chosen to have surgery to tidy up an ankle problem that had niggled me.“The plan was that would tie in with the close season and I could start pre-season.“But it hindered me and I was behind with my fitness and struggled a bit to get back to form.“Dave, obviously, came in and did well and I think him being able to play in a few positions helped him, too.“I recognised at that time, being in my mid-s I wanted to be playing every week and I wouldn’t get that at St Johnstone.“I’ve nothing against Del, that’s the decisions that have to be made to win games – when Dave came in, the manager couldn’t guarantee me games and I heard there was interest from Dundee.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

The football was great.

We are currently doing this as part of a range of measures across the university to promote racial equality as part of our strategic commitment to inclusivity and ersity.#We recognise that there is much more work to do to ensure we do not fall short of our commitments, and we will continue to listen, learn and work with our medical students to build constructively on what we have achieved through discussion so far.#For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

Action is needed and the bullies must be confronted. That they were allowed to behave in this way for so long is the real shocker.Their own managers have questions to answer.

Mindfulness concentrates your mind on the ‘here and now’ and is a proven way of dealing with mild depression or anxiety.Focus on what the plants feel like – not just their fragrance when touched – from leathery and lacey to soft and smooth. You can also mix plants that are great to touch with tactile hard landscaping elements such as a water feature, smooth polished round pebbles or the glazed ceramics.Some top touching plants and features to considerLeaves # try Stachys byzantina, commonly known as Lamb#s Ear. Its soft, downy, furry silver-grey leaves are a favourite among gardeners who tend to use it for ground cover in rich soil. As a contrast there is Acuba japonicawhich has smooth, glossy leathery leaves.Flowers # who can resist touching a bottlebrush Callistemon cintrinus – bundles of tiny delicate stamen flowers form a brush that’s soft to touch – or the soft paper-thin petals of a poppy Papaver orientale.Grasses # run your hand over the arching, thread-like leaves of feathery Stipa tenuissima also known as Mexican feather grass or the more robust drought proof ornamental Festuca glauca with thread-like blue foliage that forms dense mounds.Bark – tree bark can also provide a tactile experience especially when it’s the stunning flowering cherry Prunus serrulate with mahogany coloured bark that peels away in bands round the trunk.Landscaping – you can easily y the textures in your garden by choosing dferent hard landscaping options. If you have smooth pebbles surrounding a water feature that you can run your hand over and through, you could place lichen-covered rocks in another area of the garden.Our general well-being is intrinsically linked to the natural world which is why Thrive – the gardening for health charity – has developed the Thrive Gardening Club.For fortnightly tips on getting the most out of your garden, whatever your age or ability, and information on how gardening can keep you healthy and feeling good visit www.thrive.org.uk get-involved keep-in-touch subscribe-to-gardening-clubThrive is the UK’s leading provider of social and therapeutic horticulture programmes using gardening to bring about positive changes in the lives of people living with disabilities, ill health or mental health issues, or who are isolated, disadvantaged or vulnerable."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor may 22 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,Mental Health Awareness Week, now in its th year, runs from May  to May .This year, the theme for the week is kindness and across the country, people will be celebrating kindness in digital and creative ways within social distancing restrictions.The last couple of months, with all the uncertainty of the virus and the impact of lockdown, have been an extremely stressful and worrying time for many people across the Highlands and Islands. People who may have previously felt isolated in remote and rural communities may be feeling this even more acutely at this time, so it’s important they know support is available.Across the region, many people have also sadly faced the pain of losing loved ones to the virus or have fallen ill themselves, while others have seen their livelihoods put at risk or incomes reduced. All of this has put additional strain on people’s mental well-being.This year’s Mental Health Awareness Week is putting the focus on kindness as a means of helping people through the pandemic and building a better society as we emerge from it. We see many acts of kindness in the Highlands and Islands all the time, but this week is an opportunity for people to reflect on their interactions with others and how they can try and be a little kinder during this unprecedented time.David Stewart, MSP for Highlands and Islands region.Sir,During Mental Health Awareness Week, sight loss charity RNIB Scotland is highlighting the emotional reassurance and practical help it is offering during the coronavirus lockdown.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as their families, friends and carers.Losing some or even all your sight can be devastating news to take in, but our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.RNIB is concerned the lockdown might be affecting people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older, particularly hard. The uncertainty over access to basic shopping and medication, to information in accessible formats, the social isolation and barriers to being guided because of social distancing can all add and compound to the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.As well as our Need to Talk service, the RNIB helpline on    is available for anyone with sight loss and we continue to organise social activities over the phone and social media.We want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.James Adams, RNIB Scotland director, Edinburgh.The Scottish Invasive Species Initiativehas launched Alien Detectives – a fun and educational online resource to help the young and not so young  learn more about alien # or non-native – invasive species.Originally designed as a school education pack, the huge array of activities now includes a wide range of fun games and activities that anyone can enjoy at home, in the garden or on local walks during lockdown.Alien Detectives includes crafts, quizzes, worksheets, presentations and puzzles all themed around invasive species and the river environment. Although primarily aimed at young people, anyone with an interest in the environment or invasive species can enjoy them too.Our project team has been busy while homeworking during lockdown to produce these fantastic resources. We hope becoming Alien Detectives will bring many hours of enjoyment to iniduals and families during lockdown, especially at a time when most young people are not in a regular school environment and might be looking for a new challenge or activities to continue their learning.Invasive non-native species might be a new topic to many but it is a really important one. Invasive species can have a major impact on our environment and native wildle and are responsible for signicant bioersity loss in Scotland and across the world. We hope these resources will help raise awareness of the impacts of invasive species and inspire more young people to learn something about them.No prior knowledge is needed and there’s lots to learn and have fun with so become an Alien Detective and help us tackle invasive species today.All of the ‘Alien Detectives’ resources can be found at www.invasivespecies.scot alien-detectives.Callum Sinclair, SISI Project Manager, Newton Stewart.Sir,We may not be able to hold picnics in the usual way just yet, but why not hold the next best thing – a virtual picnic  That way you can invite as many people as you want.National charity Family Action is running its Virtual Family Picnic from May  to May  and everyone is invited.

We stayed with Margaret and Iain McDonald at their home named Meadowview in Tarbert which was located near the school.We all enjoyed the area so much that we continued to visit every year for the next consecutive eight years.Margaret invited me to go out on the herring boats once or twice. One was named Village Maid and the other Village Belle and, needless to say, we often had kippers for breakfast, which were very nice. I remember there was a boat called the Southern Cross tied up to Cock Island # can anyone tell me any history of it and when it disappeared There also used to be a smokehouse for kippers along from Tarbert to Ardrishaig.Another fond memory I have is watching the logging trucks unloading on the quay and watching them get loaded on to large boats and I think then being shipped round to Sweden or Finland. Is that correct or not as I thought there was a paper mill at Fort William As mentioned earlier, I joined North West Ambulance Service in the s and Margaret used to send me the Argyllshire Advertiser and in one of them was an advert for recruitment to the Scottish Ambulance Service.I duly got an application form from Paisley and was all but sending the form in when I realised it would be very unfair to move so far away from our young children#s grandparents and for them to be unable to see them growing up. At the time your local pharmacist was retiring and my we Sue was a qualied pharmacist, but our children were both under school age so relied on her parents for child care. Ironically, I believe the job was filled with a Blackpool pharmacist whom I had met ocassionally.My love for Scotland continued, and we had our honeymoon travelling around Scotland and calling in at Tarbert for several days on the trip round.Our last trip up there was  in June as a treat from our daughter who accompanied us on this trip. The weather was glorious, and one day we caught the bus to Skipness and walked part of the Kintyre Way back.Another day we took the MacBrayne Ferry to Islay, which was again a glorious day out, also visited Crinan, Lochgilphead and Inveraray, followed by a couple of days fishing off the pier in Tarbert. We travelled back via Portavadie and Dunoon, and have in the past used the ferry to Arran, then Brodick, Ardrossan and home.Thank you for taking the time to read this.

This is a challenging operational environment for our aircrew and an extremely dficult period for our fundraising teams as the restrictions are preventing all the events, talks and activities taking place which are so essential to help support the country#s only charity-funded helicopter air ambulance service.It costs around £ million each year to fund our Perth and Aberdeen-based helicopter air ambulances.

But the COVID- lockdown interrupted proceedings.This season’s Scottish Cup was a bit of a disappointment with Star exiting the competition in the second round after losing out to a vastly improved Dumbarton United side -. On the plus side, the first round saw Star take on Paisley League team Pollok FC and an excellent performance saw Star run out convincing winners -, one of only four defeats suffered by Pollok in all competitions.In the West Region Cup, Star progressed to the quarter-final again. A first round bye, a convincing - win against Cambuslang FA then a walkover saw the Lochgilphead youths face Paisley League A Division team Erskine.In a hard-fought encounter, Star matched Erskine for most of the game but with only  players available they couldn’t get the breakthrough they needed and eventually lost -.Star started their league campaign in September with a competitive match against new team Thorn, who transferred from Paisley A Division. Star lost -.Two strong performances in October saw Star record  a terric - win over Shettleston, last season’s league runners up, and a - win against St Patrick’s Sports Academy # an entertaining but nerve-wracking game.A mid-season stutter in November saw the Lochgilphead boys lose out to Cathcart -, then Clydebank -, both newcomers.The losing run continued into early December as Star faced last season’s champions Drumchapel Amateurs ending up down - at half-time before recovering their form with a committed second half display to pull it back to -. Unfortunately they lost out to a fourth Drumchapel goal as they chased the winner themselves.This set Star back on track as they finished the year with a hugely convincing performance, demolishing Cathcart -.January and February proved a real battle with the weather with wind, rain and freezing temperatures # often all three # only allowing four games to take place. Star secured fine victories over Busby, -, and Glasgow Red Star, -, and fought back to grind out creditable draws with Shettleston, -, and Place Park, another new team, -.Star played one league game in March before lockdown and again it was another entertaining game with a rollercoaster feel to it. Facing up to Drumchapel Amateurs, both teams played out another terric match which had everything.Coming back from a goal down and with only  men, Star played cracking football to race into a - lead but it took its toll as Drumchapel stuck to their task to draw level before adding a couple more goals to secure a win in the final five minutes.This was another fine season for Red Star s, competing well in a strong league, with only  signed players.Though the season was cut short, the boys played  games winning , drawing two and losing seven. They scored  goals and conceded  goals. There were some cracking games and the boys were looking forward to the knock-out stages of the league cup.Inconsistency probably cost Star a few more wins, but that’s what youth football development is all about and there is potential for the boys to develop.Well done from coaches and parents to the  boys who played this season – Craig Aitken, Zak Barclay, Gregor Brown, Keiran Caskie, Lewis Curran, Ruaridh Green, Woody Hoad, Alexander McLean, Conner McMurchy, Leon Murphy, Innes Paterson, Jamie Stewart and Tom West.Thanks for great support goes to sponsors Ardrishaig Community Trust, main strip, SC Crawford Building Contractors Limited, change strip and zip tops, Jewsons, tracksuits, and Mid Argyll Youth Development Services and the parents, supporters, referees and opposition teams that have made the season so enjoyable."},{"url":null,"title":"sheena shows the way as tarbert tees off","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsGolf started again at Glenralloch as lockdown measures were eased slightly across Scotland.The first members were on the tee at am on Friday May  for the re-opening, followed by a steady stream as the day went on.

similar rules regarding face masks and public transport have not been implemented across Scotland, Walesand Northern Ireland.But which types of face coverings are acceptable, and how do you wear them properly How do I wear a face mask properly The UK Government has advised that scarves, or homemade cotton coverings, that cover the nose and mouth are fine to wear- so, too, arebought masks that are not the same as those used by the health service.Surgical masks should be kept for use by health professionals.Officials have said that people can make a face covering at home, but added it is key to ensure it covers your nose and mouth.Government guidancestates that a cloth face covering should cover your mouth and nose while allowing you to breathe comfortably. This can be as simple as a scarf or bandana that ties behind the head.Before putting it on, you should wash your hands or use hand sanitiser and do the same after removing it.Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth at all times and store any used face coverings in a plastic bag until you have an opportunity to wash them.Do not touch the front of the face covering, or the part of the face covering that has been in contact with your mouth and nose.Once removed, make sure you clean any surfaces the face covering has touched and wash the covering regularly. The covering can be washed with other laundry, using your normal detergent.When wearing a face covering, take care to tuck away any loose ends.How do I stop my glasses from steaming up If you wear glasses, wearing a face mask at the same time can cause the lenses to steam up, making it dficult to see properly.But the common problem has an easy solution, thanks to advice from doctors in the medical journal Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons of England.To prevent the issue, doctors advise washing your glasses with soapy water before putting the mask on, and rinsing them under warm water.Then, gently dry off the lenses with a clean towel or cloth before putting them back on.Washing the lenses with soapy water leaves behind a ldquothin surfactant film that reduces misting on the lenses, meaning they now shouldnrsquot steam up when a face mask is worn.Should face coverings be worn where The current government advice states that face coverings should be worn in enclosed spaces, which includes some shops and public transport.At the moment, people are not being told to wear them outdoors, while exercising, or in schools or offices.Several airlines, including easyJet and Ryanair, have introduced a requirement for passengers to wear face masks on board.However, the government believes that face masks should be reserved for people who need them to protect against risks in their workplace, such as health and care workers."},{"url":null,"title":"borders-priest-moving-rome-new-job","story":"A BORDERS priest has accepted a high-ranking job in Rome.Nick Welsh, , has been based in Galashiels for the past two years.But he will soon be flying out to Italy after being picked for the role of vice-rector at the Scots College, where aspiring Scottish priests receive their training.Father Nick, originally from Stirling, told the Border he had ldquomixed emotions when he heard the news.He said: ldquoIrsquom quite excited, but Irsquoll have a bit of a heavy heart when I leave ndash I was just getting used to the Borders.Since , Father Nick has been administrator of the Parish of Our Lady  St Andrew, which has churches in Galashiels, Melrose and Selkirk.He said: ldquoI was really warmly welcomed here.

What a shame, then, about the second thing I couldnrsquot help noticing: how drab and disappointing George Square remains.Granted, the grim sight of loyalist protesters wrapped in Union flags ldquoprotecting the statues and Cenotaph didnrsquot help. But even without their isive presence the cityrsquos historic square is a let-down, visually, socially and culturally, a frustrating waste of urban space that could and should be far better utilised.Where other European squares create buzz and atmosphere with year-round arts, culture, food and shopping attracting locals and visitors, George Square is dreary and uninspiring: a few trees, some benches and a clutch of dull, predictable th-century statues ndash ldquogreat men and Queen Victoria ndash that few feel any kinship with. The only part of the square that has any real purpose and meaning is the Cenotaph.The idea that George Square is in serious need of a makeover is nothing new, of course, and there have been ious  dawns and broken promises over the years, not least the outrageous fiasco of  ndash remember that  ndash which wasted huge amounts of public money and goodwill alike. But the two defining events of  - coronavirus and the Black Lives Matter protests -offer Glasgow the best opportunity in a generation to finally get this right and transform George Square into the vibrant civic centre Glaswegians deserve.Letrsquos start with the pandemic, which will continue to damage the economic and social pull of town and city centres. As lockdown restrictions are gradually lted we will grasp a new reality ndash fewer shops, restaurants, bars and cultural attractions than before, with those that do re-open unable to work at full capacity for now. Answers to the sort of questions around attracting people to city centres that were already stumping businesses, planners and local authorities even before coronavirus hit have become all the more pressing.Thatrsquos where a proper revamp of George Square comes in, a key step forward in boosting Glasgowrsquos economy and cultural capital in the wake of the pandemic. What should the square contain  That would be for citizens to decide, but herersquos a few quick ideas that presume an eventual end to social distancing: an ampitheatre for live music, theatre and comedy, proper seating, pop-up pods for community groups, a food and craft market, arts and exhibition space, murals, a garden and childrenrsquos play area.As for the fate of the statues, again, it would be for the people to decide whether they still have a place in this new urban realm. Not that we would want to forget our past, of course. But surely we can find new and more creative ways to confront, commemorate and celebrate it, taking in voices that were previously ignored ndash women, ethnic minorities, working class people, gay people, the disabled ndash reflecting the ersity of our city as it is now.Rather than an expensive international competition for designs ndash letrsquos learn from  ndash a three-month public consultation could be held, and a  of local architects, planners, artists, businesspeople and community groups convened to create perhaps three dferent plans, which would then be voted on by the people of Glasgow. Granted, such an ambitious revamp wouldnrsquot be easy to fund in the dficult years ahead, but with a crucial economic and culturalat stake, it should be prioritised. Surely a mixture of public, private and philanthropic funding could be sourced Glasgow City Council has already started the conversation that could make all this happen, by bringing forward the pedestrianisation of George Square and suspending a third of city centre parking bays to make room for walkers and cyclists.I would urge council leader Susan Aitken and her team to think bigger. A commitment to redesign George Square would offer an exciting, positive and inclusive focus for Glaswegians in the tough months ahead. The end result could be what Glasgow has been crying out for for a generation: a proud and modern civic centrepiece that is worthy of our great city, a place that excites, entertains, and educates, that makes us feel part of something bigger.

Democracy is nothing,it is not about peaceful debate, ideas and dare I say, ision.Alec Oattes, Ayr.GIRVAN must be a really nice place. David Bone seems to have missed the British and Irish nationalists marching every year in Scotland, throughout my three score years and ten. Orange and green colours to the fore, they claim it ldquopart of their culture. These marches pre-date any signicance the SNP had in Scotland: indeed it was the Unionist Party Scotland which promoted Orange-ism in the s. We saw these ldquoLoyalists in all their glory on Sunday.There have also been literally dozens of riots in England in my letime, many of them rooted in identity and race, not one related to the SNP.Mr Bone also misses the fact that the SNP wishes to normalise Scotland as a self-governing country, while opposition to that seems based on a British nationalist identikit contrivance. Unionist parties have taken turns over the last century and more, of at first supporting Scottish home rule, then deriding it. If at any point, say with the ldquoScottish Covenant in  , they had attempted to seriously meet Scottish democratic aspirations, then Mr Bone would be sleeping more happily in his bed.Now itrsquos probably too late many Scots no longer trust Unionists donrsquot believe in a Prime Minister who has repeatedly made disparaging remarks about Scots and Scotland find majority Scottish opinions commonly discounted and ignored.GR Weir, Ochiltree.NO doubt there will be many comments about David Bonersquos letter about the SNP supposedly engineering ldquoisive identity politics\". I would argue that the Establishment in England, especially in Whitehall, has been doing that since the birth of the United Kingdom.As a schoolboy in  I asked why the new queen was titled Queen Elizabeth the Second of Great Britain. The answer was that she accepted that proposal when made in Whitehall. Thirty-four years later a British team first won the European Cup. Jock Stein was only given a lowly honour because of classdistinction by Whitehall directive.How often does radio and television media refer to Manchester being in the North although these media supposedly relate to the whole of the British Isles  Even in quizzes, questions such as \"how many lions are on the Royal Standard\" or \"which organisation is responsible for lighthouses and navigation aids\" have only the answers referring to England accepted  Newspaper reviews almost never include those of The Herald or other Scottish papers.The current issue of the History Scotland magazine relates atthe dficulties in forming international rules, for both rugby and football, for the home nations. For several years the English administrators wanted the other nations to accept only those of England. Even the first Scottish rugby team to play against England was picked in England.The question of more anger in the last decade and months arises from Brexit, Nigel Farage and Boris Johnson. These have virtually ignored the Scottish majority.Hate is too strong a word, butit does occur then it should be directed at the arrogance of the English establishment and Whitehall, not at our neighbouring nations as a whole. I am sure that many Scots have English friends and relations with whom we continue to socialise ndash providing that we get to air our own views.JB Drummond, Kilmarnock.THE SNPrsquos call for more funding from Westminster is baffling.Coming from the administration whose financial \"expertisersquorsquo has led to two rusting hulks on a Scottish shipyardrsquos stocks, at the cost of hundreds of millions, and, with exquisite timing for a pandemic, a white elephant airport.

But for the politburo-like endurance of SNP ministers, he should have been gone long ago.ldquoInstead he reminds us that a nationalist government scared of independence but without opposition is part of Scotlandrsquos problem, not its solution.He said that since the resignation of finance secretary Derek Mackasy in disgrace in February, Mr Swinney, who led the SNP to several election defeats from  to , was being dusted down as a potential heir to Ms Sturgeon.ldquoRemember, since Derek Mackay left under a cloud of scandal, the SNP leadership have looked to Swinney as the heir apparent to Sturgeon. Various media puffs and pro#les point to honest John as the candidate being polished for office.ldquoThat may account for Sturgeonrsquos anger on hearing of his blended learning approach.ldquoShe publicly slapped him down, saying part-time schooling would end as soon as possible.How could a man with expectations to lead be so weak, so beholden to his cautious officials and the structures of unions and local government ldquoIn truth, the idea of Swinney as leader was always daft.ldquoFor Scotlandrsquos sake, this latest blunder must have damaged the wheeze beyond repair.Mr Bell concludes: ldquoWhat Scotland needs is an education minister prepared to host the daily Covid- brie#ng to the public and able to set out the risks and realities.ldquoParents and pupils need to be engaged. consensus needs to be built. We need a minister who can encourage the same kind of love and regard for teaching as enjoyed by the NHS.ldquoA politician who can inspire rainbows and clapping.ldquoJohn Swinney has been education minister for six years. Enough is enough. Someone take charge and give our children a chance.Since leaving the Scottish Government, Mr Bell has often been a pungent critic of the SNP.After Mr Salmond was acquitted of  counts of sexual assault in March, Mr Bell, who was a defence witness at the trial, summed up his old boss as an insecure ldquocreep.He said: ldquoWhen your best defence is lsquoIrsquom sleazy but not criminalrsquo, itrsquos nothing to smile about.Scottish Conservative education spokesmanJamie Greene said:ldquoThe SNPrsquos handling of education throughout this crisis has been shambolic.ldquoIt knew since March that this problem was coming down the tracks, and several months on therersquos still no plan which parents can rely on or trust.ldquoParents and teachers are furious with the Scottish Government over this, and itrsquos no wonder John Swinney is now facing this level of criticism.ldquoWe need to see some more creative thinking, yet all we get from the SNP is real poverty of ambition and imagination.ldquoItrsquos been a tough few months for everyone, but the SNP now risks turning this into an irreversible catastrophe for an entire generation.An SNP spokesman said: ldquoThere will always be people who snipe from the side lines.

Employers should support their workers in using face coverings safely and provide advice,requested, on applying and removing the covering.On ferry services face coverings must also be worn by passengers and staff unless the ferry, or part of the ferry which is open to members of the public, is entirely outdoors or physical distancing of two metres can be maintained.Transport Secretary Michael Matheson stressed the importance of the new rules and that by wearing a face covering everyone is engaged in a collective responsibility to reduce the risk of transmission.He said: “Our message remains clear that public transport should be for key workers and those who need it most and can’t walk or cycle to work.#Capacity is reduced to enable physical distancing and operators are not yet running full services. However, as we work towards recovery and more peopleto work and further local leisure opportunities begin to open up it is vital that measures are put in place to protect everyone’s health.“Transport operators continue to play a key role in supporting essential travel and in ensuring passenger confidence in public transport while maintaining physical distancing. The use of face coverings forms a fundamental part of gaining that public trust.“We are asking people to take personal responsibility to do the right thing. Wearing a face covering while on public transport means you are playing your part in the collective effort to prevent the spread of coronavirus and reducing the risk to your fellow citizens. These measures complement physical distancing and good hand hygiene, they do not replace them.”Advice on face coverings, including how to make one and instructions for using one, will be available on the Transport Scotland website.

The financial support is helping firms across the nation to adapt, innovate and protect jobs. Here are two examples of how companies have been helped, and what support is available.Source: Her Majesty’s TreasuryAn unprecedented package of UK Government financial support has helped firms like Q-Mass in East Kilbride weather the coronavirus crisis. Director Ronnie Robertson said lockdown hit his company’s order book, but the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has been vital to help them hang on to their valued staff.Ronnie said: “Before this, we had quite a good order book, with three to four months of work planned, so we were pretty worried where it was going to take us.” At first, he was worried how he would keep Q-Mass’  staff on the payroll, but then the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme was announced.It offers UK Government support to pay  per cent of staff’s wages up to £, a month, and the scheme has now been extended until the end of October.Q-Mass manufactures bespoke parts for the oil, gas and defence industry so staff training is important. Ronnie said: “Our staff are very highly skilled. We’ve gathered a bunch of people here and trained them up and taken on apprentices. We do a lot of training, we’ve got good people, we train them a lot and we want to hang on to them.”He found applying for the furlough scheme quick and straightforward. He said: “It was surprisingly easy and we were surprised that the money came through relatively quickly.”Now staff at the firm who’ve been furloughed are gradually ing to work, with strict safety measures in place. Ronnie said: “We’ve put a day sht back on and we’ve still got a few office people working at home, with quite a few still on furlough.And because of the size of the building, maintaining a two-metre distance hasn’t been a problem for ing staff.“The workshop’s a big, wide open space and we have to keep cleaning things like photocopiers and touch screens, but it’s been quite straightforward.”Now Ronnie’s looking forward to a brighter future. He said: “I feel like we’re on the side of the valley and we’re looking across to the other side and it looks absolutely fantastic. Getting through the next few months is crucial for us. We have a really good bunch of people and we want to hang on to them. The furlough scheme has helped us to do that.” vw, px\"  Planning, forward thinking and invaluable help from the UK Government has enabled a Northern Ireland firm to ersy and remain solvent. When Covid- struck, Newtownards baby product manufacturer Shnuggle’s owners Sinead and Adam Murphy were prepared thanks to advice from their export colleagues in China.Sinead said: “We reduced our out-goings, put on pause our marketing spend in the business. We just tried to protect the cash that we had.“The first impact was our customers that we sell to in Asia. They all went into lockdown so our orders and sales to them stopped. But also a lot of our production happens out in Asia so our factories went into lockdown.“Luckily we had bought a lot of stock beforehand. We were so relieved that we had, at least we could carry on trading with our UK and European customers.” With around half of the company’s sales in the UK and Ireland and half in the export business, Shnuggle had to rely on their local retail-base.Sinead continued: “Baby items were classed as essential goods which was a huge relief to us. This meant as long as we could socially distance within the warehouse we could continue trading and selling online.“All of our business is supplying other retailers like John Lewis, Mamas and Papas, Amazon. But our online sales actually grew because everyone was at home and maybe an element of panic buying.”Shnuggle took advantage of the furlough and Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Schemeschemes.Sinead said: “We furloughed five out of our  team, and were able to access the Business Interruption loan through Ulster Bank.“That was our biggest headache and stress, we owed signicant amounts of money to them and we didn’t have the cash as we needed time to sell our products.”Shnuggle also received a £, Small Business Grant.Adam said: “Furloughing was brilliant, and the CBILS was the one that was the best for us because it meant that we could keep all our suppliers happy.“So even though we had a temporary dip in our sales, and obviously the inventory was sitting there ready to sell, it just kept us solvent and the cash flow moving.” vw, px\"  Here are some examples of the support available for businesses and workers.

It has allowed the waste crews to collect recyclables that have been stored in folks’ houses, whilst ensuring that our crews are able to work within the requirements of physical distancing. To ensure we have cleared the backlog, we intend to continue with the four-week cycle again.”Green recycling bins and boxes should be put out on your usual bin day – but remember to do this weekly. You should remove the caddies inside # and the items for collection should be included in your single green bin or box as we will be unable to pick up more than one at a time.Grey bincollections for household waste will continue on a fortnightly basis – again on your usual collection day.This means that the council will collect:• Glass # week commencing June .• Plastic # bottles week commencing June .• Metals and tins # week commencing July .• Paper card # week commencing July .Councillor Drever added: “We want to thank households for their cooperation and patience whilst we continue to clear the backlog of recyclables that folk have been storing during the pandemic.”Just a reminder that paper and card is being collected this week . This should be contained in a single green bin or box. Corrugated cardboard should not be included – either in the bin or left alongside.It is hoped that corrugated cardboard can be accepted from next week at the recycling centres at Hatston and Garson, along with garden waste.

The two metre social distancing rule will affect passenger capacity for our ferries – and we also continue to experience issues around the availability of staff and the effect that has on opportunities around timetabling.“I would assure our isles residents that we continue to bring these issues and challenges to the attention of the Scottish Government and will do all we can to maximise sailingsnecessary, taking on board the views of our isles residents throughout.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It looks increasingly likely that any exit from lockdown and safe re-opening of tourism and hospitality businesses could be during the low season.#Without financial support to tide them over, that could be the nail in the coffin for many businesses.“In Shetland, like where in Scotland, earnings from tourism during the spring and summer months sustains people through the winter and it is a real worry that coronavirus hit just when the visitor season was starting.#It is clear that a -month plan, at least, is needed to ensure that viable businesses can survive to provide a living for their owners and be ready to safely welcome visitors again when the time is right.”Speaking via video link earlier this week, Mr Carmichael welcomed the Chancellor of the Exchequer#s announced extension to the furlough scheme to protect jobs – but added more was needed to help tourism.“Here in the Northern Isles we particularly see that in the visitor economy, which is crucial to us,# he added.#The assistance for bed and breakfast operators, or operators of self-catering accommodation, leaves too many people without the assistance they need.“A support scheme that finishes at the end of August, or September or whenever it will be, simply will not be adequate in parts of the country such as ours.#Those parts of the country that have seasonal tourism require a -month programme, or  the tourism industry that will be left to be resurrected at the end of this process will be that much weaker, and the rebuilding and recovery that much more dficult.” on Wednesday also heard from struggling tourism businesses.One BB owner said she had been unable to apply for support funds as they required applicants to have paid businesses rates, whereas she paid domestic council tax.Living Lerwick has also raised the plight of small tourism operators.Project manager Emma Miller said that as some did not have a business banking account they had been unable to apply for the Creative or Tourism and Hospitality Enterprises Fund, which opened in Scotland to support the industry. raquo"},{"url":null,"title":"more vessels but aprils gross tonnage is well down on last year ","story":"Lerwick Harbour saw a big reduction in shipping tonnage during April compared with the same month last year – although the number of arrivals was actually up slightly.A total of  vessels called, compared with  in April , but the overall tonnage dropped from , to ,grt.The deficit was partly due to no cruise ships callinglast year, although ferries, live fish carriers and oil traffic were all also down considerably.The April arrivals this year included  fishing boats,  workboats tenders,  ro ro ferries,  live fish carriers, eight oil boats, eight tugs, five tankers, five ferries and three pilot boats.The fishing vessels comprised  Shetland,  British, three Danish, two French and one Norwegian boat.For the first four months of the year the overall number of arrivals at Lerwick holds up reasonably well with  – , as compared to , in .

And while they have been open recently for private prayer, regulations preventing many weddings and restrictions on funerals have proved a dficult cross to bear.All-Ireland Catholic Primate Archbishop Eamon Martin said much work had already been going on to make churches safe for worship.I expect that we will be beginning in a cautious way at first, and there will be a need for ongoing patience and careful monitoring of the situation, he said. I commend parishes for reaching out to parishioners in very dficult circumstances during the lockdown, which included the broadcasting of Mass and other prayer opportunities by webcam Archbishop Eamon Martin, All-Ireland Catholic PrimateIn recent days, having spoken to priests across the dioceses of Armagh and Dromore, it is clear to me that there is a strong desire from our people and priests to be able to celebrate the Eucharist and have access to the other sacraments, especially baptism, marriage and reconciliation. I commend parishes for reaching out to parishioners in very dficult circumstances during the lockdown, which included the broadcasting of Mass and other prayer opportunities by webcam. Since March we have also been alert to God#s presence in the lonely and the suffering. Sadly the pandemic has brought great hardship to many families whose loved ones have died because of the virus. In a lot of cases it was not possible for family members to be by their side, or to be present at their funeral. As we see more areas of community le gradually emerging from the worst impacts of Covid-, this announcement will be appreciated across the denomination Rev Trevor Gribben, general secretary of the Presbyterian Church in IrelandGod knows our grief and how much we need strength, courage, consolation and comfort at this time.Rev Trevor Gribben, general secretary of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, also welcomed the news.We are delighted to have reached this point and welcome today#s indicative announcement that gathering for church services can now resume, albeit with certain restrictions in place, he said.Back in March it was with genuine sadness that we had to close our churches, one of the many unprecedented national restrictions put in place to keep us all safe. As we see more areas of community le gradually emerging from the worst impacts of Covid-, this announcement will be appreciated across the denomination.A Church of Ireland spokesperson said We join with other Churches in welcoming the announcements today which will allow us to make a start on making our church buildings safe to resume public worship.It#s understood that the Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride is to meet faith leaders on June  to consider how funerals, weddings, christenings and other celebrations may be conducted.Belfast Most ReadCoronavirus: MLA Bradshaw says reason for small cluster outbreak in NI #should be made public#Northern Ireland#s most popular property listings as market reopens after lockdownCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Hairdressers to reopen, shielding to be paused and social distancing at schools reduced to mDerry man Conor McColgan killed alongside girlfriend in horror crashClarity call as medical chief issues letters to NI shielders,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The updated shielding guidance applies until June  and Dr McBride has said further guidance will be provided before the end of the month.Officials are facing calls to provide clarity to people who are shielding, particularly amid reports that some people are coming under pressure toto work, while concerns have also been raised by younger people who are shielding about the effects the protection measures are having on their children.DUP MLA Alex Easton, a member of the Stormont health committee, said any further letters advising people to shield must include more information for patients and employers.I would like more clarity around shielding in general, he said. My father, who is diabetic and has lost both legs as a result, didn#t receive a letter, so I think that the letters need to include a lot more information.I would like to see the letters include a booklet with a list of conditions and medication that mean patients should shield. There should also be specic information for employers because I have been contacted by people who have been told to shield and they are being expected to work.I think the majority of employers have been very understanding, but the longer this goes on, the more challenging it is going to be for those who are shielding. The next letter should include detailed information for employers about why it is so important that anyone who is shielding should take the precautions that is being sent out by the CMO.People who have been deemed as falling to the highest clinical risk group, and have therefore been told to shield, include anyone who has had an organ transplant, cancer patients, people with motor neurone disease and anyone with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder.In the letters being sent out to people this week, Dr McBride explained: I know that this has been a very challenging time for you and that it will not always have been easy to comply with the advice. The Covid- virus still poses a high risksomeone who is shielding is exposed to it. However, infection levels in the community are now falling so the risk of exposure is signicantly less than it has been over the last two months.Because the risk is lower, I have now updated the guidance for Northern Ireland so that from June  those who are shielding can now spend time outside with people from their own household or one person from another household whilst ensuring that social distancing is observed. I know that you will want to know about our plans for the future of the shielding advice. Please be assured that we are actively reviewing the shielding advice and we will provide new guidance before the end of the first shielding period.Dr McBride is also asking anyone who is shielding to take part in an engagement process which will help advise government policy on shielding in the months ahead.He added: Finally, I wanted to thank you for all of your efforts during this very dficult time. The Covid- pandemic has made huge demands on many people across Northern Ireland, and I want you to know that we understand the uncertainty and upheaval that those shielding, their families and carers in particular have faced.Belfast Most ReadCoronavirus: MLA Bradshaw says reason for small cluster outbreak in NI #should be made public#Northern Ireland#s most popular property listings as market reopens after lockdownCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Hairdressers to reopen, shielding to be paused and social distancing at schools reduced to mDerry man Conor McColgan killed alongside girlfriend in horror crashClarity call as medical chief issues letters to NI shielders,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Mark Hamiliton, who is a member of Ash, and his dad, Neil, started the project a year ago and since then the customised bangles have been snapped up by fans. The father and son team have now raised £, for the charity, which has had to suspend many of its services for local cancer patients and their families, and has furloughed most staff due to the coronavirus pandemic.The charity has also had to postpone its fundraising events, so donations are even more vital during the current crisis. The latest batch of bracelets are from guitar and bass strings played during Ash#s recent European tour, which was cancelled half-way through. Over the last year, Mark#s dad has made hundreds of bangles as souvenirs from a host of the band#s concerts played all over the world. Mark, who said he hopes to be back on tour once the pandemic is over, said: Thanks so much to all the Ash and Snow Patrol fans who have supported our #RockBangle project for Cancer Focus NI. So far we have raised around £, and hope to sell more bracelets once our tour recommences, whenever that may be. Big gratitude also to dad, who#s worked so hard on making these bangles in his wee shed, and Happy Father#s Day to him from my lockdown home in Northumberland.Mark donated the proceeds of the bracelets to Cancer Focus NI because of his mum, Miriam, who has now thankfully survived cancer three times. Miriam has received great support from Cancer Focus NI over the years. She is also one of the founder members of the charity#s support group in Downpatrick, helping other women who#ve been diagnosed with cancer. Mark, who sells the bangles on his social media channels, explained that making the bracelets is a team effort. I weave and cut the strings to size and my dad solders the joints together, making what was an ugly joint into something that resembles a metal pearl, he explained. They look nice, but raw and rustic. I want them to retain a bit of that rock #n# roll aesthetic. Rosie Forsythe, from Cancer Focus NI, said: We can#t thank Mark and his dad enough for all their hard work and generosity. Cancer Focus NI relies on donations for over % of our income.

Obviously many people will be nervous, butyou can spend, do - it might save a job or two. Most of Northern Ireland#s often-criticised large public sector still have employment, as do others in IT, agriculture, etc, he said.So the advice is not to be reckless, but economies only grow and jobs are saved by spending. Soyou can, do. Maybe then we can keep less people on furlough from ending up unemployed.Speaking at an online seminar of the Association of Chartered Certied Accountants, Mr Gibson said: It will be our responsibility as citizens and as businesses to show confidence in the sectors of our economy that need it most. This will require a collective effort to go out for a meal, to buy a coffee from our local cafe and to go to the cinema when they open.He told the Belfastthat the public understandably felt powerless in the face of large-scale redundancies, including , jobs lost between aeroplane seat maker Thompson Aero and aerospace giant Bombardier. But he added: We can#t go out and buy aeroplane seats or wings, but what we can do is make those little decisions to support those restaurants, shops and cafes that might close without our support.The money you hand over to that person on the other side of the till could make the dference to whether or not that person still has that job in the future.He added putting up with queues in order to support businesses was the right thing to do. Maybe you look at the coffee shop or ice-cream shop and think you can#t be bothered queuing, he said. But that decision could be a dference between that coffee shop staying open or not. It sounds dramatic, but it#s true.Belfast Most ReadCoronavirus: MLA Bradshaw says reason for small cluster outbreak in NI #should be made public#Northern Ireland#s most popular property listings as market reopens after lockdownCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Hairdressers to reopen, shielding to be paused and social distancing at schools reduced to mDerry man Conor McColgan killed alongside girlfriend in horror crashClarity call as medical chief issues letters to NI shielders,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Publicans in Derry who took a ‘massive’ financial hit by closing ahead of St Patrick’s Day in the interest of public safety have encouraged the public to ‘support their local’ once they reopen. Northern Irelands hotels, bars, restaurants and cafes can reopen from July . William McGuinness and his business partner Phil Nolan own Paedar O’Donnells, The Gweedore and Fty Seven nightclub on Waterloo Street. Before the government issued any formal directive for businesses to shut, Paedar’s led the way by announcing that it was closing its doors on March . googletag.cmd.push It came two days before the busiest date on the calendar for Irish bars, St Patrick’s Day. “It was a matter of conscience for us,” Mr McGuinness said, “the general feeling at the time was that the NHS was going to be under pressure and we thought St Patrick’s Day would have been a petri dish for infection and we didn’t want to be responsible for that.” Boris Johnson’s order for all non-essential businesses would come over a week later on March . Derry City and Strabane has the second lowest COVID- death rate of every council area in the country and just  positive Coronavirus cases to date – also the second lowest in the country. googletag.cmd.push Chair of the British Medical Association in NI, Derry doctor Tom Black, has credited the part played by local businesses who took their cues from the Republic of Ireland. Mr McGuinness said they’re happy they made that decision even though the business took a ‘massive hit’ because of it. “St Patrick’s Day is our busiest day of the year and we were thinking about retirement soon but this thing has thrown it all up in the air. “We knew that, but we were just concerned about the health of Derry people.” Paedar’s missed out on grants because it didn’t meet the criteria but employees were furloughed. The rebuild will be a slow process, Mr McGuinness said, as the pandemic took its toll. DIFFICULT From July  pubs and bars will be allowed to trade but must serve food and operate on a table service basis. Pubs that do not serve food will be allowed to sell alcohol outdoors, such as beer gardens, also restricted to table service. Mr McGuinness said that will make it ‘very dficult’ for small bars like Paedar’s with limited outdoor space. Permission to use that space is absolutely essential in his view. He added: “I would object to the fact that restaurant bars are allowed to open but bars aren’t allowed to serve inside. “I think the risk is higher in a restaurant bar with adults and children being served food and drink whereas we’re just serving alcohol to adults. “With food there are all sorts of utensils but we just have glasses and disposable plastic. “I don’t see the sense in holding us up because we don’t do food.” The ‘rush’ is now on to ready the bar for customers and bar owners like Mr McGuinness are looking to the government and local authorities for guidance. Paedar O’Donnell’s has been cleared of tables and chairs to allow for the walls to be freshly painted and floors nished ahead of the grand reopening.  Mr McGuinness hopes that the government advice is relaxed to allow bars to serve indoors. They’re awaiting further guidance before spending any money on Perspex screens or other safety measures. He concluded: “We’d encourage people to come back but it’s going to be very limited space. “We don’t have the tourists, we were a very busy bar at weekends, and we’re not going to get those numbers in – nowhere is – because Derry people like to go out on a Friday and Saturday and nowhere will be able to cater for them because of social distancing. “There’s no money to be made in the next few months that’s the reality. “But hopefully over timeit is under control and there’s no resurgence maybe we can get back to some normality.” INFORMATION The owner of numerous bar-restaurants in the city including the Bentley, The Magnet and Molly Malones, Tony O’Connor, is also seeking clarity. “I’m surmising that they’re working on it at Stormont but we need more information about social distancing and so on,” he said. With all of his restaurants serving food he’s assured by the fact that customers can sit indoors but is unsure as to whether dining customers can stay longer to socialise. Mr O Connor said: “Every one of our premises will be opening on July  because of the food situation. Out of our six bars, five of them have outdoor areas.” This week he held a meeting with management and they’re ‘all positive and raring to go’. Like many businesses, the pandemic has been a ‘nightmare’ for Mr O’Connor but he realises that everybody is on the same boat. The Irish government ‘deserves a massive pat on the back’ for closing bars before St Patrick’s Day, he said, because ‘you would have had thousands and thousands across Ireland’ spreading the virus. “A lot of bars lost out on revenue there, no money was coming in and none getting paid out, so you just start over again,” he added. AMAZING  Bars have been actively discouraged from staging live music events or screening football matches to minimise the urge for customers to ‘dance’ or ‘hug each other’ after a goal is scored. It’s Mr O’Connor’s aspiration that the bar will be allowed to have a singer-songwriter, two-piece band performing or DJ providing entertainment. The local businessman said they will have hand sanitisers at each entrance, on every floor, at every table and also behind the bars and in kitchen areas for staff. “I’d rather not open as to have big screens in front of the bar because I think it takes the atmosphere away. “We have enough space so we can take tables away to create distance,” he stated. They’re also considering an App on which people can order food and drinks but are awaiting further guidance. And extra staff will be on hand to carry out an increased cleaning schedule. Looking to the future, Mr O’Connor would like to see visitors to the city from other parts of the island. He said: “I think Derry will get a good turnout because we handled the pandemic well as a city, there was a low number of Coronavirus cases. “I can’t wait to get my teeth back into it, we’ve been doing nothing the past few months, and the not knowing is the worst thing. “We’ve been doing takeaways but getting fully open is going to be amazing. “We’d invite people to get back out and support your local. “Self-awareness is key, Derry has played a blinder, it should be recognised and people here don’t have to be told to social distance, they’re fully aware.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

With all of his restaurants serving food he’s assured by the fact that customers can sit indoors but is unsure as to whether dining customers can stay longer to socialise. Mr O Connor said: “Every one of our premises will be opening on July  because of the food situation. Out of our six bars, five of them have outdoor areas.” This week he held a meeting with management and they’re ‘all positive and raring to go’. Like many businesses, the pandemic has been a ‘nightmare’ for Mr O’Connor but he realises that everybody is on the same boat. The Irish government ‘deserves a massive pat on the back’ for closing bars before St Patrick’s Day, he said, because ‘you would have had thousands and thousands across Ireland’ spreading the virus. “A lot of bars lost out on revenue there, no money was coming in and none getting paid out, so you just start over again,” he added. AMAZING  Bars have been actively discouraged from staging live music events or screening football matches to minimise the urge for customers to ‘dance’ or ‘hug each other’ after a goal is scored. It’s Mr O’Connor’s aspiration that the bar will be allowed to have a singer-songwriter, two-piece band performing or DJ providing entertainment. The local businessman said they will have hand sanitisers at each entrance, on every floor, at every table and also behind the bars and in kitchen areas for staff. “I’d rather not open as to have big screens in front of the bar because I think it takes the atmosphere away. “We have enough space so we can take tables away to create distance,” he stated. They’re also considering an App on which people can order food and drinks but are awaiting further guidance. And extra staff will be on hand to carry out an increased cleaning schedule. Looking to the future, Mr O’Connor would like to see visitors to the city from other parts of the island. He said: “I think Derry will get a good turnout because we handled the pandemic well as a city, there was a low number of Coronavirus cases. “I can’t wait to get my teeth back into it, we’ve been doing nothing the past few months, and the not knowing is the worst thing. “We’ve been doing takeaways but getting fully open is going to be amazing. “We’d invite people to get back out and support your local. “Self-awareness is key, Derry has played a blinder, it should be recognised and people here don’t have to be told to social distance, they’re fully aware.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It comes after First Minister Arlene Foster told a Stormont sitting on Tuesday that she ‘does not intend to make any announcement about the date of first intake until all the necessary preparation work has been completed’. Speaking to the Derry News yesterday, Sinn Feacutein MLA Karen Mullan reiterated the point that students will enrol next year. Karen Mullan said the announcement by Michelle O’Neill on May  was made ‘on behalf of the Executive’ which involves the five main parties. googletag.cmd.push That was needed to allow Ulster University to move on to the next stage of the General Medical Councilaccreditation process. She added: “I know people may feel frustratedthere is no commitment in terms of dates and movement but there are no concerns at this stage on our part that the work isn’t being done. “That’s not to say it hasn’t been dficult but there are no concerns from the university either, they have everything they need to progress through the GMC stage. “And even when we get to the next point on this journey when we will have applications out there is so much work, it is a long-term project. googletag.cmd.push “The initial intake is for  students but that will increase over five years and we need a financial commitment to resource that for every year and work on the wider expansion of Magee.” A General Medical Council spokesperson confirmed that the next date to comply with is the Graduate Medical School Admissions Testapplication process in July. A GMC spokesperson said: “There are stages that must be completed, required for all new medical school applications, before students can be recruited. “We will decide on the readiness of the University of Ulster to accept students in September , by the end of this July.” Since the May  announcement, key players in delivering the project including the Economy Minister Dianne Dodds and Arlene Foster have spoke of ‘signicant work’ and risk assessments that must be carried out before they can commit themselves to a date. Karen Mullan said that it is ‘dficult’ when there are ‘dissenting voices’ and it ‘does create that sense of fear that is out there’. She recognised that work still has to be done to get it over the line and ‘you can’t mitigate against something that is out of everybody’s control’. Asked is Sinn Feacutein is facing resistance from within the Executive Karen Mullan was clear that all parties signed up to the commitment laid out in the New Decade, New Approach document towards Magee. But she acknowledged that Magee is not a priority for other MLAs who are focused on their own constituencies. ‘TRANSPARENCY’ SDLP Leader, Colum Eastwood MP has expressed concern that the First Minister was unable to give SDLP MLA, Mark H Durkan, a cast iron guarantee that the Magee Medical School would be ready to open in September . The Foyle MP said: “The SDLP have been campaigning for Magee expansion for many years and we secured a ringfenced funding commitment as part of New Decade, New Approach. We also worked hard to secure a commitment to supporting Magee expansion in the draft Programme for Government in the south. “The money was made available and in the months that followed, we urged the DUP and Sinn Fein to make the necessary decisions and get this project delivered. “Not only did we find ourselves rebuked as negative when asking practical questions, we were told that it was a done deal. “Clearly, it is not as the First Minister was unable to provide these basic assurances today in the Assembly Chamber, when questioned by my colleague Mark H Durkan MLA. “We will continue to fight for the Medical School and a fully expanded Magee campus. We hope that it will still open next year, but this latest statement from the First Minister makes it more dficult. “At very least, the people of Derry deserve transparency and honesty from those holding the most senior positions in the Executive. SDLP Economy Spokesperson, Sinead McLaughlin MLA added: “This is a very disappointing lack of clarity and to be blunt, Im angry about it. We were promised the Magee Medical School was coming next year and now we are not sure. “We have to invest in training more doctors to reduce locum costs and to strengthen our health service. Covid- demonstrated the need, but it looks likely that Derry and the North West will be let down by the DUP and Sinn Fein, once again.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

From  July, subject to the rate of community transmission continuing to be low, people will no longer need to shield and should instead follow the same guidance and precautions as those considered to be generally vulnerable. That involves taking particular care when out and about - and strictly maintaining social distancing. Letters will be issued in the coming days to all those covered by shielding informing them of the planned change. Mr Swann stated:“I have been clear that shielding would not last one minute longer than it needed to. We have now reached the point where,the current trends continue, there will be no need for anyone to shield after  July. googletag.cmd.push “I have listened to many of you and to the challenges you have faced during this period. I am in no doubt as to the dficulties shielding has presented for a great many people. “It is unrealistic to think these dficulties will just vanish because the need to shield has ended. That is why the letters we issue will provide details of the support which will continue to be available up to and after  July. “While my announcement today will be welcome news for many who are shielding, some will view the prospect of an end to shielding with great anxiety. I want to assure them that they should decide what to do at their own pace. Everyone will approach this situation dferently. googletag.cmd.push “As is so often the case at present, this will be about weighing up the options and making informed choices. Going outside can bring some degree of potential risk but this can be mitigated and minimised by strict social distancing. Staying indoors indefinitely is not good for anyone’s mental or physical health. “Finally, I would ask everyone to be considerate as people end their periods of shielding. We should all continue to social distance, but in the coming weeks I want you to be particularly understanding of the fact you might be encountering someone who has had to stay at home for many weeks. Please be aware of this, show respect and kindness to all and keep your distance.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

These exclusive photographs show the special screens which have been erected at Tinneys Bar in Derry. All other pubs are expected to install similar screens between staff and customers as the hospitality sector reopens following the coronavirus lockdown.  A local blinds shop has been assisting Derry bars and businesses as they prepare to reopen safely. Ace Blinds have been operating in the Derry area, serving the community for over five years and employing local people. As businesses adjust to the so-called new normal after lockdown, they have to enforce social distancing and come up with innovative ways to protect their customers. googletag.cmd.push Therefore, Ace Blinds has fitted ‘COVID- roller shields’ in local bars and the orders have been mounting from other businesses in the city. “It has gone a bit crazy at the minute and we have already taken  orders for bars,” says John Kelly of Ace Blinds. It is new territory for Ace Blinds in terms of the material they are using. “The plastic material suits bars great as they can be moved up and down very easily, not like perspex, and they are a lot easier on the eye for customers, so more friendly. They can be attached to suspension ceilings with a special clip so no drillingneeds be. googletag.cmd.push “The material is easily cleaned, you just hold the bottom bar and wipe clean and it can be secured to bars or the groundneeded.” The company has fitted the bathroom at EI Engineering to separate sinks which provides an extra layer of protection for workers. Other businesses in the town have come to them with dferent proposals which they’re working through together. This week, the Economy Minister Dianne Dodds announced that all non-essential goods retailers in Northern Ireland can re-open from tomorrow. Pubs and restaurants are expected to follow suit in July. Confirming the ‘major step forward’, the Minister said: “The pandemic has had a devastating impact on the local economy. The recovery has already begun and it is time now for the pace to accelerate. The re-opening of all goods retail outlets will be a huge part of this. “The safety of staff and customers is of course paramount. All retailers must be able to implement measures that minimise the risk to their staff and to the people who visit their stores. “We will be co-existing with this virus for some time to come so it is vital that we continue to adhere to guidance to work and live safely.” The Minister added: “The re-opening of our local shopping sector is a signicant step forward in the Executive’s pathway to recovery. I and my Executive colleagues remain committed to moving forward in the recovery while at all times keeping the health, wellbeing and safety of people at the centre and being transparent in our approach.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

A new m footway and cycleway has been constructed between the Ford Road junction on Mayogall Road in Clady. The project, along with m of resurfacing work, marks the completion of the project at an estimated cost of pound,. Mid Ulster District Councillor Sean McPeake congratulated DFI Roads Service on the completion of the project. He said: “The newly created footway will make it much safer for all road and footway users including school children attending the local schools, pedestrians and motorists alike. googletag.cmd.push “With the popularity of cycling ever increasing the widening of the footway to include cycle-paths are a much-welcomed addition. “The junction of the Ford Road has been greatly improved with the removal of high verges at the entrance greatly improving visibility for those entering and exiting this junction. “I wish to thank Tracy Bratton DFI Roads Service and FP Mc Cann contractors for their cooperation in having this signicant road safety project delivered. The residents of Clady and surrounding area are very appreciative of these improvements, completed to a high standard that improves safety for motorists, walkers and cyclists alike.” Work has also been completed in the nearby area of Glenone, with safety chevrons restored on the Portglenone to Bellaghy Road. googletag.cmd.push Carntogher councillor Martin Kearney welcomed the development but condemned vandalism to road signage in the area. “A number of traffic accidents here in recent times have caused considerable concern to local road users,” he said. “Previous markers had been demolished as well with vehicles often ending up in the nearby fields. I am pleased to report the Department of Infrastructure has replaced these chevrons. “However, it is disappointing to note that when the local community were abiding by the advice to lockdown others were vandalising the nearby Ballynease Rd bilingual sign which has been there for over  years. Thankfully the Council have replaced that also.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Events will take the form of information sessions, live presentations, short films and live chats. Ulster University will host of iety of online events, from an interactive session on robotics to a discussion around language and identity. googletag.cmd.push With recent approval from the Executive Office for the opening of Magees Graduate-Entry Medical School, medicine will also be a big focus from Ulster University, with Professor Louise Dubras, Foundation Dean of the GEMS, and Professor Tony Bjourson of C-TRIC discussing medicine in the st century. North West Regional College lecturers will host a series of online events, ranging from swing dance style combinations, health and sport activities to include tips for a healthy lestyle, first aid and holistic health, as well as online cooking demos.

Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, Brian Tierney, said the range of events really captured the essence of what learning is about for all ages. Looking at the wonderful and wide-ranging programme that has been put in place for this festival is extremely exciting – there really is something for everyone and I think it has been adapted really well to fit in with the current climate in taking the festival online. We can all do with learning new things, whether its a new skill or education on really important issues like disability awareness or the role medicine plays in our society. This programme celebrates everyone, from our young children to our students, and the adults out there as well – its never too late to learn! Our current situation can be overwhelming and frustrating at times, and this festival offers the perfect solution, by picking up new skills and information, and by utilising technology in a way that we may never have needed before.” More details about the festival are available on the councils website.

The proposal would involve demolishing a number of landmark buildings on Duke Street and the construction of  apartments in their place. Duke Street is one of the busiest thoroughfares in to the city and is used by thousands of vehicles each day. While there are a number of shops on the street, there are also several derelict buildings, including those earmarked for demolition as part of the apartment plans. The company behind the plans, Hillvalley Properties, have said that the new apartments would help regenerate the area. googletag.cmd.push It is understood that the apartments would be used for social housing. The access to the complex would be via Spencer Road. There are no plans for the car parking within the complex, as the developers say that the apartments are in a central position. Within the complex, there are also plans to construct a garden and soft play area. A statement submitted to Derry City and Strabane District Council on behalf of the applicant said: Most of the buildings included in the application have lain vacant for many years and their replacement will only improve the visual outlook of this street.” googletag.cmd.push An application for the Duke Street apartments has recently been submitted to the councils planning department. Last year, the council approved plans for the erection of a separate seven-story residential building that will house  new apartments at a nearby vacant site at the corner of Duke Street and Fountain Hill. The  units will include  one-bedroom and  two -bedroom apartments. The development also includes associated site works and the development of an amenity space.

He spoke to Michael McMullan about his love for football, his career and answering Irelands call. *** It has always been football for Ruaidhri Higgins. Always. He has never known anything dferent. Even in Primary Four, Leo McCloskey saw enough to call him into the Termoncanice PS team. The following year, they lost a Northern Ireland final, before going one better  months later. It was the beginning for the man Stephen Kenny has put his trust into lead the scouting and analysis of the Republic of Ireland soccer team. googletag.cmd.push Higgins obsession for the game smashed through the roof when he began to play with the local Newtowne underage teams from the age of seven. “I wasnt one of those kids that was into cartoons, super heroes and Disney films, I was just obsessed by playing football from no age,” Ruaidhri begins. “I cant ever remember not playing it and it has been my le.” It began to get more serious when Kenny Shiels, who was taking his son Dean to play for Lisburn Youths at the time, asked Ruaidhris fatherhis son would join them. It was a prominent shop window for scouts, but the regular . kick-offs demanded a six oclock rise and trek up the M. googletag.cmd.push “It was a massive commitment,” Ruaidhri said, of his parents Danny and Marys time. For two years, it was Newtowne in the summer and Lisburn in the winter and all the travelling it entailed. They backed him  percent. Ruaidhri and Paddy are their youngest sons, with a  year gap to Michael and Kevin. “It is two dferent generations, but we are unbelievably close, the four of us,” Ruaidhri stresses. “I have been in every corner of Europe with football and they have always followed, they have been massive supporters in my career. “Without that upbringing and without that support, then I probably wouldnt be in the position I am in and wouldnt have had a career in this country like I had. I am very grateful and I dont take it for granted.” Ruaidhri played Gaelic football in his youth and as a pupil of St Marys Limavady lost an Ulster final replay to Coalisland. Growing up, he rarely missed a game when Derry were challenging for Sam Maguire. Even then, at the age of eight, Ruaidhri was deeper in thought than most. “The semi-final was probably the final, I remember when Johnny McGurk hit the winning score with his left foot,” Ruaidhri recalls of the  triumph, with the detail he will be using to suss out Irelands opponents. “It was a massive passion at that time but football shaded it. My brothers, my Da and my uncles first love would be GAA.” His first soccer football game was a trip to Parkhead to see Celtic come from - down to beat Dundee United in the Scottish Cup. He has been to Old Trafford, but doesnt have a favourite team. “I wouldnt say I am a fan of anyone. I am a football fan and I would look out for Celtic orUniteds score but it wouldnt ruin my weekendthey didnt win.” As the years passed, Ruaidhris prowess in the ious underage leagues attracted the attention of soccer scouts and was forward and back with too many clubs before opting for Coventry City. *** There were offers from more prominent clubs on the table, but Coventry attracted him. A chance for first team football, a long-term contract and hospitality all influenced his decision. “I was made feel unbelievably welcome, even at that age, by Gordon Strachan, the first team manager,” Ruaidhri states. “Richard Money, the Academy Director, and George Mackiemade my family feel unbelievably welcome every time we went over and made a big fuss.” Ruaidhri has no regrets about the move and completed his last two years of school in Coventry. At the time, a growth spurt led to knee problems and he spent the first two months in plaster and he didnt kick a ball for close to six months. “It was the right decision,” Ruaidhri points out of the club insisting he join earlier than anticipated. “I was playing through the pain barrier at home and they werent happy about it. Until they fixed it, I went  months in and out of playing because of the pain I was in. They had invested in me and were well within their rights. “It toughened me up. I moved away from home at  and had to become a man before a normal teenager, that stood me in good stead. Looking back, in terms of becoming more streetwise, it gave me a sound footing.” While he was happy with his progress in his first two years, he felt there was a genuine point he caught the eye of first-team manager Gary McAllister, who liked how Ruairi played in possession and he bagged two goals on his reserve debut. “I played really well and got peoples attention around the club,” Higgins felt. It was a quick evolution in how the game changed and relegation from the Championship sent out a warning message. “It was all about second balls and getting up and down the pitch. That didnt suit my style. Once athleticism started to take over from creative players, I kinda knew I might not have a career at that level,” he added. For four and half years, Coventry had high hopes for the Limavady man, but it faded away. When his contract ended, he wasnt too keen on going down the leagues. “It is a body blow to players when they get released from clubs in England. It is your dream, it is your passion, you feel you have failed.” Just when he needed a saviour, Stephen Kenny made the first of five important phone calls to Ruaidhri Higgins. *** With his teenage years coming to an end and his Coventry career over, an   number lit up on Ruaidhri Higgins phone. Kenny had just taken up the mantle as Derry City manager in August  and was putting together a squad. “I had never spoken to him before,” Ruaidhri reveals. “There was a definite rebuilding process when I came home, I wasnt the same person for six to  months. I lost my confidence and felt I had let people down,” he said, while stressing nothing was further from the truth. “Stephen was the perfect manager for me at that time. Living at home with my parents helped massively.” Slowly but surely he got his mojo back. “I owe Stephen a lot. In my first six months I played a lot in the reserve team just to get playing football again. I was performing better and better and running games in the reserves and it gave me the confidence that I could get my career back on track.” Kennys management skills continued, when he waited for the opportune moment to bed him back into the senior squad. It wasnt a rush, but rather some games to ease him into a regular spot. The Candystripes, with Higgins as a regular, won four League Cups in a row from  to . In , they won the FAI Cup with a - extra-time thriller, Kennys last game before taking over at Scottish side Dunfermline. After losing the  title to Cork City on the last day of the season, they missed the  treble after Shelbourne won the league on score dference. “Stephen brought great success and, particularly in  and , the Brandywell was packed and there was a great buzz”, Higgins states. “We had a really good run in Europe in  and that probably cost us the treble because of the backlog of games.” Derry beat IFK Gothenburg and Gretna before going out against Paris Saint-Germain - on aggregate, after holding the French side scoreless at the Brandywell in the first leg. Higgins played in both legs against Gothenburg and rates it has his European highlight. “They had three or four Swedish internationals that played in the  World Cup. We were something like - to win in Gothenburg,” he remembers. Kenny broke down their opponents in advance of the game, showing video clips of unknown teams and how they got results against Gothenburg. “I remember after that meeting, we walked out of it and we were thinking we have a helluva chance here. “We went out and deserved to win the game. It wasnt a smash and grab, it was an unbelievable performance. The home game we deserved to win that, we won - on aggregate and it was a massive achievement for the club.” Derry lost the FAI Cup final in  and were relegated to the First Division the following season, due to financial irregularities. “We went four or five months without pay. I had just bought a house, I had a mortgage and I had bills to pay,” Higgins points out. Pat Fenlon brought him to Bohemians. During the stint Bohs won the Setanta Cup, but Higgins was cup tied and missed out and again Higgins missed on a league medal on score dference to champions Shamrock Rovers. “I probably didnt do myself justice there. I had a decent period in mid-season, I lost my form and when Derry got promoted I went back there.” Back at the Brandywell, Higgins won a fth League Cup and in the FAI Cup decider, his flick on setup Rory Patterson for the extra-time winner. “We qualied for Europe through the league and were actually in the title race until four or five games in the season.” The  season, was one of Higgins best in a Derry shirt, but when Roddy Collins came in as manager, he wasnt in the plans. “I had a good season and had a new options and it was Stephenwho brought me to Dundalk and we won the League Cup, that was my sixth. It gave us the confidence to push on and win the league,” Higgins recalls. “We were trailing Cork going into the final game of the season. We played them at home and we beat them -, that was an amazing night. I was involved in four titles that went to the last game of the season, I lost three and won that one. “There has been a lot of ups and downs but thankfully there are a lot of good memories to look back on. You get lower with the downs than higher with the ups “Throughout my playing career in the League of Ireland, I averaged a trophy a season, so I had a successful enough playing career.” After a spell at Coleraine, where he also managed the U Academy squad, he began to focus more on coaching. He remembers Willie McKeown, then Coventrys Ireland scout telling him youve a great eye for the game and encouraging him to push on and get his coaching badges. “I had no interest at that time obviously. You have this dream of becoming a star footballer, but I genuinely always had an interest in the tactical side of the game,” said Higgins. Stephen Kenny also thought he had a good eye for the game and asked him to join Dundalks coaching staff. In the first season, they lost out to Cork City in the league. “I stayed in the role as analyst, we won thedouble and Stephen left to take theUs, Vinnywas promote to manager and I was promoted to assistant manager. So, I won the league with Dundalk in three dferent roles.” *** When Kenny was promoted to the Ireland manager post, he once again punched Higgins number into his phone. It was a brilliant call to get,not altogether a shock. “We have that relationship. He values me. It was a shock in a sense that it was the international stage, a dferent level. “It is a huge honour and a privilege to be asked. I had made my mind up very quickly because it is impossible to turn that opportunity down when it comes.” He acknowledges Dundalk, who he states were amazing in giving him the . Going to another League of Ireland Cup would have took some serious thinking. “When you are going to the international stage, it is incredibility tough to even consider turning that down,” Ruaidhri highlights. Now the work starts again in earnest. When I first call, he is scouring footage of European play-off opponents Bulgaria. His weeks are taken up with meetings, both online and face to face where circumstances allow it. “ One thing you can be sure, Stephen will have plenty for you to do and he leaves nothing to chance,” Ruaidhri stresses. “We have two games in early September, thats the main focus for myself, Stephen and the staff under him.” When le gets back to normal and gamesto the fixture calendar, Ruaidhri will be clocking up the air miles. “I will be going to watch our own players in England and reporting back, as well as studying the opposition,” he adds. Nothing beats being there and seeing a game in the flesh. The TV camera will only ever follow the ball. “If you have a birds eye view from the stand, you can see everything that is going on. When the ball is at this end of the pitch, what is the teams shape like back here. “When you are watching an inidual player, you literally focus on the player. It is dferentyou are watching a team. You are analysing the whole structure of the team. It is two completely dferent things,” Higgins continues. From playing on Termoncanices school team, to now, he is now an important cog in international football and takes Stephens approach as a massive compliment. “There are a lot of bigger names than me, who he couldve went after and have loved the position. He has huge trust in me and sees the value I can bring and I take it as a massive compliment and for me, it is a huge confidence booster.” He has never been at a major tournament as a fan. Watching from a pub as Damien Duff tore Spain apart in the  World Cup clash in Suwon is a memory, a game Ireland lost on penalties. “Damien was probably the best winger in the world and thats not exaggerating,” Higgins says of the man who, along with Alan Kelly and Keith Andrews, is now in the management setup with him. Now, qualying for a major tournament would be a dream, but as part of the management is also an objective Higgins has an input to. “We have an opportunity within the next two years of getting to the Euros and getting to a World Cup. “You dream of it when you were a small boy. We will be doing everything we can, it wont be from the want of trying. We have a really good group of players to go and try to achieve something special.” Football has always been Ruaidhri Higgins le. His skill set has opened the latest door of opportunity.

He spoke to Michael McMullan about his love for football, his career and answering Irelands call. *** It has always been football for Ruaidhri Higgins. Always. He has never known anything dferent. Even in Primary Four, Leo McCloskey saw enough to call him into the Termoncanice PS team. The following year, they lost a Northern Ireland final, before going one better  months later. It was the beginning for the man Stephen Kenny has put his trust into lead the scouting and analysis of the Republic of Ireland soccer team. googletag.cmd.push Higgins obsession for the game smashed through the roof when he began to play with the local Newtowne underage teams from the age of seven. “I wasnt one of those kids that was into cartoons, super heroes and Disney films, I was just obsessed by playing football from no age,” Ruaidhri begins. “I cant ever remember not playing it and it has been my le.” It began to get more serious when Kenny Shiels, who was taking his son Dean to play for Lisburn Youths at the time, asked Ruaidhris fatherhis son would join them. It was a prominent shop window for scouts, but the regular . kick-offs demanded a six oclock rise and trek up the M. googletag.cmd.push “It was a massive commitment,” Ruaidhri said, of his parents Danny and Marys time. For two years, it was Newtowne in the summer and Lisburn in the winter and all the travelling it entailed. They backed him  percent. Ruaidhri and Paddy are their youngest sons, with a  year gap to Michael and Kevin. “It is two dferent generations, but we are unbelievably close, the four of us,” Ruaidhri stresses. “I have been in every corner of Europe with football and they have always followed, they have been massive supporters in my career. “Without that upbringing and without that support, then I probably wouldnt be in the position I am in and wouldnt have had a career in this country like I had. I am very grateful and I dont take it for granted.” Ruaidhri played Gaelic football in his youth and as a pupil of St Marys Limavady lost an Ulster final replay to Coalisland. Growing up, he rarely missed a game when Derry were challenging for Sam Maguire. Even then, at the age of eight, Ruaidhri was deeper in thought than most. “The semi-final was probably the final, I remember when Johnny McGurk hit the winning score with his left foot,” Ruaidhri recalls of the  triumph, with the detail he will be using to suss out Irelands opponents. “It was a massive passion at that time but football shaded it. My brothers, my Da and my uncles first love would be GAA.” His first soccer football game was a trip to Parkhead to see Celtic come from - down to beat Dundee United in the Scottish Cup. He has been to Old Trafford, but doesnt have a favourite team. “I wouldnt say I am a fan of anyone. I am a football fan and I would look out for Celtic orUniteds score but it wouldnt ruin my weekendthey didnt win.” As the years passed, Ruaidhris prowess in the ious underage leagues attracted the attention of soccer scouts and was forward and back with too many clubs before opting for Coventry City. *** There were offers from more prominent clubs on the table, but Coventry attracted him. A chance for first team football, a long-term contract and hospitality all influenced his decision. “I was made feel unbelievably welcome, even at that age, by Gordon Strachan, the first team manager,” Ruaidhri states. “Richard Money, the Academy Director, and George Mackiemade my family feel unbelievably welcome every time we went over and made a big fuss.” Ruaidhri has no regrets about the move and completed his last two years of school in Coventry. At the time, a growth spurt led to knee problems and he spent the first two months in plaster and he didnt kick a ball for close to six months. “It was the right decision,” Ruaidhri points out of the club insisting he join earlier than anticipated. “I was playing through the pain barrier at home and they werent happy about it. Until they fixed it, I went  months in and out of playing because of the pain I was in. They had invested in me and were well within their rights. “It toughened me up. I moved away from home at  and had to become a man before a normal teenager, that stood me in good stead. Looking back, in terms of becoming more streetwise, it gave me a sound footing.” While he was happy with his progress in his first two years, he felt there was a genuine point he caught the eye of first-team manager Gary McAllister, who liked how Ruairi played in possession and he bagged two goals on his reserve debut. “I played really well and got peoples attention around the club,” Higgins felt. It was a quick evolution in how the game changed and relegation from the Championship sent out a warning message. “It was all about second balls and getting up and down the pitch. That didnt suit my style. Once athleticism started to take over from creative players, I kinda knew I might not have a career at that level,” he added. For four and half years, Coventry had high hopes for the Limavady man, but it faded away. When his contract ended, he wasnt too keen on going down the leagues. “It is a body blow to players when they get released from clubs in England. It is your dream, it is your passion, you feel you have failed.” Just when he needed a saviour, Stephen Kenny made the first of five important phone calls to Ruaidhri Higgins. *** With his teenage years coming to an end and his Coventry career over, an   number lit up on Ruaidhri Higgins phone. Kenny had just taken up the mantle as Derry City manager in August  and was putting together a squad. “I had never spoken to him before,” Ruaidhri reveals. “There was a definite rebuilding process when I came home, I wasnt the same person for six to  months. I lost my confidence and felt I had let people down,” he said, while stressing nothing was further from the truth. “Stephen was the perfect manager for me at that time. Living at home with my parents helped massively.” Slowly but surely he got his mojo back. “I owe Stephen a lot. In my first six months I played a lot in the reserve team just to get playing football again. I was performing better and better and running games in the reserves and it gave me the confidence that I could get my career back on track.” Kennys management skills continued, when he waited for the opportune moment to bed him back into the senior squad. It wasnt a rush, but rather some games to ease him into a regular spot. The Candystripes, with Higgins as a regular, won four League Cups in a row from  to . In , they won the FAI Cup with a - extra-time thriller, Kennys last game before taking over at Scottish side Dunfermline. After losing the  title to Cork City on the last day of the season, they missed the  treble after Shelbourne won the league on score dference. “Stephen brought great success and, particularly in  and , the Brandywell was packed and there was a great buzz”, Higgins states. “We had a really good run in Europe in  and that probably cost us the treble because of the backlog of games.” Derry beat IFK Gothenburg and Gretna before going out against Paris Saint-Germain - on aggregate, after holding the French side scoreless at the Brandywell in the first leg. Higgins played in both legs against Gothenburg and rates it has his European highlight. “They had three or four Swedish internationals that played in the  World Cup. We were something like - to win in Gothenburg,” he remembers. Kenny broke down their opponents in advance of the game, showing video clips of unknown teams and how they got results against Gothenburg. “I remember after that meeting, we walked out of it and we were thinking we have a helluva chance here. “We went out and deserved to win the game. It wasnt a smash and grab, it was an unbelievable performance. The home game we deserved to win that, we won - on aggregate and it was a massive achievement for the club.” Derry lost the FAI Cup final in  and were relegated to the First Division the following season, due to financial irregularities. “We went four or five months without pay. I had just bought a house, I had a mortgage and I had bills to pay,” Higgins points out. Pat Fenlon brought him to Bohemians. During the stint Bohs won the Setanta Cup, but Higgins was cup tied and missed out and again Higgins missed on a league medal on score dference to champions Shamrock Rovers. “I probably didnt do myself justice there. I had a decent period in mid-season, I lost my form and when Derry got promoted I went back there.” Back at the Brandywell, Higgins won a fth League Cup and in the FAI Cup decider, his flick on setup Rory Patterson for the extra-time winner. “We qualied for Europe through the league and were actually in the title race until four or five games in the season.” The  season, was one of Higgins best in a Derry shirt, but when Roddy Collins came in as manager, he wasnt in the plans. “I had a good season and had a new options and it was Stephenwho brought me to Dundalk and we won the League Cup, that was my sixth. It gave us the confidence to push on and win the league,” Higgins recalls. “We were trailing Cork going into the final game of the season. We played them at home and we beat them -, that was an amazing night. I was involved in four titles that went to the last game of the season, I lost three and won that one. “There has been a lot of ups and downs but thankfully there are a lot of good memories to look back on. You get lower with the downs than higher with the ups “Throughout my playing career in the League of Ireland, I averaged a trophy a season, so I had a successful enough playing career.” After a spell at Coleraine, where he also managed the U Academy squad, he began to focus more on coaching.

His book has been described in The Independent as ldquoone of the finest pieces of modern nature writing in recent years. In this extract the autistic teenager shares his joy of the natural world on a day out to Murlough with his sister and brother.OUR garden is thrumming with birds today: coal, blue and great tits, blackbird, thrush, magpie, jackdaw, rook, all of them revelling on the grass, pecking at the feeders.I could happily watch them all day but rain is coming from the east, so we decide to go west to the coast at Murlough to stay in the sunshine. I usually despise being in the sun. I find its light too bright, its heat too hot, and it can make me feel astherersquos nowhere to hide. But with this rain coming, I feel like being on the dunes at Murlough, pressed by warmth and sea breezes.The ancient dune system here is six thousand years old, fragile and spectacular. The unusually high dunes were formed in the late th and th centuries by massive storms, and were used by people in the Middle Ages as rabbit warrens to provide them with meat and pelts.Grazing rabbits encouraged the grassy heathland here, but when myxomatosis first broke out in the s, as it did in other parts of Ireland and Britain, the population was almost wiped out. With fewer rabbits, sea buckthorn and sycamore could grow, turning heath to scrubland. Now the National Trust have intervened at Murlough, managing the landscape so it reverts back to heath mdash and judging from the copious pings, it looks like the rabbits are thriving again, too.The day is sparkling, the wind is shaking and shaping the clouds. Lorcan and Blaacutethnaid want to swim, so I stroll along the beach with my binoculars. Shapes out at sea stop me: a trinity of torpedoing gannets. They swoop, wheel and suddenly drop, spiralling until the last second when they transform into arrows before hitting the water.Swallows are overhead ndash I can see their small bodies so clearly, weightless and constantly moving. I feel myself rising with them.My dark, knotted thoughts seem to be staying away at the moment. I feel as free as the gannets and swallows. If they can live their lives, shouldnrsquot I do the same  Can I breathe and live and also fight  The natural world mdash which includes us mdash is facing such enormous challenges that itrsquos easy to become overwhelmed and depressed. But we must fix them, andIrsquom no longer here, alive, I canrsquot be part of the solution.What is it thatrsquos holding me back  Anxiety  Depression  Autism  These are the shackles. Surely, I can break free. Or at least I can accept these things as part of me. I have no answers, but the lightness of these thoughts and these days weave my body and mind with everything around me. The only thing that I am really bound to is nature ndash as we all are.Lorcan and Blaacutethnaid are running towards me, and I run to them, and then we run together, exultant. We slow down in unison, all feeling the same pull of the large peculiar shells dotted around the beach. We each pick one up and hold them outstretched, delicate porcelain in our hands.They look like pale planets, pockmarked with symmetrical lines. I rattle mine, listening to the whisper of sand and the past. These are sea potatoes mdash a type of sand-burrowing sea urchin mdash with pocks that once held spines and a bleached calcium carbonate shell that could so easily shatter on land or at sea. Each one is a miracle. So many miracles washed up at once.We start to collect them and Lorcan decides to name three of the best specimens Sandy, Sam and Sandra. He holds a conversation with them, three sea potatoes, which makes us laugh so hard that tears well up and almost flow, and wersquore still laughing as a warm rain starts to fall on us.Under dark skies, I feel completely unburdened of any doubts in my own abilities to help our planet. Instead, I feel energised and ready. Sopping wet and cold and with chattering teeth, still giggling madly, I feel hope pouring in the rain. Being myself is enough.Diary of a Young Naturalist by Dara McAnulty is published by Little Tollerand can be bought online, or at No Alibis bookshop in Belfast..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"A lifetime of capturing Ireland’s scenic beauty  ","story":"AMATEUR photographer Chris Laverty spent a letime capturing Irelandrsquos scenic beauty.The former Queenrsquos University computer centre manager travelled extensively, always with his camera, and always with an eye for the magic of the countryside around him.

As we work to do so, our absolute priority will be to keep our patients, service users and staff safe. the statement adds.The health trustrsquos insistence that emergency services will be restored at the Downe comes ahead of a meeting with a Sinn Fein delegation to discuss the issue.Spearheaded by South Down MP, Chris Hazzard, the delegation will be seeking assurances that all services will be restored to their previous level.Ahead of the meeting, Mr Hazzard said that due to the pandemic, the local community was left without access to vital services at the Downe due to the health systemrsquos response to coronavirus which ldquorequired what amounted to extraordinary measures for an extraordinary time.The MP said the Downe was left ldquounrecognisable as emergency and outpatient services, amongst others, closed from the end of March.ldquoWhere required, all available staff and equipment from these units was also requisitioned for use in other parts of the South Eastern Trust area, he continued.ldquoIn agreeing to the radical reconfiguration of the Downe, the community made a big sacrice in order to accommodate the unprecedented demands made by both health trusts in the fight against Covid-.Insisting that it was the right thing to do at the right time, Mr Hazzard said there is now an onus on trust management to respond in kind to the community.He said the recently published recovery plans have delayed the restoration of vital services to the community, causing signicant concern amongst many who fear that ldquotemporary closure might inevitably mean permanent removal.Mr Hazzard said the Sinn Fein delegation will be calling for the full restoration of services at the Downe and will also be meeting with the chief executive of the Southern Trust to call for services removed from Newryrsquos Daisy Hill hospital to be reinstated.Rowallane DUP councillors are also demanding the full restoration of services at the Downe Hospital, highlighting the importance of reopening the emergency department as soon as possible.Cllr Billy Walker said it was ironic that within hours of confirmation that the Downpatrick ED would not reopen at this stage, the South Eastern Trust revealed via social media that the Ulster Hospitalrsquos emergency department was extremely busy.ldquoThis is nothing new, he declared. ldquoThere is a clear need for the Downersquos emergency department to reopen now. Having this facility available can help ease the pressure on other EDs and we cannot understand why there is not increased investment in Downpatrick.ldquoWe all understood the temporary closure of services at the Downe to allow health chiefs to respond to the global pandemic, but the time for those services to be reinstated is now.

However, bearing in mind the scheme is all but shovel ready, this should be a simple case of signing the commencement orders with construction starting as soon as possible.Mr Hazzard said the roads minister has a capital budget of more than poundm to be spent this year, suggesting that very few projects are as advanced as the Ballynahinch bypass.ldquoThere is no logical reason why this long overdue project canrsquot get the green light for construction as a matter of priority, he said.The MP added: ldquoIn light of the severe economic impact of Covid- and the ongoing Brexit uncertainty, the commencement of this scheme would be a welcome step towards improving both our local economy and the wellbeing of our community..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Darragh Cross residents bring cheer to local residential home  ","story":"RESIDENTS from Oakland Court in Darragh Cross made the most of the lockdown by having socially distanced nights of entertainment while helping the residents of a nearby residential home.From hosting fun events such as bingo and discos, they raised pound for Willowview Residential Home in Saintfield.Oakland Court residents would like to thank Darragh Crossrsquo Vivo shop for its donation of prize hampers and everyone who donated prizes and gts.In turn, all residents and staff of Willowview Residential Home would like to say pay their gratitude to to all the residents of Oakland Court and Darragh Cross Vivo for their kindness and thoughtfulness..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"DNA testing on dog dirt  ","story":"SENIOR Newry, Mourne and Down Council officers say they will need time to research the issue of using DNA testing on dog dirt in a bid to trace animals which are allowed to use public areas as open air toilets.Members of the local authorityrsquos Neighbourhood Services Committee will discuss the issue at their virtual meeting later today.A motion on the issue tabled by Rowallane councillor Patrick Brown at the March meeting of the full council was referred to the local authority committee for discussion.Dog dirt poses a major health risk, especially to children, who could potentially lose their sight as a result of coming into contact with it.Cllr Brown said there was a need to consider innovative ways of tackling the issue which has been raised on a regular basis by elected representatives across the local authorityrsquos seven DEAs.He is keen for the local authority to investigate the viability of using DNA testing in a bid to identy offenders and aid enforcement officers to dish out fines.Cllr Brown is also eager for council officials to draw upon best practice from other councils who have introduced such a scheme in a bid to crack down on the dog fouling issue.In addition, he wants the local authority to roll out what he has described as an ldquoenhanced public awareness campaign focusing on the dangers of dog fouling.Ahead of tonightrsquos council meeting, officers are recommending that Cllr Brownrsquos motion is agreed to allow them time to research similar schemes which have been introduced where.In addition, officers say that they will need to understand the time and resources required to implement such a scheme locally beforereporting back to the council committee.Politicians, who have previously asked for more enforcement staff to be deployed across the district to deal with the dog fouling problem, say the highly contentious issue is one of the single most complained about problems in the area.They say that despite valiant efforts over recent years by council officials and others, the issue has not been adequately addressed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Drive in assembly at Crossgar primary school  ","story":"CEDAR Integrated Primary School in Crossgar has said farewell to its P pupils.Staff held a drive-in leavers ceremony for the outgoing P class last Friday.Parents and carers were invited to park in the playground and watch the  pupils receive folders of their work from their time at Cedar.They also received a survival kit for lsquobig schoolrsquo, as well as trophies for sports, arts and ICT,.

He was also famous for discovering milk chocolate.Born in Killyleagh on April , , Sir Hans died in Cha in , aged  and described as the worldrsquos greatest collector who, from his earliest years, catalogued and carefully encased every artefact that he found.Over the years he accumulated nearly , items many of which today are on display in the British Museum.Close to the picturesque harbour in Killyleagh stands a copy of the London statue in honour of Sir Hans with a local councillor branding the campaign to take down the statues in the capital as ldquoridiculousCllr Billy Walker insists that the pioneering physician was not a slave trader and that the clamour for many statues to be taken down was becoming ldquosilly, urging the Government to show some backbone on the matter.He said Sir Hans was ldquorevered in his home town where people were proud to have a copy of the statue to a man who did so much for the world.Cllr Walker continued: ldquoSir Hans gave us the concept of free museums, found a cure for smallpox and pioneered science and medicine to do away with magic for treating illness.ldquoHe also promoted the use of quinine against malaria, discovered milk chocolate and was the first man to lead both Royal Colleges.

In addition to the services directly provided at our local hospital mdash the peoplersquos hospital mdash Downe staff were redeployed to other healthcare facilities andcontributed enormously to the NHS effort.When the emergency planning was taking effect, it was the clear understanding of many local political and community representatives, that the emergency department service would be restored immediately upon the conclusion of the pandemic.Whilst there is clearly a signicant possibility of a so-called second surge in infections mdash and we are all aware as to just how serious such a second surge could be mdash at the same time there is increased normalisation of health provision across the North.The restoration of the urgent care service previously provided at the Downe must be a top priority as part of this normalisation. It should have been included in the June action plan, published by the health trust last week.Just last week, as attendances were increasing at the remaining emergency departments, including at the Ulster Hospital, it was apparent that existing facilities are and will be unable to cope with demand.During the Covid emergency planning, decisions were taken to temporarily close the emergency departments at the Downe, Daisy Hill and the Mater hospitals.Just last week, trade union representatives received categorical assurances from the Southern Trust about the re-opening of about Daisy Hill Hospital. Similar assurances are now required about the Downe.There is also a signicant impetus gathering now for the implementation of restructuring of healthcare services generally, and of urgent care in particular, across Northern Ireland.Decisions about the future of healthcare, particularly urgent care, afford an excellent opportunity to redress health inequalities that have arisen and been perpetuated by the historic under investment in the health service by successive governments and by the pursuit of centralisation policies.Many people believe that those centralisation policies played a crucial role in leaving us facing into a pandemic with insufficient hospital beds, insufficient intensive care beds, insufficient ambulance cover, insufficient ventilators and insufficient healthcare workers.Any change to emergency and urgent care provision is only permissible where it happens with the consent of the people.In the final analysis, decisions about the allocation of healthcare resources are political decisions taken by politicians, elected by the people and not by bureaucrats. Tiers and levels of bureaucracy make no dference to where ultimate responsibility lies.I have a great deal of sympathy for the recently appointed health minister, Robin Swann, who within a few weeks of his appointment, found himself facing the biggest public health emergency in the history of the National Health Service.I would respectfully suggest that Mr Swann should insist upon the criteria for change stated by Michelle OrsquoNeill when she was Health Minister.The now Deputy First Minister stated in November  that local people should be at the centre of decision-making processes in designing and delivering services. The , people who marched through Downpatrick in support of the Downe Hospitalin the Love the Downe Rally on February , , would certainly agree with that.As far back as , Dr Michael McBride, speaking at the sod cutting ceremony for the new Downe Hospital, said that ldquothe emphasis would be on making the health system respond to the patient rather than the patient to the system. I concur with that.In the Down Recorder of November , , after the publication of the Bengoa Report, Michelle OrsquoNeill was quoted as saying: ldquoWe will deliver care and support in the most appropriate settings, ideally in peoplersquos homes and communities.Again, I would concur with that.If there is to be a change in urgent care provision across Northern Ireland, no one can expect to be immune from that change. At the same time, change would only be possible or acceptableit is to create a better service for all of the people and a fair and equitable distribution of services.Many people in this area believe that we have had a very raw deal for over  years from the health service and some politicians.It sometimes seems to be forgotten that the National Health Service is free at the point of use, but it is certainly not without cost. It is the people who pay for it.Rural communities have particular characteristics and needs that must be addressed, in terms of at the most basic, accessibility to services. Like everyone , they have rights.Access to healthcare is a right, not a privilege.If it is to be the case that urgent care is being restructured, citizens in rural areas which, for this purpose, includes virtually anyone outside the Greater Belfast area, cannot be expected to forego services so that Belfast can continue to enjoy a proleration of emergency services, with not one but two Type  emergency departments on the scale of that at the Ulster Hospital, on its overdeveloped and cramped site, the Royal Victoria Hospital and the Mater, with the Type  unit at the Lagan Valley hospital, just seven miles from Belfast, a similar distance to that travelled by the people of Ardglass to the Downe hospital.Of course, Type  emergency departments are also to be found at Antrim and Craigavon, neither of which are far from Belfast and are linked by the best possible road infrastructure.Logically, it would seem, that the existence of two Type  units in Belfast is not sustainable, given the apparent massive pressure on services.We were told by the Department of Health at the time of the January  public meeting in Downpatrick Cricket Club that the purpose of that meeting was to enable local people to ldquofundamentally shape, inform and influence the criteria to be used to deliver services in the future.We hope that is still the case and await meaningful engagement with the community before change is implemented.The then deputy permanent secretary was quoted as having said that the then Minister would want to see ldquoongoing engagement in redesigning services. I am sure that the current Health Minister has the same views.The challenge for the Health Minister in the future must surely be to develop a fair and equitable distribution of services that would end discrimination against rural communities and ensure that all services, including ambulance services, are readily accessible to all of the people.It is worth remembering as well, that there was actually a .%in the attendances at emergency departments in Northern Ireland between December  and December . In the same period, attendances at the Downe Hospitalrsquos emergency department rose signicantly.Decisions about change in the health service are political decisions. All of the major parties form the Northern Ireland Executive, which is collectively accountable for the program for government and all that it delivers or fails to deliver for the people.It is imperative that any attempt to change or restructure healthcare provision in Northern Ireland is done so in full consultation with the end users of the services, who are also the paymasters for it. This will be very dficult, as history has created a deep mistrust between substantial elements in our community and the Department of Health.Our community has suffered greatly from repeated cuts to services and the ruthless pursuit of a centralisation agenda a pursuit that has continued even in recent years when the NHS in England and Wales has been investing in and supporting smaller hospitals, recognising their crucial roles at the heart of local communities and using technological advances to support them.If it appears that Covid- is being used as a cover to implement long-standing Department of Health policy, then any changes would be resented by the community and in fact rejected by it. This would lead to an irreparable breach of trust between the people and the State.If an attempt is made to in any way reduce the services that are currently on offer at the Downe Hospital, this community, as it has done before, will rise up in righteous indignation.Twenty five thousand people took to the streets of Downpatrick in February . If our emergency department is not restored within a reasonable timescale mdash a matter of weeks mdash it is very likely that this area will see an unprecedented display of anger, with , plus people on the street, with legal challenges about any perceived abuse of process and a community-wide campaign, a cross-community campaign and political upheaval at the highest level of government.The people of East and South Down have had enough. They have reluctantly sacriced local services, as a temporary measure in the short term, but their resolve should not be underestimated.The people of Newcastle, Ballynahinch, Castlewellan, Ardglass, Killough, Clough, Downpatrick, Strangford, Crossgar, Lower Mourne and the vast surrounding rural hinterland need these services.Farmers, fishermen and builders need emergency care as much as ever, so too do the tourists who flock into our area every year and probably will do so in even greater numbers this year.It is time to restore the Downe Hospitalrsquos emergency department and it is time to concentrate investment in local services, delivering for the people who need the services, where they need those services.The NHS must serve the people from ldquocradle to grave. It is a part of the social contract between the people and those who govern them.Politicians and administrators come and go. The Downe hospital must live on, developing all the time the range of services it offers.Equality demands nothing less..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Revered servant of local cricket  ","story":"Robin Walsh remembers Alfie Linehan, the distinguished Downpatrick cricket stalwart who died last yearTHE great paradox of Alfie Linehan was to be found in his disposition on the cricket field and off it.At the crease, his was a belligerent style, hitting the ball farther than anyone , compiling his runs in a manner that kept the scorers busy. Beyond the boundary!Yet this domineering, almost bullying, approach belied one of Irish cricketrsquos truest gentlemen off it: soft-spoken, never a word that offended, never a word against him.In one of the most distinguished legacies to the local game, the late Downpatrick farmer captained the Ireland team before turning to administration in the roles of chairman and president of the Northern Cricket Union and president of the Irish Cricket Union.Yet it was where it mattered most, at the grassroots of the game, that Alfie left his indelible mark.His devotion to the Downpatrick club and its famous international ground The Meadow was boundless and le-long, from underage player to captain of the club, coach and ultimately chairman and president.He either played or captained Downpatrick in five NCU Senior League, three Senior Cup-winning sides and an Irish Senior Cup triumph along with his older brother Hugh, another talented batsman whose death at the age of  dealt a terrible blow to Alfie.In later years it was a source of great pride that Hughrsquos son, Paul, was to captain the club and daughter Anne played for Ireland.His wersquos nephew, James Cunningham, also captained the club.Alfiersquos hard-hitting ways over four decades from the s took him to  Irish appearances mdash six of them as captain mdash in the days when international caps were much less liberally awarded, and his contribution to the success of NCU representative cricket has rarely been equalled.Administration was an endless labour of love at local, provincial and national level. Such was his accommodating nature that he chaired countless committees ranging from solving an umpire shortage in the NCU to raising funds at ICU golf days.His contribution to his local community extended far beyond the boundaries of the cricket club.In his day he was a member of the NI Sports Council, a director of his local hospital trust and president of Ardglass Golf Club.Alfiersquos friends were legion, none more close than Cecil Walker, that leading light of the Lisburn club.Their playing days over, they travelled the world with their wives watching international cricket and storing delightful memories of new friendships, whether tales of the Bodyline era over tea with Harold Larwood at his home in Sydney, or a fond mention by David lsquoBumblersquo Lloyd from the commentary box.Of all thatrsquos been written down the years about Alfie Linehan, one game has been overlooked and yet it speaks more than any of his commitment to Downpatrick.It was Saturday, August , , and Downpatrick were due to play Lurgan. It was also the day of Alfiersquos wedding to his beloved Mary. No problem: wedding in the morning, cricket in the afternoon, reception in the evening, off on honeymoon the next day.Of all the tributes paid to Alfie none has been more signicant than that on BBC Televisionrsquos Sports Personality of the Year programme last December.He was included in the prestigious roll of honour of international sports personalities who had died during . The programme called them ldquospecial people.My own personal memory of Alfie will always be the toast he iniably delivered at the end of an eveningrsquos conviviality, of which there were many:ldquoMay you always walk in sunshineSlumber warm when night winds blowMay you always live with laughterFor a smile becomes you soThis article was first published on the CricketEurope website as

Following a prolonged period of dry weather water levels have dropped to around %. It hasnt been that low since . Picture: Michael CooperSince the beginning of lockdown, the company has seen a signicant rise in the amount of water used in homes.This rise, coupled with the dry weather, has contributed to a drop in water levels in reservoirs.Increased household use has not been offset by the closure of businesses, as many high water users, such as the agri-food sector, factories etc. have been able to stay operational during this time. NI Water Chief Executive Sara Venning said: “This recent dry spell, which has been breaking records, coupled with more people at home using more water, has resulted in a signicant drop in our water levels.  \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

We would need a period of reasonably wet weather before we would see a signicant change in the levels of most of our reservoirs.“There are a number of steps NI Water can take to alleviate the stress on reservoirs including a hosepipe ban.However, the key to conserving water is public action now.How we all use our water now will have a massive impact on our water levels during the summer months and on whether a hosepipe ban will be required.“For example, we know from the increase in our night usage some customers are leaving sprinklers and hoses on overnight we are appealing to them to stop.A sprinkler left on overnight is enough to meet the daily water needs of  families. We are also asking people to think before they use their pressure washer. Could the task be put off until we are out of this dry period  “However, the easiest way for everyone to save a little water and make a big dference is through normal household tasks.If each of us turned off the tap when brushing our teeth, in a month we would save enough water for the daily handwashing of  people.  “Similarly,you put a jug of water into the fridge rather than running the tap, those actions alone would save approximately  litres per day.This is enough to keep  people hydrated for a whole day! “We want everyone to enjoy their home and garden, we just need people to think about how they use their water andwhat they are doing is essential.If it is not essential we would really appeal to people not do it at the moment.”\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

in one of his articles that such a progressive town as Penarth was without an operatic and dramatic society, writes Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Societypresident, Mary Gardner.The response to his outcry was quickly taken up and within three weeks the Penarth Operatic Society was formed.The Societyrsquos first production was Gilbert  Sullivanrsquos Iolanthe, played at The Hippodrome which later burnt down, and what a glittering opening evening it must have been as the audience wore evening dress.The review featured next day read, ldquoBrilliant Initial Performance.More newsVale council issues warning over the use of parksFines increased for coronavirus lockdown breachesMarie Curie Great Blooming Tea Party goes virtualA few years later in , the drama section came into being and with it a new title of the Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Society, known affectionately as PODS.Since then PODS has progressed down through the decades with many highlights along the way.One being in  when PODS presented that great musical, The King And I, which won the premier prize at the Waterford International Festival, for which the company received a beautul Waterford crystal vase.The Town Council held a reception to honour the Society at the Paget Rooms, and James Callaghan, the local MP, paid his tribute to PODS saying it ldquoadded lustre and brought culture to Penarth.Another landmark was the play, Dear Octopus, by Dodie Smith produced for PODS th anniversary celebrations.One of our most challenging and exciting shows was Cabaret in , which won the National Operatic  Dramatic Associationrsquos award for Best Production and Best Stage Management and Technical presentation.More recently in , to honour and pay tribute to the many men who gave their lives in World War One, PODS presented the very special play, Last Man Standing, which also won a NODA award for Best Drama.In , PODS decided to do pantomime, and this has been a greatly gratying and popular addition to the companyrsquos output.Itrsquos wonderful to see children in the cast having on-stage experience, and then those children in the audience, perhaps for the first time, enjoying and loving live theatre.PODS is a very busy Society putting on four shows a year, a musical, two plays and a pantomime.Mrs Gardner said: ldquoThis year, sadly and very upsettingly after much hard work by all involved, the covid- virus struck as PODS had just set-up at the Paget Rooms ready for its run of Goodnight Mister Tom, only to be told the venue would be shut down next day.ldquoSince January, the Society had also been rehearsing for its May musical, The Full Monty, and that too has had to be cancelled.       ,params: .pushldquoNevertheless, when this terrible emergency is over the company will put on these two productions sometime in the future. ldquoPODS is proud of its achievement in giving much pleasure and entertainment to the local community with its first-class shows over the last  years, and its goal is to make its centenary in  with the help of its faithful audiences, friends and patrons.PODS is always ready to welcome new members, but at the moment it cannot meet or rehearse due to the covid- restrictions.It might be some time before restrictions are lted on groups being able to rehearse together, or audiences allowed back in theatres, meanwhile PODS members keep in touch

make face masks compulsory public transport","story":"Mark Drakeford said Englands decision to bring in a requirement for coverings had raised issues for people commuting between the two countries.It came as Public Health Wales said a further four people had died after testing positive for coronavirus, taking the total number of deaths to ,, while the number of positive cases grew by  to ,.More NewsLuxury car manufacturer Aston Martin to axe  jobsMans efforts toWorld War One Penarth soldiers plaque found in New ZealandPenarth RNLI leboat crew rescues people caught out by Bristol Channel tideOn Friday, Mr Drakeford was questioned about his governments position on non-medical coverings after a trade union representing doctors in Wales said bringing in rules would help control the spread of Covid- and save lives.Mr Drakeford told the Governments daily press briefing in Cardf: \"The context for face coverings has changed because of an announcement made yesterday in England about mandatory use of face masks on public transport.\"That will not come in until June , and that gives us a short number of days in order to consider the position here in Wales recognising that changed context.\"Mr Drakeford said a \"definitive statement\" on the issue would be made in the first part of next week, and that detailed questions about Englands new rules would be explored with ministers and officials in Westminster.But he said the UK Government had not discussed or given advanced notice of the decision with Wales, and questioned whether England was concerned with \"making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards\".\"I wish that wed had a chance to explore this with the UK Government before they made the announcements,\" he said.\"That would have allowed us to have some answers to the questions that I raised today before the event rather than after the event.\"But while on the bulk of issues we continue to be able to have discussion and co-operation in advance of decision making, in a small number of cases we hear about it only after the decision has been made.\"He added: \"Were going to have to use the time we now have to find out from them the extent to which they have got answers to these questions in advance of making the decision, or whether its a matter of making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards.\"Mr Drakeford said the advice from the chief medical officer for Wales remained that wearing face masks gave people \"some marginal extra protection\" but was not sufficient to make it mandatory.\"The chief medical officer has expressed his anxieties that people might do more risky things because they think a face mask offers them protection, which it doesnt,\" Mr Drakeford said.\"But context changes because in England it is mandatory to use face masks while on public transport.\"Trains and roads between north and south Wales weave in and out of the border all the time and in a sheer practical sense, we have to think through whether having separate regimes is a possibility when you can leave on a train that starts in Wales, goes into England, comes back into Wales, goes back into England, comes back into Wales.\"Earlier on Friday the British Medical AssociationWales called on the Welsh Government to change its stance on non-medical face coverings, and ensure a supply are available to the public.The trade unions council chair for Wales, Dr David Bailey, said: \"BMA Cymru Wales advocates the wearing of face coverings by the public in areas where they cannot socially distance.\"There still remains a considerable risk of infection, and emerging evidence has shown thatmouths and noses are covered when people are in areas where they cannot socially distance, it may help in controlling the spread of infection of Covid- and therefore save lives.\"BMA Cymru Wales is calling on the Welsh Government to change their position immediately, to lessen the risk of the public spreading the virus.\"Wales main train operator, Transport for Wales, said it would \"work collaboratively\" with partners to ensure passengers were kept safe travelling across borders.A spokesman said: \"The cross-border nature of our network means that we will continue to work collaboratively with industry partners to ensure customers understand how they can travel safely as they travel between Wales and England.\"The safety of our colleagues and customers is our top priority and wed like to reinforce the message to stay local and only use public transportthe journey is essential and theres no other travel

decision to bring in a requirement for coverings had raised issues for people commuting between the two countries.It came as Public Health Wales said a further four people had died after testing positive for coronavirus, taking the total number of deaths to ,, while the number of positive cases grew by  to ,.More NewsLuxury car manufacturer Aston Martin to axe  jobsMans efforts toWorld War One Penarth soldiers plaque found in New ZealandPenarth RNLI leboat crew rescues people caught out by Bristol Channel tideOn Friday, Mr Drakeford was questioned about his governments position on non-medical coverings after a trade union representing doctors in Wales said bringing in rules would help control the spread of Covid- and save lives.Mr Drakeford told the Governments daily press briefing in Cardf: \"The context for face coverings has changed because of an announcement made yesterday in England about mandatory use of face masks on public transport.\"That will not come in until June , and that gives us a short number of days in order to consider the position here in Wales recognising that changed context.\"Mr Drakeford said a \"definitive statement\" on the issue would be made in the first part of next week, and that detailed questions about Englands new rules would be explored with ministers and officials in Westminster.But he said the UK Government had not discussed or given advanced notice of the decision with Wales, and questioned whether England was concerned with \"making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards\".\"I wish that wed had a chance to explore this with the UK Government before they made the announcements,\" he said.\"That would have allowed us to have some answers to the questions that I raised today before the event rather than after the event.\"But while on the bulk of issues we continue to be able to have discussion and co-operation in advance of decision making, in a small number of cases we hear about it only after the decision has been made.\"He added: \"Were going to have to use the time we now have to find out from them the extent to which they have got answers to these questions in advance of making the decision, or whether its a matter of making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards.\"Mr Drakeford said the advice from the chief medical officer for Wales remained that wearing face masks gave people \"some marginal extra protection\" but was not sufficient to make it mandatory.\"The chief medical officer has expressed his anxieties that people might do more risky things because they think a face mask offers them protection, which it doesnt,\" Mr Drakeford said.\"But context changes because in England it is mandatory to use face masks while on public transport.\"Trains and roads between north and south Wales weave in and out of the border all the time and in a sheer practical sense, we have to think through whether having separate regimes is a possibility when you can leave on a train that starts in Wales, goes into England, comes back into Wales, goes back into England, comes back into Wales.\"Earlier on Friday the British Medical AssociationWales called on the Welsh Government to change its stance on non-medical face coverings, and ensure a supply are available to the public.The trade unions council chair for Wales, Dr David Bailey, said: \"BMA Cymru Wales advocates the wearing of face coverings by the public in areas where they cannot socially distance.\"There still remains a considerable risk of infection, and emerging evidence has shown thatmouths and noses are covered when people are in areas where they cannot socially distance, it may help in controlling the spread of infection of Covid- and therefore save lives.\"BMA Cymru Wales is calling on the Welsh Government to change their position immediately, to lessen the risk of the public spreading the virus.\"Wales main train operator, Transport for Wales, said it would \"work collaboratively\" with partners to ensure passengers were kept safe travelling across borders.A spokesman said: \"The cross-border nature of our network means that we will continue to work collaboratively with industry partners to ensure customers understand how they can travel safely as they travel between Wales and England.\"The safety of our colleagues and customers is our top priority and wed like to reinforce the message to stay local and only use public transportthe journey is essential and theres no other travel alternative.\" article_url   content_id

option to alleviate potential flood risk.More NewsVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldMillions become unpaid carers due to coronavirus crisisPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownThe campaign by the Save Dinas Powys Woods and Protect Homes from Flooding group was launched in March  after the Woodland Trust said NRW was proposing to build a dam within its site of Cwm George and Casehill Woods.The group said the proposals would involve cutting down  square metres of trees including  square metres of ancient trees and regular flooding upstream during high rainfall would result in further destruction of ancient trees, hedgerows, wildle, and plants.Dormice and other protected species like bats were at risk, the group said.The woods, much-loved by the community, attracts visitors from other areas and is the Woodland Trustrsquos most visited site in Wales with more than , visitors.Hundreds of people took part in marches in  to oppose the dam.NRW released its draft Outline Business Case in February  and a consultation period with the local community took place.Hundreds of people attended a meeting in February to oppose the dam and they wrote to NRW, with their views, during the coronavirus lockdown.Chairman of Save Dinas Powys Woods  Protect Homes From Flooding, Peter Smith said the group welcomed the announcement that NRW will not develop a dam in the Dinas Powys Woods.ldquoLocal people recognise the flood risk in the village, but are overwhelmingly in favour of a natural flood management programmein the Cadoxton River and Eastbrook catchments, plus improved channel maintenance andrequired local hard defences, rather than an environmentally unfriendly dam, Dr Smith said.ldquoOur proposals will slow the flow of the rivers upstream thus reducing the risk of flash flooding, and by removing obstacles improve flow downstream.ldquoWe now look forward to working with NRW and The Woodland Trust to design an effective NFM scheme.ldquoBoth have expertise in this area, and, having made funds available for NFM projects, we know that the Welsh Government is keen for Wales to become

including the Woodland Trust, our local community councils, and county councillors.ldquoWe extend our particular thanks our local MS, Jane Hutt, for her advocacy and support.Community councillor, Chris Franks said NRW must not now ignore any problems.ldquoClearly over the years there has been reduced spending on maintenance of the stream through Dinas Powys and towards Barry, he said.ldquoThe public has said that the NRW must improve monitoring of flows on the Cadoxton River, implement natural flood management measures and improve flow at Cardf Road bridge where the stream passes under the A to reduce flood risk.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquolsquoFollowing our meeting on May  Sir David Henshaw chairman of NRW wrote to me on May  to say that NRW received almost  responses to our consultation on the Outline Business Case with the vast majority being opposed to the upstream storage option on the Cadoxton Brook.NRW chairman, Sir Henshaw said: ldquoWhen we consider the marginal

has spoken of the plight of rural communities during lockdown in Uganda.Three months ago, Jenipher Wetaka Sambazi, a Fairtrade coffee farmer from the Mt Elgon region in Uganda, was sharing her experiences of the benefit of Fairtrade in Penarthrsquos Tabernacle Baptist Church.More NewsVictory in campaign to save Dinas Powys ancient woodland as dam plan is abandonedVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownNow she and her family, like communities around the world, are under lockdown.In March, campaigners, businesses, supporters, and students from around Wales heard Jenipherrsquos story, face to face.Now she is unable to travel or even meet with her neighbours.This means the coffee picked at the end of the last harvest remains on the mountain and Jenipher and her fellow farmers are prohibited from travelling to gather it for processing under the current lockdown rules.There are currently several hundred known cases of covid- in Uganda, but none in the Mount Elgon region and no fatalities in Uganda as yet.Farmers want to keep it this way, but lockdown is causing other concerns such as limiting access to food and healthcare.This is the time of year when there is the least amount of food available, and the closing of markets and freedom to travel for farmers to source food and water means that times are exceptionally hard.Jenipher as vice-chairwoman of a Fairtrade coffee cooperative, is responsible for many who rely on the cooperative for work.The expert hand-sorters who are seasonal workers and rely on this part of the coffee chain to feed their family at this time, have no coffee to sort.While they may have some spare eggs, vegetables or matoke to trade, the threat of soldiers prohibiting them from doing so is too much for them.Farmer co-operatives, an essential element of Fairtrade, enable and encourage communities to work together.Fairtrade also requires an extra amount of money, the Fairtrade premium, to be paid to producers.Fairtrade farmers like Jenipher are struggling, but they have the benefits of a strong local community as well as the backup of the Fairtrade premium.Fairtrade International have announced a .m euro Fairtrade Producer Relief fund targeting the immediate needs and Resilience Fund to help producers rebuild their businesses after Covid-.Jenipher Wettaka Sambazi said: ldquoLe is hard.ldquoThe markets are shut so there is nowhere to sell or earn money, or to buy food and basic essentials.ldquoLocal health centres have been shut to reduce the chance of spreading the virus, but since all transport is banned, those who need operations, treatment or antenatal care need to walk  km to the nearest hospital.ldquoTwo women and their unborn babies have died on the way.\"Roger Casey, who attends Tabernacle Baptist Church said: ldquoIt was wonderful to meet Jenipher and hear her story.ldquoWe get through a lot of coffee in our office and meeting a real coffee farmer from Uganda makes you think about the real people and real lives behind that Fairtrade logo.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquoMeeting Jenipher during her visit to Wales earlier this year was inspiring.ldquoThe increasing dficulties facing rural farming communities because of the pandemic has shown how important Fairtrade cooperatives continue to be and I am glad that leaders like Jenipher continue to promote the benefits of Fairtrade and to support communities.National co-ordinator of Fair Trade Wales, Aileen Burmeister added: ldquoFair Trade producers are being impacted by covid- restrictions.ldquoGlobal stock markets are falling, meaning that farmers and workers are receiving far less for their produce.\"It is in these times that we can really see how important the Fairtrade minimum price is. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey

million development has been known as South Lake LeisureCentre but DUP party group leader, Councillor Mark Baxter feels this proposal is a fitting way to honour both the jewel in the council’s crown and the centenaryof Northern Ireland.“Our country celebrates a great milestone on the May  next year, our th anniversary as a nation within the United Kingdom,” said Cllr Baxter.“Given the current economic situation, as a party we have discussed a fitting and inexpensive way to mark this signicant anniversary.“At Council’s next monthly meeting we will propose that Council officially name the new leisure centre in Craigavon at the south lake as the ‘Centenary Leisure Centre’.“No official name had ever been discussed until this week so we feel it’s very timely.“This is an iconic building within our borough and indeed will be the most modern centre within Northern Ireland, we all look forward to the grand opening which will be a very welcome investment to the area.”The centre had been due to open in August of this year but this has been delayed due to the coronavirus lockdown.\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most

to get on its bikeThe Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon area cannot be ‘left behind’ in terms of providing cycle lanes, an Alliance councillor has said.By The NewsroomThursday, th June , : pm\"\"Cyclists.Alliance Party representative, Councillor Peter Lavery, called on Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council to take a more proactive role in local active travel and has asked that time be set aside during July’s meeting of Council’s planning committee to discuss the issue.“It has been great to see an increased number of people out cycling during the past few months,” said Cllr Lavery.“We as a public body need to be proactive and collaborate with experts to create ideas and put plans in place to harness this renewed enthusiasm for the long term.“Looking to the future, Alliance believes that government needs to rebalance funding away from roads and into more sustainable transportforms so that an increased number of transport choice are viable for residents.“This would include integrating public transport by creating links between the bus and rail network, car users and cyclists.”Noting recent announcements from the Department for Infrastructurerelating to cycle lanes and greenways, Cllr Lavery asked why this borough should not enjoy the same amenities.“The point also need to be made that when it comes to investment in projects like greenways and cycle lanes there is more to Northern Ireland than just Belfast and Derry,” he said.“Although I welcome investment in those cities, we in the ABC Council area are the second biggest in terms of population so we cannot be left behind.”A spokesperson for Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council said Council remains committed to active travel.“Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough

Everyone appreciates and takes responsibility for their protection, preservation and enhancement’.”The spokesperson continued: “In addition to a number of active travel projects already completed, the Council is continuing to develop and deliver initiativesto allow it to meet these objectives.“Active travel is a unique resource as a potential driver for economic regeneration and user well beingand the council is currently looking at ‘The One Path’ initiative in order to discuss and understand the issues people face when using shared paths and to collaboratively develop ways which help people to better share the space.“The Council is currently investigating the possibility of delivering a Landcare project in the Carn, Seagoe and Charlestown industrial areas of the Borough with the aim of developing the infrastructure around existing walking and cycling networks.“The Council fully understands the importance of implementing active travel within our infrastructure and is open to exploring all options to help benefit the lives of all who live, work and visit our Borough.”Adam Morton , Local Democracy Reporting Service\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyNews you can trust since News\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisCoronavirusSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us    "},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1592493837675.jpg--health_minister_issues_shielding_advice.jpg?159249383700","title":"health minister issues shielding advice ","story":"Health Minister Robin Swann has announced plans to pause the shielding advice that was issued to people ahead of the Covid- peak in Northern Ireland. From  July, subject to the rate of community transmission continuing to be low, people will no longer need to shield and should instead follow the same guidance and precautions as those considered to be generally vulnerable. That involves taking particular care when out and about - and strictly maintaining social distancing.Letters will be issued in the coming days to all those covered by shielding informing them of the planned change.Mr Swann stated: “I have been clear that shielding would not last one minute longer than it needed to. We have now reached the point where,the current trends continue, there will be no need for anyone to shield after  July. “I have listened to many of you and to the challenges you have faced during this period. I am in no doubt as to the dficulties shielding has presented for a great many people.“It is unrealistic to think these dficulties will just vanish because the need to shield has ended. That is why the letters we issue will provide details of the support which will continue to be available up to and after  July.“While my announcement today will be welcome news for many who are shielding, some will view the prospect of an end to shielding with great anxiety. I want to assure them that they should decide what to do at their own pace. Everyone will approach this situation dferently.“As is so often the case at present, this will be about weighing up the options and making informed choices. Going outside can bring some degree of potential risk but this can be mitigated and minimised by strict social distancing. Staying indoors indefinitely is not good for anyone’s mental or physical health.“Finally, I would ask everyone to be considerate as people end their periods of shielding.We should all continue to social distance, but in the coming weeks I want you to be particularly understanding of the fact you might be encountering someone who has had to stay at home for many weeks. Please be aware of this, show respect and kindness to all and keep your distance.”  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:    n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_cbbbdffebcfdbdcdd   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_cfaefdaaedddc   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
