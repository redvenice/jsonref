Beynon shares his bed with these three women every night but on the weekends up to 30 women - who message him on Instagram - are also invited to join the party. Talking about their sex lives, Taesha says: \u0027What we do in here is more extreme than porn\u0027          Flamboyant: Beynon - who calls himself The Candyman and his house The Candy Shop Mansion - poses on the edge of his swimming pool which has a bar, a \u0027grotto\u0027, and tiles he designed himself lined with 24-karat gold. He says: \u0027My idol Gianni Versace was obsessed with the beauty of women. For me it\u0027s women, art, cars and fashion. I\u0027m a visionary and I\u0027m f***ing crazy - there\u0027s so much going on and it\u0027s how I express who I am\u0027          Lavish: His courtyard contains a classical-inspired water feature, two palm trees and a huge mosaic of Bacchus, god of wine. The tycoon invites 1,000 people into his home each year for a huge party. \u0027I\u0027m trying to give people that escape – to come into a world they would never experience and live like it for a day,\u0027 he says          The Angels: Beynon calls his wife and girlfriends \u0027angels\u0027. He has given each of them a matching necklace - the key to the mansion - which stands them apart from other girls who sleep with him on the weekends. His wife Taesha (left) says the four-way relationship works because she likes girls. She met Nisha (centre) at a modelling shoot where they \u0027hit it off\u0027 and she later introduced her to her husband          Fashion: Next to the bedroom is a huge walk-in wardrobe where he keeps more than 100 pairs of shoes, countless shirts and jackets and a range of Gucci and Versace watches, protected by bulletproof glass. Beynon says his time as a model made him fascinated by fashion and he keeps his interest up now. He says he has never met a girl who packs more clothes than him          Outdoors: The mansion boasts a sprawling garden which overlooks the river. \u0027This is where the wild parties happen,\u0027 Beynon says pointing to the swimming pool with a bar, a \u0027grotto\u0027, and tiles he designed himself lined with 24-karat gold. The tycoon prides himself on attention to detail. He says he hand-draws all his designs and artworks which cover the mansion          The bedroom: Beynon shares the master bedroom with three women every night. There are two bathrooms - one for him and one for the women - and a make-up area where the women each have their own mirror and set of drawers containing all the beauty products under the sun. The ceiling above the bed is mirrored and on the wall is a staggering collage of Salvador Dali works which he put together himself. Discussing his sex life, Beynon says: \u0027I make Fifty Shades Of Grey look like a kindergarten. I\u0027m just non-stop, I’m f***ing nuts.\u0027          Extraordinary: The underside of the roof jutting out towards the pool is inspired by the Sistine Chapel itself, Beynon says, adding: \u0027I became fascinated by Renaissance art when I was modelling in Italy. These ideas all come from my head and this is how I see the world\u0027. The rest of his mansion is littered with Renaissance and classical-inspired pieces          The original: Beynon\u0027s painting is inspired by the roof of the Sistine Chapel in Rome, Italy. In 1508, Pope Julius II, who was head of the Church from 1503 to 1513, hired Michelangelo to paint the ceiling of the chapel which is now one of the most famous painted interior spaces in the world          The boardroom: This is where Beynon runs his business empire in the afternoons and evenings. A large table surrounded by throne-like blue and gold chairs sits opposite his desk supporting a flat screen TV, a golden calculator and golden tissue box alongside a portrait of his wife  Luxurious: Beynon designed the wooden floor himself with glass panels so he can see his cars in the garage below. \u0027This won Australian Residential Floor Of The Year,\u0027 he says proudly, pointing to the framed certificate on the wall. The room is where he organises his parties with his assistants. They comb through 7,000 applications from the general public to eventually invite 1,000 revellers to his home every December          The garage: Beynon walks through two automatic glass doors - engraved with the words work harder, play harder - to his garage containing a Ferrari F40, Lamborghini Aventador, Rolls Royce Phantom coupe, a Jeep and a gold-sprayed motorbike for weekend rides. \u0027The Rolls is my Bruce Wayne car, the Lambo my Batman,\u0027 Beynon says, explaining that he has two different personalities          Welcome to the house of fun: The words Candy Shop Mansion sit above Beynon\u0027s gold-plated wooden front doors flanked by two white statues and perfectly trimmed hedges. The tycoon made his first million as a model before riding the Gold Coast property boom of the early 2000s and using the proceeds to buy a a controlling stake in his parents\u0027 Free Choice tobacco company. He\u0027s now worth multi-millions and makes no attempt to hide it          Pass the popcorn: The home cinema, kitted out with multiple light settings, rows of red leather chairs that fully recline and a four-metre bed \u0027for when it\u0027s just me and the girls\u0027. On the back wall are posters of his eight favorite movies: The Godfather, The Dark Knight Rises, The Wolf of Wall Street, Scarface, Rocky IV, The Great Gatsby, Ironman, and Fifty Shades Of Grey          Womaniser: The Candyman poses at his poolside. Talking about the couple\u0027s joint-decision to introduce other girlfriends into their relationship, his wife Taesha says: \u0027I kissed girls when I was younger and have always been curious so we were both keen to try it out and see how it went and it evolved from there\u0027The courtyard of 46-year-old Beynon\u0027s Gold Coast home, which he bought in 2010 for $3.75million, contains a classical-inspired water feature, two palm trees and a huge mosaic of Bacchus, god of wine.The words Candy Shop Mansion sit above his gold-plated wooden front doors flanked by two white statues and perfectly trimmed hedges.                            I make Fifty Shades of Grey look like a kindergarten. I’m f***ing nuts                        Benyon on his extraordinary sex life His garage is accessed through two automatic glass doors - engraved with the words \u0027work harder, play harder\u0027 - and contains a Ferrari F40, Lamborghini Aventador, Rolls Royce Phantom coupe, a Jeep and a gold-sprayed motorbike for weekend rides.All are emblazoned with his custom-drawn logo which reads \u0027CM\u0027 for his nickname Candyman and \u0027TB\u0027 for Travers Beynon when looked at from a different angle.\u0027The Rolls is my Bruce Wayne car, the Lambo my Batman,\u0027 Beynon says, explaining that he has two different personalities. \u0027Its the two sides of a single coin. You have Travers Beynon - the entrepreneur the family man. On the other side you have The Candyman - the entertainer, the playboy.\u0027As if to prove his point about his softer, family man side, he then takes a lift upstairs which he had installed for when he moves his elderly father into the mansion to take care of him.          Excessive: Beynon has more than 100 pairs of shoes in the walk-in wardrobe which he shares with his wife. He likes to pick out which outfits she wears from day to day. Speaking to Daily Mail Australia from his Candy Shop Mansion, he insisted that he is neither a sexist nor a misogynist but merely a good-time guy making fun of people who take life too seriously          Extravagant: The wardrobe also has countless jackets, belts and handbags.

On the other side you have The Candyman – the entertainer, the playboy.\u0027  Flash: Beynon carries \u0027very expensive\u0027 Mont Grappa pen. He says: \u0027I sign so many cheques and contracts it\u0027s a very important tool.\u0027 He also has dozens of watches, mostly by Gucci and Versace which he keeps in a bulletproof case          Peculiar: This is a collage of Salvador Dali works that Beynon assembled himself to have in his bedroom where he spends each night with at least three women. Beynon says: \u0027I\u0027m a feminist. I have girls here that want to be models – I look after them and dress them and style them and make them feel beautiful. But I also employ women who I work with in the boardroom, in the corporate setting, and I would never ask them to come the mansion and wear bikinis\u0027          Attention to detail: Beynon says he enjoys choosing girls\u0027 outfits. He says: \u0027I have girls here that want to be models – I look after them and dress them and style them and make them feel beautiful.\u0027 He rejects any accusations that he is sexist and says he only tries to have as much fun in life as possible          Well-read: In his boardroom, Beynon has dozens of books, mostly on motivation, management and leadership. But he also has the writings of his idol, Italian fashion designer Gianni Versace. Beynon was an AFL player before he broke his back aged 17 and forged a new career in the modelling world    Visionary: \u0027I\u0027m obsessed with beauty\u0027, Beynon says as he strides through his white hallway which features a portrait of Napoleon Bonaparte (left) opposite purple velvet chairs where his five-year-old Jack Russell-Pug cross named Spartacus (right) nestles in a small ball          The pool: Looming over the water is a seven-tonne marble statue of Poseidon. \u0027He\u0027s not just the protector of the ocean but also of my pool,\u0027 says Beynon as he points to walls lined with re-creations of Paolo Veronese\u0027s The Wedding at Cana and Michelangelo\u0027s The Creation Of Adam  Ostentatious: Even the boardroom has dozens of Louis Vuitton handbags and stilettos lying around for the women to try on. Beynon says he spends time with his older children in the boardroom when they come home from school and university. There they discuss their lives and and any problems. Beynon\u0027s son, 19, is at university but also works for Free Choice He strides into his boardroom from where he runs his business empire in the afternoons and evenings. A large table surrounded by throne-like blue and gold chairs sits opposite his desk supporting a flat screen TV, a golden calculator and golden tissue box. Behind the desk is a cabinet full of books on leadership and management. \u0027When I came back from modelling in Miami, New York, London, Paris and Milan, I put my head down and learnt everything I could about business,\u0027 Beynon says. \u0027I read my first book when I was 26 and now I\u0027ve read every one in this cabinet.\u0027He designed the wooden floor himself with glass panels so he can see his cars in the garage below. \u0027This won Australian Residential Floor Of The Year,\u0027 he says proudly, pointing to the framed certificate on the wall.Next he heads downstairs and through a new part of the house called the ballroom, which is being renovated to host lavish dinner parties and masquerade-style dances.He wanders outside to a sprawling garden which overlooks the river. \u0027This is where the wild parties happen,\u0027 he says, pointing to the swimming pool with a bar, a \u0027grotto\u0027, and tiles he designed himself lined with 24-karat gold. Looming over the water is a seven-tonne marble statue of Poseidon. \u0027He\u0027s not just the protector of the ocean but also of my pool,\u0027 says Beynon as he points to walls lined with re-creations of Paolo Veronese\u0027s The Wedding At Cana and Michelangelo\u0027s The Creation Of Adam.          A throne fit for a king: Beynon\u0027s two idols are Gianni Versace and Hugh Hefner, the founder of Playboy and editor-in-chief of the notorious men\u0027s magazine, which began in 1953. Beynon says of his racy Instagram snaps: \u0027The photos are tongue in cheek – we’re having a lot of fun and we’re taking the piss out of this world because it’s so sensitive now.\u0027          The entrance: The enormous gates of the Candy Mansion are flanked by two classical-inspired statues set against gold backgrounds. Beynon says he rolls out of his kingsize bed and goes for a 50km bike ride every morning before work          The open-plan kitchen: This is where the Candyman entertains up to 30 women every Friday night. He says \u0027we get the tequila it\u0027s pretty wild.\u0027 Beynon works from home in his boardroom where he sometimes has dinner with his two older children from his previous marriage          Family man: Beynon says his girlfriends are like aunties to the kids: \u0027We\u0027re a massive family. Every Sunday night we all sit at the family table, it’s a rule of mine – no phones, we get takeaway, they can’t be at their friends\u0027 and we have dinner.\u0027          Playboy: Beynon poses on the edge of his pool. He then points to a pontoon leading out into the river where his speedboat is moored. \u0027That\u0027s my new cigarette boat, she has 200 horsepower and absolutely hammers.\u0027          Suave: Beynon poses next to his Rolls Royce Phantom coupe. He says: \u0027The first rule of being successful, is put yourself around someone who us successful. These younger girls who are in their 20s are around me and they’re watching me hustle and they’re learning from the way I am, the way I manage people.\u0027          Time for a film: The Candyman poses in his home cinema. He says of his favourite films: \u0027They all have meanings for me, for example I relate to the part in Rocky IV where the crowd turn against him he never gives up and they start to cheer for him at the end. That\u0027s what I feel with the hate towards me. Once people get to know me, the won\u0027t feel the same\u0027          Doting son: Beynon has installed a lift in preparation for when his moves his elderly father into the mansion to take care of him. He is pictured here holding a stripper pole in his bedroom. He says on Friday nights he turns his bedroom into a club          The post that caused the most outrage was one of him holding his wife Taesha and another girlfriend by the bikini straps as they crawl at his feet          As the criticism flooded in, he responded in the only way he knows how - by fighting fire with fire and posting this photo\u0027The photos are tongue in cheek – we\u0027re having a lot of fun and we\u0027re taking the piss out of this world because it\u0027s so sensitive now. When I was a kid I was taught stick and stones will break my bones but words will never hurt me.\u0027Now they’re teaching kids names hurt so it make people more sensitive and people are getting so upset by words that more and more are having breakdowns.\u0027 The post that caused the most outrage was one of him holding his wife Taesha and another girlfriend by the bikini straps as they crawled at his feet.As the criticism flooded in, he responded in the only way he knows how - by fighting fire with fire.\u0027When people who saw that photo started lying that I used a dog collar and and lead on the girls, I turned around and I stood on my balcony holding 13 girls on leads. I took a photo as a f*** you.\u0027\u0027If you\u0027re going to provoke me and you\u0027re going to talk shit about me – be prepared for a war.\u0027   Beynon weighed in on the ball tampering scandal that has rocked world cricket with a racy Instagram post featuring his wife (centre) and girlfriendsBeynon said he only aims to \u0027have fun\u0027 with the photos and in life generally. He reeled off the example of his recent mocking of the Australian cricket cheating scandal.  He posted a photo of himself in cricket whites alongside three almost-naked women, who wore small pieces of yellow tape after the Australian team used it to tamper with the ball against South Africa.He said: \u0027I’m having fun – just like in the cricket photo. What they did was cheat, what a disgrace. So in true English or Australian humour we take the p*** out of them. It’s part of our culture. \u0027Sitting around the family table we take the p*** out of each other – no-one\u0027s sensitive. You have to have fun. The girls were laughing non-stop for five minutes when we did the cricket photo.\u0027He added: \u0027Life is tough, business is tough and everyone needs to lighten up a bit.\u0027When someone says I’m sexist it inspires me to come up with something sexist. So if they were smart, they\u0027d leave me alone. Because if they push me, I will bite and I will come back bigger and stronger.\u0027                         Beynon walks through the kitchen to the home cinema, kitted out with multiple light settings, rows of red leather chairs that fully recline and a four-metre bed \u0027for when it\u0027s just me and the girls\u0027. On the back wall are posters of his eight favorite movies: The Godfather, The Dark Knight Rises, The Wolf Of Wall Street, Scarface, Rocky IV, The Great Gatsby, Ironman, and Fifty Shades Of Grey.He says: \u0027They all have meanings for me. For example, I relate to the part in Rocky IV where the crowd turn against him but he never gives up and they start to cheer for him at the end. \u0027That\u0027s what I feel with the hate towards me. Once people get to know me, they won\u0027t feel the same – they say I\u0027m a sexist and a misogynist but I\u0027m not, I\u0027m having fun and I don\u0027t care what they say: I\u0027m authentic and I won\u0027t change the way I am.He continues: \u0027The Wolf Of Wall Street represents my wild side - no-one parties like I do. And I love The Great Gatsby because there\u0027s nothing that makes me as happy as when I\u0027m entertaining guests. My parties are out of control – there\u0027s nothing like them on this planet.\u0027Beynon leaves the cinema room and walks back past his Napoleon portrait and upstairs to the master bedroom, where he shares king-size beds with at least three women every night.          Responding to his critics who call him sexist, Beynon says: \u0027The girls in my life know I’m not a sexist. I idolise, I adore women, I respect them at a corporate level and I respect them on a personal level – but I take the piss out of anyone who wants to have a go at them or me\u0027  Hedonist: \u0027Life is tough, business is tough, it’s like a pressure cooker,\u0027 Beynon says. \u0027Everyone needs to lighten up a bit sometimes \u0027cause that pressure is going to explode. You have to have a valve that releases all that so how do you do that? By laughing\u0027          Everywhere gold: The Candy Shop Mansion is full to the brim with ostentatious furniture including these red sofas next to a chess board with silver and gold pieces. This room also boasts a chandelier and and two classical-inspired statues          Motorhead: The Candyman loves racing cars. Last year he was seen taking part in Shannon\u0027s National GT Australia Trophy series at Sandown Park, Victoria.

And when the haters have a go at me, my next move is to put these on\u0027, he says grabbing a pair of Versace silver gladiator-style knee-high sandals and placing them triumphantly on the table  Left: Beynon\u0027s portrait of Napoleon sits next to posters of his favourite film characters. Right: A picture montage of his late mother Sam leans against a fireplace. \u0027She passed away in 2015,\u0027 Beynon says. \u0027I miss her terribly, she was an incredibly strong woman.\u0027 There are also photos of his teenage son and daughter from a previous marriage to Venezuelan Miss World winner Ninibeth Leal which ended with a messy orce and judge granting him sole custodyThere are two bathrooms - one for him and one for the women - and a make-up area where the women each have their own mirror and set of drawers containing all the beauty products under the sun.The ceiling above the bed is mirrored and on the wall is a staggering Salvador Dali collage which he put together himself. Leaning against the wall is a sword: \u0027I never know when I may have to defend my girls,\u0027 Beynon explains.\u0027The craziest nights of my life have been in this bedroom,\u0027 says Beynon. \u0027On Fridays we get a stripper pole, smoke machine and bring the DJ up to turn it into a nightclub.\u0027                             It\u0027s two sides of a single coin. You have Travers Beynon - the entrepreneur, the family man. On the other side you have The Candyman – the entertainer, the playboy\u0027                         Beynon on his two personalities Talking about sharing his bed with so many women, he adds: \u0027I make Fifty Shades Of Grey look like a kindergarten. I fell asleep in that movie, I took the girls and we were thinking is it gonna get serious or what? I\u0027m just non-stop, I\u0027m f***ing nuts.\u0027Next to the bedroom is a huge walk-in wardrobe where he keeps more than 100 pairs of shoes, countless shirts and jackets and a range of Gucci and Versace watches, protected by bulletproof glass.Pulling out a pair of golden Louis Vuittons with red souls, he jokes: \u0027You don\u0027t wear these if you\u0027re sensitive to hate and abuse.\u0027And when the haters have a go at me, my next move is to put these on\u0027, he says, grabbing a pair of Versace silver gladiator-style sandals and placing them triumphantly on the table. There are also handbags, dresses and dozens of pairs of high heels for his wife. \u0027I buy all the girls their clothes and pick out all their outfits,\u0027 Beynon explains. \u0027When we go on holiday I plan their outfits down to the detail of their eye makeup.\u0027Beynon then walks downstairs and outside into his courtyard. Turning to admire his home, he says: \u0027This mansion represents what I\u0027m all about. It\u0027s fun, it\u0027s flamboyant, it\u0027s out there and it\u0027s over the top.\u0027Travers Beynon is certainly all of those things.           Plush: In the wardrobe there are also handbags, dresses and dozens of pairs of high heels for his wife. \u0027I buy all the girls their clothes and pick out all their outfits,\u0027 Beynon explains. \u0027When we go on holiday I plan their outfits down to the detail of their eye makeup.\u0027          Poser: The Candyman is not camera shy after a decade-long career in modelling which took him around the world to Miami, New York, London, Paris and Milan. He modelled for several big named brands including Calvin Klein          Unusual: Beynon strolls inside to the main entertainment room adjacent to the pool. There is a mosaic of Versace\u0027s face on the floor - the first thing he had done to the house - and a picture montage of his late mother Sam leans against a fireplace  \u0027What we do in here is more extreme than porn\u0027: The Candyman\u0027s wife of eight years reveals how her four-way relationship with him and two girlfriends works inside and outside the bedroom - and says she NEVER feels degraded or objectified   The Candyman has been married to Taesha, 27, for eight years after they met at one of his lavish parties.Her disapproving parents disowned her but she now has two children of her own with the husband she shares with up to 30 other women.Here, in her own words, she tells Daily Mail Australia her story and hits back at her fiercest critics.I used to do promotional modelling and Trav hired me at one of his parties in 2009. When I first met him I felt instantly there was a spark there but he was avoiding me and ignoring me so I had to work for his affection. A couple of months later I was running and he was cycling and we met on the same bike track.There were a few smiles and then he stopped to talk one time. I was with my mum and I hardly said anything because I was so nervous and just let my mum do the talking.           The wives and girlfriends: Beynon on his king-sized bed with wife Taesha (centre), girlfriend Krystal (left) and girlfriend Nisha (right). Taesha says: \u0027When we starting dating I didn\u0027t know he was going to have other girlfriends as well as me but it was something that we discussed together - it wasn\u0027t him saying this is what\u0027s going to happen \u0027He was at one of the nightclubs to promote his mate\u0027s party and we saw each other there. I was up on a balcony and he told me that I had a really fat a*se.I was like \u0027what the hell - this guy that I like is telling me that I\u0027m fat\u0027. I went to speak to him and he said \u0027you have a really fat a*se in that dress\u0027 and I thought \u0027oh my god\u0027.                            We have a very experimental sex life - it\u0027s extreme                         Taesha Beynon on sharing her marital bed with up to 30 women We were flirting and I was talking close to his ear and he was telling me that I was spitting in his ear and making me really nervous and making it worse - it was so embarrassing.But then we started talking about modelling and he said \u0027I can help you with your portfolio\u0027 and we exchanged numbers.Not long after that I went his place and it happened from there - but it took about four to six months of working to try to get him.When we started dating I didn\u0027t know he was going to have other girlfriends as well as me but it was something that we discussed together - it wasn\u0027t him saying \u0027this is what\u0027s going to happen\u0027.We\u0027d been together for a couple of years when we started to bring in other girls.          Friday night: The Candyman is pictured in his home with his wife Taesha (second right in white) and his girlfriend Nisha (left)  The lift or the stairs? Beynon shared these racy Instagram snaps of him and his wives and girlfriends heading to bed. Taesha says: \u0027What girl doesn\u0027t like to be handcuffed and thrown on the bed? It\u0027s so plain these days people need to spice it up.\u0027 I kissed girls when I was younger and have always been curious so we were both keen to try it out and see how it went and it evolved from there.We have a very experimental sex life - it\u0027s extreme. I haven\u0027t watched porn or anything like that but even if you were to watch porn I don\u0027t think it\u0027s anything compared to what we get up to.Trav makes us feel comfortable to come out of our shells, to experiment with each other and with him. He is crazy but he definitely has a softer side which is what keeps us close. Regarding the other girls, I\u0027ve had my time with jealousy and you get past it. Trav and I have a very strong marriage and a very strong relationship - we make enough time to spend one on one together. I feel like I\u0027m always the centre of his life.To anyone who says Travers degrades women or is disrespectful to women, I say that they don\u0027t know what he\u0027s actually like. I never feel degraded - what we do is fun. Which girl doesn\u0027t like to be handcuffed and thrown on the bed? Sex is so plain these days, people need to spice it up.           Taesha says: \u0027On Fridays and Saturdays it\u0027s crazy - we have heaps of girls over and I love meeting new girls. Some can be too attention-seeking and others are really fun and cool and we invite them back.\u0027I am doing what I choose with my body and people shouldn\u0027t judge me for that. I used to do bikini waitressing and I hated going to work. I love being here.Day to day I still do normal things: looking after the children, cleaning the house, cooking, laundry  and we try to work out as much as we can.On Fridays and Saturdays it\u0027s crazy - we have heaps of girls over and I love meeting new girls. Some can be too attention-seeking and others are really fun and cool and we invite those ones back. My parents don\u0027t like Travers and I have nothing to do with them now. They loved him at the start but then my dad asked him for $2.8million for one of his building projects and Trav refused. They have hated him since then and said the worst things about him like \u0027I wish he were dead\u0027. I was a month out of giving birth to my first child and that was it, we stopped talking to the whole family. It was tough but it was the right decision.I didn\u0027t want anything to do with them, I didn\u0027t want my children to have anything to do with them and I\u0027m so glad I don\u0027t talk to them or see them anymore. I picked Travers instead of them and I haven\u0027t spoken to them since. It\u0027s done now.Now we have good times all the time, even just waking up next to him and cuddling him, I love times like that.   I\u0027m hoping to be with Trav for the rest of my life and have more children with him. Police ram driver off road after high-speed chase in LeedsBritish ISIS soldiers blasts UK in first audio interviewMother speaks about her son\u0027s devastating heroin addictionSquirrel who lost his front paws gets a second chanceBlair says \u0027power\u0027 is the real case for Britain to stay in the EUSickening moment footy star snaps leg after slamming into goalpostShocking footage shows boy falling from burning mall in Russia11-year-old boy lies in hospital after escaping burning mallPeople brave cold to go out the night before Good FridayBritish woman returns after getting lost in Brazilian rainforestSecurity remove furniture from US consulate in St. Petersburg    Party time: Beynon and Taesha at his Freaks Unleashed bash in December.

Biel and her business partners now accuse their former  employees of trying to extort money from them          Five of the nine employees at Jessica Biel\u0027s kid-friendly LA restaurant Au Fudge who are suing the star and her business partners for $1.5 millionThe former employees claim that the majority of their income came from working at special events that cost companies including Netflix and Amazon up to $90,000 for an occasion - but they never received gratuities.\u0027There would be multiple events per week and you would be working tirelessly and we would walk away with pennies,\u0027 Defendant Connor Gleason said. \u0027We felt really cheated out of our hard-earned money.\u0027Another former staffer, Kirstyn Toney, said that \u0027these companies, they thought they were tipping the staff, and they were really just tipping Jessica Biel\u0027.But lawyers for Biel call the lawsuit nothing more than \u0027an effort to extort money from the Defendants via unsupported and farfetched claims that lack any credibility\u0027.The suit claimed that the bulk of the restaurant\u0027s money came from \u0027buyouts\u0027, or private events in which they routinely charged clients 22 per cent gratuity - but the employees claim they never saw their tips.They sued Biel and her business partners claiming they lost out on $430,100 in gratuities from the private events and an additional $31,549 in missed rest breaks which they said they were denied.The suit also sought $1 million in punitive damage.          The nine restaurant employees are represented by Stormy Daniels\u0027 former lawyer, Keith Davidson, who appeared to be unresponsive to Biel\u0027s lawyers just as the porn star started to speak out about her alleged one-night stand with President Donald Trump  In mid-January, Daniels first spoke out about her alleged one-night stand with Trump and the NDA she had to sign ahead of the 2016 presidential election. She\u0027s pictured above speaking on 60 Minutes on SundayIn legal documents filed on February 27, Biel\u0027s legal team claims the lawsuit attempts to hold her personally liable for the funds with no factual support.The actress calls the claims \u0027frivolous\u0027 and demands the judge dismiss the case.Legal filings claim that the gratuities that the employees claim they\u0027re owed were not actually gratuities, but mandatory service charges that are not owed to the employees.Biel and her business partners say they have never had conversations with the employees over the accusations they\u0027ve made.Further, legal documents claim that there is no proof that the employees worked the events mentioned in their lawsuit, provided services that would entitle them to tips or even had an agreement with Au Fudge that they were entitled to tips.The filing claims that if the court allows the employees to continue to pursue their case, it could enable them to recover gratuities that are owed to others who worked for the restaurant.In regard to the claim that employees weren\u0027t provided meal breaks, Biel and her business partners say there is no allegation that any of them felt obligated to work through their break.Biel and her business partners have asked that the lawsuit be dismissed.          In the weeks before the latest documents were filed, a lawyer representing Biel tried to meet with Keith Davidson, the lawyer who is representing the former employees and the former lawyer of Stormy Daniels           Davidson was apparently unresponsive through email when a lawyer representing Biel tried to have a phone call at the end of January and in early February          It took Knoles more than two weeks to pin down Davidson and discuss the complaint. Shortly thereafter, the complaint was filedIn the weeks before the latest documents were filed, a lawyer representing Biel tried to meet with Keith Davidson, the lawyer who is representing the former employees and the former lawyer of Stormy Daniels.Just days before the 2016 election, Davidson negotiated a nondisclosure agreement for Daniels with then-presidential candidate Donald Trump\u0027s lawyer Michael Cohen in return for $130,000.Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, is now suing Trump to have her NDA torn up because the now-president never signed it. Trump\u0027s lawyer, Michael Cohen, claims he paid Daniels himself.In the Au Fudge case, Davidson was apparently unresponsive through email when a lawyer representing Biel tried to have a phone call at the end of January and in early February.The lawyer, Emily Knoles, attempted to contact Davidson on several occasions via email to discuss the lawsuit and their demurrer, or objection to the lawsuit.It took Knoles more than two weeks to pin down Davidson and discuss the complaint. Shortly thereafter, the demurrer was filed. The correspondence came around the time Daniels started speaking out about the alleged affair and NDA.Now Stormy¿s lawyer will try to depose President Trump and...¿Sound familiar?¿: Megyn Kelly says she was threatened by...Trump attends super PAC dinner at home of real estate mogul...White House claims Trump is TOO BUSY to tweet about Stormy...Share this article    The White House on Monday said Trump \u0027has strongly, clearly and has consistently denied\u0027 allegations of sexual liaison with DanielsDaniels first claimed she had an affair with Trump on January 12. Knoles\u0027 first email to Davidson was on January 17. Davidson first responded on January 26, but the two didn\u0027t speak about the case until February 5 - right in the midst of the Daniels scandal.The White House on Monday said Trump \u0027has strongly, clearly and has consistently denied\u0027 allegations of sexual liaison.In an interview that aired Sunday on CBS\u0027s \u002760 Minutes\u0027 show, Daniels said she had been threatened by a man in a Las Vegas parking lot in 2011 who warned her to \u0027leave Trump alone.\u0027Davidson no longer represents Daniels, who is now represented by Michael Avenatti, who took the porn star on as a client earlier this year.Davidson\u0027s attorney provided the following statement to DailyMail.com: \u0027These nine hard-working members of the Au Fudge waitstaff had their hard-earned tips stolen from the owners of the establishment. \u0027This is nothing more than a case where workers were not paid for their work. To portray the situation as though the employees are seeking anything more than what they are owed is reckless, unfair and defamatory.\u0027I stand by these employees and their valid claim and look forward to them receiving justice in this case.\u0027"},{"url":"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5555691/Janice-Dickinson-slams-Ryan-Seacrests-TV-production-company-false-controversy.html","title":"Janice Dickinson slams Ryan Seacrest\u0027s TV production company over \u0027false controversy\u0027","story":"Janice Dickinson has accused Ryan Seacrest\u0027s TV production company of dragging her into a \u0027false controversy\u0027 on the Shahs of Sunset reality TV show.

And I do know who the organiser of that conspiracy is and I do know who it\u0027s being led by - and I do know why.\u0027It all has to do with the paedophilia claims that I\u0027ve made.\u0027So I can\u0027t say that this incident was related, but what I can say is that it\u0027s very odd that a group of Mexican guys would pull over a car, go as far as opening a door and stabbing the person inside.\u0027Because generally, if they\u0027re going to do that kind of an aggressive move, they\u0027re going to ask for a wallet at that point, they\u0027re going to ask for your car keys, they\u0027re going to ask for some kind of demand.\u0027 The actor, 46, wrote on Twitter that he was sitting in his car on Tuesday night and while his security detail was distracted by a group of men, an inidual opened his door and stabbed him with \u0027something.\u0027Feldman also claimed on Twitter that this attack was the work of the \u0027wolfpack,\u0027 a group of powerful Hollywood players that he believes have been trying to kill him in order to get revenge after he named a number of alleged pedophiles in the movie industry.  The Los Angeles Police Department said on Wednesday that officers were called to a residence in Reseda just before midnight on Tuesday in response to an assault with a deadly weapon call.          Getting the word out: Feldman posted on Twitter shortly after the attack on Tuesday    Veteran: Feldman may be best known for his work in classic 1985 adventure film The GooniesA good deal of that money would go towards security said Feldman, a cost he justified by claiming he had almost been killed just a few days prior.\u0027The most important thing is that I have security. Somebody tried to kill me the other day. I\u0027ve been arrested. This is no joke. I\u0027m fearing for my life,\u0027 said Feldman.When Megyn pressed the actor on his near-death experience, he stated: \u0027I had two trucks come speeding at me at the same time.\u0027He quickly added: \u0027I\u0027m not saying they were trying to kill Corey Feldman. But they were trying to kill a group of people walking across the street.\u0027That $10 million project was later scrapped in favor of a $100,000 one for his \u0027truth campaign,\u0027 which has raised $29,000 as of Wednesday morning.Since the recent Harvey Weinstein sex scandals sparked a surge of Hollywood heavyweights getting toppled from their positions of power, Corey\u0027s previous accounts of abuse at the hands of showbiz executives have gained new traction. Feldman first came forward with his account in his 2013 memoir, Coreyography, claiming that both he and Corey Haim were repeatedly abused as up-and-coming actors.Back in December, the actor was vindicated again as police in California said they had uncovered a tape in which Corey listed the names of men who had abused him in the past. The former child actor had claimed in October that he had given the names of sexual predators in Hollywood to the Santa Barbara County Sheriff\u0027s Office in 1993 during their investigation into Michael Jackson\u0027s molestation charges.Then in November, the actor revealed the identities of two alleged child molesters he claims took advantage of him and other adolescent screen stars years ago.He claimed on Dr. Oz that his former assistant and actor Jon Grissom was the first to take advantage of him in the 1980s.Feldman also named former child talent manager and convicted sex offender Marty Weiss in a separate interview on Today.Weiss was arrested in 2011 after one of his clients told police he had been sexually abused by the man starting when he was just 11-years-old, claiming the incidents happened 30 to 40 times over a roughly three years period.He eventually pleaded no contest to two counts of child molestation in 2012 and was sentenced to a year in jail and five years probation however he was immediately released after entering his plea for time served.Corey Feldman Named in Sexual Battery Police Report | TMZ.comCorey Feldman\u0027s Hospital Tests Came Back Negative for Drugs, Diseases | TMZ.com"},{"url":"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5561993/Iron-Man-Jimmy-Robert-Downey-Jr-takes-viral-campaign-rare-disease.html","title":"Iron Man becomes \u0027See You, Jimmy\u0027: Robert Downey Jr takes part in viral campaign for rare disease","story":"Hollywood star Robert Downey Jr flew to Scotland to help an schoolboy with a rare condition that causes children to gain weight and suffer breathing difficultiesKnown medically as \u0027Rapid-onset Obesity with Hypothalamic dysfunction, Hypoventilation and Autonomic Dysregulation\u0027, the condition is potentially fatal.So hoping to help the sweet schoolboy and give him a day to remember, Downey Jr posted a video of his new Muddy Puddle craze to raise money for ROHHAD research.Father got his girlfriend, 20, to rape his 11-year-old...Why do you look so concerned?

She says she found out about Topshop heiress Chloe Green\u0027s reported pregnancy when her son suddenly told her after stuffing a basketball up his topMelissa Meeks was playing basketball with her eight-year-old son, Jeremy Junior, in the garden two months ago when he innocently let slip some potentially devastating news.‘He said it so nonchalantly,’ she says. ‘We were messing around with a basketball when he stuck it under his shirt and said: “Look, I’m pregnant.” \u0027I asked him: “Why would you do that? Do you know somebody who’s pregnant?” He said: “Yes, Chloe.\u0027The Chloe she’s referring to is Chloe Green, the 27-year-old daughter of Topshop tycoon, Sir Philip Green.The news was devastating to Melissa because the father of the baby, presumably, is Melissa’s husband Jeremy Meeks, the ‘hot felon’ former gang member and criminal (now model) who’s been a constant presence at Chloe’s side since last summer.The blow hit Melissa hard: ‘It was as if my heart stopped for a little bit,’ she says. ‘I was in shock, but at the same time I knew it was coming. To me, starting a family with a billionaire’s daughter is the golden ticket, right?’Naturally, she wanted to know more, but didn’t want to pressure her son. America\u0027s next hot felon? Website collects mugshots of the...Share this articleBut Melissa is convinced the pregnancy is real and the hurt is writ large across her face. ‘Deep down I knew,’ she says. ‘I had a gut feeling.’While Jeremy — who’s also stepfather to Melissa’s two elder children, Eliana, 17, and Robert, 12 — and Chloe haven’t confirmed anything, reports that they are expecting a child together were all over the media this week.Theirs is an unlikely union. Chloe Green is the only, indulged, jet-setting daughter of a billionaire, while Jeremy Meeks, 34, is a heavily tattooed villain, with a list of criminal convictions as long as... well, the ever-growing list of luxury holidays he is enjoying with Miss Green since they were photographed cavorting on a £118,000 super-yacht in the Mediterranean off the coast of Turkey last June.           Jeremy Meeks, known as the \u0027hot felon\u0027, began a relationship with Chloe Green, the 27-year-old daughter of Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green, last summerUntil those photos appeared, Melissa, a 37-year-old nurse, had assumed her eight-year marriage to Meeks, whose modelling career began after his police mugshot went viral on social media, was healthy and strong.She’d thought he’d gone to Turkey to promote a holiday resort. The day before he flew out, he’d sworn blind he loved her.‘I noticed he had started following this Chloe Green on his Instagram account and asked him who she was. He told me she was his manager’s business partner.\u0027I asked if he was seeing her, and straight away he said no. Three or four days later, the pictures on the boat came out.‘When he came back around July 4, he came to the house to take the boys. I was hardly functioning. I couldn’t sleep. I couldn’t eat. I was a mess. He said he was sorry for the way it came out and that he didn’t mean to hurt me.          Green and Meeks at a Topman store in Los Angeles last year‘Perhaps when Chloe’s a mother she’ll understand how hurt I felt. In fairness, Jeremy Junior says she’s nice to him, which, as a mum, I’m glad about. \u0027I want him to be happy. He spent Christmas and New Year’s Eve with them on the yacht. They flew to Florida on a private jet. Her parents were there, too. \u0027It’s a very different world to ours. They brought him designer clothes — Dolce \u0026amp Gabbana — a PlayStation and lots of other things, too.‘I remember when he came home I told him to clean up his room, saying: “I’m not your maid.” To which he replied: “Well, I have one on the boat.” These people have so much money they don’t live in reality. Philip Green is a man of great power and wealth. In that world, you have the money to get what you want no matter what.’Melissa truly believed she would grow old with Meeks after they met at a friend’s party in Stockton, California, in 2008. They married shortly after Christmas and, a year later, Jeremy Junior was born.‘He had little blue eyes and they stayed blue.’ Her face softens as she remembers that day. ‘He was pretty small — 6lb 11oz — and I remember Jeremy cupping him in his hand and staring at him. He said it was one of the greatest moments of his life.’Jeremy had had a pretty rough childhood and he wanted better for his son. Indeed, Meeks was little more than a baby himself when his own father was sentenced to life in prison for murder. His mother had drug problems, so he was raised largely by his sister and gravitated towards street gangs.‘He was incarcerated for a lot of his adult life before he met me,’ says Melissa. ‘I think his involvement with street gangs had something to do with wanting to feel he was part of some sort of family.’Meeks was open about his past as a member of the notorious North Side Crips, one of California’s most brutal street gangs. In 2002, he got two years for theft and was in and out of prison for years for a series of crimes, including resisting arrest.          Happier times: Melissa Meeks with her \u0027hot felon\u0027 husband before he began dating Chloe GreenHe has a Crips tattoo on his right forearm and a teardrop inked under his left eye, often said to symbolise a gang killing.Having once been arrested for beating a 16-year-old boy ‘into a pulp’, he was described by police as ‘one of the most violent criminals in the Stockton area’ before he was jailed for two years in 2014 for possession of a firearm and one count of ‘street terrorism’. His police mugshot then went viral.‘That’s what changed everything,’ says Melissa, who visited him in prison every weekend and supported the family in his absence. When Meeks was released two years ago, he was snapped up by an agent and soon secured a modelling contract.‘He didn’t get his first big modelling gig until the New York Fashion Show in February 2017,’ she says. ‘Although he came out of prison in April 2016, he was under house arrest until July.‘We didn’t have much money, but on our wedding anniversary he bought me this necklace that had a little diamond stud. We went wine-tasting. I was very happy that day. I had no idea that was the last anniversary I was ever going to have with him.’Her eyes fill with tears. ‘I try not to think about this stuff.’The relationship began to change after the fashion show.‘I wanted to be involved, I wanted to travel with him. But he said he couldn’t afford for me to go, as he was just starting out.‘The big change came after the Cannes Film Festival. That’s when he met her. Week after week, I saw him change. I think the lifestyle and the industry got hold of him.          The 2014 mugshot from Stockton Police Department which sent the internet into a frenzy and set Jeremy Meeks on the road to stardom‘He started to try to pull himself away from his old life and into his new life. He just wanted to do his own thing. I felt I didn’t fit into this new life. I’m sure if I was a billionaire I’d have fitted right in,’ she adds with a hollow laugh. ‘We’d have arguments and he’d say he wanted a orce, then the next moment he’d be on the phone saying how much he loved me, and that he didn’t want to break up our family. \u0027Emotionally it was very difficult, but he never said “this is over — I’m moving out” until those boat pictures happened.’‘It was a slap in the face. I was devastated. It was shocking, unbelievable. The kids didn’t know what to do or say. I couldn’t go into work I was so upset. I lost so much weight. I was in a terrible state.‘Now I’ve put the bits of the puzzle together I’ve realised that between Cannes in May and the trip to Turkey at the end of June he was living with us but spending a lot of time in LA.‘That’s when I really noticed the difference. I felt in my gut there was something going on, but he looked me in the face and swore there wasn’t.‘Now he maintains nothing happened between him and Chloe until Turkey, but I don’t believe it. \u0027Isn’t it a bit of a coincidence the paparazzi were in the middle of the ocean when they were kissing? Somebody had to set that up.’"},{"url":"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5563899/MARGO-DURRELL-day-Gerald-turned-boarding-house-python-sack-monkeys.html","title":"MARGO DURRELL: The day Gerald turned up at my boarding house with a python and sack of monkeys","story":"    Unconventional: The Durrells in the ITV drama based on Gerald\u0027s childhood memoir (pictured)I glanced at my mother, Louisa, who was staying with me pending the sale of our family home. A look of dismay had crossed her face and she was no doubt remembering other times when the presence of a sack or box had meant eventual trouble.‘If he puts one foot over my threshold,’ I said in a voice of doom, ‘I’m done for.’‘Too late, dear,’ said Mother in a queer voice and we went to face the inevitable.          Gerald Durrell as a youthful zoologist returning from one of his animal-collecting expeditions‘Just a few monkeys,’ Gerald called out airily, seeing Mother and me for the first time and throwing a saucy eye heavenwards towards an upstairs window, where two half-clad nurses — my tenants Blanche and Judy — had been disturbed from their slumbers and were now watching him.‘I hope there is nothing dangerous in that sack, dear?’ Mother inquired, kissing her youngest tenderly. ‘It’s a 6ft python, but it’s harmless,’ Gerald replied carelessly.‘My God! We can’t have it in this house, Gerald!’ Mother said, in the vain attempt at a firm voice which, as all her offspring knew, meant that he could. And with that I lost all hope of life as a respectable landlady in a sedate seaside town.It was the summer of 1947, almost 20 years since the death of my father Samuel, an engineer who, like my mother, was of English descent but born and brought up in India in the days of the Raj.My family and other philandering feuding drunkards: As...After yet another TV drama he can\u0027t hear because of mumbling...Share this articleAll FOUR of us children were also born there and, when Father died in 1928, Mother brought us to Bournemouth where, she had been told, it was sunnier than anywhere else in England.We always seemed to be chasing the sun. In 1935, the need to eke out mother’s dwindling pension saw us move to the magical and inexpensive Greek island of Corfu, described so appealingly in Gerald’s book My Family And Other Animals.Our life of idle bliss there had come to an end with the outbreak of the war. In the years since then I had met, married and been orced from the boys’ father Jack Breeze, an RAF pilot.Now aged 27, I was back in Bournemouth with the rest of the family who referred to my plans to open a guest house, using an inheritance from Father, as ‘Margo’s new madness’.Mother’s main worries hitherto had been an impending overdraft and a terror of the white slave trade. She still warned me, her only daughter, against hypodermic syringes administered swiftly in cinemas by sinister strangers, and her fears about my new career were not allayed by my older brothers Lawrence and Leslie who horrified her with graphic accounts of lewd male lodgers and land-ladies throttled in their beds.          Margo Durrell pictured at her Bournemouth home in 1995Undaunted, I embarked on a search for the right property and finally found the one I wanted in a quiet, wide road of large Edwardian houses — our own road, in fact.Almost directly opposite our family house at 52 — which was on the market, my mother having put it up for sale after Gerald left — number 51 was big, comfortable and square and stood solid on three floors.As the boys and I moved in and renovations went ahead, the family called almost daily, unable to resist giving their advice.While Mother stood in the kitchen, genteelly brewing cups of tea for the various workmen in residence and making sure that her much-loved grandsons were not starving to death in my hands, Lawrence came up with numerous uneconomical ideas.These included a lavatory with a concealed radiogram and walls lined with bookshelves, Lawrence explaining that this was the only place in any family residence where one could be completely private.The suggestions made by Leslie — a squat, bawdy figure sunk deep in the intricacies of guns, beer and women — were equally impractical, including a swimming pool, a specially-designed bar and a rifle range.As for Gerald, who was five years younger than me, he was temporarily away, looking for the animals with which he would populate his dream zoo.He had written to say how pleased he was that I was about to replenish the family’s fortunes, but I had read this brief communication with great mistrust. A lively candidate for his zoo already ruled the house my mother was selling. It was a marmoset, a small furry apparition with the face of an old sage.          Gerald Durrell\u0027s book My Family And Other Animals - based on his expedition memoirs -  became an immediate hit in 1956 became an immediate hit, has never been out of print and has sold more than a million copiesPerching in strategic spots to relieve the pangs of nature, deeply offended if disturbed, Pavlo would sulk for hours in some inaccessible place while Simon, an over-fed Tibetan sheepdog, tussled against him for first place in the family’s affections.With Gerald away, Mother had brought both Pavlo and Simon to stay with me and, just to add to the menagerie, Leslie — who was living nearby, with a jolly off-licence manageress named Doris — had turned up one day with a housewarming present, a large black-and-white mongrel called Johnny.Leslie had rescued him on learning he was due to be put down at the local vet’s and it soon became apparent why he was a near victim of extinction: he possessed a nervous twitch when excited which sent him cocking his leg in all directions.All this had coincided with the arrival of my first lodgers, among them a trombonist named Andy. A shy Northerner with soft eyes and a humorous mouth, he played his instrument with firm, square hands that sent an uneasy longing through me and, it seemed, all my female tenants.Alongside the glamorous Blanche and Judy, they included a far less glamorous nurse named Jane, a skinny bespectacled spinster much taken to hanging around the hall in décolleté nighties in the hope that the men of the house might notice her.Competition for Andy’s attention was intense and, had I foreseen the strange circumstances in which the monkeys would bring us closer together, I might have been more welcoming of Gerald’s arrival. As it was, I couldn’t hide a scowl as, preoccupied with negotiating the monkey cage into the garage, he handed me the sack containing the snake.‘You’ll have to keep it hidden from your lodgers,’ Mother whispered and I wondered out loud why Gerald couldn’t go and stay in our house across the road.  The book and series convey a dream world where Gerald (pictured as a child) roams free, swimming and sailing with no supervision, and befriending exotic animals, which he would bring home and install in the bath‘Oh no, dear,’ Mother replied. ‘The poor boy would be lonely. Besides, Leslie has practically sold the house to some solicitor or other, and we couldn’t have Gerald making a mess in there if that’s the case, could we?’ Gerald, though he appeared absorbed in the safe housing of his animals, had in no way missed either the faces of the nurses at the window or the arrival home of two other attractive women — Paula, who worked on the make-up counter in a local department store, and Olwen, an assistant in a shoe shop and part-time artist’s model.They were soon followed by Mr Budden, a bricklayer, and Barry, who hired out pedal-boats on the local beach. I greeted each of them in turn, camouflaging the rough sack, my hand uncomfortable against what felt like a thick coil of rope, conscious that it was actually a python.The coast finally clear, I laid the sack to rest behind the garage door, and there, I thought, it was going to stay if I had anything to do with it. Back in the house I heard Mother on the telephone, spreading the good news of Gerald’s arrival to Doris and Leslie, who were soon speeding up to join us, laden with drink and good humour.The drawing room, fully alive for the first time, vibrated with laughter, reminiscences and, because no Durrell family reunion, however small, was complete without one, a heated discussion.‘Now Gerald, I do hope you are not going to cause Margo a lot of trouble with your animals,’ Mother said, taking Dutch courage from a double gin. ‘We’ve had one or two nasty little experiences you know and we don’t really feel up to coping with any more.’With that she began describing the time she was in the midst of hosting a ladies’ tea party when Gerald, with the deftness of a conjurer, produced from out of a small bag a 3ft snake, omitting to explain that it wasn’t venomous.Screams had brought the tea party to a close and the snake, taking fright, had slithered in a fluid movement to the door and made a cunning escape to the next-door neighbour’s shrubbery while a party of well-bred Bournemouth ladies, gathering up their belongings, had swept down the drive.As Mother recounted this tale, Gerald looked thoughtful, a small smile hovering at the corners of his mouth as he deftly directed the criticism towards me.‘Ah, but what about your boyfriends, Margo?’ he said. ‘In your time you’ve had some swooning around you, God knows why. ‘And I hear that some fool with a trombone seems to be jostling for first place in your affections.’ I looked around indignantly. How dare the family discuss my private life? How dare my lodgers gossip? I thought furiously. But all this was nothing compared to the worry of Gerald’s presence.That night, he sank into a peaceful sleep, unconcerned by the preoccupations of suburbia. In the kitchen, where it had been moved despite my protestations, the python was equally contented, full on a meal of white mice.Only I lay awake, restless with thoughts of what my neighbours would make of Gerald’s creatures. A die-hard group of retired gentry who strove to maintain the road’s genteel atmosphere even as dwindling fortunes saw big houses being converted into flats and nursing homes, they were typified by the aloof figures of Lord and Lady Booth, the latter a graciously befurred woman who passed daily, dragging a permanently yapping terrier with her.I had never spoken to Lord Booth, but within a few days I had an irate phone call from him.By then Gerald had departed, ending a short stay into which he had packed much flirtation with my lady lodgers.Although he had taken the python with him, he had left me in protesting charge of his monkeys and this telephone call soon alerted me to my shortcomings as their keeper.‘There is an animal in my bedroom that has knocked over the light, and is eating my tobacco!’ His Lordship announced. ‘The thing has now escaped by the window. I am going to make my complaint to the right authorities.’A click, then silence, told me I had been deliberately cut off. Thoroughly alarmed, I then heard a long drawn-out ‘eeeeeee’ and a frantic squawking of chickens from next door.I rushed to an upstairs window to see what was causing the disturbance. Somehow the monkeys had escaped and one of them was now sitting in the open door of the chicken house, sucking eggs with a blissful lack of concern.Below him, hens fled in agitation and a defeated cockerel sat, stunned to silence, as my neighbour Mr Briggs approached with a gun.‘Don’t shoot!’ I yelled indignantly. At the sound of my scream, doors opened on all sides of the landing and soon Andy was by my side.‘One of the monkeys is over at Mr Briggs’s and about to get shot — can you rescue it for me?’ I begged.He followed me into the garden without a murmur of protest and cleared the fence easily, falling at Mr Briggs’s feet as the gun went off.‘You missed!’ came the disparaging comment of Mrs Briggs, accompanied by the renewed noise of chickens in frantic terror, the deafening squeals of a now very frightened monkey and Andy booming out unrepeatable curses.‘Has someone been shot?’ I asked aghast, fearful I might be mourning the loss of Andy.But then his head and shoulders appeared above the fence and after a slight struggle he dropped back down beside us, pain and fury making his face haggard. His hand was bleeding profusely.‘Are you bitten?’ I said, my spirits chilling at the sight of his ashen face. ‘Ay.’ He turned to me bitterly. ‘Where do you want this monkey?’ ‘Back in the garage,’ I answered with a shamed face.Then plain Jane emerged from the house and enveloped Andy in sympathetic arms. She led him away, without a glance in my direction, to her first-aid chest.I had lost him, I told myself in anguish the object of my dreams was even now languishing with rabies in the clutches of skinny Jane, she who had proved so much more efficient than I in a crisis.I was destined to be an old maid, a sour-faced landlady, ageing quickly, not at all gracefully and, if the monkeys had anything to do with it, lacking any money with which to pacify myself.Like visiting holidaymakers, they had begun exploring the delights of the town and the local paper started a daily column following their routes and escapades. They could afford to find it amusing — after all it wasn’t they who would have to pay the damages of possible disaster.I sent a brief telegram to Gerald telling him to return and collect his specimens, ending it with the word ‘vital’. He arrived almost immediately and, cursing my incompetence, set off to bring home whichever offenders had been caught.As the prodigals returned, one by one, they greeted their foster father with recognisable cries of welcome and touching shows of affection.Touching, that was, to those of us who had not suffered either the galling indignities of chasing a monkey, which is always just out of reach, or its bites.Now his charges were once more safe, Gerald treated their escape lightly. ‘The bonds of true love,’ he told me, ‘are strengthened, not severed, by a few disasters.’‘Not monkey bites,’ I insisted, proving my facts with a dismal tale of a lost love, an uncomfortable reminder of which came whenever Andy passed me in the hall with an impassive face and a bandaged hand carried with painful care.I prayed that things might be put right at a party I had planned in honour of my lodger Gordon, a mournful bachelor who was about to leave us after coming into an inheritance.But amid all the gaiety I couldn’t bring myself to approach the dejected figure of Andy, whose throbbing hand eventually took him early to bed.Only when he crept upstairs did I rise from my seat, telling myself that a landlady had a perfect right to see how an ailing lodger was, even at that hour.So I found myself knocking gently at the door of his room and entering.‘I was hoping you would come,’ he said and I kissed the ill-fated hand, the sleeve neatly folded back by the trim fingers of Jane.We were together at last. And, though it pained me to admit it, we had Gerald — and his monkeys — to thank.n ADAPTED from Whatever Happened To Margo? by Margaret Durrell (Penguin, £9.99). © Margaret Durrell 1995.

Security personnel carry pieces of furniture out of the US consulate in St Petersburg, Russia An embassy official suggested that the jet, which had arrived from Moscow on a scheduled return trip, had been searched in connection with the diplomatic crisis over the Salisbury spy poisoning.The row intensified on Friday after the Kremlin ordered Britain to reduce the number of diplomats in Moscow down to the same amount that Russia has in London.It came as ambassadors from more than 20 countries were called into the foreign ministry in Moscow to be told of the latest wave of retaliatory measures being imposed.As the crisis notched up the Russian embassy in London said British officials had searched an Aeroflot jet that had landed at Heathrow from Moscow.According to an embassy officer Border Force and customs officers at first tried to search the plane without the crew, although the captain was eventually allowed to be present.

And again at his Oxford graduation (right)    The best-known theoretical physicist of his time, Hawking wrote so lucidly of the mysteries of space, time and black holes that his book, \u0027A Brief History of Time,\u0027 became an international best-seller, making him one of science\u0027s biggest celebrities since Albert EinsteinThe best-known theoretical physicist of his time, Hawking wrote so lucidly of the mysteries of space, time and black holes that his book, \u0027A Brief History of Time,\u0027 became an international best-seller, making him one of science\u0027s biggest celebrities since Albert Einstein. \u0027He was a great scientist and an extraordinary man whose work and legacy will live on for many years,\u0027 his children Lucy, Robert and Tim said in a statement. His courage and persistence with his brilliance and humour inspired people across the world. He once said, \u0027It would not be much of a universe if it wasn\u0027t home to the people you love.\u0027 We will miss him forever.\u0027Even though his body was attacked by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, when Hawking was 21, he stunned doctors by living with the normally fatal illness for more than 50 years. A severe attack of pneumonia in 1985 left him breathing through a tube, forcing him to communicate through an electronic voice synthesizer that gave him his distinctive robotic monotone.But he continued his scientific work, appeared on television and married for a second time.As one of Isaac Newton\u0027s successors as Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge University, Hawking was involved in the search for the great goal of physics - a \u0027unified theory.\u0027Such a theory would resolve the contradictions between Einstein\u0027s theory of relativity, which describes the laws of gravity that govern the motion of large objects like planets, and the quantum mechanics theory, which deals with the world of subatomic particles.For Hawking, the search was almost a religious quest - he said finding a \u0027theory of everything\u0027 would allow mankind to \u0027know the mind of God.\u0027\u0027A complete, consistent unified theory is only the first step: our goal is a complete understanding of the events around us, and of our own existence,\u0027 he wrote in \u0027A Brief History of Time.\u0027In later years, though, he suggested a unified theory might not exist.He followed up \u0027A Brief History of Time\u0027 in 2001 with the more accessible sequel \u0027The Universe in a Nutshell,\u0027 updating readers on concepts like super gravity, naked singularities and the possibility of an 11-dimensional universe.Hawking said belief in a God who intervenes in the universe \u0027to make sure the good guys win or get rewarded in the next life\u0027 was wishful thinking.\u0027But one can\u0027t help asking the question: Why does the universe exist?\u0027 he said in 1991. \u0027I don\u0027t know an operational way to give the question or the answer, if there is one, a meaning. But it bothers me.\u0027The combination of his best-selling book and his almost total disability - for a while he could use a few fingers, later he could only tighten the muscles on his face - made him one of science\u0027s most recognizable faces.He made cameo television appearances in \u0027The Big Bang Theory,\u0027 \u0027\u0027The Simpsons\u0027 and \u0027Star Trek: The Next Generation\u0027 and counted among his fans U2 guitarist The Edge, who attended a January 2002 celebration of Hawking\u0027s 60th birthday.His early life was chronicled in the 2014 film \u0027The Theory of Everything,\u0027 with Eddie Redmayne winning the best actor Academy Award for his portrayal of the scientist. The film focused still more attention on Hawking\u0027s remarkable achievements.Some colleagues credited that celebrity with generating new enthusiasm for science.His achievements and his longevity helped prove to many that even the most severe disabilities need not stop patients from living. Hawking was born Jan. 8, 1942, in Oxford, and grew up in London and St. Albans, northwest of the capital. In 1959, he entered Oxford University and then went on to graduate work at Cambridge.Signs of illness appeared in his first year of graduate school, and he was diagnosed with ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig\u0027s disease after the New York Yankee star who died of it. The disease usually kills within three to five years.                                                     "},{"url":"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5564875/China-space-lab-fall-Earth-later-European-Space-Agency.html","title":"China space lab may fall to Earth later: European Space...","story":"    Tiangong-1, an eight-tonne space lab the size of a bus, is due to rip across the sky as it makes a fiery entry into the earth’s atmosphere between Sunday and Monday.

The Tiangong-1 space lab (pictured in an undated image taken before ground crews lost control of it) is expected to make a fiery plunge back to Earth by MondayChina sent another lab, Tiangong-2, into orbit in September 2016 as a stepping stone to its goal of having a crewed space station by 2022.During the re-entry, atmospheric drag will rip away solar arrays, antennas and other external components at an altitude of around 60 miles, according to the Chinese space office.The intensifying heat and friction will cause the main structure to burn or blow up, and it should disintegrate at an altitude of around 50 miles, it said.Most fragments will dissipate in the air and a small amount of debris will fall relatively slowly before landing across hundreds of square miles, most likely in the ocean, which covers more than 70 per cent of the Earth\u0027s surface.  This graphic shows a timeline between the launch of Tiangong-1 on September 29, 2011 and its re-entry into earth at some point over the next few daysExperts have downplayed any concerns about the Tiangong-1 causing any damage when it hurtles back to Earth, with the ESA noting that nearly 6,000 uncontrolled re-entries of large objects have occurred over the past 60 years without harming anyone.Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, estimates that Tiangong-1 is the 50th most massive uncontrolled re-entry of an object since 1957, when the Soviet Union launched Sputnik 1 - the world\u0027s first artificial satellite.At an altitude of 37 to 43 miles, debris will begin to turn into \u0027a series of fireballs\u0027, which is when people on the ground will \u0027see a spectacular show\u0027, he said.  "},{"url":"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5564987/Former-Fox-News-reporter-Diana-Falzone-settles-discrimination-lawsuit-battling-endometriosis.html","title":"Ex Fox News reporter Diana Falzone settles discrimination lawsuit","story":"    Fox411 host Diana Falzone filed a lawsuit in New York on May 2017 alleging that Fox, a unit of Twenty-First Century Fox Inc, discriminated against her on the basis of sex and disabilityFor Falzone, even though she has always been career-focused, she\u0027s also always considered family her top priority.Her plan was to be married by 34, and start her family by 36, \u0027but endometriosis had another plan,\u0027 she said.In February 2016, she first learned she had endometriosis after excruciating pain landed her in the hospital for emergency surgery, she told DailyMail.com. That\u0027s when she was diagnosed with infertility, as well.   Infertility doesn\u0027t necessarily mean a woman can\u0027t get pregnant, but in Falzone\u0027s case, it did mean that she had a very low egg reserve, which makes naturally getting pregnant extremely difficult, without some extra help from science.\u0027So on top of having to undergo a three-and-half hour surgery to remove the endometrial lesions from my organs I had to put a plan together with my doctors of how I was going to preserve my fertility,\u0027 Falzone said. Part of her plan involved freezing her eggs that Fall. She went through two rounds of egg retrieval, and by October 2016 she had seven eggs on ice.Falzone said she felt OK about that, especially because her doctors had told her there was little chance of her endometriosis coming back.A few months later, she shared her story on the Fox News website, under the headline, \u0027Women Should Never Suffer in Silence,\u0027 which she said was written by one of her editors.She was first persuaded to share her story by the manager of her doctor\u0027s office who urged her to speak out to help women who may be suffering in silence, alone. But when she did, she was taken off the air, which she would later claim was due to her pre-approved decision to share her story.          Doctors told Falzone in June 2017 that  she had a six-month window to get pregnant, and only a three- month window to retrieve additional eggs before her body attacked what she had leftIt was just a few months after that in May 2017  when she finally had enough, and filed her lawsuit for discrimination against Fox. That\u0027s also when she started getting what she called \u0027foreshadowing pain.\u0027\u0027It is so intense and debilitating and different than any other pain you\u0027ve had, that you know its endometriosis, and you know it\u0027s back,\u0027 she said. Unfortunately, she wasn\u0027t wrong. The disease had come back, and with a vengeance.In June 2017, Falzone underwent another surgery to remove the uterine lining that was taking over her body, this time four hours long.\u0027The legions were everywhere,\u0027 she said. \u0027They were on my bladder, my uterus was fuzed to my abdomen, my ovaries were fuzed. My entire appendix was diseased by the endometriosis,  that\u0027s why I was getting such terrible pain. They removed that.\u0027And this time, her doctors  told her another attack was not only possible, but likely.They told her she had a six-month window to get pregnant, and only a three- month window to retrieve and preserve additional eggs, before her body attacked whatever she had left.Falzone\u0027s discrimination lawsuit against Fox, which claimed she was demoted and taken off the air for being a woman and writing about the medical condition that left her infertile, was one of several high profile claims against the company in the past yearSo, after conferring with her reproductive immunologist and surgeons, Falzone agreed to begin the process as soon as her body was healed enough. She retrieved more eggs in September, and this time made embryos.Then, on November 22, the day before Thanksgiving, Falzone went to see her doctor to have an embryo transfer.The embryo implanted, and 10 days later her blood test revealed she was successfully pregnant, with what she\u0027d later find out will be a baby boy.  But she wasn\u0027t out of the woods yet. Endometriosis is like a auto immune disorder, so her body could have attacked the cells growing inside of her.Thankfully, she was monitored closely, that hasn\u0027t happened, and all of her troubles with her former employer are behind her.    Falzone\u0027s discrimination lawsuit against Fox, which claimed she was demoted and taken off the air for being a woman and writing about the medical condition that left her infertile, was one of several high profile claims against the company in the past year. The lawsuit was filed just as she was diagnosed with a returning case of the disease, and on the same day that Fox News co-President Bill Shine\u0027s resigned, who wasn\u0027t accused of sexual harassment but was named in lawsuits for allegedly covering up such behavior.Falzone was represented by Nancy Smith and Martin Hyman, the same attorneys who filed Gretchen Carlson\u0027s sexual harassment lawsuit in 2016 against Roger Ailes. Fox News reporter Diana Falzone sues the network, claiming...Bill Shine is OUT as co-president of Fox NewsShare this articleWhile the terms of Falzone\u0027s settlement with Fox have not been disclosed, her legal representation helped Carlson secure a $20 million settlement, which ultimately led to the resignation of Ailes. Her lawsuit was discontinued on March 16, one week after her last day with the network in New York City.Falzone is currently reviving a previous project, a comic book she co-created with Geoff Skinner for pre-teens and teens called Hot Mess, that aims to help youth prepare for the tough parts of their high school years.She\u0027ll also appear in the upcoming season of Reelz Network\u0027s Collision Course as an entertainment reporter and commentator, out this Spring.       Women should never suffer in silence | Fox NewsFox News reporter says she was shunned over article about health condition | News | WKZOFox News co-president Bill Shine out in latest shake-up for network - May. 1, 2017Hot Mess - A Webcomic Series by Diana Falzone Emily Chan \u0026amp Geoff Skinner"},{"url":"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5564989/Former-international-footballer-racially-abused-bus-headed-home-church.html","title":"Former international footballer was racially abused on Liverpool bus","story":"    Twenty-six-year-old footballer Pavel Vieira was racially abused on the bus as he traveled home from churchPavel, who is from the African nation of Guinea-Bissau, had been at church.He boarded the number 21 bus at 9pm as he headed to his home near County Road, Walton.But as soon as he boarded the bus, a man started racially abusing him.In response, he got his phone out and began to film. As the clip starts, the racist is seen trying to knock Pavel\u0027s phone out of his hand. He tells him that he doesn\u0027t like him because he is black, adding: \u0027You shouldn\u0027t even be here.\u0027\u0027I can\u0027t believe their mouths\u0027: Victim of racist tirade...White van driver who drove at businesswoman\u0027s car and...Share this articleHe can then be heard attempting to prove others on the bus share his racist views, saying: \u0027Everyone is thinking it, they are all the same, why doesn\u0027t everyone say something.\u0027But at this point, other passengers on the bus step in - with one man shouting to Pavel \u0027I\u0027m Scouse, I don\u0027t hate you mate.\u0027Others join in condemning the racist attack - and one man comes forward to shake Pavel\u0027s hand and speak out against the man.But his horrific slurs continue, as he tells Pavel he has only come to the UK because \u0027his mother was raped\u0027, prompting more outrage from the passengers on the bus.Pavel shared the video in a bid to highlight the support he received from the public.The 26-year-old has played football for a number of UK clubs, including Bangor City and once trialed with Tranmere Rovers.

I tell everybody, “Life is a bicycle – stop pedalling, and you fall off.”‘To get a job and to do the same thing then to retire 50 years later is soul destroying,’ he says. ‘Life’s full of change now.’ A businessman by background, it is 34 years since he was first brought to Westminster to mastermind Margaret Thatcher’s privatisation plans.Ironically, he is moving on just as that huge revolution is at risk of being overturned by Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell, Labour’s leader and Shadow Chancellor, who have put nationalisation at the heart of their political agenda.‘Life’s a pendulum,’ sighs Lord Young, sitting smartly dressed in one of his trademark bow ties in Young Associates’ Regent’s Park office, a short walk from the home he shares with his wife, Lita.‘When I was young, I was very Left-wing. I believed in the state owning things. When I saw what happened in practice, I grew up.’Lord Young was one of Lady Thatcher’s closest advisers between 1984 and 1989, and worked on the public sales of companies including BT and Cable and Wireless.He then spent two decades as a City grandee, working with a string of firms and organisations including the Institute of Directors and investment bank Salomon Brothers before David Cameron invited him to be the Coalition Government’s enterprise adviser between 2010 and 2015.At this time, Lord Young established himself as a supporter of small business, and launched an £80 million start-up loan scheme.Saviour for battered Persimmon?  Housebuilder hires a new...How the majority of fat cat firms were using the SAME...MP blasts Persimmon boss\u0027s £100m bonus as \u0027impossible to...Share this article    Storm: Persimmon’s Jeff Fairburn received a £45 million bonus last year‘Now, it’s gone too far the other way. That’s exactly what she would have said.’It would take a brave man to assume they could speak on behalf of Lady Thatcher were she still alive. But Lord Young is better placed than most to make such assertions. He speaks proudly of his regular one-on-one meetings with the Iron Lady and the level of confidence she had in him. ‘I was a political eunuch,’ he explains. ‘There was no way I could ever be a threat to her. So I was someone that could be trusted. She was an amazing woman.’Were they friends? Strictly in a business sense, he says. ‘It’s very interesting, actually. I would not enjoy having dinner with her. She was awkward, difficult, because she was a driven person.’But he adds that she ‘did wonders for this country’, and looks back at the pre-Thatcher days with horror: ‘It was the most miserable time in this country.’Lord Young left school at the age of 16 in 1948, as did most others at that time, he says. He started out as a clerk in a solicitor’s office and studied for a law degree in the evenings. He later went into the industrial and commercial property business, ahead of his first spell in politics. After resigning from Lady Thatcher’s government in 1989, he went back into business and set up Young Associates in 1996.He describes the five-year period in the Coalition Government as the best of his life, though he is concerned that UK politics has changed for the worse since the 1980s. ‘Some time in the Blair years they decided to turn politics into a profession and make it a full-time job,’ he says.‘When I joined the Cabinet in 1984 I sat in my first meeting and looked around and worked out that of the 21 people there, 11 had started their own business.’In the Cameron government, he says, people were generally ten years younger and did not have this experience. He fears the current Cabinet has the same problem. ‘What you need, I think, is life experience,’ he adds. ‘People who have taken responsibility for things and done things.’And what would Lord Young say if Theresa May became the third Prime Minister to turn to him for some life experience in her Cabinet? ‘Like a complete and utter idiot, I’d say yes.’"},{"url":"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5565405/Unseen-diary-RAF-chaplain-captures-heroism-sacrifice-humour-Few.html","title":"Unseen diary of RAF chaplain captures the heroism, sacrifice and humour of The Few","story":""},{"url":"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5565447/Terminally-ill-father-61-hosting-wake.html","title":"Terminally-ill father from Kent is hosting his OWN wake","story":"    David Hughes, 61, has an incurable form of cancer but wants one final party before he passes awayIn October, he was given the awful news it had spread to his bones and it was terminal.His living wake will take place from 7pm on Saturday, April 28 at Minster\u0027s Working Men\u0027s Club and will feature disco music from the 1970s and 80s, a raffle and a buffet.The money raised on the night will go towards prostate and bone cancer research.Mr Hughes said: \u0027I want to see as many of my friends and family, past and present, as possible while I\u0027m still here.Police hunt hit-and-run driver who killed a 10-year-old...Stephen Hawking\u0027s family say their last goodbyes as...Share this article\u0027If you grew up in Noreen Avenue, Minster, in the 1960s and 1970s or were at Minster Primary, Sheerness Secondary School for boys, or Sheppey School with me, please come and join us for a fun-filled night.\u0027Or if you worked with me at Woods Bakery, Klippons, Queenborough Rolling Mill or Morrisons.\u0027 He added: \u0027Life is about making memories and moving on, but it\u0027s also about all the people you know and have met along the way.\u0027It will be great to have a catch up with people I haven\u0027t seen for a long time.\u0027Why have a get together when you\u0027re dead?\u0027          Minster Working Men\u0027s Club, where Mr Hughes will hold his living wake next monthMr Hughes has two daughters, Emma and Lauren and has four grandchildren, Carys, Jayden, Sasha and Savannah.  His sister Miriam Parker said: \u0027If you know David, come and celebrate his life and help him see faces from the past before he leaves us forever.\u0027He\u0027s such a hard working, decent, nice chap.

There are lots of lovely things about this trail, not just the calming sea views. It’s flat and easy and you can’t get lost – just follow the coastline. The other bonus is that a view of Snowdon keeps you company.Very early on you’ll pass the Sea Zoo Conservation Centre on your right, and you might even notice the team releasing baby lobsters and seahorses back into the wild.The area is known for its mussels because these waters make for some of the best growing conditions in Britain – and mussels are likely to be on the menu at the Marram Grass Cafe, about eight miles into the walk. The walk ends on the romantic Llanddwyn Island, home of Wales’s own female St Valentine and a favourite spot for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, because it’s where they lived when William served as a search-and-rescue helicopter pilot.          The route ends with magnificent views over Caernarfon Bay, pictured, but as it isn\u0027t circular, you will need a taxi or a friend to give you a lift back to your carAs the sun sets, you’ll catch the unexpected silhouette of a lighthouse on the promontory and there are stunning views out to Caernarfon Bay, the Snowdonia range and the Llyn peninsula – all in one eye-watering gaze.This isn’t a circular walk, so either phone a friend, book a taxi or hitch a ride back to your car.theoutdoorguide.co.ukwalks julia-bradbury-walks anglesey-coastal-walk2 Ravenscar to Robin Hood’s Bay, North Yorkshire MoorsLength: 10.3 milesStart: RavenscarEnd: RavenscarPitstop: Ravenscar Tearooms          This 10.3 mile walk loops around the North Yorkshire Moors to the base at RavenscarYou can enjoy the North Yorks Moors National Park in miniature on this walk through some of its best-known landscapes. From the craggy heights of Ravenscar, the route runs across Howdale Moor before dropping down to the old Scarborough-to-Whitby railway line and along to the smugglers’ haunt of Robin Hood’s Bay.You can go rock-pooling and fossil-hunting, before returning along an exhilarating clifftop walk. Sea views, cobbled lanes, cinder tracks, archaeological ruins and spreading moorland heather – it’s a combination that takes a lot of beating in a single day.          While on the 10-mile walk, you will get the chance to see Robin Hood\u0027s Bay and its villageThis is part of Alfred Wainwright’s Coast to Coast Walk – the beginning or the end, depending where you start. I remember being really sad when we finished doing the Coast to Coast. I stood in Robin Hood’s Bay with sea lapping over my boots and throwing a pebble into the water as tradition dictates. I was longing to stay but I had to drive to Scotland to start filming another series – it was heartbreaking to have to leave so soon. It’s definitely on my go-back-to list.theoutdoorguide.co.ukwalksnational-parksnorth-york- moors-walk3 Friars Crag Walk,Lake DistrictLength: 1.13 milesStart: Keswick Camping and Caravanning Club siteEnd: Keswick town centrePitstop: Keswick Lakeside Shop          This 1.13 stroll along Friars Crag Walk privides amazing views over Derwent WaterI have a soft spot for Keswick and I have tried to support the town when the weather has been stormy and businesses have been struggling.I remember being there with the Prince of Wales, joining forces to turn on the Christmas lights in the hope of giving the tourist trade a little bit of a boost.Start at the Keswick Camping and Caravanning Club site and walk along the lake into Cockshot Woods, which are alive with birds and red squirrels. Beyond this is a meadow often filled with grazing Herdwick sheep, and geese having a rest. It’s an ideal spot for children to run wild.          The area around Friars Crag in Keswick, pictured, has Unesco World Heritage StatusAt the furthest edge of the woods is a bench with a stunning view of the lakes. I can’t get enough of this area, which has been awarded Unesco World Heritage Site status.Whenever I talk about travel and walking, I always speak about the Lake District, which is the ultimate outdoor destination. Where else can you get valleys, mountains, rivers and pretty villages all in the same small corner of the country? This walk is wheelchair-friendly too.theoutdoorguide.co.ukwalkswheelchair-friendly-walks friars-crag-keswick4 The South Downs Walk, East SussexLength: 4.75 milesStart: Tiger Inn, East DeanEnd: Grand Hotel, EastbournePitstop: Tiger Inn, East Dean          This 4.75 mile route starts at the Tiger Inn and ends at the Belle Tout LighthouseFollow in the footsteps of Sherlock Holmes on a classic English walk which includes the white cliffs of the Seven Sisters, Beachy Head and the seaside charm of Birling Gap, ending at the Belle Tout lighthouse, with its commanding views across the Sussex Downs.Some of the cliffs are called the Bottoms, which suits my Carry On sense of humour: there’s not many times you can say on camera with a straight face: ‘That’s a lovely Bottom.’On a good day you can see six counties and the Isle of Wight, while the Birling Gap National Trust cafe is a great place for tea and biscuits. But enjoy it while you can: the Birling Gap is disappearing at a staggering erosion rate of almost one metre a year. This isn’t a circular walk, so either phone a friend or hitch a ride back to your car.          The Tiger Inn in East Dean is a wonderful spot to stop for dinner made from local produceI love the olde worlde charm of Eastbourne’s Grand Hotel, with its outdoor pool (it’s usually open from Easter until November). Winston Churchill and Charlie Chaplin were fans too. The Tiger Inn, in the village of East Dean, which looks as if it’s a setting for Midsomer Murders, is a good place for dinner made from fresh, local ingredients.theoutdoorguide.co.ukwalks julia-bradbury-walks south-downs-seven-sisters-walk5 West Highland Way, ScotlandLength: 9.6 milesStart: Glencoe Mountain CentreEnd: Devil’s Staircase (you might want to continue to the peak of Stob Mhic Mhartuin, which is a further 783 yards)Pitstop: Glencoe Mountain Resort Cafe          This 9.6 mile trip from the Glencoe Mountain Centre to the Devil\u0027s Staircase is hardThis stretch is the average person’s long-distance hike, perfect for fairweather walkers. Like the rest of the West Highland Way, it is simple to navigate and easy-going underfoot, although a Scottish downpour can turn parts of it from a path to a stream.The Highland scenery is breathtaking, the kind of valley Ian Fleming envisioned as the childhood home of James Bond, and it provides the backdrop to the climax of Skyfall. Walks in Scotland hold a special place in my heart because I used to spend a lot of time here as a girl on family holidays, beachcombing with my dad. They are happy memories and I can’t wait to bring my own children.For a bite to eat, stop at the Glencoe Mountain Resort Cafe (glencoemountain.co.uk). If you fancy an overnight stay, try The Drovers Inn (droversinn.co.uk). Don’t forget to arrange transport if you’re heading back to Glencoe.theoutdoorguide.co.uk britains-favourite-walks west-highland-way6 St Ives to Zennor, CornwallLength: 12.09 milesStart: Porthgwidden BeachEnd: Porthgwidden BeachPitstop: Tinners Arms, Zennor          This 12.09 mile trip in Cornwall is quite difficult with wild and rugged landscape The landscape is wild and rugged along this, one of the toughest sections of the South West Coast Path. The walk is invigorating and incredibly picturesque – it’s in an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and there isn’t a bad view of the Atlantic.I love walks that hug the seashore – there’s something so refreshing about being close to the water, hearing the waves and breathing in the sea air. According to the National Trust we all sleep better after a coastal walk – it can give you an extra 47 minutes’ sleep a night on average.          This walk needs plenty of time and it is worthwhile stocking up on provisions before you startTrue or not, it’s certainly worth investigating during this round trip. Allow plenty of time and remember to stock up on provisions before you start.Alternatively, reward yourself in one of my favourite pubs, the 700-year-old Tinners Arms, which is about halfway along the route. I can be found there myself occasionally with a pint of cider.For more information visit theoutdoorguide.co.ukbritains-favourite-walksst-ives-to-zennor7 Regent’s Canal, LondonLength: 8.6 milesStart: PaddingtonEnd: LimehousePitstop: Camden Lock Market          This 8.6 mile walk will bring you from Paddington to Limehouse along the Regent\u0027s CanalThe Regent’s Canal, part of the Grand Union Canal, is an amazing way to see a different sort of London life. This is my ‘country walk’ in the city and I never do it without feeling I am paying homage to Amsterdam. From the elegance of Little Venice – surely the most popular stretch of canal to live on in London – to the powerhouse of the Docklands, this walk gives you an extraordinary insight into the capital’s history.Canals used to be the motorways of the country – this one is still a wonderful human highway.          The walk gives you the chance to sample Little Venice and the wonderful Camden MarketCamden Market is a great place for a pitstop. Browse the vintage fashion stalls or grab lunch at one of the food stalls. I always smile to myself as Canary Wharf comes into view. That’s where I got one of my first breaks in TV, working for Janet Street-Porter in the 1990s on LiveTV.theoutdoorguide.co.uk britains-favourite-walks regents-canal-london8 East Lyn River Walk, DevonLength: 5.18 milesStart: LyntonEnd: LynmouthPitstop: Watersmeet National Trust cafe          This 5.18-mile walk is medium difficulty looping around Countisbury Hill in DevonThis is a hidden treasure on the Exmoor coast. I discovered it while I was filming Britain’s Best Walks for ITV two years ago and it’s now in my top three personal favourites. You set off from the picturesque town of Lynton and meander under a canopy of trees by the side of the East Lyn river. At the halfway point of the walk, where the East Lyn merges with Hoar Oak Water, there’s the stunning Watersmeet National Trust cafe, which is a wonderful spot for a cream tea.           There is a lot of wildlife to see on this walk as well as some wonderful spots to eatI think this cafe is in the prettiest location in Britain, possibly the world. It sits on a river bend which has attracted poets and writers for centuries – Wordsworth was a fan. There’s also a lot of wildlife to see on this walk – fish, birds and all the little riverbank animals. There is even talk of otters, elusive though they are. On the way back, you leave the river and head up towards Countisbury Hill and circle back down to the coast.theoutdoorguide.co.ukwalks julia-bradbury-walks britains-best-walks-exmoor-devon9 Wells-next-the-Sea Coastal Walk, NorfolkLength: 4.76 milesStart: Crown HotelEnd: Wells village centrePitstop: Holkham Cafe          This is an easy 4.76 mile stroll with lots of ersions and unusual sights including grey sealsThis is as much a day out as a walk. If you enjoy a mix of seaside cafes, stunning wildlife, dunes, woodlands and a busy working harbour, then this is the one for you. Wells-Next-The-Sea is part of the pretty flint chain of villages dotting the Norfolk coastline.This is an easy route with lots of ersions and unusual sights, including pink-footed geese and grey seals. But here’s a health-and-safety warning: if you take your dog, watch them with the seals. It’s rare but they have been known to drag curious dogs into the sea.The walk starts in the centre of Wells and follows a track (that’s wheelchair-friendly) out of the harbour and down to the beachfront, where there’s a great cafe called the Holkham (holkham.co.ukstay-eatbeach-cafe).          If you take your dog on this walk it might be at risk from the seals who live in the areaThe views from the beach are spectacular and the walk heads into the dunes. Watch your footing through here, then choose various pathways that weave through a pine woodland and back to the cafe.theoutdoorguide.co.uk britains-favourite-walks wells-beach-norfolk10 High Cup Nick, CumbriaLength: 9.01 milesStart: DuftonEnd: DuftonPitstop: Stag Inn, Dufton          This is a medium difficulty walk which covers 9.01 miles and loops around High Cup NickHigh Cup Nick has been called the Grand Canyon of the Pennines and is surely one of the North’s most glorious landscape features. You start and end in the village of Dufton. While you are there, pop your head in at the workshop of Rudds Rakes, where they’ve been making wooden rakes by hand since the 1890s. Owner John may even let you buy one of the special rakes that have been used in films and in the Opening Ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.As you head out of the village, be prepared for a challenge. It’s rocky underfoot and the scenery is wild moorland. You’ll cross streams that become rivers in winter and come upon large boulder fields – and you might be battered by the ‘Helm Wind’ (the only named wind in Britain) that roars across the surrounding hills.          The walk to High Cup Nick is  rocky underfoot and the scenery is wild moorlandIt’s quite rightly an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, and when you make the final climb along the edge of the valley and arrive at the mighty High Cup Nick, you’ll be rewarded with mesmerising views of the impressive glaciated valley.This is one of the highlights of the Pennine Way and was described by Wainwright as an ‘unforgettable sight’.When you make it back to Dufton, you’ll never be more grateful for a pint at the Stag Inn.theoutdoorguide.co.ukwalks julia-bradbury-walks cumbria-high-cup-walk Julia Bradbury will present Goodwood Festival Of Speed – The Silver Jubilee – from July 12 to 15 on ITV. "},{"url":"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5565607/Dickensian-diseases-including-rickets-gout-syphilis-make-comeback-modern-Britain.html","title":"Dickensian diseases including rickets, gout and  syphilis make a comeback in modern Britain","story":"    Tiny Tim, a child character in Charles Dickens\u0027 novel \u0027A Christmas Carol\u0027 was a famous sufferer of rickets          In the 19th century syphilis sufferers in France were caricatured to warn people of the awful consequences of visiting brothels      Outbreak of EYE syphilis is not slowing down, CDC warns British weather is causing rickets to skyrocket in children:...Share this articleIn very rare cases, it can be spread through prolonged kissing, as well as the more common routes of transmission: vaginal, anal and oral sex. It comes from the bacteria Treponema pallidum.

For seasoned Royal watchers are wondering whether Jessica, 37, might be so glamorous, there’s a risk she’ll overshadow Meghan – just as Pippa Middleton and her impossibly pert posterior took centre stage when she was bridesmaid at Kate’s marriage to William.EXCLUSIVE: Meghan Markle\u0027s \u0027first kiss\u0027 - and how she \u0027held...Share this article‘Meghan adores Jessica, not just as a friend but also as someone whose taste and style are impeccable,’ a friend told The Mail on Sunday.‘Meghan looks up to Jessica and has, to a certain degree, modelled herself on her. The irony is Meghan could end up being upstaged by the woman she’s fashioned herself on.’          My little army of helpers: It\u0027s a tight schedule getting everyone to school on time in the morning, so it\u0027s worth planning outfits in advance. What better accessories than co-ordinating seven-year-old twins?          Hey kids, DO try this at home: Now it\u0027s time to get the finely honed midriff out for another impossible-looking workout - this one is just \u0027fun\u0027, says Jessica, although it\u0027s \u0027not for the faint-hearted\u0027It is not merely Jessica’s soignee appearance that appears to have caught Meghan’s eye, for the merest glance at Jessica’s Instagram feed (scrutinised by 100,000 followers) reveals a life of domestic perfection. It has certainly given Meghan something to aim for.Born Jessica Brownstein in Montreal, she had a privileged start as a member of Canada’s Browns shoes dynasty, worth a reported £50 million. She attended an exclusive all-girls’ school, before going to McGill University, where she studied industrial relations and economics –skills she used to good effect when she launched her own business importing luxury lingerie.          No-one comes between me and my pal: Ripped jeans, glossy hair, black T-shirts – it’s almost like we’re identical twins. Or maybe I’m her stylist?          Hurrah!

But you don\u0027t look this good by opting for Chablis - make mine a sparkling mineral water. Yummy!Later, she would make a successful career as a stylist – with her own TV slot – and wedding planner, but it was her 2007 marriage to Ben Mulroney, son of former Canadian prime minister Brian Mulroney and one of Canada’s top television presenters, that propelled her on to the A-list.Today Jessica and her husband lead an affluent, yoga-toned life, that appears to be lifted from the pages of a magazine.Jessica regularly posts ‘inspirational’ fitness videos and pictures on Instagram – she and Meghan bonded over a ‘deep passion’ for yoga, Pilates, dogs and philanthropy.They first met when Meghan arrived in Toronto in 2011 to film Suits. Until then, the aspiring actress had been something of a ‘rough diamond’, but soon her style began to mirror her friend’s.‘Jessica helped Meghan with her wardrobe and introduced her to the right people,’ as one of their circle put it. An even closes friendship duly blossomed          Want a clue on Meg\u0027s big day? Time for my close-up - as a TV bridal expert. Whether you want to look mermaid or Meringue, I can find the perfect dress for your big day. Just ask Meghan!Before she took down her blog called The Tig, Meghan frequently posted pictures of the two on holiday and proudly referred to herself as ‘Aunty Meg’ to Jessica’s children. And it was in Jessica’s house that Harry and Meghan sought refuge when news of their secret romance first became public in 2016. Jessica attended Meghan’s recent Church of England baptism and has been closely involved in preparing for the wedding. She flew to Britain in January to attend the first fitting of the wedding dress and plans to return twice more before the ceremony in May.Her children, twins Brian and John, seven, and daughter Ivy, five, are even tipped to be page boys and bridesmaid alongside Prince George and Princess Charlotte. Certainly, if Meghan needs any domestic tips on leading an impeccably stylish and organised life with children in tow, she knows where to turn. But she should beware – it involves 5am starts and doing everything in heels.‘Jess is up early every morning, usually around 5am when Ben leaves the house, to make lunches for the kids and get them ready for the day,’ a friend remarked.‘After the kids are in school or kindergarten, she either goes straight to meetings or her television job. After that she usually works out and then is home in time for the kids when they return from school. They often cook together. And she will do all of this in heels.’A source added: ‘Everyone is betting on Jessica as Maid of Honour, but she’s giving nothing away.’And if she’s not, that’s only because she’ll be too busy planning every last detail. ‘The one thing you can be certain of is that Meghan’s wedding will be perfect… just like Jessica.’Meghan will, no doubt, be hoping all eyes stay firmly on the bride. "},{"url":"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5565635/DARA-BRIAIN-never-Strictly-did-win-it.html","title":"DARA Ó BRIAIN: I could never do Strictly... but if I did I would win it","story":"    Comedian Dara Ó Briain, 46, pictured, has been described as \u0027Britain\u0027s favourite Irishman\u0027          Dara, pictured yesterday at Stephen Hawkin\u0027s funeral, got to meet the acclaimed scientist before he died - and even owns a signed copy of his book, A Brief History Of TimeMeet your heroes.

But a tribunal in London revealed two weeks ago it had dismissed the request.Leah Washington, then 17, and Vicky Balch, 20, suffered partial leg amputations in the weeks after the rollercoaster crash. Three others suffered serious injuries, including Miss Washington’s boyfriend Joe Pugh, 18, who broke both kneecaps and had the little finger of his left hand snapped off.The collision in June 2015 had the same impact as a car crashing at 90mph, a court was told. A judge said the park’s parent company, Merlin Entertainments, was guilty of a ‘catastrophic failure’, adding that it was ‘a needless and avoidable accident in which those who were injured were lucky not to be killed’. Merlin – which admitted breaching the Health and Safety Act – was fined £5 million. The crash occurred after an engineer restarted the ride while a stationary carriage was still on the track.Merlin chief Nick Varney said after the court hearing in 2016 that the firm had ‘let people down with devastating consequences.’ At a tribunal in London to hear the case for a tax cut, Merlin said its annual business rates payments should be cut because the public had been put off rollercoasters.\u0027I finally feel confident in my own skin\u0027: Alton Towers...Share this articleThe tribunal was told ‘the attitude of members of the public to thrill rides in general, and to thrill rides at Alton Towers in particular’, had changed following the crash.Merlin argued the switch in attitudes constituted a ‘material change’ for its business and one which had continued to impact on trade.

But his no-nonsense nanny Veronica Crook may just have let the cat out of the bag.‘He would make an excellent Prime Minister,’ she said without hesitation, when we bumped into her after interviewing the man whose nappies she used to change.Miss Crook had come to the Tory MP’s Westminster office so that he could drive her to Gournay Court, his pile in Somerset, where she is nanny to his six children, just as she was to Jacob nearly 50 years ago. ‘He was as good as gold as a little boy and he hasn’t changed a bit,’ she said.The popularity among dukes to dustmen of the languid Old Etonian Brexiteer who has stepped straight out of a Victorian ‘Spy’ cartoon has taken most by surprise.Blair, Clinton, Obama and Cameron all vied to be tieless and trendy. Rees-Mogg, with his double-breasted suits and Latin quotations, does the opposite.Ask him who is the England football manager: ‘Not a clue.’                            Who is the England manager? I haven\u0027t a clue                         Name a rap star: ‘No idea.’Does he ever eff and blind? ‘No, never. The worst I say is damn. I’m trying to bring the term blighter back into fashion.’With no Cabinet responsibility and millions in the bank from a successful City career, he can afford to speak his mind. And does. For all his politesse, he fires off militant letters to Mrs May telling her what he will and won’t accept in Brexit talks.Six months ago, Rees-Mogg was still a novelty act. Now many at Westminster believe that if he got to the last stage of the Conservative leadership contest, whereby party members choose between the top two MPs, Rees-Mogg would steal the show. He gave new and surprising insights into his personal and political life in his interview with this newspaper in which he:          Rees-Mogg posted this picture of his family on Instragram with the caption: On the way to the Eve of Christmas mass with the troops, Thomas is already in the carl Issued a heartfelt new call for the ban on Catholics becoming monarchs to be scrappedl Confessed he got away with driving at 100mph and lets his two-year-old son drive his Jaguarl Admitted that he could have been a devout Muslim instead of a CatholicGavin Williamson and Toff hold secret meeting: Defence...\u0027She was told not to worry\u0027: Britain\u0027s youngest Tory...Share this articlel Rejects Left-wing jibes that he is a ‘fascist’, saying he is against corporal and capital punishmentl Said he had never been ‘really drunk’.Rees-Mogg’s hardline views on Europe are well known but he is a softie as a dad. ‘I wasn’t smacked and I don’t want my children hit,’ he said. ‘If you want to hit your children, it is usually because you have lost control.’He leaves it to wife Helena to keep order. ‘I’m wet but she sticks to what she says. When they have a go at me for two minutes I say, “All right, then.” Nanny is pleased if they’re in bed when I get home or else they all start racing about.’          Jacob Rees-Mogg is the bookies’ favourite to succeed Theresa May as Tory leaderLiterally in the case of two-year-old Alfred. Dad lets him sit on his knee in his Jag as they cruise up and down the driveway of their home. ‘He holds the steering wheel while I do the accelerator,’ he revealed. ‘If I put my hands on the wheel, he says, “No, Alfred do it.” As soon as I get home, he says “Daddy, car!” and we toddle out.’Rees-Mogg’s unblinking faith in Brexit is matched by a passionate religious conviction which dates back to his upbringing as a Catholic. Had he ever wondered if he would have been a devout Muslim if he had been raised by a Muslim family? ‘There’s a lot of truth in that,’ he said.He rails against the arbitrary power of Brussels bureaucrats but has no qualms about the untrammelled authority wielded in another European capital, Rome. He likes the ‘clearly set out dogmas’ of the Catholic Church. ‘If a Pope has a disagreement with a cardinal he just moves him, it’s easy,’ he said with a chuckle.Rees-Mogg said his faith stems from the Resurrection.‘If you believe Christ died on the cross and rose again on the third day, there’s no miracle greater than that. If that is true, it’s easy to believe the rest of the Church’s teaching. If it’s not, everything else is a waste of time.’How could he be so sure?‘Because St Peter was willing to be martyred, crucified upside down, because he had seen the Resurrection.’ But the men who blew up the Twin Towers and the London Underground claimed to be martyrs too.‘They weren’t martyrs, they were evil, delusional mass murderers,’ he said. This time there was no Bertie Woosterish smile playing on his lips. Rees-Mogg’s strict Catholic orthodoxy caused controversy when he said he opposed all abortion, including for rape victims.Shortly before our interview, a friend of the MP suggested privately that Rees-Mogg also believes in another Catholic tenet – that there should be no sex before marriage. He duly confirmed he and Helena did not live together before they married in 2007, when he was aged 38. However, when pressed further, Rees-Mogg rebuffed us with a firm: ‘I am not discussing private and intimate matters.’He is uneasy about some aspects of the transgender rights debate.‘If you have people who have no intention of changing sex but think it would be fun to go into the women’s changing room, we cannot ignore that.’And he takes issue with Guardian pundit Suzanne Moore, who called him a ‘semi fascist in tweed’.‘I’m very far from being a fascist,’ he said, with the same Zen-like calm he displayed when he refused to be intimidated by Left-wing thugs at a meeting at a university in Bristol last month.

I believe in giving people sent to prison a second chance.’Mrs May was mocked for saying the naughtiest thing she had done was to run through a wheat field. Rees-Mogg, who owns two classic Bentleys as well as the Jag (he calls it his ‘day car’), nervously confessed he once drove at 100mph on a British motorway without getting caught – ‘this is dangerous territory, one doesn’t want to show off or be a total wuss’ – and has had ‘two or three’ speeding fines.He has never used the F-word –‘at least not as an adult’ – and has ‘never drunk so much that I can’t remember what happened the night before’.Rees-Mogg compares Brexit to the Glorious Revolution of 1688, the birth of modern parliamentary sovereignty. It is an interesting parallel. The Glorious Revolution also saw Catholic James II thrown out, the Crown given to Protestant William of Orange from the European mainland, partly to boost trade (sound familiar?), and Catholics banned from becoming the monarch.Rees-Mogg has tried to reassure non-believers alarmed by his deeply held religious convictions on issues like abortion and rape, saying they would not affect his policies if he ever got into power.However, there could be an exception. His fierce Catholic pride was hurt when the ban on the monarch’s female offspring having equal rights to succeed to the throne was lifted in 2013, while his call for the ban on Catholics to be lifted was rejected.‘It was unfriendly to the Catholic Church to say women must not be discriminated against but it’s fine that Catholics are. It should have been updated for everyone.’It could lead to an interesting conversation in his first audience with the Queen – the Head of the Church of England – if Rees-Mogg ever inherits Mrs May’s Tory crown."},{"url":"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5565731/Corbyn-faces-revolt-women-Labour-MPs-wife-beater-MP.html","title":"Corbyn faces revolt from women Labour MPs over \u0027wife beater\u0027 MP","story":"    Jeremy Corbyn faced a revolt from women Labour MPs last night over claims his party has failed to take action against a male MP accused of wife-beatingIt is understood that Jess Phillips, who chairs the women’s group, has since written to Mr Corbyn asking for the MP to be suspended pending an investigation.The row came as Mr Corbyn faced a deepening crisis over claims that he has failed to crack down on anti-Semitism in his party. On a day of dramatic new developments:Leading ‘Corbynista’ Christine Shawcroft resigned from Labour’s ruling national body after claims that she failed to act against anti-Semitic Labour activists – and was replaced by comedian Eddie IzzardLabour MP John Mann, writing in this newspaper, said Mr Corbyn was ‘unfit’ to be Prime Minister unless he expelled Ken Livingstone who has said Hitler supported Zionism – and claimed Labour faced up to 5,000 anti-Semitism complaintsLeading Blairite ex-MP Tristram Hunt called for London Mayor Sadiq Khan or ex-Foreign Secretary David Miliband to launch a new party to challenge LabourA Jewish Labour donor revealed he had quit the party because he no longer felt any ‘affinity or connection’ with it in the wake of the anti-Semitism row.Ms Shawcroft, who supports the hard-Left Momentum group that supports Mr Corbyn’s leadership, was forced to step down as head of the National Executive Committee’s disciplinary committee last week after she appeared to defend a council candidate accused of Holocaust denial. However, she quit the NEC altogether last night following calls for her to go from party deputy leader Tom Watson.Amid the row, a leaked letter that Ms Shawcroft wrote three weeks ago – seen by the MoS – defended her chairmanship of the NEC disputes panel but complained that she was ‘stitched up’. Last night she said she had quit because ‘it is clear that my continued membership of the NEC has become a distraction for the party’.Harriet Harman (left) backed calls to suspend the politician from the party, while it is understood that Jess Phillips (right) has written to Mr Corbyn asking for the MP to be suspended pending an investigation      Eddie Izzard joins Labour NEC after official at the centre...Share this articleMr Hunt said both would make ideal leaders of a ‘pro-European, internationalist party that believes in social mobility, a market economy and social justice’.Mr Corbyn has denied being anti-Semitic.

Hostility to Jews had ‘infected the Labour Party so it’s become endemic’, he said.The MoS has chosen not to disclose the identity of the MP in the wife-beating claims. Labour sources denied the party had failed to act, saying the party leader’s office had taken ‘every opportunity’ to try to deal with the allegations.  We have been told that Labour has a backlog of 74 cases of anti-Semitism... but it could be as many as FIVE THOUSAND says JOHN MANN MP By John Mann, MP for Bassetlaw for The Mail on Sunday Like all Labour supporters, I want nothing more than for Labour to be returned to power.But to achieve that we need a leader who can be trusted to be Prime Minister.There is no doubt that the latest disclosures surrounding anti-Semitism in the party have damaged our leadership.I welcome Jeremy Corbyn’s apology for having endorsed a disgusting mural which showed Jewish bankers playing a Monopoly-style game on a board resting on the backs of bowed naked workers. But Mr Corbyn’s contrition is not enough. We were told last week that the party has a backlog of 74 cases of alleged anti-Semitism that are yet to be dealt with. But I have been told the problem is so widespread there could be anything from 2,000 to 5,000 claims of anti-Semitic behaviour. It is no exaggeration to say this issue has become a serious threat to our ability to present ourselves to the electorate as a party ready to run the country.But it is not too late for Mr Corbyn to redeem himself.The most egregious instances of anti-Semitism in Labour have involved Ken Livingstone, who said Hitler supported Zionism.I have had one or two public confrontations with him over his views. In the eyes of many, Mr Livingstone embodies all that is deplorable about Labour anti-Semitism. Several complaints have been made against him but nothing gets resolved.          Comedian Eddie Izzard is replacing Christine Shawcroft on Labour\u0027s NECEddie Izzard first shot to fame in the early 1990s as a transvestite comedian who deployed distinctive stream-of-consciousness monologues on the stand-up circuit. His absurdist riffs frequently addressed his enjoyment of crossdressing and heels – and his own sexual leanings, which he has described as ‘straight transvestite’.His move into Labour politics came under Tony Blair: by 1998, Izzard had become one of the biggest private financial donors to the party, appearing in party political broadcasts and declaring his ambition to become an MP.He has also acted in films, including Ocean’s Twelve, and in 2009 completed 43 marathons in 51 days for Sport Relief.Izzard, who lost his mother to cancer when he was six, has said that he first realised he was a transgender person at the age of four when he watched another boy being forced to wear a dress by his sisters.                         "},{"url":"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5565737/Pippa-Middletons-laws-say-rape-claim-against-David-Matthews-outrageous-set-up.html","title":"Pippa Middleton\u0027s in-laws say rape claim made against David Matthews is an \u0027outrageous set-up\u0027","story":"    CHARGED: David Matthews, right, with daughter-in-law Pippa Middleton at her wedding to James Matthews, left, last yearIt is understood the complainant lives in London and once had close links to the £5,000-a-night Eden Rock Hotel, which Mr Matthews bought after visiting French-speaking St Barts in 1975.She lodged a complaint against the self-made businessman last year and he was arrested by child protection police at Orly airport after flying into Paris from the Caribbean last Tuesday.

At 19, he started selling cars door to door and, in his spare time, pursued his love of motor racing at the local track. He was ision champion in the British Touring Car Championships in 1971.His first marriage was to Anita Taylor, Britain’s first woman racing driver. They had a daughter, Nina, but orced three years later in 1969.

The son of a Yorkshire coal miner, he is a self-made man who enjoys the title Laird of Glen Affric (his 10,000-acre Scottish estate) and has homes in London, France and on St Barts.He started off working as an apprentice mechanic for his father, before taking up motor racing in his early 20s and marrying pioneering female racing driver, Anita Taylor, a renowned beauty and gossip column darling.Before splitting three years later, they had a daughter Nina, who now lives on Jersey with husband Adam Mackie, whose family electrical business is worth £456 million – more than the Middletons and Matthews combined. Their four children are Rosa, Tristan, Lily and Yasmina.Mr Matthews’ glamorous second wife Jane, 70, enjoyed a privileged childhood in Harare, capital of Zimbabwe. Sporty and popular, she was voted carnival queen at university and rode through the streets on a gold throne atop a motorised float.At 21, she graduated in Fine Art and won a scholarship to the Rijks Academy in Amsterdam. When her ferry stopped in England, she hopped off on a whim and ended up staying for good.It was then she met David Matthews, recently orced, who had spotted an old photograph of her in a yearbook belonging to his sister-in-law. They married in the early 1970s, a low-key register office affair to which Jane wore an old brown sweater and a skirt. A celebration in Zimbabwe followed, where her bohemian father turned up two hours late, riding a donkey.If Spencer inherited her wild streak, then James – whom Pippa Middleton married in May last year – is the steady one.

And, oh, how the scene has changed. Take last week, when I went for dinner at an old haunt, Mildreds in Soho, which has a ‘no bookings policy’. (I’m thinking of bringing in my own ‘no smashed avocado policy’.)Despite it being a veggie diner and a wet Tuesday evening, I wasn’t shown to a table or even a stool at the bar, merely given a number, 43, which didn’t bode well. I was forced to ‘stand in ze queue outside’, jostled by pedestrians and circling Ubers, before finally making it under cover, where I had to stand for a further 40 minutes in difficult shoes.

I’ve only had three intimate partners in my life and am numb from learning that this cancer is usually transmitted through sexual contact and can lie dormant for decades. I remember a quotation from Churchill: ‘When you’re going through hell, keep going.’Nurse Laura gives me a leaflet about possible side effects of chemotherapy, especially nausea.Later, back at home, Helen treats me to some Turkish delight. I wonder whether this sweet I adore will ever taste the same after my treatment.March 12On the first day of my treatment as an outpatient at Guy’s, I go up to the ‘Chemo Village’. Laura directs me to chair 28, my home for the next six hours. In the distance I can see my birthplace, near the Crystal Palace TV mast. I silently pray for a cure.At 2pm I’m hooked up to my final bag of fluid and then set off for radiotherapy. The mask I have to wear is really tight, like a straitjacket. I feel like I’m being throttled and my pulse is bursting in my neck.Helen comes to collect me. I just want to get back to the security of home. I ask if she has a plastic bag and silently pray: ‘Please God don’t make me sick this evening on a packed commuter train.’March 13At about 6.30am nausea sets in. I manage some tea and cornflakes, washing down seven types of pill as I eat. During my radiotherapy I have a minor panic attack which I manage to overcome. I try to gulp, which is impossible with the tightness of the mask. It’s impossible to open your eyes or your mouth properly.March 14Another sleepless night. I’m really nauseous with violent hiccups and a very dry throat.Two days before my diagnosis six weeks ago I was in the gym. I ran two miles that morning, I rowed, cycled, lifted some weights and boxed a punch bag. My consultant told me on diagnosis that I had to stop going to the gym immediately and focus on putting weight on to combat future loss from the treatment. Now I am 21 lb heavier. Fitness: another loss.After treatment I meet Specialist Nurse Tina. She says 80 per cent of people my age have been exposed to HPV, and no one knows what causes the cancer to grow from its dormant state. She mentions the campaign to get our boys vaccinated. This cancer can be wiped out. In the bathroom mirror I notice my neck is already reddening.          Pictured is the medication Paul has been taking during his treatment periodMarch 15I got up three times in the night to gargle with bicarbonate of soda and salt – akin to having a sweaty sock rinsed out in your mouth.The pills are making me really constipated and bloated. The train to Guy’s is packed with schoolchildren and there’s nowhere to sit. I’m hot, sweaty, and in a panic. Pride prevents me from asking someone to move. When ladies are pregnant they can now wear visible badges: perhaps cancer patients should wear something similar.On the train home I fall asleep and nearly miss my stop. Later I go public on Facebook about my illness. I’m overwhelmed by the response – more than 150 messages from family and footballing friends, along with phone calls. It’s good to feel loved.March 16Today I have to start injecting myself with Filgrastim into my stomach to produce more white blood cells. I waste the first syringe on the lounge carpet. The second goes in easily. After breakfast I try a couple of minutes on the exercise bike and I’m shocked at my level of fatigue. There’s no energy in me.After getting home I nap all afternoon. I wake at about 7pm, determined to enjoy fish and chips. By 7.30 I’m fast asleep again.Please God, give me my life back. The physical pain is doubled by so many other losses, personal and emotional.March 17It’s snowing. I wish I could go for a walk, but I sleep most of the morning. The constipation is agony. I have ringing in my left ear and my throat has almost closed completely.March 19I’m so tired with very little appetite, extremely dry mouth and throat and I’m struggling with any type of drink. I love tea and now it tastes of nothing. I worry as I must keep up my fluids. I wrap myself in a blanket and sleep until after midday.March 20Up most of the night. I have no idea what to drink as everything tastes the same. Today I chat to a fellow sufferer Jenny whose mouth cancer means she has had to have grafts to make a new cheek. I’m humbled by her positive attitude.                             I feel as if I\u0027ve lost my life, the things I love. I feel useless...                          I tell her my routine to get through radiotherapy: prayer and inner chanting. We discover we both use imagery to take us off to a distant land to escape our own reality.March 21I try Rice Krispies and find them indigestible. At lunchtime I make tomato soup with bread and butter and this, too, is unpalatable. Food has become intolerable. At the hospital I’m told to adopt swallowing exercises, as my throat muscles will now be used less and less. The dietician says I should try ice cream, but it tastes like cardboard, too, just cold cardboard. Perhaps the feeding tube will be needed sooner rather than later.Ulcers are appearing in my throat and I’m prescribed liquid morphine. I really struggle with my evening meal and have to get up several times during the night due to skin peeling from the roof of my mouth.March 22My tongue is permanently stinging and it feels as if I have a ball of wool lodged in my throat. My psychologist says I should view food as medicine. I wish I could eat the meals Helen cooks with so much care. I’m gagging from dryness in my throat. My tongue and palate are on fire. Helen nags me to go through the swallowing exercises and I comply.          Paul described this mask as a straight jacket which made it difficult to breathe March 23My dad insists he is coming with me to hospital. He used to find it difficult to express his love physically but in the past three months he has kissed me so many times. He tells me he loves me all the time. Thanks dad, I love you, too.Waiting for radiotherapy I talk to a chap with a nasogastric feeding tube. I ask him about the discomfort and he says he won’t say much, so as not to frighten me.March 24By far the worst night to date. My mouth is completely ulcerated and has closed up, my lips are swollen, I can’t talk properly and blood oozes from my mouth. The stinging is intense. At 2am I’m in so much pain I uncap the morphine bottle for the first time.I return to bed hoping this gives instant relief. It doesn’t. At last I drop off and wake at about 7am. The pain is returning with a vengeance. By 8am I’m on fire again.March 25I feel paralysed with pain and fear. I’ve got weeks to go but I’ve been knocked down. It’s hard to speak. My weight is falling marginally every day. I can’t get a toothbrush in my mouth as my gums are so sensitive. In the early hours I spoon in the morphine but again no relief.

But although girls aged 12 and 13 have been vaccinated on the NHS since 2008, because it also causes cervical cancer, vaccinating boys is not considered ‘cost-effective’.\u0027If I\u0027d of had the same jabs as girls get I\u0027d have avoided...Share this articleThe vaccine, which costs less than £40 for a two-dose course, grants total protection, and our campaign is backed by health organisations and cancer specialists. MPs from all parties support our campaign.          The Health Secretary is facing fresh calls to start vaccinating teenage boys against human papilloma virus (HPV)Labour Shadow Health Minister Sharon Hodgson said the NHS ‘must go further to include all adolescent boys so that, like their female peers, they can be protected’. Tory MP Sir Paul Beresford, who practices as a dentist, said he was ‘appalled’ by the failure to immunise boys: ‘It is not fair, ethical, or socially responsible to have a public health policy that leaves 50 per cent of the population vulnerable to HPV and head and neck cancer.’Minutes of a meeting in February by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation – the NHS committee which guides vaccine policy – reveal signs of a policy shift. Describing the committee’s previous ruling that vaccinating boys is not cost-effective as only ‘borderline’, the minutes say the DoH will now allow it to alter the basis of the computer model that led to its previous decision.They also mention a pending High Court judicial review, which will be launched by the Throat Cancer Foundation if the committee does not change its mind, on grounds of gender discrimination. Before it makes a final decision, the minutes say, the committee will seek legal advice as to whether denying boys the vaccine is lawful.Commenting on the apparent shift in policy, Public Health England’s Mary Ramsay said that, although vaccinating boys had not been seen as cost effective, ‘updated results are closer to the threshold of cost-effectiveness’. Therefore the committee ‘decided it would be reasonable to refine the models further’. "},{"url":"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5566391/How-seven-ancient-ruins-world-look-like-reconstructed.html","title":"How seven ancient ruins around the world would look like if they were reconstructed","story":"The Parthenon, when first constructed, was made completely of marble and had 92 colorful rectangular panels near the top (left). Today, the colors have faded and the roof makes the temple appear to be an open space (right)Located in Athens, Greece, atop the Acropolis, the Parthenon was dedicated to the goddess of wisdom, Athena.  The temple\u0027s construction began in 447 BC and it was completed in 438 BC.
