[{"url":null,"title":"Prince Harry receives backlash social media telling people meditate day","story":"  \u0027I love this convo about coaching\u0027: Harry\u0027s woke guidance to businessAlexi Robichaux, CEO of BetterUp: \u0027As I mentioned before I couldn\u0027t be more excited to host this first ever public Inner Work day with Prince Harry.... \u0027Harry I\u0027d love to start with your journey in mental fitness, you\u0027ve been with BetterUp for a little over a year now, and you\u0027ve been even before your time here one of the loudest and bravest advocates for mental fitness around the world. \u0027Can you talk about investing in yourself not just on the outside with your physical fitness but actually relate it to your own resilience and these internal strengths and resources?\u0027Prince Harry:  \u0027Thanks Alexi I\u0027d love to start by saying the intro you had there was amazing. I think what most people watching or listening to this will question is \u0027\u0027what about my time?\u0027\u0027\u0027\u0027\u0027Those are all amazing things, I would simply love to do them but I don\u0027t have enough time in the day\u0027\u0027. \u0027The distractions of life, whether you\u0027ve got work complications or every element of our life becomes busier and busier and busier. Then add on top of that, the attention economy of media, social media, pulling you in all sorts of different directions as well, again it goes back to everything you said. \u0027Most people will sit there and listen and think that\u0027s fantastic but I don\u0027t have the time. Well the good thing is, you can make time. \u0027And if you don\u0027t have time then you probably need to make time even more. I, similar to you Alexi, experienced burnout and throughout that burnout literally getting to the very end of everything I had. \u0027I was burning the candle at both ends. And just went boom. And that is when you are forced to look inside yourself. Because with everything else around you you feel as though it\u0027s working against you but the only way you can really combat it, the only way you can build resilience for the outside world and your entire environment is the inner work. \u0027Because if you work out how and why you react to certain people, certain situations you can gain control of those situations. Doesn\u0027t mean they\u0027re not gonna happen, it means that your reaction to them is more in your control.Mr Robichaux: \u0027I think that\u0027s so profound Harry, and I\u0027m glad you mention this point of time. Could you share a little bit more about what that experience and journey has been like for you and what are some ways you\u0027ve seen success in investing in your mental fitness?\u0027Prince Harry: \u0027It has to start from yourself. This idea that you can somehow find mental fitness from other people. Yes, as a team you can certainly encourage each other but it starts at home and it starts internally. \u0027And the effect that has for yourself and reaching your own peak performance but also the people around you and if you\u0027re a business leader then also your employees as well, to go \u0027\u0027you know what everyone\u0027s gonna have today focusing on themselves\u0027\u0027. \u0027That doesn\u0027t mean that necessarily everyone\u0027s going to take them up on that offer but as I said at the beginning everyone has such busy days anyway that even if you do have that 15 min slate of white space...\u0027By the way I now put in about half an hour or 45 minutes in the morning when it\u0027s like \u0027\u0027okay one of the kids has gone to school the other one\u0027s taking a nap right there\u0027s a break in our programme\u0027\u0027.  \u0027It\u0027s either for workout, to take the dog for a walk - get out in nature. Maybe meditate, I know that I need to mediate every single day. I would hope that everybody would be able to do that but the reality is that once your time starts slipping away and once you have other commitments in your day or you need to be there to show up for other people, guess what, the self care is the first thing that drops away. \u0027And I\u0027m happy to admit that as a husband, dad, someone\u0027s who\u0027s starting up a business but then think about the single dads, single mums you just don\u0027t have the time to be able to do that. \u0027So yes I think the point here is that when it comes to mental fitness it\u0027s the pinnacle, it\u0027s what you\u0027re aiming for and the road towards that can be really bumpy, it\u0027s called inner work for a reason. \u0027And I think that immediately might put some people off. Going \u0027\u0027more work?\u0027\u0027 But the outer work becomes so much easier once you get to grips with the inner work and then everything starts to fall into place.\u0027\u0027Serena Williams: \u0027Do you find that that work that you do on yourself, because you know I\u0027m still learning, is that like an everyday thing or is this like a few times a week? \u0027I know how much nervous system is gonna react to certain situations that are out of my control. What can I do, what have I got in my toolbox that I know works for me? \u0027What is readily available and it\u0027s different for every single person...\u0027You\u0027ve got to put it in like just as much as brushing your teeth every morning it\u0027s got to be straight after something that\u0027s already in your day diary of this is a habit, I need to make it a habit. \u0027If it\u0027s not a habit then it\u0027s the first thing that drops away from your busy day.\u0027 \u0027Life is about learning, right. If you\u0027re in your 20s, your 30s, your 40s and even your 50s and you think that you\u0027ve got it sorted, then bad stuff\u0027s gonna happen. \u0027There\u0027s a lesson here, there\u0027s a lesson. I\u0027m being schooled by the universe. There\u0027s something in this for me to learn so that next time this happens I become more resilient or being able to see a way around it to be able to achieve the ultimate goal. \u0027And if you have that perspective then every single bad thing that happens, actually can be good.\u0027 Mr Robichaux: \u0027You know one reason we\u0027re doing this with companies is around this matter of what we were talking about is we need to reframe inner work as part of the job. Harry I\u0027m curious, what does that bring up to you? You\u0027re building a business, you\u0027re an entrepreneur, how do you think about this?\u0027Prince Harry: \u0027From an employer perspective you can\u0027t expect in today\u0027s world your people to put in the work on themselves when you\u0027re not giving them the time to be able to do that. \u0027Which is why I think it\u0027s so important as employers going \u0027\u0027you know what, if you wanna be able to do, if you have the chance to be able to do it in your own spare time, that\u0027s fantastic we fully support you. But we are going to factor that in to your routine at work\u0027\u0027. \u0027If everybody was doing that, the shift in global consciousness and awareness and self awareness would be enormous, would be vast. Again, the proof is in the pudding. \u0027Look at these companies that signed up or that had a BetterUp coaches for the last however many years and the numbers speak for themselves. The employees their potential their performance at work but also at home has increased tenfold in some cases. \u0027So not only are they better at work, therefore as an employer \u0027\u0027you\u0027re welcome, you\u0027re getting more out of me than you thought you would\u0027\u0027 but also you\u0027re creating more capacity and more ability for those iniduals when they go home to show up and be the person they need to be for their friends and their community. \u0027To be the parent they need to be for their kids. So it is one whole cycle of connectivity that ultimately means everybody around you starts to benefit. That\u0027s the way I see it.\u0027Mr Robichaux: \u0027I think that\u0027s so well said. What\u0027s your experience been with coaching?\u0027Prince Harry: \u0027To have someone there who\u0027s not only coaching you through life but as part of that is challenging your perspective. \u0027That\u0027s what I ask from my BetterUp coach on a weekly basis. I can\u0027t wait for BetterUp to be in that position to be able to make it even more accessible for people so that every single person anywhere around the world had access to a BetterUp coach and you know the biggest challenge we\u0027re gonna have is finding enough coaches. \u0027Because the demand is there, the need is there. The need\u0027s not gonna go away guys, we know that. The world\u0027s becoming harder and harder and more complicated and that\u0027s just an observation. \u0027I think people are gonna need to rely on each other and on professional help but also friends, family, maybe complete strangers. Anyone can actually help you in that coaching process. \u0027To be able to have different points of view in your life and friends who will not worry about pushing back on things that you say or things that you feel to be able to make you, well not make, encourage you to be able to see it more clearly, I view that as trying to surround myself with people who I would happily have washing the windscreen and clearing those filters so that you can be able to see your own life and the reality of that life more clearly rather than this endless filter system of what you think is happening.Mr Robichaux: \u0027I love this conversation about coaching. Before we wrap is there any final advice or coaching you would share in relation to practicing mental fitness or investing in inner work?\u0027Prince Harry: \u0027Life is about discovery. In that discovery you\u0027re gonna find things that you don\u0027t like, that make you uncomfortable. \u0027You\u0027re gonna find things that are constantly pushing back on you but as you work your way around those things, all of a sudden all of the stresses and chaos and all the things that were working against you in your life. \u0027Be it private life, work life, whatever it is that work life balance, all of the things getting in your way either fall away or you visualise them and are able to turn a negative into a positive and therefore make those things work for you.\u0027And when you get to that point, from my perspective is feels like a superpower, but it takes time. It\u0027s constant, it\u0027s a work in progress. \u0027For me personally it\u0027s like constantly buffering. It\u0027s a work in progress, some days are great some days are really hard. \u0027And no matter what I put into it I am always kicking myself going \u0027\u0027if you\u0027d done this this this which you know works for you, then you wouldn\u0027t be in this state now\u0027\u0027. \u0027So again it\u0027s work but out of all the work we do and all the things we work towards, it is the most fulfilling work apart from being a dad.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Boris appoints Steve Barclay Chief Staff ex GB News journo Guto Harri director comms","story":"Share this article In his intervention, Mr Gibb said Mr Bell had been \u0027brave\u0027 and \u0027struck a chord\u0027.He wrote: \u0027He expressed the anger and frustration of millions at rule-breaking by those most responsible for making the rules.\u0027He was not a fool for sticking by those rules. But, whether inadvertently or not, behaviour by people at the heart of government suggests that they think he was - or worse still, that the rules don\u0027t apply to them.\u0027He said his constituents were \u0027furious about the double standards\u0027.Mr Gibb said: \u0027The Prime Minister accepted the resignation of Allegra Stratton for joking about a Christmas party that she hadn\u0027t attended, but he won\u0027t take responsibility for those that he did attend.\u0027I am sorry to say that it is hard to see how it can be the case that the Prime Minister told the truth.\u0027Other Tory MPs are expected to consider over the weekend whether to write to the chairman of the 1922 Committee Sir Graham in an attempt to force a leadership contest.In an apparent move to head off further dissent, Mr Johnson has written to Tory MPs promising them a greater role in policymaking with a \u0027direct line\u0027 into No 10.The latest turmoil was triggered by the shock resignation on Thursday of Mr Johnson\u0027s long-standing policy chief Munira Mirza over his refusal to withdraw his \u0027scurrilous\u0027 accusation about Sir Keir.Speaking on Friday, Mr Javid indicated that he agreed with Chancellor Rishi Sunak, who said he would not have made those remarks.\u0027Keir Starmer, when he was running the DPP, did a good job and he should be respected for it. It is a tough job and he deserved absolute respect for that,\u0027 he told reporters.Mr Javid acknowledged Mr Johnson had subsequently \u0027clarified\u0027 his comments and insisted the Prime Minister still had his full support.However, his intervention will only fuel speculation over how much support the Prime Minister really enjoys from members of his top team.Ms Mirza\u0027s resignation was followed by the announcement that three more of the most senior figures in No 10 - chief of staff Dan Rosenfield, principal private secretary Martin Reynolds and director of communications Jack Doyle - were also leaving.The Prime Minister\u0027s official spokesperson said the departures had all been agreed before Ms Mirza tendered her resignation and that they were leaving by mutual consent.All three were to some extent implicated in the controversy over parties during lockdown.Mr Reynolds organised the notorious \u0027bring your own booze\u0027 event in the Downing Street garden while Mr Doyle was reportedly at at least one of the gatherings now under investigation by the police.While Mr Rosenfield did not join until after most of the events had taken place, he has been criticised over the Government\u0027s initial response to the report that there had been no breach of the rules.Boris Johnson\u0027s foes aim to bring him down with brutal weekend of \u0027deeply unpleasant\u0027 personal attacks on wife Carrie"},{"url":null,"title":"Whistleblowers accuse Instagram putting astronomical profits people","story":"Share this article \u0027I remember when people started getting paid to post,\u0027 recalls Cole Rise, who designed the original Instagram icon and seven of its filters.\u0027That idea quickly makes what you post a bit artificial. Where some people were doing full-on BMW ads - and it\u0027s not genuine to who they are as a person because I know that person, they don\u0027t drive a BMW.\u0027The core of Instagram, as I remember, it was just: Here\u0027s what\u0027s happening. But if what\u0027s happening is an ad, then there\u0027s an artificiality to it.\u0027 The following year, Facebook changed the chronological feed to an algorithmic one, enabling Instagram to target users with subjects in which they had shown an interest.By 2018, they had introduced tools to mute and filter followers, as well as notify them of bullying content. But the patch did not get to the root of the problem.\u0027If you want to understand why Instagram is the way it is, you have to understand how the algorithms have shaped it to be that way, said former Facebook responsible AI researcher Manish Raghavan.\u0027They are the result of people\u0027s choices. What Instagram is looking to do is keep you engaged in some way. This is slightly different from asking: What do you actually want to see?\u0027The human brain is not evolved to deal with social media. It isn\u0027t evolved to look at a screen all day and understand let\u0027s say that the thing that you\u0027re seeing on the other side of the screen isn\u0027t someone\u0027s real life.\u0027\u0027The algorithms are the most-opaque part of this whole system,\u0027 adds Messina. \u0027You can see the user behaviour, you can see sort of like the consequences of what happens as a result of being exposed to certain content, especially over and over again.\u0027But we don\u0027t necessarily understand - and some of the companies don\u0027t even understand - how content is targeted to different iniduals, what choices they made to go down certain paths. And that lack of awareness is where we\u0027re the most vulnerable.\u0027Hannah Ray, who worked at Instagram as a community manager for Europe, Middle East and Africa, recalls: \u0027There were things that we were aware of that we would feed back. Like, you know, the hashtag tag, #thinspo has just popped up and it should probably be banned.\u0027So those things would come up and then we\u0027d kind of jump on them and quickly figure out, like the best policy to do that. But you have to remember, that\u0027s alongside, loads of other firefighting issues that were popping up.\u0027I mean, daily, there were like new things coming up that I think are just part of like just how huge the platform was growing so quickly. It has gone from photography and art …to money…\u0027Facebook\u0027s struggle to improve its image was dealt a blow last year when American data analyst Frances Haugen, a former Facebook product manager, leaked thousands of the company\u0027s internal documents, revealing \u0027the conflicts of interest between what was good for the public and what was good for Facebook\u0027 and claiming the social media platform \u0027chose to optimise for its own interests, like making more money\u0027.Zuckerberg denied the allegations.Then, in October, she warned Parliament that Instagram may never be safe for schoolchildren the company\u0027s own research revealed that it turned them into addicts.The company allowed \u0027bullying to follow children home\u0027 to their bedrooms because they wanted them to get \u0027hooked\u0027 for the future of the platform,\u0027 she explained.Now, as the online safety bill, nicknamed the Nick Clegg law, after its vice-president for global affairs and communications, chugs slowly through Parliament – Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries is expected to outline shortly draconian penalties for tech firm bosses – Haugen, who worked for Facebook for two years, has warned that the App is \u0027one of the fundamental conflicts of our civilisation\u0027.\u0027The company\u0027s leadership knows how to make Facebook and Instagram safer,\u0027 she told BBC3. \u0027They have put their astronomical profits before people. We\u0027re facing one of the fundamental conflicts of our civilisation. Which is are we going to let algorithms rule us, or will people rule algorithms?\u0027This is just the beginning. And the thing that I think young people see is how intense the problems are because teenagers are killing themselves because of Instagram.\u0027I think the thing that\u0027s really important for people to understand is how Instagram differs from other social media platforms. Tik Tok is about performance. It\u0027s about doing fun things with your friends. Snapchat is about faces and augmented reality.\u0027You know, it\u0027s not actually you. It\u0027s you with a mask on. Facebook\u0027s internal research says that Instagram is about bodies and about social comparison. You know, it\u0027s seen as a little window into other people\u0027s lives and comparing like, what is your life like to theirs?\u0027According to Facebook\u0027s own research, 13 per cent of British teenagers, who thought about suicide, were driven by Instagram and one in three teenage girls think that the social media App gives them body image issues.Teenager Abby, 17, who lives in Newcastle with her mother Alyson and twin sister Jessica and is training to be a nurse, joined Instagram in 2016 and blames the App for her deteriorating mental health. She was hospitalised for self-harm in May 2021 and remains under supervised care.\u0027I probably wouldn\u0027t know what self-harm was if I didn\u0027t look on them accounts,\u0027 she said.\u0027I knew how long I had to stay under water to drown myself. I knew how many Paracetamol to take to kill myself. I knew how many minutes you\u0027d have to have something around your neck like a ligature.\u0027You\u0027d get added into groups and people would tell us to go kill myself and they\u0027d want to do it together. And they\u0027d want to video call together to self-harm together, which is just corrupt.\u0027Influencer Lauren Black blames the platform for her eating disorder. \u0027I was on Instagram like all the time,\u0027 she says. \u0027My screen time was like 13 hours a day. It was ridiculous. From the moment I woke up, to when I went to sleep, I\u0027d literally be scrolling….\u0027It\u0027s kind of no wonder that it had a negative effect on my mental health... All the images would be quite highly edited. I was comparing myself to this false person I was looking at and not really realising that that\u0027s what I was doing.\u0027I always used to use filters on Instagram, and I didn\u0027t realise how damaging they were and I always used to put like my pictures in Facetune and make my waist smaller than what it was.During Covid, I made friends with a neighbour and she\u0027d been through eating disorder recovery before she\u0027d been an inpatient. And she said: You\u0027re actually ill, you need to get help. Something clicked and I thought, you\u0027re right and I got help from there.\u0027I\u0027m literally a completely different person. Every single thing is different about me now because I\u0027ve been through so much therapy. My whole life has changed. I\u0027ve decided more recently to not edit any of my content.\u0027So, I just have it straight from my iPhone camera to Instagram not being touched. I don\u0027t want to add to the problem that is probably never going to go away by showing people this false image of myself.\u0027I feel a lot happier and healthier. I literally always smile, which I never really did before.\u0027 A Meta spokesperson said: \u0027People come to Instagram to express themselves, explore and connect. We spent approximately $5 billion on safety and security last year alone, and it continues to be our top priority.\u0027We work with experts to develop our rules, and to build features that help protect people and give them more control over their experience. We care deeply about this, and about making sure people feel good about the time they spent on Instagram.\u0027While we do, on the advice of experts, allow people to talk about their own experiences, we\u0027ve never allowed people to promote or glorify suicide or self-harm.\u0027We\u0027ve built sophisticated technology make it difficult for people to come across potentially harmful content, and to help us find and remove this content more quickly, and we\u0027re in discussions with regulators about bringing this technology to the UK.\u0027We do research so we can find problems and make changes. Our findings inform the changes we make. We want to be more open about the research we do.\u0027The research showed that on 11 of 12 wellbeing issues, teenage girls who said they struggled with the issues also said that Instagram had made them better than worse.\u0027Our policies are designed to help reduce societal pressure. We remove content that promotes miraculous claims about a diet or weight loss product, and we restrict content and ads promoting weight loss products or cosmetic procedures to people over 18.\u0027We\u0027ll also reject ads completely if they show unrealistic results, or encourage negative self-image to sell a product.\u0027The Instagram Effect airs on BBC3 Monday, February 7."},{"url":null,"title":"Boss gives 800 staff day International Womens Day","story":"Share this article Its UK boss, Simon Nicholson, said male employees were being encouraged to ‘support the women in their lives’ on the day. Mr Nicholson, a father of three, will walk with his wife as she completes a challenge to walk the equivalent of Land’s End to John O’Groats.He told The Mail on Sunday: ‘Women often put themselves at the back of the queue when it comes to looking after their health.

Originally from Kenya, Wafula is one of some 21,000 international students studying in Ireland, many of whom are struggling.He was elated when he won a scholarship to research a PhD in finance at University College Dublin (UCD) in September 2020. Looking back, he wasn’t prepared for the challenges that lay ahead. Every day is a struggle to make ends meet, he says.His first year of study was online due to Covid restrictions. After securing temporary housing, it took Wafula more than 10 months to find suitable accommodation for his family to come to Ireland.

He has worked as a tutor at the university, but his Stamp 2 visa limits him to work no more than 20 hours each week. His hours are precarious and he does not know if he will get any in the current semester.Meanwhile, his income is quickly swallowed up by his monthly rent (€1,100), electricity (€200) and daily commute (€18 a day).“It is practically impossible to live any life,” he says. “It becomes really hard to say you’re enjoying it.”Wafula admits experiencing mental health difficulties throughout his time here. “You have to put on a bold face, so your wife and kids don’t see that... I’m not enjoying the process, but maybe the outcome, which is getting a PhD and hopefully getting a job,” he says.Wafula wrote to UCD president Andrew Deeks in August, claiming international PhD students were “suffering in silence” and facing “systematic” discrimination during their time in Ireland.In a statement, UCD said international students receive an offer pack that references accommodation, the cost of living and visa advice. While the college generally has sufficient on-campus places for international students, it said that it does not currently have family accommodation.The university said PhD candidates have a student status and are deemed to be under full-time instruction, while scholarship holders are exempt from tax on their scholarship income.They are not normally employees, a spokesman said, and issues around employment are controlled by the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment.AbroadThe experiences of international students is raising wider questions around Ireland’s policy of attracting more and more students from abroad.While their higher fees are helping to plug holes in third-level funding, many international students argue that they are not being treating fairly and are not adequately warned about the cost of living or scarcity of accommodation.In Ireland, about 17,000 students from outside of the European Economic Area (EEA) are paying €10,000-€20,000 for their courses, though in some cases fees can be as high as €55,000.Most non-EEA students come from the US, China, India, Brazil, Canada and Saudi Arabia. Irish students pay a student contribution charge capped at €3,000.Bukky Adebowale, vice-president for equality and citizenship at the Union of Students in Ireland, says many international students feel they are treated as if they are cash-cows to prop up an under-funded third-level system. “They don’t feel heard,” says Adebowale.Bhumi Mehda, who is studying for a master’s in computer science, is one of them. She was required to have €40,000 in her bank account before being accepted into the State. On top of needing €25,600 for tuition fees at UCD, and after receiving some financial help from her parents, she took out a loan to finance the high cost of living in Ireland – but it still wasn’t enough.After arriving from India with her sister Jill at the end of the summer, she was met with the stark reality of Ireland’s housing crisis. Although they contacted 20-30 places a day, they struggled to find permanent accommodation. The sisters spent a month in temporary accommodation and were “freaking out” in fear of having no place to go.Less than 48 hours before they were due to leave their temporary accommodation, with no place to go, they finally secured a year-long tenancy agreement – but it didn’t come cheap. Bhumi, Jill and two friends now live close to Belfield campus in Dublin 4 and pay €2,500 a month for the two-bedroom house or €625 to share a bedroom far more than they budgeted.The  contacted all Irish universities to ask if they provide warnings to internationals regarding Ireland’s housing crisis prior to arrival. Many give general advice such as “book early” or tell students about “high demand” in the rental market. NUI Galway seems to go further than most by offering virtual “meet and greets” and information sessions for international students. The university also said it invites housing charity Threshold to provide accommodation guidance to incoming internationals.Bukky Adebowale of USI says the “honest truth” must be presented to internationals before coming to Ireland.Laura Harmon, executive director of the Irish Council for International Students, whose members include 30 higher-education institutions, says she does not think colleges are exploiting students. She argues that universities are following the national strategy on internationalising education in Ireland.But why aren’t students allowed to work more than 20 hours each week to cover their high costs? The Department of Justice, which issues their visas, maintains the sole reason for students being in the State is to study. The department said it must ensure students can survive on their own resources without relying on work.Plugging the gapThe move to “internationalise” higher education is Government policy. The Department of Education’s strategy in this area, due an update since 2020, aims to increase the economic output of these students from €819 million in 2014 to €1.15 billion by 2020 and increase the output of the English-language education sector by €200 million. The policy has been bearing fruit non-EEA students have more than doubled since 2011.The supply of lucrative international students has helped plug university finances in the years following the recession and, more recently, during the pandemic.Latest figures show Ireland’s main universities increased their student fee income in the first year of the pandemic at a time when most were confined to remote learning. No refunds were provided to international students neither were they entitled to the once-off €250 payment from the Government.“Maybe universities should not make so much money at the expense of people paying,” says Wafula.Minister for Higher Education Simon Harris is shortly expected to begin long-awaited action on the 2016 Cassells report, which aims to address key funding issues in the sector. International students like Wafula and Bhumi hope they won’t be left behind in the new vision for the sector.International students: in numbers17,000Estimated number of students from outside the European Economic Area studying in IrelandEstimated economic output generated from international studentsTuition fees for most international students"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"former td noel treacy remembered as passionate and energetic","story":"Late minister of state  Noel Treacy who died this week.Photograph: Eric Luke Former Fianna Fáil TD Noel Treacy was remembered at his funeral as a “once off, larger than life” figure, who fit many achievements into his 70 years of life. Joan Treacy Hogan, told mourners at St Michael’s Church, Gurteen, Ballinasloe, Co Galway that her father was a real people person, who had a keen memory for people’s names, faces and family connections. “His love of helping people is what made him interested in politics... he was passionate and energetic.”Mr Treacy died this week at the age of 70 after having cancer for 12 years.In a euolgy, Ms Treacy Hogan said he faced his illness with great bravery, according to his daughter. “He never complained and he never gave up.”She spoke of how he would call his wife “my darling Mary” when in hospital and said if he had to do it all again, he would marry her 100 times over. He was a Fianna Fáil TD for Galway East since a 1982 by-election until his retirement in 2011. He was the longest-serving minister of state, serving in 11 governmental departments in total. She said her father was born into a deep rooted republican family. He was very proud of his Gurteen roots, and his family said they were touched by the support they received from the community in the past few days. She described her father as a great orator, Mr Treacy was very passionate about the Irish language, Irish culture and GAA. He was heavily involved in his local and county club, according to his daughter. The former TD was also a gaeilgeoir, and was the first minister from Ireland to speak Irish at a meeting of the European Council.Ms Treacy Hogan said her father told her he was most proud of his involvement with the peace talks in Northern Ireland. In attendance at the funeral were Aide-de-camp for President Michael D. Higgins Colonel Brian Walsh,Taoiseach Micheál Martin, and former taoiseach Brian Cowen.The Taoiseach told mourners that Mr Treacy was a proud son of Galway and the west, and a proud Irishman whose life was defined by service. “His record of achievement was deep and of real substance.”He often had no interest in taking credit for his achievements, and he was “active in everything”, according to Mr Martin. Within a year of being elected TD, he was made a party spokesperson. He gave 29 years of service in the Dáil, making many contributions along the way, added Mr Martin. “He was always on top of his responsibilities, he treated everyone with respect, no matter what their position was.”Mr Martin said Mr Treacy was one of the best people with whom to share a department and he was a very warm, hospitable and collegial person. "},{"url":null,"title":"miriam lord and just like that golfgate is brought to a swift and sudden end","story":"Is that it?Eighteen months of “Golfgate” madness dismissed in four minutes by a no-nonsense judge in a Galway courtroom.Donie Cassidy, Noel Grealish and hoteliers John and James Sweeney must have been as surprised as everyone else at the speed with which the verdict was produced. As day three of holding forth in never-ending circles around the banqueting tables of a golf society dinner drew to a close, most observers expected proceedings to spill over into another day.Senator Michael McDowell SC had just completed an excruciatingly long closing argument (at one point we noted two people asleep in his vicinity) explaining why his client, TD Noel Grealish, had absolutely no case to answer.There were three other senior counsel ready and waiting to do the same.And then suddenly, after months and months of fury and fulmination and acres of newsprint and countless hours of angry back-and-forth across the airwaves, Judge Mary Fahy dismissed the case against Grealish in a few pithy sentences.“Absolutely no evidence to show he was one of the organisers” of the infamous Golfgate dinner in Connemara. “This is a criminal prosecution. I have a reasonable doubt.”It’s a pity judges don’t bang gavels in Irish courts because this would have been the perfect time for some legal percussion. Perhaps they’ll have a gavel in the movie.“So I have to dismiss the charges.”But she wasn’t finished yet.There would be no impassioned closing addresses from Colm Smyth, Eddie Walsh and Constance Cassidy, and all three of them imported at considerable expense from the Inner Bar in Dublin. There would be no grand stand to make on behalf of their clients, because Mary Fahy was in no mood to hang around. She had heard enough.“We have to admit – anyone listening to the case – that the evidence was most impressive,” she declared, singling out witnesses John Flaherty, former captain of the guard in Leinster House, and none other than Mr Justice Séamus Woulfe as being particularly impressive.“Responsible people” who wouldn’t have gone to a dinner if they didn’t feel comfortable or safe.Judge Fahy had no doubt that the defendants did everything they thought they could do to comply with the Covid restrictions.“And in my view they did comply – not in the court of public opinion but in the court of law, in my view, they did.”This was only going one way.“So I am dismissing the charges against all the defendants.”There were no cheers. No high-fiving.Misty-eyedNoel Grealish, who was captain of the Oireachtas Golf Society, was the first politician to emerge. He looked a little flushed and misty-eyed as he stood beside his solicitor and let him do the talking. His lawyer and Oireachtas colleague McDowell, who had just triumphantly talked the case to a conclusion, was beaming.Donie Cassidy (75), who had taken the whole episode very badly, was last to leave the courthouse, flanked by the members of the Westmeath legal massive who handled his case: his senior counsel Colm Smyth, junior counsel and former Labour TD Willie Penrose and solicitor JJ Mannion.In some ways, and after hearing three days of evidence, there was a certain inevitability to this whole sorry saga ending with an emotional Donie standing on the courthouse steps in the drizzle, quoting the words of his late, beloved mother: “The truth always wins in the end.”You knew he was upset because he forgot to thank the Minister for Justice for the use of the hall.A weight was gone off his shoulders and he was mightily relieved, but the strain was etched on his face as he remembered all the people who were lost to Covid and the “friends who lost their position in life” as a result of the controversy.Should he have held the dinner at all? “In hindsight, everyone would do something maybe differently.”A few hours earlier, he was in bits with worry.“What do you think? I don’t know what to think. The last two years, oh, I couldn’t begin to tell ya. There was no talking to them. No talking to them . . . How do you think it will go?”Donie the defendant, disconsolate at lunchtime and thinking he was facing into a fourth day in court. For somebody who had been living with the aftermath of the “Golfgate” furore for 18 months, he still seemed shocked by it all.ConsideredAfter the charges were dismissed, questions were asked about whether he should have organised the dinner. The Westmeath legal massive was having none of it as former Senator Cassidy considered his reply.“The court has ruled,” they muttered behind him. “The court has ruled.” And then they gently nudged their client towards the car.All the talk, all the legal argument forgotten in the shock delivery of the verdicts.Eoghan Cole BL, who argued the case for the DPP and the State, looked disconsolate as he left the building. He had put forward a spirited fight against a star team of legal big guns (and a Supreme Court judge who attended the golf beano giving the benefit of his wisdom on the matter from the witness box). And superb he was too, noted the judge on Thursday.Inspector Peter Conlon – he was the main Garda witness – was given a torrid time in the witness box. He stuck to his view that sticking a temporary partition wall down a room of over 80 people to ide them into two legally acceptable groups did not mean they were attending separate events, or in different rooms.“It’s my assertion that it is one room by virtue of two openings made in the partition,” he said in reply to Eddie Walsh’s cultured bellowing.There were discussions on what constitutes a multiple gathering and what is the definition of an organiser. Does a moveable partition make a moveable feast? How big a gap in the partition is acceptable? Is there a difference between mingling and intermingling? Why did nearly all the witnesses seem to be seated with their backs to the action?What exactly is a “three-shot fourball single stableford Champagne scramble competition”? Inspector Conlon was able to explain that to the court. Guards like playing golf. Barristers like boasting that they know nothing about it, as they did again on Thursday.MeanderingFor all his meandering, McDowell made some excellent points in his closing argument. Not least on the intriguing question of “someone in Dublin”, maybe in the DPP’s office, keen to prosecute some of the main movers in the golf outing because of the public outcry over it?“Doubtless somebody somewhere in Dublin decided that there was a public interest in showing the public that heads would roll . . . Doubtless somebody did that in order to assuage public opinion and anger.”This anger was compounded by people “thinking that 80 people had assembled in secret, more or less, abusing their status as members of the Oireachtas” in contravention of the rules. “That was the source of all that anger and recrimination and all the disastrous consequences that followed.”He reminded the court of the atmosphere at the time.The country nearly melted down with anger, quivered McDowell.It didn’t sound like a great night anyway. Former minister Dara Calleary, who had to resign over his attendance at the function, told how he was escorted to a table and told to stay there unless he needed to go to the toilet.After the decision, some of the victorious lawyers gathered in the opulent bar of the Hardiman Hotel on Eyre Square to have a celebratory drink, watch the six o’clock news and toast the partition.Is this the end of Golfgate?The ranks of The Vindicated may now be seeking reinstatement. RTÉ’s Sean O’Rourke has already expressed a desire “to be back on air”. Big Phil Hogan will be like a Cheshire Cat. And Dara Calleary will be eyeing a ministerial return when the next reshuffle happens.As for everyone else, you’ll have to ask all the people who cancelled weddings and other events at the time. If they had known they could have had all their guests in attendance if only they had thought of getting partitions. They won’t be too happy, even if they did the right thing.Judge Fahy may have closed her case, but the court of public opinion is still in session."},{"url":null,"title":"south africa hails covid milestone as vaccine factory set for fit out","story":"The NantSA facility, the future vaccine manufacturing campus in Brackengate, Cape Town: unless there is more equity in vaccination distribution, it could take years to inoculate enough Africans to bring the pandemic under control. Photograph: Gianluigi Guercia The large empty factory on Cape Town’s outskirts did not appear like a game-changer in Africa’s bid to overcome the unequal distribution of Covid-19 vaccines globally when unveiled by president Cyril Ramaphosa last month.Devoid of equipment and employees, the building located in the northern suburb of Brackenfell resembled a vacant warehouse rather than a state-of-the-art pharmaceutical production facility, which it will become by the end of 2022.Yet South Africa’s president assured reporters its development was “a milestone” in Africa’s ambitious drive to improve vaccine equity for its 54 countries, as it aims to make – from start to finish – second-generation Covid-19 shots for distribution across the continent by the end of this year.South Africa’s leader has been highly critical of the global rollout of Covid-19 vaccines to date, saying poorer nations are last in line while rich ones get preferential treatment from vaccine producers.Official World Health Organisation (WHO) statistics show that only about 8 per cent of Africa’s 1.3 billion population had been vaccinated against Covid-19 by the end of 2021, while many developed nations have inoculated more than 60 per cent of theirs.This has prompted many healthcare experts to warn that unless there is more equity in vaccination distribution, it could take years to inoculate enough Africans to bring the pandemic under control in a region where the current dominant Covid-19 variant – Omicron – was first identified. A billion dosesFive African nations have full, albeit small, vaccine manufacturing capabilities, according to the WHO. Other vaccine facilities across the continent primarily carry out a “fill and finish” role – meaning they load and package vaccines developed and mixed elsewhere. South Africa’s new vaccine production plant, which is being developed by the US-based biotech billionaire Patrick Soon-Shiong, aims to address this situation.Born and raised in South Africa, Soon-Shiong has established the company NantSA to work with the newly-launched Africa’s Access to Advanced Healthcare Coalition to produce a billion doses a year of his Covid-19 vaccine by 2025 in Brackenfell.The doctor-turned-entrepreneur’s new T-cell vaccine for Covid-19, which is being developed by his US-based company ImmunityBio Inc, is undergoing clinical trials in South Africa, Botswana, Australia and the US.There are high hopes for it, Soon-Shiong said at the Brackenfell launch, as it is designed to not only target the virus’s spike protein, like mRNA vaccines do. It also activates “killer” T-cells, a type of white blood cell that is an essential part of the immune system, to attack a nucleocapsid protein at the virus core that is crucial to its structural integrity.“An infected cell is the factory for Covid and killing these cells is the only way to get rid of this pandemic,” he said, adding: “We have developed this T-cell vaccine and we want to manufacture it in Africa, for Africa and export it to the world.”Knowledge transferThe goal is to use the ImmunityBio vaccine as a universal booster shot if it is approved by regulators in the US, EU and other countries, Soon-Shiong said.Last May, Soon-Shiong also committed an initial three billion rand (€175 million) to help facilitate the knowledge-transfer process and local capacity building in South Africa around the T-cell vaccine for Covid.Furthermore, ImmunityBio in collaboration with NantSA will provide the technology and expertise needed to manufacture this vaccine and others, as well as their ingredients. The production plant also aims to develop treatments for cancer, tuberculosis and HIVAids in the coming years.Safura Abdool Karim, a South African public health lawyer, believes that once the Brackenfell plant is up and running, it holds great potential to develop Africa’s pharmaceutical sector.“Building the capacity of local scientists is at this project’s core, so it bodes well for developing expertise here and facilitating vaccine equity for Africans. But the challenge is we are not privy to the nature of the technology and intellectual property transfer, so we will have to wait and see,” she said.However, Abdool Karim maintained Africa still faces a massive challenge in the next six to 12 months to get sufficient Covid-19 vaccines for its people.“Vaccine producers and developed countries need to provide more Covid-19 shots to Africa than they currently are. Vaccines are often shipped here close to their expiry dates even though they need to have at least a six-week shelf life.“They are also sent to African countries on very short notice with little detail of their storage needs provided in advance. So, although rich countries are not monopolising Covid-19 vaccines as much anymore, their approach to sharing with Africa still has the same effect,” she said.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress overshadowed by Putin crackdowns and confrontation with WestRussia\u0026rsquos land of the midnight sun said to have inspired creator of Chanel No. 5Atomic icebreakers and floating power plants to help Kremlin develop Arctic shipping routeMinority nations feel squeeze as Putin\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquopower vertical\u0026rsquo crushes republics\u0026rsquo autonomyHistory of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"young africans","story":"Tom Saater has a rags to riches story and a unique insight into Nigeria\u0026rsquos biggest cityIn one of the world\u0026rsquos most dangerous places to attend school, teachers lead lessons and the students comeAfrican country\u0026rsquos tech innovators call for international investment and domestic supportYoung Nigerians dance out onto world stage with pride, confidence and high ambitionWomen-led organisation aims to stop atrocities of dictatorship from reoccurringIn the Gambia, a flourishing comedy scene is used to convey serious messagesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"addicted enduring romance shipwreck","story":"It is one of the most famous shipwrecks in history – a 244-year-old mystery of the seabed, the search for which has tantalised archaeologists.So the news this week that Endeavour – Captain James Cook’s ship aboard which he landed on the east coast of Australia in 1770 – looks to have been found off Rhode Island in the US has thrilled me. And for good reason.In 1982, aged 22 and fresh from an archaeology degree, I joined a team of more than 500 ers excavating and raising the Mary Rose, Henry VIII’s warship, sunk in the Solent in 1545. Seeing the pictures of Endeavour in the murky waters of Newport Harbour, where in 1778 it was scuttled by the British during the American War of Independence, brought back a flood of precious memories.Many of the objects we found preserved in layers of silt, were real “wow” moments. But there was one that stood out: a very plain shovel, its blade, shaft and handle made out of a single piece of wood. I remember picking it out of the mud and thinking that the last person who touched it would have been a Tudor sailor. It was a really special feeling.But it’s not just the objects recovered which are important, it is the idea of rediscovering something that connects us to a different age and with different values from our own.Whether it’s Cook’s Endeavour, or the expedition that got underway from Cape Town this week to locate Ernest Shackleton’s steam yacht Endurance – crushed by the South Pole ice in 1915 and sunk 10,000ft below the surface – these are romantic quests. Both in the magic of relocating something once thought lost to the waves, and the act of searching itself a human endeavour that touches a part of us seeking connection to the past.Unlike so many other wrecks, the Mary Rose was a working ship when she capsized, so we discovered a cross-section of society preserved from a single moment in time rather like the Roman city of Pompeii, buried under volcanic ash. The word time capsule is overused – but that’s what it was.Will that be the case with Endeavour? Captain Cook wasn’t on board at the time, and the vessel was being used as a transport ship by British forces. When it was sunk to stop it falling into enemy hands, they most likely saved any valuables.But you would be surprised at what unexpected and revealing objects a wreck can offer up. Cook conducted experiments on Endeavour and used pioneering navigation techniques. What if an instrument he used were to resurface? What a story it would tell us.Even if nothing of the kind is found, locating Endeavour will give Australia a time to reflect on its history, for better or worse. Whatever one’s attitude to colonialism, it is a significant ship in the histories of many countries – which may help to explain the geopolitical row that has already broken out between Australia and the US, who had a 22-year partnership to search for the ship, over the timing of the announcement.Questions will now be asked about whether or not to raise it. But the hardest decision is not the how – or even the cost, which would be significant. Forty years ago, £2.3 million was needed to bring up the Mary Rose roughly £9 million in today’s money.The toughest issue is whether raising it can be justified. When the Mary Rose sank, more than 500 lives were lost. Some argued that they should have been left undisturbed – in their final resting place – as descendants of those drowned on the Titanic have insisted.But by deciding to bring the Mary Rose to the surface and placing her in a museum in Portsmouth, we believe we have created a testament to her crew. Our museum is dedicated to them.After all, we can’t all e to explore shipwrecks – nor would everyone want to. It was dark down there. I could hardly see the er working only six feet away from me. We only used our underwater lights occasionally because they were so expensive. To show the public the treasures we found was very special indeed.And there are new ways to do so. The quest to find the Endurance is being broadcast live on TikTok. Shackleton himself understood the importance of bringing the public along for the voyage and took with him a professional filmmaker in 1914. Even after the Endurance sank, he protected the footage.“When Shackleton was loading everything into lifeboats, he left his pocket watch behind,” says Dan Snow, the TV historian who is taking part in the search.“But he made damn sure that Frank Hurley’s reels went in that boat, because he realised that without documentary evidence of what they’ve been through, it would be difficult to engage the public’s enthusiasm.”Since the creation of the 2001 Unesco Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage, there has been an increasing feeling that we shouldn’t raise wrecks just because we can. There are other ways of celebrating history. Experts create highly accurate 3-D models, and virtual-reality displays. You can sail on full-size replicas there is a very good example of Endeavour itself in Australia.I sometimes reflect that there would be more of a question mark over raising the Mary Rose now than there was in the 1980s. But that doesn’t mean I have any regrets. It was raised so that the whole world could see it, rather than being the privilege of ers.Such heritage objects belong to us all, to inspire and increase human knowledge.

The bingo card from the past two decades looks utterly chaotic. Massive English country houses, anyone? Small, pathetic-looking dogs? Adopted children from the developing world? And that’s just Madonna.If anybody had “fully working farms with machinery, crops, livestock and agricultural advisers” as a prediction, though, I’d eat my flat cap. Yet, for some reason, that is where we are in early 2022: from DJs to television presenters, actors to musicians, the rich and famous are shunning the glitz and glamour and returning to the soil, hoe in hand, ready to till and sow for our benefit.Sort of. A few are giving it a go. Jeremy Clarkson and his 1,000 acres in Oxfordshire – fertile ground for his hit Amazon Prime series, if nothing else – is just the start. Now, the BBC has a series about the former Emmerdale actor and Strictly Come Dancing winner, Kelvin Fletcher, taking on 120 acres in the Peaks.There will soon be another new BBC series, this time featuring chef Marcus Wareing learning the ropes on his 65-acre smallholding in East Sussex. One episode includes an almost like-for-like reconstruction of a scene from Clarkson’s Farm, as Wareing struggles to control a tractor while under the supervision of an impressively patient local.Martin Clunes has a farm in Dorset. Paul O’Grady still has his farm in Kent. Jimi Mistry and Flavia Cacace, who met on Strictly in 2010, have a farm in North Devon. Matt Baker farmed in Hertfordshire, now he runs his family farm in County Durham. JB Gill, from the boy band JLS, farms turkeys in Sevenoaks. Dancing on Ice judge Jason Gardiner bought a farm in rural Portugal in lockdown.And those are only the British D-listers. Around the world, Oprah Winfrey, Russell Crowe, Reese Witherspoon, Amanda Seyfried, Zayn Malik, Chris Pratt, Martha Stewart and Yolanda Hadid all own working farms. And this week, the British superstar DJ Calvin Harris joined them, swapping his Hollywood lifestyle for 138 acres in Ibiza, where he is, we are reliably told, not afraid to get his “hands dirty”.Reportedly now Ibiza’s largest organic farmer, Harris, who is worth around £200m, employs farmers, chefs and growers to help him produce veg, eggs, wine and farm-to-table meals. To prove he is serious about the venture, he has grown a beard and bought several fleeces.Against the challenges of cheap food culture, a lack of industry newcomers, rapacious housing developers and myriad other issues, farming has long yearned for a saviour from its seemingly inexorable decline. Celebrities, meanwhile, have long yearned for something – anything, literally anything – they can be perceived as saving.But whether the marriage is a mutually beneficial one isn’t always obvious. Generally, one farmer tells me, “it depends if they actually farm it, or if they just use it as their playground”. This is a fair point: buying an existing farm and filling it with a veg garden, a couple of pet alpacas and 50 set-aside acres to rag a quad bike around with your old stag-do mates does little to help the struggling agricultural industry.Actually try and make a go of it, though, and hire an agricultural adviser or some help, and it could do. Better still, make a go of it and simultaneously launch a phenomenally successful TV series that is both entertaining and gently educational about the realities of land management, like Clarkson has done, and you could do farming a world of good.Those were the remarks last year of James Rebanks, perhaps Britain’s most famous farmer, thanks to his best-selling books about life as an upland sheep farmer in Cumbria. It was a broadside against the BBC, but also a tacit endorsement of celebrity intervention in agriculture – assuming the celebrity is realistic about it. (Famously, Clarkson says he made £140 profit from his farm, Diddly Squat, in 2020.)The total number of separate UK farm holdings declined by 35 per cent to just over 185,000 between 2005 and 2016, according to Eurostat. The average age of a farmer sits squarely around 60. Celebrities – even Instagram influencers, despite filtering out much of the toil – might help the idea become a little more appealing to newcomers.The UK’s biggest inidual farmer is arguably the billionaire Sir James Dyson, who has hoovered (sorry, vacuumed…) approximately 36,000 acres in recent years. I visited his high-tech Lincolnshire place with him once he was passionate and fascinated with it all, but in his designer chinos and trademark round spectacles, he looked a little like a tourist.Inadvertent saviours boosting an industry in dire need of support, then, or rich, tax-evading farm blockers making it harder than ever for our country economies to survive? If we know anything about celebrities, the answer doesn’t matter. They’ll be buying something else soon, anyway.More from NewsDefund the police?

(Meir) is a very important person in Israeli history, she said.I said, \u0027Look Guy, I\u0027m not Jewish, and if you want to think about that, and decide to go in a different direction, no hard feelings. I will absolutely understand\u0027.However, she also added that this approach to casting raises other questions too, saying: You know, if someone who\u0027s not Jewish can\u0027t play Jewish, does someone who\u0027s Jewish play someone who\u0027s not Jewish?Dame Maureen has previously claimed that the challenge of acting was to become the character you are playing regardless of background.But Speaking on ITV\u0027s Good Morning Britain she said that actors who shared the background of their character should be looked at first.On the portrayal of Meir specifically she highlighted that the Jewishness of the character is so integral and added that if the religion fires the character, then actors from that religious group should be considered first.Responding to Dame Maureen\u0027s criticism, Mirren said: \u0027I do believe it is a discussion that has to be had - it\u0027s utterly legitimate.I very much respect Maureen. And I love her as an actress, absolutely.I\u0027d love to bump into her and sit and have a cup of tea and talk about it,\u0027 she added. Dame to dame, I suggest.She added: \u0027My only real fear is if I\u0027m really bad as Golda...in which case, I\u0027ll be toast.More from NewsDefund the police?

The Pope has issued warnings about the tendency of neo-traditionalism among younger clergy, telling fellow Jesuits in Africa in 2019: “Have you never seen young priests all stiff in black cassocks and hats in the shape of the planet Saturn on their heads? Behind all the rigid clericalism there are serious problems.”These new guidelines will prevent a priest from offering sacraments in the old rite without permission.As a result, churches in England are cancelling their Latin confirmation services. Joseph Shaw, chairman of the Latin Mass Society, told The : “They’re not stopping it because it\u0027s not popular, they\u0027re stopping it because it is popular and that worries them - because it’s not what they’re used to.“They’ve spent their lives using the reformed liturgy, and essentially have devoted their lives to pushing a mistake. That’s a painful thing to admit. Young people like traditional mass, it has perennial value and a more classic style.”Latin Mass is a Roman Catholic Mass celebrated in ecclesiastical Latin. While the liturgy is in Latin, sermons are permitted in the local vernacular.Preparations for around 20 confirmations in the Extraordinary Form of the Roman Rite were scheduled to take place at the Birmingham Oratory in February and more than 40 were expected to be conferred at St James’ Church, Spanish Place, London, in June.However, all of them have been cancelled after the Responsa ad dubia, published in December by the Congregation for Divine Worship, which suggested that Old Rite liturgies were impermissible.The crackdown by the Vatican was intended to halt possible isions within the Church following the growing popularity of the Old Rite - particularly among young people and families, with one senior official claiming devotion to the Latin Mass had become a movement that was “out of control”.However, priests who continue to offer Mass in both the Ordinary and Extraordinary Forms said the move has alienated many of the faithful, leaving them “bewildered and flummoxed” and failing to grasp why they were being punished.“Everybody is very disappointed,” one priest told the Catholic Herald. “People can’t understand it. It is a monumental failure of not listening and not caring. This seems to be just a slap in the face.”“Pope Benedict achieved peace in this area,” he continued, “but now war has been declared and nobody quite understands why.”A spokesperson for the Catholic Bishops\u0027 Conference of England and Wales, said: “Pope Francis is presiding over a reform in the broadest sense. This reform is examining every area of administration and practice.“Traditionis Custodes and any Responses attendant to it are the context of the thirty-sixth of thirty-seven specific ‘motu proprios’ promulgated during this papacy so far. They reform the universal law of the Church.“These ‘motu proprios’ cover any number of subjects in the life of the Church, including matters affecting the Sacred Liturgy.“Liturgical celebrations in Latin are not the issue. Sacraments celebrated by bishops, priests and deacons are to be celebrated according to normative law, using the liturgical books of Pope St Paul VI and Pope St John Paul II.”More from NewsDefund the police?

normally a prime location for promotions - which instead were stocking lower-sugar drinks such as coconut water as well as some fruit juices.The move has been welcomed by obesity campaigners, and comes after years of criticism that the layout of supermarkets is sometimes designed to encourage unhealthy purchases.They said the success of the initiative would depend significantly on the clarity of the signage.Bryan Roberts, a retail analyst at Shopfloor Insights, said he expected Tesco to follow up by introducing HFSS-compliant bays to their chilled and frozen sections in the coming weeks.He said that the changes meant customers would initially find the layout of stores unfamiliar, with items like toilet roll, kitchen towel and cleaning products at aisle ends where previously there would have been crisps.The first batch of HFSS legislation covering in-store and online promotions is set to come into force in October.Conservative peers alongside food industry and advertising bosses have recently called for the pre-9pm watershed ban for HFSS advertisements, due to come into force next January, to be put back by a year, arguing that the industry needs more time to prepare.The Prime Minister embraced the measures in 2020 after he nearly died from Covid, a virus which is more likely to kill people who are overweight.However, he has promised to listen to more backbenchers critical of the plans as part of his effort to shore up support among Tory backbenchers amid the \u0027partygate\u0027 scandal.But on Friday, Mr Javid stood by the plan. It came as the Health Secretary called for a long-term plan to tackle cancer, the risk of which can be significantly increased by poor diets.Tam Fry, from the National Obesity Forum, said: A bit of fat, sugar and salt in our food never did anyone real harm.As far as obesity is concerned, it\u0027s the excessive quantities of all three, plus the calories that go with them, that do the damage.The idea of having aisles whose products, I assume, will sport predominantly green traffic light labels is to be strongly welcomed.In the companies\u0027 larger stores the idea will lose some of its effectiveness if the aisles are not well signposted.A Tesco spokesperson said: We passionately believe that healthy, sustainably produced food should be accessible to everyone – whoever they are, wherever they live, whatever their budget.We welcome the Government’s ongoing focus on obesity and are working closely with them to understand the detail of the new legislation and to make sure we can implement the changes effectively and communicate the changes to customers.This process is ongoing and forms part of our wider strategic approach to healthy and sustainable diets, and the work we are doing to deliver against our health commitments.Christopher Snowdon, head of lifestyle economics at the Institute of Economic Affairs, says: Tesco and Sainsbury’s are experimenting with their store layouts and if customers like the new arrangement, the companies will benefit. I see no point in promoting essentials like toilet paper at the end of the aisle, but that is a matter for them. Either way, there is no need for government coercion.It is preposterous that the state is now dictating where shopkeepers can place their products. When Conservative MPs look back on their time in Government, many of them will wonder why they bothered.More from NewsDefund the police?

Now, more and more people are turning to itMembers of the Sheppey Support Bus Image: Adam Gerrard   Daily MirrorByEmily RetterSenior Feature Writer:,  Feb Updated:,  Feb |commentsIn the snaking queue for the Sheppey Support Bus people raise their hoods against the wind screaming off the Thames Estuary. Harsh winter sun throws tired under-eye shadows into sharp relief. These folk in Minster-on-Sea, on the Isle of Sheppey, Kent, are here to ask for help and that’s hard to stomach for many, embarrassing.Chantelle Stroud, , is out of electricity today. The stay-at-home mum of two under-fives and a teenager thankfully has £ on her gas meter due to a cold weather payment, administered when temperatures drop below  degrees.But without electricity, cooking is an issue. She’ll go to her mum’s. Her “big, old house”, a private rental, is “impossible to keep warm” anyway when you eke out gas. “I go to bed at six with the kids to keep warm,” she admits. “We have been ill for weeks and weeks, my eldest since before Christmas, the doctor says she has a problem with her lung. Her bedroom is freezing.” The innovative double decker bus, brainchild of Sheppey Community Development Forum, was launched in November to offer food support - a social supermarket on the lower deck - and fuel poverty support - offices on the upper deck - to the people of this deprived area. Up top sits Stevie Pettitt, a fuel and water adviser for Seashells, a local family charity, whose job is to arrange emergency fuel vouchers, supplied by Fuel Bank Foundation, to people unable to top up their gas and electricity prepayment meters. With an energy price cap rise of % in April announced by Ofgem this week, this is the frontline of Britain’s fuel poverty war.Here, Stevie stares desperation full in the face while multi-millionaire chancellor Rishi Sunak just tells us higher energy prices “are something we will have to adjust to.”He’ll have no idea what that truly means. The people here know full well about ‘adjusting’ following energy hikes last autumn - they are already skipping showers, turning off the gas so they can cook their children’s tea on electric cookers, going to bed early. And yet most say they still have either run out of electricity or gas, or have only a pound or two left. Stevie says: “I feel I am putting a sticking plaster over a gaping wound. It is heartbreaking, you can hear the devastation in their voices saying ‘I’m cold’.  “People will ask for food they don’t need to cook, they wear dressing gowns over their clothes, they make tea in flasks so they don’t use the kettle. “It’s got to the point where this is all I’m doing and nothing .” A commonplace message pings on her phone. It reads: “I’m so sorry to ask, but how many fuel vouchers are people entitled to  I’m really struggling with topping up my gas, we have been wanting to keep the three kiddies warm. I have been advised it will be switched off at am today. Could you help me please ” The limit is theoretically three a year - but Fuel Bank Foundation can’t be strict. Stevie will rush, but can only get her a voucher by tomorrow.  Ofgem’s announcement for most households means an annual bill increase of £ to £, a year. For those using prepayment meters, many in private rentals and social housing, that rise will be £ to £, on average. Sunak has offered a £ loan to families via energy companies, but this will need to be paid back over time. Also £ council tax rebates to those in bands A-D, but the Resolution Foundation has said one in  of the poorest th of families do not live in properties of these bands. This is also not due until October, when experts predict further energy cost rises.  It’s hard to comprehend what this will mean for folk on the bus, of whom all I meet rely on benefits and do not work, either due to ill-health, caring responsibilities, or struggle to find employment. The vouchers are worth £, originally designed to last ten days on average, but now barely scrape a week for many. From mid-November Stevie’s given out .

Fuel Bank Foundation has  centres across Britain handing out around  vouchers a day compared to - a year ago. Deborah Clay, , from Sheerness-on-Sea, the bus’s next stop, has been without gas since Christmas Eve. A former baker and confectioner battling bad health and living alone, she racked up energy debts so agreed to switch to a prepayment meter, paying off that debt incrementally from each top up. But on Christmas Eve when she put on £ for gas, there was a fault and it didn’t register. She had no more to add. Struggling to get hold of her energy supplier, out of minutes on her phone, she battled on with only electricity and then developed pneumonia. She’s been scared to put more money on and lose it.  Raspy with a chest infection, she begs for Stevie’s help. Her voucher will clear her debt and standing charge, which has been mounting even though she hasn’t been using gas. And the energy company, finally reached, knocks off the lost £. Today is a good day, but it’s firefighting. She calculates energy costs her around £ a fortnight, even scrimping, and without her debt.“I borrowed an electric one-bar fire and have slept on the settee,” she admits. “I’ve boiled the kettle to wash up, I shower maybe once a week, it sounds skanky. For cooking I’ve used the microwave and one ring on the cooker.” William and Susan Bunce resort to sitting in the dark. Susan, , cares for William, , who has had a mini stroke, angina, and recently suffered pleurisy twice. He feels the cold painfully. Diligent Susan puts £ on electricity and £ on gas each fortnight. It won’t reach the end of that time. An extra tenner from her carer’s allowance will usually be needed to carry them through. The heating comes on for half an hour in the morning and one hour at night in the living room only - “and some days not at all.”“We don’t sit with the lights on now,” she says. “There is street light outside.“We used to shower every day, now it’s twice a week. It does get me down sometimes.” The visitor that leaves us silent, is a mum in her twenties who asks not to be named because she fears judgement.She regularly chooses electricity over gas so she can feed her two children.Today she has around £ left on gas, £ on electricity. She is searching for work, her Universal Credit is not due until later this month.“I borrow from friends, it’s a constant loop of asking,” she says, eyes glassy with tears she won’t let fall. “I go for electric so we can eat, I have been without gas for a week. “As soon as the kids come home from school they put their dressing gowns on and sit with duvets. If it’s sunny I keep them outside running around, it’s warmer.”  Stevie is despairing. A voucher only gives “breathing space”. Matthew Cole, head of Fuel Bank Foundation, says Sunak’s measures “don’t go far enough for those who need them the most”, and wants additional targeted support. Before a pm deadline Stevie must rush to process the vouchers, responsibility weighing heavy. “The problems feel so huge, I can’t think of anything ,” she says.

How was this creature ever our Prime Minister  We will ask this in the same way someone might ponder “Why did I ever marry that Satanist  I should have had second thoughts when he gave me a birthday cake made out of a sacriced llama.” This week Boris Johnson answered a question about his illegal parties by accusing Keir Starmer of “failing to prosecute Jimmy Savile”. Next week he’ll say: “Furthermore Mr Speaker, Keir Starmer also failed to prosecute Osama bin Laden, Jack the Ripper, William the Conqueror, The Riddler, the shark in Jaws and The Daleks.”  That will be in answer to a question about photos of him at a Downing Street party, riding a pig naked with Vladimir Putin. His other strategy when he’s been caught at something is to announce a new project, to try to change the subject. In a few days he’ll tell us he’s going to build a bridge to the lost underwater city of Atlantis, and he’s changed the route of the HS railway to go there. He’ll add: “We have also set up an excellent trade deal with Basilea, Queen of the mermaids, which wouldn’t have been possiblewe were still in the European Union.” But this time it isn’t working.  One by one, his old colleagues are resigning, and making statements that go: “I cannot believe that the man who always lies has told a lie.” As his support disappears, everyone associated with him will leave. Eventually even the wallpaper he bought for £ a roll will peel itself off the wall and roll back to the interior designer, saying: “I can no longer have it on my conscience that I am decorating a wall looked at by this man.” Laura Kuenssberg will appear on the news saying: “This is a massive blow for the Prime Minister. Now the worry for Downing Street is that other furnishings may follow. There are rumours that one of the curtains is on the verge of resigning and two of his taps were seen leaving in a taxi this afternoon.”ClearoutEven now, Johnson tries to claim the staff who resigned didn’t resign – it was him who “cleared them out”. He’ll explain further: “They’ve left because they’re dead. They all exploded, so everything’s going to plan.” And he makes comments such as: “The British people are sick of hearing about how we lied and cheated about the parties we had through the ­lockdown. They want us to move on to lying and cheating about more important issues such as energy prices and Ukraine instead.” Now we’re in the crazy final days of a filthy empire, so anything can happen. There will be an interview with Nadine Dorries for BBC news, in which she writhes naked on the floor talking in tongues, which Jacob Rees-Mogg translates as “Boris is the truth, the light, praise be upon him.” In  years, children will read of these times and ask how they happened, and the finest minds of the day will answer: “I really have no idea.”Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Boris JohnsonKeir StarmerHouse of CommonsConservative PartyEuropean UnionJimmy SavileJacob Rees-MoggWilliam the conquerorVladimir PutinOsama bin LadenPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

A fth aide quit the Prime Minister’s inner circle, while a Conservative grandee said Mr Johnson had become toxic. Staff left over a mixture of Partygate and the Prime Minister’s response to it - when he first denied any parties took place, then lashed out, ly accusing Keir Starmer of failing to prosecute Jimmy Savile.While a lack of top aides will leave Boris Johnson vulnerable, it’s his MPs who decidehe will face a leadership contest.It takes  Tory opponents to trigger a vote of no confidence, and No has been furiously trying to stop that happening. A ‘shadow whipping operation’ is led by loyalist Conor Burns, the MP who claimed the PM was “ambushed by a cake”. And yesterday the PM wrote to restless MPs, promising to set up “backbench policy committees” to hear their concerns. The problem is, the anger on Tory benches is hard to measure or stop - because there’s not one single faction out to get the PM. As one MP told the Mirror, the PM has only “transaction friendships” - a situation that’s now left holes all over his armour. Those calling for the PM to quit are a scrappy assortment of veterans, new MPs, moderates and hardliners.  They were united only by wanting to win in  - and now, many are united only by wanting the Prime Minister out. Even within each “faction” opinions y massively - and by no means will all “members” ever call for the PM to quit. But here’s a very rough look at seven “types” of Tory MP that could spell trouble for the PM.  MPs - including the ‘Red Wall’More than  of Boris Johnson’s  MPs were newly-elected in the  landslide.Many of these were in the ‘Red Wall’ of former Labour heartlands in the Midlands and northern England.Most feel they owe their job to Boris Johnson due to his crushing election victory - but that loyalty is starting to fray. A ‘pork pie plot’ of around  ‘-ers’ - supposedly led by Melton’s MP Alicia Kearns - fizzled out, but could resurge.Newcastle-under-Lyme MP Aaron Bell suggested the PM treated him like a “fool” after he didn’t hug at his gran’s funeral.  Away from the ‘Red Wall’, Totnes -er Anthony Mangnall put in a letter savaging the PM’s “mistruths”. Many more -ers, including Chris Loder and Dehenna Davison, were said to be considering ousting the PM but haven’t publicly submitted a letter. If many moved at once, it could nudge them over the -letter threshold. Veterans who’ve nothing to loseMany of the prominent “topple Boris Johnson” headlines have come from long-serving MPs who dance to their own tune. Some, like -year veteran Sir Roger Gale, never had much love for the Prime Minister and are unlikely to move the dial. But a drip-drip of other ‘big beasts’ could embolden young MPs nervous about their careers to step over the clf-edge.Former ministers Andrew Mitchell, David Davis and Tim Loughton have all turned on the PM, with Mr Davis declaring at PMQs : “In the name of God, go.”Former Foreign Secretary Sir Malcolm Rkind is no longer an MP, but yesterday said Mr Johnson is now “toxic”.Ex-leader William Hague said the PM should be “worried”… and ex-PM Sir John Major is expected to make an intervention soon.Others who are able to speak their mindsSome MPs have not acquired grandee status, but have been around long enough - and not had ministerial jobs - that they care less about loyalty to the PM. Andrew Bridgen has submitted no confidence letters in Cameron and May, and now Johnson has joined the club too.Fellow -er Peter Aldous is no loyalist, campaigning to stop the £ Universal Credit cut, but no rowdy troublemaker either. He urged the PM to go “in the best interests of the country”.Sir Gary Streeter, an MP since  though never a minister, also urged the PM to quit because he “cannot reconcile the pain” of Brits with No parties. MPs who speak their minds are dangerous, because - just maybe - it reminds loyalists of what they’re really thinking deep down. Covid lockdown sceptics and the ‘awkward squad’The couple of dozen most ardent lockdown sceptics are less of a threat to the PM than they were, now rules are lted. But they will keep watch on the Prime Minister and are not afraid to cause him big troublethey think it’s needed. The same is true of a string of - often overlapping - Tory pressure groups. The Net Zero Scrutiny Group, for example, boasts lockdown sceptics Craig Mackinlay and Steve Baker and is fighting what it sees as counterproductive green policies. What’s most notable is that these groups contain more Tory MPs who are unafraid to speak their mind. Charles Walker, who said he “would applaud”Boris Johnson resigned, and William Wragg who revealed “blackmail” by Tory whips, were both in ‘awkward squads’ on Covid policy. One Nation Tories and moderatesThen there are Tory ‘moderates’, including some who chair Commons committees or belong to the formal ‘One Nation’ group. Committee chairs Tobias Ellwood and Caroline Nokes are among the most prominent to demand the PM’s exit. While not calling for the PM to quit, Foreign Affairs Committee chief Tom Tugendhat was the first to say he’d run as a new leader. Yesterday senior Tory Huw Merriman, who chairs the Transport Committee, said he was deeply troubled by the situation, and warned Mr Johnson to improve or leave Downing Street.  The One Nation caucus has a few dozen MPs and is led by ex-Cabinet minister Damian Green, who has kept his powder dry. Jeremy Hunt has not broken ranks either - even though he’s not ruled out running again as leader.Butother prominent moderates speak out, it would encourage more still. The irony is that shapeshter Boris Johnson was once considered a One Nation Tory, but has little affection from them now.Regional leadersWhile they have no direct no-confidence vote, regional leaders have powerful political influence on whether the PM should stay. West Midlands Mayor Andy Street has refused to say he still backs the PM, and warns he’s “waiting to see” how he’ll act. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross was one of the first to demand he quit, with ex-leader Ruth Davidson also hitting out. She was left in tears as she condemned Downing Street parties for “making a mockery” of the public’s sacrices.  Constituency parties make fewer headlines, but do have a direct line to the MP for their area - dripping through to Westminster. Some, such as North Oxfordshire, have already written to members in anger. If that was multiplied it would add to the pressure.Boris Johnsonaposs inner circleBoris Johnson’s Cabinet was dubbed a circle of “weak yes-men”by one disgruntled Tory speaking to the Mirror. But while somewill always defend him to the hilt, others have been a lot less keen to sing the PM’s praises. Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss are widely seen to be leadership frontrunners. They’ve spent months building up a quiet support base and, while supportive of the PM, phrase that support carefully.Mr Sunak said he “wouldn’t have said” the Jimmy Savile jibe, adding the Tories would be fiscally responsible “on my watch”. If one or two top Cabinet ministers resigned, that could be enough in itself to trigger  letters and a leadership process.  Then there are No staff. If they turn disloyal, they could either leak damaging information - or quit altogether. Policy adviser Elena Narozanski became the latest No official to walk out yesterday, following policy chief Munira Mirza. Three more aides quit in what No claimed was a mutually-agreed Partygate clearout: chief of staff Dan Rosenfield, communications director Jack Doyle and principal private secretary Martin Reynolds. While the three men appear likely to stay short-term, recruitment for Martin Reynolds’ replacement only began yesterday. That leaves the Prime Minister open to attack from one ‘faction’, all or none. As for whether anyone actually makes their move  We’ll just have to wait and see.

The Chancellor’s aides blamed a “typo” in a national newspaper column he wrote saying a colder than usual winter was one cause of imminent bill hikes. In fact this winter is warmer than usual.Mr Sunak, the wealthiest member of Boris Johnson ’s Cabinet, used his self-penned article to try to distance the Tories from the power crisis.He wrote: “There are a few factors causing energy prices to rise so dramatically and unfortunately they are mostly out of the Government’s control. One is the steep rise in demand for gas in places such as China, which has pushed up global prices. “Another is the fact that we have had a colder than usual winter so we have used up more of our own stores of gas here at home.” His team claim the typo was on the “colder winter” phrase. A web version of the column was changed after weather experts rubbished the claim. The Met Office said this winter’s temperature averages .C so far – .C warmer than over the three decades to .And Aurora Energy Research commodities head Anise Ganbold said: “On average, gas demand is % below the past four winters.”The GMB union’s national secretary Andy Prendergast last night said: “ Rishi Sunak is either hopelessly out of touch or deliberately misleading people.“We all know it’s a mild winter. The Chancellor needs to spend more time worrying about gas and less time gaslighting the nation.” Mr Sunak also wrote in his article that the factors he listed meant “on average, people will be seeing their energy bills rise by £”. The increase will start in April after the cap on energy prices was raised % by regulator Ofgem. Mr Sunak this week offered consumers £ off their bills from October in what was touted as a Government goodwill gesture. But it emerged the deal is simply a “buy now pay later” style loan that hard-pressed families must pay back over two years. Households in council tax bands A to D will get a one-off £ rebate in April. Charities say it is not enough and is not targeted at those who need it most. A Treasury spokesman said: “As the Chancellor set out, the reasons gas prices are soaring are global. “No country in western Europe has been unaffected by the unprecedented wholesale gas volatility. It is incorrect to suggest the UK is uniquely exposed to it.” Ex-Labour leader Ed Miliband branded Mr Sunak’s response to the energy price crisis “inadequate”. He said: “The Chancel-lor should have adopted Labour ’s plan for a windfall tax on oil and gas producers to help fund a support package for families.“Instead he chose to side with those companies making billions, not the millions facing hardship this winter.” Annual profits at energy giant Shell rose to £.billion. BP is expected next week to report a profit of almost £. billion. In  the Rough gas storage facility in the North Sea – Britain’s biggest – was shut because the Conservatives refused to subsidise repairs. Now the nation has storage for only % of need, leaving us reliant on supplies from Europe and Russia. Mr Sunak did not mention that the Tories were alerted at the time that closing Rough could lead to a power crisis. Amid rising fears over energy, the Bank of England has warned of a dramatic fall in living standards – with take-home pay suffering the biggest hit on record and inflation expected to top % in April. The gap between pay and living costs is growing due to soaring prices for energy, food and petrol, TUC analysis shows. Pay growth is down to .% on average, it found – with key workers who kept the UK going in the pandemic, such as transport and retail staff, even worse off. It said low pay will reduce consumer spending and further weaken the fragile economy, adding: “Britain needs a pay rise.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Labour PartyConservative PartyThe TreasuryEnergyEnergy billsGas pricesLiving standardsPoliticsSunday Mirror\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

It’s about taking back political control from local councils through metro mayors imposed by Whitehall. Nobody has asked for this revolution in local government – indeed, when asked, people voted against it.But the Tories ploughed ahead, and they intend to accelerate the process.The price for giving back half the money they’ve taken away from councils since  is to demand directly elected regional bosses. They think they can win those elections with candidates like ambitious, loud-mouthed Ben Houchen, mayor of the traditionally Labour area, Teesside. mayors have limited powers over transport and suchlike, but as Manchester’s Andy Burnham found during the pandemic, they are largely illusory. Westminster still rules.The combined voices of West and South Yorkshire mayors failed utterly to save the Leeds-Manchester Northern Powerhouse Rail route, or the HS high-speed rail link to London.Michael Gove, the Grovelling-Up-To-Boris Secretary, talks airily of better local transport. But the Tories have halved the “bus back better” fund.They wasted more money on unusable PPE in six months than they propose to give poorer regions in the years to , when this dog’s breakfast of a blueprint for Britain is designed to mature. Levelling up is a classic Conservative trick, to wrest back and retain control over millions of voters in provincial England. Scotland and Wales chose their own form of devolution. They don’t need or want these newfangled regional gaffers. The trick won’t work there.mayors are fake devolution. They get saddled with responsibility for things like buses they haven’t the money to put right, but no real powers to make le better for the people they are supposed to represent. Don’t be fooled. Kidsapos jabs going missing The understandable fixation with jabs for Covid has unwelcome side effects. The number of children having vaccinations against measles has dropped off, leaving one in  new kids in school without protection. Health chiefs fear an outbreak of this highly infectious, potentially deadly diseasethey’re not inoculated. This grim news comes as the Government does a screeching U-turn on mandatory Covid jabs for all NHS staff, on pain of dismissal. On balance, this is the right thing to do. But I fear the decision will strengthen the nutcase anti-vaxxers campaigning for an end to all jabs.Health Secretary Sajid Javid, who called off the sacking threat , has a big job restoring public faith in vaccination.Is he up to it  I wonder.  Break this spell Salford University students are warned that scenes in Charlotte Bronte’s Jane Eyre and Charles Dickens’ Great Expectations might upset them. Even more incredibly, at Chester University “trigger warnings” were issued about the risks of reading Harry Potter. Crazy. I spent much of my first year at university reading Russian novels such as Dostoevsky’s Crime and Punishment. They would give the little dears a nervous breakdown. But fiction that accurately reflects reality prepares you for le better than a whole library of woke warnings.

And she blamed the Prime Ministeraposs researchers and advisers for hoods Boris Johnson has said in Parliament, insisting he tells the truth to the best of his knowledge.The Culture Secretary appeared affronted when she was asked by host Charlie Stayt when she last spoke to Boris Johnson, whom sheaposd been sent on TV to defend. Asked when sheaposd last spoken to the Prime Minister, Ms Dorries shrugged, looked quizzically into her webcam, and replied: Why  During the exchange, Stayt said he was really confused, asking Ms Dorrieshis question was a dficult one. The presenter asked: Have you spoken to the Prime Minister recently, in the last  hours  After a brief pause, a smiling Ms Dorries replied: Why  Why are you asking me that question  Stayt replied: Iaposd like to know. Dorries simply said: Weaposve communicated.  Appearing perplexed, Stayt went on to say: Iaposm really confused. Is that a dficult question  Iaposm just askingyouaposve spoken to the Prime Minister, in the last  hours. Dorries repeated: We have communicated. Stayt went on to ask what Mr Johnson had communicated to her, but Ms Dorries declined to go into detail. She said: Iaposm not going to tell you the extent of my communications with the Prime Minister. I mean, Iaposve answered your question. We have communicated. What is your next question  When Stayt asked about the PMaposs mood, Dorries described it as very positive, extremely positive. Elsewhere in her media round, she mixed up two Tory MPs with the same surname, claimed % of Tory MPs back the PM and blamed remainer enemies for plotting against him. She admitted there are a number of reasons actually, itaposs not just one, but she said: That certainly is at play with a group.  However, out of the  Tory MPs who have so far publicly called on Boris Johnson to go, just seven of those had publicly backed remaining in the EU in the  referendum.One of those who has said the Prime Minister should go is David Davis, who served as Brexit Secretary, and another is strident Brexiteer Andrew Bridgen.But Ms Dorries told Times Radio: There are a small number of voices, whether they are people who were ardent supporters of Remain, who see this as their last opportunity to reverse Brexit. Ms Dorries was also forced to insist Mr Johnson tells the truth as the PM came under sustained pressure over the future of his premiership. She said Mr Johnson told the truth to the best of his knowledge based on what he was told by his aides. Challenged about a claim made by Mr Johnson in the Commons about the number of people in work before and after the pandemic, Ms Dorries told BBC Breakfast: He will have been given by advisers and researchers the fact that there were more people in work than there were at the beginning of the pandemic, not on the payroll. She said: So did he tell the truth when he quoted that  Yes, he told the truth as it was given to him. I can personally tell you that the Prime Minister, when he stands at the despatch box and makes quotes like the one you just quoted, is because the researchers and his advisers will have given him that quote, and thataposs... and he was truthful, to the best of his knowledge, when he made that quote, she said. She added: The Prime Minister does tell the truth.  Honesty was one of the key reasons former minister Nick Gibb said on Friday that he could no longer support the PM, and had submitted a letter of no confidence to Sir Graham Brady. Writing in The , Mr Gibb, MP for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, said his constituents were furious about the double standards and he said the Prime Minister had been inaccurate in statements to the Commons. He said: The Prime Minister accepted the resignation of Allegra Stratton for joking about a Christmas party that she hadnapost attended, but he wonapost take responsibility for those that he did attend. I am sorry to say that it is hard to see how it can be the case that the Prime Minister told the truth. The MP said: To restore trust, we need to change the Prime Minister. Backbencher Aaron Bellalso declared publicly he had submitted a letter calling for a vote of no confidence in his leader. John Glen, a Treasury minister and Salisbury MP, said the situation with No  was deeply uncomfortable, disappointing, and embarrassing. Writing in his local newspaper The Salisbury Journal, he did not call for the Prime Minister to resign but said: The culture in Number  fell short of what the country had a right to expect, and responsibility must be taken for the mistakes that were made. The interventions brought the number of Tory MPs who have now publicly called for Mr Johnson to resign to . Privately, the number is expected to be higher.  Mr Johnson also lost five No  aides in  hours on Thursday and Friday. But Ms Dorries insisted % of Conservative MPs were behind the Prime Minister.This included, she said, the Health Secretary following comments over the Prime Ministeraposs allegation that Sir Keir Starmer failed to prosecute Jimmy Savile. She said: I spoke to Sajid Javid last night and he reassured me that he is % behind the Prime Minister.In fact, I think heaposs quite shocked at how his comments have been interpreted.  Mr Javid said Sir Keir deserved absolute respect for the job he did as director of public prosecutions and that it was important that the Prime Minister claried his earlier accusation that Sir Keir had failed to prosecute Savile.Earlier, Chancellor Rishi Sunak had said he would not have made the comments.Ms Dorries said her Cabinet colleague was entitled to his views. Ms Dorries told BBC Radio aposs Today programme that anybody who leads an organisation, like the Prime Minister leads the Government or Keir Starmer led the Crown Prosecution Service, when something goes wrong, you take responsibility and you apologise. She said: Rishi Sunak is entitled to his views and you know, heaposs entitled to say... make any comments that he wants to. Ms Dorries was defending the Prime Minister as other Tory MPs are expected to consider over the weekend whether to write to the chairman of the  Committee Sir Graham in an attempt to force a leadership contest.Former minister Dr Liam Fox has said he is waiting to see what comes out of the full Sue Gray report into the partygate saga.Mr Johnson was facing fresh accusations on Saturday after The Mirror reported that the politan Police had been handed a photograph of Mr Johnson holding a beer at an alleged gathering in June  to mark the Prime Ministeraposs birthday.

Image: Getty ImagesByMikey SmithWhitehall Correspondent:,  Feb |comments Tens of thousands of pounds have been spent on Sue Gray’s party inquiry, the People has been told - as Boris Johnson scrambles to cling on to Downing Street.Some sources estimate the cost of the Partygate probe could be as high as £,. And up to £, more could be being splashed on the Met’s investigation into lockdown-busting parties in Downing Street, as police officers st through hundreds of photographs, CCTV images and other evidence. A senior former officer told the People last nightthe police have been left in a “no-win situation” over the politically-charged probe - and are “not the appropriate agency to deal with this.” A Cabinet Office source said no aposadditional public moneyapos had been spent on the Sue Gray inquiry. But several senior civil servants from the Propriety and Ethics unit have been devoting their working time to the probe for weeks.Asked by Deputy Labour Leader Angela Rayner to officially confirm the cost of the Sue Gray inquiry, Tory Cabinet Office Minister Michael Ellis refused.He said: The Government does not comment on internal resourcing matters.  Ms Rayner told the People: Time after time, taxpayers are paying the price for the Prime Ministeraposs personal failures. Boris Johnson could have saved so much time and expense by simply telling the truth in the first place, and now heaposs adding insult to injury by refusing to come clean on the costs. It would be an utter insultthis time and money was spent on an investigation that didnapost see the light of day. The Prime Minister cannot be allowed to break his promise to publish the report in full. Lib Dem Treasury Spokesperson Christine Jardine MP added: If Boris Johnson had just come clean and answered a simple question, taxpayeraposs cash could have been saved. Instead money that could have been spent helping people with their energy bills is being used to find out which Downing Street parties Boris Johnson attended. The whole situation is absurd. Ministers must publish the full Sue Gray report including any photos to prevent an expensive Whitehall whitewash. Tory MPs faced a weekend of soul-searching over whether to send letters of no-confidence in Boris Johnson’s leadership, following a chaotic “clear-out” of senior Downing Street staff and advisors. As many as  backbenchers from all wings of the party have publicly urged Mr Johnson to call time on his premiership. And sources suggested the total number of no-confidence letters sent to backbench chief Sir Graham Brady could be in the forties - just a handful away from triggering a vote. And the PM came under more pressure yesterdayas the Daily Mirror revealed police had been given a photograph of Mr Johnson holding a beer at a birthday party in Number , allegedly against lockdown rules. The birthday snap, taken by Andrew Parsons, one of Mr Johnson’s tax-funded vanity photographers, is understood to be among  photographs handed to the police by Sue Gray’s team. Peter Kirkham, a former Detective Chief Inspector with Scotland Yard, said a team of five to  officers sting through vast swathes of evidence over a period of weeks could cost in excess of £,.  He said the Met Police would be “torn” between carrying out a throrough investigation to avoid any “unexploded bombs”, while keeping the costs as low as possible. But he also said the scandal had left police chiefs in a dficult position because they faced being criticised for failing to investigate, while also being hammered for spending taxpayersapos cash. Mr Kirkham said: “This is why the police do not do reactive investigations of minor offences that are only going to lead to a fine. “Eventhese people get the full £, ticket, although most of them will not, the question is aposWhy are we spending all this money to achieve this apos “With other minor offences like speeding, we ask what are the justications for spending a shedload of money  Normally there isnapost one, to spend vast amounts of money like this. This isnapost murder, itaposs not got le imprisonment attached to it.” More than , violent crime offences were recorded in London in - - an increase of , in five years. Meanwhile, despite a promised £.bn increase in force budgets next year, police forces in England and Wales have struggled to cope with overall budget cuts of around % over the previous decade. “This is almost a political decision, the decision to investigate it is unusual, Mr Kirkham added. “Itaposs politically skewed because this is the Prime Minister, itaposs the heart of Government and it raises public interest issues.” Referring to the dficulties facing investigating officers and Met Police Commissioner Cressida Dick, Mr Kirkham said: “The police didnapost want this investigation in the first place but the Commissioner is in a no-win situation. “If she doesnapost spend the money she would be criticised for going at it half-cocked and aposhelping Boris off the hookapos, thataposs how it would be portrayed. “If she does spend the money and someone adds the costs up retrospectively, theyaposll say it cost us huge sums to achieve fines of a few hundred quid. She loses every time. “Thataposs why the police are not the appropriate agency to deal with this.” A Whitehall insider claimed Mr Johnson was “totally consumed with saving himself” - having spoken with  MPs one-to-one in recent weeks, yet only had calls with six world leaders. “He even missed a call with Putin because heaposs too busy trying to save himself,” the source said. But they said Mr Johnson would “welcome” a no-confidence vote being held by the party, and believes he would win it easily. “When that stuff lands thereaposs no way weaposre not going to go over the tipping point,” the source said. “The vote is % coming. But he doesnapost mind. The earlier the better.” They added: “Once he wins the confidence vote - and he will win the confidence vote - heaposs got a year.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Conservative PartyLiberal DemocratsScotland Yardpolitan PoliceNadine DorriesAndrew ParsonsBoris JohnsonCressida DickGraham BradyCCTVBirthday partyCCTV footageCivil servantsEnergy billsPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Despite witnesses hearing a bang and a scream following the impact, the parcel man drove away from the scene without checkingthe pedigree Hungarian wire haired Vizsla was okay. The six-year-old dog, who twice qualied for the Crufts puppy class and won several open shows, was put down by a vet later that day. Nothing can replace Moka, Shirley told The Mirror. I was absolutely gobsmacked when it happened. There were  people walking across that field with their dogs.  It could have been a child on the track. Shirley, from Norfolk, was at a shoot on a pig farm on November  last year when Moka went to collect a bird. The van came back from the houses really fast, she recalled. I heard a bang and a scream. I could see the van through the numerous gaps in the thin hedge. I ran through a gap in the hedge and one of the guys who had been shooting shouted at the driver, but after momentarily braking he sped off. The van driver had gone right over Moka and It was clear that she had at least a broken leg. I immediately covered her with my coat in an attempt to stop her going into shock and called my vets to let them know what had happened. Shirley, , took her dog for treatment for a broken leg, but she had to be put down later that night. The part-time administrator contacted Amazon and found the company to be very empathetic at first. About two weeks later they responded that the driver was a contract driver and not employed directly by them, and he had referred the matter to his insurance company, she claimed. However, after I stated that he was representing Amazon they paid the amount of the vets bill direct into my bank account. An Amazon spokesperson said: “We have very high standards for our delivery service providers and how they serve customers. We are taking this matter seriously and have reached out to Ms Cooper to offer our support.

Sources say the game has helped men aged  to  beat bad behaviour at HMP Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire. The Independent Monitoring Board jail watchdog said: “Imaginative innovations by officers helped build relationships and lessened prisoners’ boredom. Quizzes and cell-bell bingo – with prizes – provided fun.” The Mirroraposs newsletter brings you the latest news, exciting showbiz and TV stories, sport updates and essential political information.The newsletter is emailed out first thing every morning, at noon and every evening. Never miss a moment by signing up to our newsletter here.  The bingo sessions, which started just over a year ago, are part of a support programme for inmates. Stats show a fall in assaults on staff and other prisoners since it began. A jail source said: “If a few games alleviate a bit of boredom, it’s good for everyone concerned.” Last week, we told how inmates at HMP Wetherby are taken on fishing trips. Others get to pet animals and are given VR headsets.

The schoolboy, named locally as Szymon, was rushed to hospital where he later died after he was hit by the vehicle outside Northfleet Technology College in Kent on Wednesday. By his side should have been friend Kyran Thompson, , who was trailing a minute behind and hadnapost made the arranged meet-up. Kyran, who has been off school since the shocking incident, came across his friend lying on the floor. The West Ham academy player told The Mirror:a minute after it happened. I saw him on the floor. When asked what he would say to his friend, Kyran said: Iaposll miss playing basketball with you. We wonapost forget you. Rest in peace. Karl Thompson, Kyranaposs dad and owner of Kent Elite Scouting, said of his son: He is not okay. He isnapost himself. It has been hard on him.  Father and son visited the crash site on Friday afternoon to add a basketball tribute to the huge mound of flowers left for Szymon. His death has prompted a police probe which has seen a teenage boy from Gravesend arrested on suspicion of manslaughter. He is not thought to have been behind the wheel of the minibus, Mail Online reports. Daniel Grant, who has a child at the school, sprang into action after seeing Szymon injured on the floor and performed CPR on the boy. All I want is for the family to know is that someone tried, the dad-of-three told The Mirror. Thataposs what Iaposd want to knowthat was my child.  The -year-old former prison officer said two of his other children were in the car at the time and saw him carrying out the procedure. My youngest, who is almost five, he was sitting aposwatching daddy workingapos, as he called it, Daniel continued. He came out of school yesterday and askedthe boy was dead forever. Tributes have been pouring in for Szymon since the tragedy, with grieving members of the community leaving bouquets and cards at the scene of the crash. One message read: R.I.P little man. I know Iaposve never met you but you have touched the heart of every parent. Two basketballs with aposRIPapos written on them were also left at the scene.  One woman wrote on Facebook: I can’t believe I’m not going to see you walking home from school or playing with my pops and the kids round the park. I never forget the day I told you kids our estate was haunted and it got dark and I got a call from you all nearly in tears saying youaposre all scared. She added: I will always remember that day you will be sadly missed young man thinking of your mum and family. Another woman said: I cannot bring myself to tell the boys. I’m heart broken to say the least. Poor family, he was loved by everyone here. In a public letter Northfleet head teacher Jane Partridge said that several students had been left extremely distressed after seeing the collision.  Iaposm sorry to inform you that one of our community died this morning after being hit by a vehicle on his way to school, she added. The incident is currently under investigation by the police so we are unable to comment further. The Kent and Essex Serious Crime Directorate has launched a dedicated public portal online for witnesses to submit information which may help the investigation. Anyone who witnessed the crash, saw the child or vehicle in the moments leading up to it, or has dashcam footage, should contact police quoting reference -. A Kent Police spokesman said: A teenage boy, from the Gravesend area, was arrested in connection with the incident. He has since been released on bail, until February , pending further enquiries.

At first Amelie thought it was a friend until she “looked down and saw the crocodile ”.She she saw the beast swim under and around her to “measure the size of me”, before it snapped and dragged her underwater.  Although she couldn’t breathe, her pal held on to her le jacket by the shoulders as she desperately kicked the creature. She said: “You just think how do I get out  How do we escape this  At that point, I was just so ridiculously grateful that my friend was in the water.”After being saved, she had to wait  minutes for a rescue helicopter with no pain relief. As they waited, her friend told her not to look at her legs - but she replied: “It’s okay, tell them to amputate both my legs.” She added she looked down and I “knew in my head” there was no saving them. “I nearly lost my le, losing my legs compared to that is nothing,” she said. After having seven operations, she can now walk on crutches and hopes to go to university in September.Despite her terrying ordeal, she says she now intends toto the country to help build a school. She addedshe can change “hundreds of lives” by nearly dying, then it will “all have been worth it”.  “Obviously what happened was terrible, but I can’t change it and I was so lucky to have people around me I did,” she said. “It’s kind of a reality check, and makes you realise how lucky you are and how amazing le is.” She added: “You just never imagine it could happen to someone like you.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON TeenagersCrocodilesAnimalsAccidents\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The family of five are being evicted from the house in Thurnscoe, Yorkshire, on Monday February , Yorkshire Live reports. They were given the marching order on January , after having failed to pay rent for several months. Parents Amy Winter, , and Joshua Thain, , told Yorkshire Live they made Barnsley Council aware of their situation months ago and claim the local authority hasn’t helped. The parents, who each claim Universal Credit, have been living at the house with their children Skye, five, Daisy-Mae, four, and Lexi,  months, with another child on the way as Amy is currently five months pregnant. Amy said: “It’s that bad we don’t go out or anything because we’re worried. I’ve asked my familythey can help, they can’t help with accommodation because they’re only living in one bed and two bedroom houses.  “The only person who is trying to help is my partner’s uncle but he lives down in Somerset. “I think Barnsley Council need to get off their backside and figure out what they’re going to do, instead of just telling us one thing and next thing a dferent thing.”Neither the parent’s names are on the tenancy agreement for the property, which is owned by Sanctuary Housing. They claim to have stayed there with late grandma Victoria Robertshaw, Joshua’s mother, to look after her whilst she was ill. The -year-old died after testing positive for Covid- in August.Amy is also not pleased with Sanctuary Housing, alleging their officers were rude to her. Amy said: “They [Sanctuary Housing] were being rude about it, saying they would just put us on the streets. We’re just waiting for them to break down the door now. Barnsley Council has said ‘just keep your doors locked’.”  Barnsley Council says it’s offered advice around dferent housing options but Amy claims the only options offered would split-up the family even further - Amy and Josh have another child Macauli, , who lives with Amy’s mother. Amy said: “I ain’t separating my family up after everything that’s gone on with Josh losing his mum, I said ‘I ain’t separating my family just because you want me to’.” A spokesperson for Sanctuary Housing said: “On Monday January , an Outright Possession Order for this property was granted by a judge at court which asks the occupants to vacate it within  days. The proceedings related to signicant rent arrears that have built up with no rent being paid for several months, despite our attempts to resolve the issue before going to court.  “We have been liaising with Barnsley Council to ensure the occupants can access alternative accommodation as soon as possible, so this property can then be offered to a family who are currently waiting on Barnsley’s housing list.” Barnsley Councillor Jenny Platts, Cabinet Spokesperson for Adults and Communities, said: “Our housing team are continuing to work with the couple and are offering them advice around their housing options and support to consider alternative accommodation. “As part of this process, we have made enquiries into their current and previous housing situation, helping us explore all avenues of accommodation with them. “Our housing team are available to offer support and help whether you’re homeless or worried about becoming homeless, and they give you advice based on inidual circumstances. We encourage anyone worried about their housing situation to get in touch with us as soon as possible to make us aware of your situation.

And as he does, the reckless rider is also seen pulling out in front of a black taxi and almost knocking over another cyclist.He then continues to show flagrant disregard for other road users - making it impossible for any to overtake him.Then, with motorists backed up behind him, he even slowed down to take a selfie before whizzing off and almost crashing into a commuter as he ran a red light.  The driver who filmed the incident told The Sun: Cyclist riding the middle of the road despite having a cycle lane by him, making it impossible to overtake. At the same time taking advantage of the no punishment on riding without any hands on the handlebars to steer the bicycle as his hands busy on his mobile phone taking selfies and with the other hand holding what appears to be a takeaway.The major Highway Code revamp came into effect last Saturday and is aimed to boost protection for cyclists and pedestrians. But motorists have been fighting back and calling for the new laws, which they say are unfair, to be scrapped. The new guidance means traffic should give way when pedestrians are crossing or waiting to cross at junctions. Cyclists are advised to ride in the centre of lanes on quieter roads, in slower-moving traffic, and when approaching junctions, to make themselves as visible as possible.A hierarchy of road users has also been introduced, meaning someone driving will have more responsibility to watch out for people cycling, walking, or riding a horse, and cyclists will have more responsibility to be aware of pedestrians.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON SelfiesDangerous drivingCyclistsCars\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Now, in the Queen’s historic address, she has received the ultimate accolade. Elizabeth II has reigned for  years and been an exemplary monarch. Her calm demeanour, sense of duty and loyalty to her country have made her beloved here and around the world. Now, on this most special of days, she has set out part of the country’s future: Camilla. The grand gesture of announcing that Charles’s we will become Queen Consort is the very highest mark of respect. It shows her trust and admiration for a woman she believes will continue the tradition of service she has worked hard to uphold.  It has not been easy for Camilla to follow Diana, so loved by so many. Yet she has risen to the challenge with quiet dignity and been a steady presence in tumultuous times that have engulfed the family. For the Queen to call on us to give Camilla our support when she takes her place is a typically wondrous gesture. It forms the centre of a special message from a special monarch, so adept at finding the right words at the right time. Another mark of Her Majesty’s great sense of respect and loyalty is that she should take time to mention how she can still recall her father’s death. And there is no mistaking her palpable excitement for the momentous Jubilee. As she declares, just like with all her service over  years, she will continue to lead “with all my heart”.

He got seven years for the burglary and another three years in  for an earlier raid on a Mayfair jewellers. Jones was handed a further six years and  days for failing to repay more than six million he was said to have made from the Hatton Garden heist. Police claim two thirds of the stolen cash and jewels remain unrecovered.  By March , Jones had repaid £,. after the elderly criminals were hit by one of the biggest proceeds of crime orders in British history. He was released from HMP Hollesley Bay this week and was seen enjoying his freedom near his home in Enfield, north London. His release means Michael “Basil the Ghost” Seed, , and John “Kenny”  Collins, , are the only two members of the gang who remain in jail. Mastermind Brian Reader, , was released after serving three years in . A judge later ruled his dementia meant he did not have to go back inside for failing to repay the stolen millions. Reader is understood to still be living at his home in Dartford, south east London. Fellow ringleader Terry Perkins died in prison in  aged .  Jones, played by Ray Winstone and Phil Daniels in two films about the crime, led police to a stash of jewels hidden in a cemetery declaring “that’s all I had”. He wrote to Martin Brunt at Sky News in  saying he would take police to the location after admitting conspiracy to commit burglary. Unknown to him officers had found jewels buried in the graveyard but he led them to a separate, smaller stash, claiming that was all there was. Prosecutors said he did not tell officers about the larger bag of jewels hoping he could keep it.  Jones was also secretly recorded by police talking to Perkins while driving around London after the raid which took place over two nights during the Easter bank holiday weekend. Perkins said: “The biggest robbery in the f**king world, Dan, we was on.” Jones replied: “And what a book you could write f**king hell.” A teetotal fitness fanatic originally from Tottenham, north London, he has previous convictions including burglary, theft, robbery and handling stolen goods, which meant he has spent much of his adult le in prison. The lelong Spurs fan was so institutionalised that he referred to evenings after pm as “bang up” and would refuse to receive visitors or take phone calls. In the surroundings of his detached home, where the large wooden staircase was adorned with a carved skull, he would not sleep in bed with his partner, Valerie.  The father of two preferred to dress in a Tommy Cooper-style fez and his mother’s dressing gown, then bed down for the night in a sleeping bag on his bedroom floor. Jones would urinate in a bottle because of his obsession with the army and the SAS, and talked to his wire-haired terrier, Rocket, ashe were human. He spent his evenings reading books on crime and scouring the internet for ideas. A gang source said: “ Danny has got a likeable character. He is very forceful and impatient. “If you were on a bit of work the odds of it being successful would get better and better every week you were planning it but he would always want to do it tonight.” Fellow Hatton Garden gang member Carl Wood said of his friend during his trial: “Danny is a very sensitive guy, a very funny man. Eccentric to extremes, that everyone who knew Danny would say he was mad.”  Jones had been jailed for seven years in  and it was during this time, while in Maidstone prison, that was given a cell next to Reader’s old mentor Billy Barrett. Alarm expert Basil was the last raider to be arrested. He is serving ten years after finally being jailed in . The gang, nicknamed the “Diamond Wheezers” because of their ages, tunnelled into an underground safe deposit facility in London’s diamond district. They got hold of a key to the multiple-occupancy building, enabling Basil to simply walk in through the front door.Once inside, he let the others in through a fire escape.Dressed as workmen in high-visibility jackets and face masks, they went unnoticed as they lugged in the heavy tools needed for the job. The Mirror revealed CCTV of them in action in , showing for the first time that the raid had taken place over two nights. Jones and Basil were the only two slim enough to get into the vault through the hole they had made with a diamond tipped drill. Heather Chalk from the Crown Prosecution Service, said in : “Daniel Jones gained millions of pounds of criminal cash from the Hatton Garden burglary. “In January, the CPS showed the court that Jones had the funds to pay back his ill-gotten gains and today we have successfully argued that his default sentences should be activated. “Jones has failed to do so and will face more time in prison while the amount owed continues to stand.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON CCTVPrisonsCCTV footageMental healthCrimeJewelleryBurglaryHatton Garden robberyDaily Mirror,callToAction:ltpgtGet weekly highlights from Mirror editor Alison Phillips direct to your emaillt pgt,buttonText:,contentId:,newsletterImage:https:i-prod.mirror article.ece ALTERNATES sd _AlisonHeaderFinal.png,endpointUrl:https:response.pure interface list.php,profile:Reach_Mirror,isPureNewsLetter:true,pureMailingListId:Mirror - Alisons Newsletter,isDoubleOptIn:,newsletterSiteName:Mirror\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get weekly highlights from Mirror editor Alison Phillips direct to your emailInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The average UK household wastes around £ a year by throwing away food. The total amount of produce wasted is around . million tons. But food apps such as OLIO and Too Good To Go help prevent waste by connecting people to bargain bags of surplus supplies from supermarkets and other firms. Tom Church, co-founder of LatestDeals, says: “The huge benefit of these apps, as well as being budget-friendly, is that it’s much better for the environment. Less wasting food and less wasting money means everyone’s a winner.” Here, some savvy shoppers who explain how the apps have made a huge dference to their lives. Knowing you’re helping people in need is greatAlex Bak managed to eat for free for the first six months of the pandemic.The NHS worker has been a regular user of the OLIO app since March  – and now uses it to get bargain groceries two to three times a week. Every penny the -year-old saves is being put towards a deposit for a house.Alex says: “To know you are helping reduce waste by using food that would otherwise be thrown out, and to know you could be helping someone  who really needs it, is a great feeling. “I wanted to see how far I could go with it. For the first six months of the pandemic, I didn’t spend any money on food. Every single thing was from the app.” Among the items Alex collected from other people’s homes were sandwiches and salads from Pret A Manger, and fresh fruit, vegetables and bread from Tesco. During the first lockdown, Alex, who works as a clinical research practitioner, told how going to collect food was a great way of combining her daily exercise with reducing waste and saving money. Alex, who lives with three flatmates in Bethnal Green, East London, says: “I used to spend £ to £ a week on food. That’s now more like £ to £ a week, so I’m saving on average £ – and helping reduce waste.” The apps mean there’s no need for food waste Kind-hearted Kathryn Neale not only uses OLIO and Too Good To Go to save money, but she shares fresh produce with local foodbanks and care homes, too. The -year-old single mum, who has four children, works as a volunteer food collector. She says: “I get milk vouchers for my little two and have been getting the government vouchers for the big two but it’s not been quite enough. I still need to get fresh fruit and veg and keep a good supply of full-fat milk in the fridge for the little ones so getting a Morrisons box once a week has been a great help. “It’s £. and although it is meant to be a veg box, it can consist of anything that is reduced or damaged but is always edible and should be up to the value of £.” As well as picking up cut-price food for herself, Kathryn also delivers reduced produce to other people, including shielding pensioners and her parents. She believes thatyou don’t want or need certain food, there is no excuse for binning it as almost everything can be frozen or given to people who can use it via apps like OLIO. It’s encouraged me to be creative in the kitchen Last year, Julia Wilson’s -year-old husband Peter had a stroke so she gave up her job as a carer to look after him full-time. She discovered food-saving app Too Good To Go while browsing the internet three years ago and says it has been “a leline” for them. Julia, , says: “You don’t get paid much for being a carer, but Too Good To Go has been brilliant. We used to spend a horrendous amount on food – about £ a week. Now we spend around £. It’s been a real leline for us.” Julia uses the app to buy hugely discounted bags from Morrisons the most. But she also gets cakes from Greggs and other local shops like Hobbs House Bakery. She reserves magic bags via the site around three times a week. Julia, of Coalpit Heath, South Glos, said: “They are only a few pounds, most often for produce worth well over £. “Christmas was just overwhelming. We had mince pies, chocolate cake… so many things. And it’s really inspired me to come up with dferent dishes in the kitchen, which has just been so enjoyable.” We’re using the £, I’ve saved on trip to Florida Going out at pm to pick up a “magic bag” of food from her nearest One Stop shop has become a ritual for savvy mum Sarah Colley. The  year-old, the head of finance for an online menswear retailer, has shaved thousands of pounds off her weekly food shop thanks to the Too Good To Go app. Sarah, who lives with her solicitor husband Andy, , and son Joseph, six, says: “We’ve been saving an average of about £ a week so over  months, it’s been a saving of about £,. “The money we’ve saved is in a holiday fund. We’ve rebooked a trip to Florida that we were hoping to do before the pandemic and we’re using the money to go for longer.” Sarah, of Scarborough, North Yorks, says: “Each retailer sets the price of the bags. They’ll say how many they have at the end of the day on the app and you go and pick one up. “You spend around £. for a magic bag and it’s like a lottery because you have no idea what you’re getting. “One of my colleagues jokes, ‘You’re an accountant from Yorkshire so you’re going to be a bit tight’, which is probably true. But I don’t like seeing food go to wasteI can either use it myself or give it to people at work.” I was impressed with the boxes... they helped a lot Widow Shelly Kelly, , is a carer with an eye for a bargain. The mum of four swears by the Too Good To Go app after she once managed to get £ worth of groceries for just £. Shelly says: “I picked up two Morrisons boxes using the app and was very impressed. It helped me out a lot. And by paying £. for  bags of fruit and veg, I essentially only paid p for each item.” Fruit and veg are key items in the boxes – and Shelly told how you can make huge savings.  She says: “The best bargain was  punnets of strawberries. The total price originally would have been £. using the offers in store. “Ten punnets were £. each or two for £ making the total price £ with the offer, and the remaining three were £. each or two for £, so the original price would have been £.. However I only paid £. for these, saving £. in the process.” Shelly, from Leamington Spa, Warks, adds: “I froze a lot of it… the kids made a lot of smoothies and milkshakes with it. Frozen strawberries were also great in my gin!” How the free food apps work The apps involve picking up perfectly good food from cafes, restaurants, bakeries and shops near you, so you have to be willing to collect it. Too Good To Go has more than  million users worldwide and says it saves more than , meals each day. Users simply register for free and can pick up “magic bags”, which contain ious items from big-brand chains such as Greggs, Costa and Waitrose. OLIO is also free to download with an optional supporter donation of £. a month. It allows people to fetch food from all the usual sources, as well as from neighbours, who might be throwing away good food because they are moving home or going on holiday.  The app also includes a goodwill scheme in which you can sign up to be a volunteer, picking up food for others. Other popular food apps include Karma, which works similarly to Too Good To Go but focuses on local outlets. The food offered on the app is sold as inidual discounted meals so you know what you’re getting – handyyou’re a vegetarian or have food allergies, for example. NoWaste also helps you manage your own food waste. The free app allows you to log your weekly shop and sets up reminders so you will know when it is going out of date. Another app called Nosh, developed by the University of Essex, works in a similar way – as does Kitche, which has more than , recipe ideas to help you use up leftovers.

With views over the beautul Conwy Valley from its elevated position, near Snowdonia National Park and the coastline at Llandudno, itaposs not a surprise the spot was chosen by Williams for his striking mansion. The mansion gained its Grade II listing in , amended in , for its aposspecial architectural interest as primarily an early th century convalescent home of definite character, with signicant earlier origin as a country house.  It was then opened as a convalescent home in  and became a nursing home from . In  it was bought by Warwickshire County Council who operated it as an outdoor learning centre providing residential trips and courses for schoolchildren from that English county. However, the centre closed in October  and has now been put up for auction with a guide price of just £,. From  Cadw states Marle Hall was rented by the Birmingham Saturday Club, who later purchased, refurbished and rebuilt the house, with extensions at the rear.  The imposing mansion greets you with an impressive, symmetrical Georgian façade with a delightful glass covered front veranda surely the most pleasing place to gather and socialise whilst admiring the views. And although the interior is set up as the outdoor centre, plenty of period features survive, with a few in the core of the house dating back to its Tudor beginnings. Arguably the most glorious of the features is the entrance hall and staircase, boasting wood wall ling, intricate carved newel posts, Jacobean-style balusters and stained glass window . Exposed ceiling beams, a stone fireplace and fancy wooden double doors are extra features that instantly impress once you walk through the carved stone archway dating back to Tudor times, from the front door into the main reception hall.  Thereaposs multi-layered cornicing to reward youyou look up and either tiles, wood floorboards or beautully sanded parquet flooringyou look down within some of the main ground floor reception rooms. The huge, classic Georgian windows in the main rooms ensure each space is bursting with light and the abundance of wood in the primary rooms add visually warmth to the white and pale blue colour palette. Thereaposs a fancy metal and tiled fireplace in one of the reception rooms but the decor is, of course, set up to be operational as an outdoor education centre, so the interior design is minimal and simple to be ideal for its past commercial usage. Thereaposs a large, commercial kitchen, a large dining room with long tables and multiple chairs, carpeted classrooms, offices and lounges.  The house has a large boot room and changing room, and a space allocated to drying out wet kit. The remaining two floors above are mainly dedicated to dormitories and washing facilities, as well as a few more classrooms and break-out rooms. The accommodation in the main house is completed by a basement.  Outside, as well as woodland to explore, there are outbuildings to have a rummage around too. The main property within the grounds is a Grade II listed cottage, with a charming ceiling beamed kitchen, fireplace in the living room and three bedrooms and a bathroom upstairs. This property proposition overlooking Llandudno in Conwy, can offer a new owner plenty to consider. The dream home scenario is an amazing and super posh country pad once the house has been ed to a residential dwelling, as it currently has C use. This classication is for the provision of residential accommodation as use as a hospital or nursing home, residential school or college, or training centre.  Any changes to the house will need planning consent, with the Grade II listing as an important element. But the agent selling the house suggests a number of uses for Marle Hall, such as a boutique hotel with its location so close to the coast and Snowdonia, with ownersapos accommodation in the onsite cottage. Conversion into a complex of apartments might be an option to investigate too, but who wouldnapost want to dream about owning this country pile all for themselves, as Sir Hugh Williams did all those centuries ago  Marle Hall is going to auction with a guide price of £, on March , but is likely to sell for more, with Savills.

The large inflatable creature arrived in Leicester Square and has already caused something of a consternation on social media. People made suggestive remarks about the giant lime-coloured dino which was presumably supposed to attract the attention of kids. Unfortunately, it did gather some interest, but mainly from adults who reckoned it had more than a passing resemblance to male genitalia. The erection of the inflatable attracted a string of posts on Twitter including one from @moanystark who posted the giant creature on his feed.Along with the picture he wrote It’s all gone a bit Phoenix Nights in Leicester Square.  Other amused posters responded to the post and questionedthe creature, which has dark eyes at the end of its long green neck, was attracting the right people. @idlewildgirl said: Is it meant to…look like that   While others guffawed at the dinosaur and what it actually looked like. The creature was aposerectedapos as part of a promotion for the latest JackAss comedy flick according to one user on Reddit.  @thehibachi wrote: For those unaware, it’s promo for Jackass Forever. One poster who responded said: Ah! That’s why it’s phallic shaped! The giant green creature also had orange spikes on its back and y tale which allowed for more jests. Another Reddit poster said: There was no way this wasnapost deliberate  @Fancy Hawk wrote Get that bloody loveoff my club premises! Adults clearly thought the giant green specimen was aimed at them rather than children. And its arrival in Leicester Square provoked some amusing reactions as one person guarded it in case high winds sent it towering off in another direction. Other couples posed for selfies with the inflatable which began to draw crowds when it first went up in the square.  Tourists were also intrigued by the giant  ft inflatable which also sported some giant dinosaur claws which looked liked they could cause a bit of damage. But it was its likeness to a male member which left people in most amused and continued to attract attention during the day. Passers-by stopped and took pictures on their phones and were surprised by its size.  The film Jackass Forever, which the giant green creature was promoting is a black comedy directed by and is he sequel to Jackass D which was released in . It is a compilation of stunts, pranks and skits and opens with a parody of Godzilla where cast members fight off the monster.

Nestle’s UK CEO Stefano Agostini, a member of the UK Investment Council who also advises on levelling up, is overseeing the closure of its northern confectionery factory in Newcastle. The move will cost the UK  jobs. Production of treats such as Fruit Pastilles and Toffee Crisps will sht to the Czech Republic, Poland and Bulgaria, where labour is cheaper. A further  staff will go at Nestle’s KitKat plant in York. The GMB union’s northern senior organiser Chris Jukes said: “It’s staggering hypocrisy from the Government. “Levelling up is not what Agostini is doing in Newcastle. “Yes, they’re putting some investment in places like Halax. “But in terms of Newcastle, you couldn’t pick a worse example of levelling up. They’re off-shoring jobs and profit. If the Investment Council is about bringing jobs, he’s getting rid of jobs. “For the Government to put this guy from Nestle on the Council when they’re a perfect example of achieving the opposite, beggars belief.”  Last month the North East was named Britain’s jobs blackspot as unemployment hit .%. Nestle said: “Investments made by Nestle in the UK signicantly outweigh changes in production.” Its investments include a £million distribution centre, a £m upgrade to its Buxton Water factory in Derbyshire and a £m facelt of its York office plus recycling and green projects.

And as more British troops are sent to square up against Vladimir Putin’s forces on Ukraine’s borders, shadow Foreign Secretary David Lammy and shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves say that cash must be ed.They say in their letter: “It is shameful that Britain is repeatedly described as the money-laundering capital of the world. “It is in our national and economic interests to address the challenges of hostile influence and interference which the Government’s inaction and behaviour have regrettably permitted.” And Mr Lammy told the Sunday Mirror: “The cosy links between the Conservative Party and Russian-linked donors raise serious questions about our national security at a time when tensions with Russia are on the rise. “While Boris Johnson tries to talk tough with Vladimir Putin, his own party has been raking in millions from donors with links to Russia.” President Joe Biden has been warned by US diplomats that Russian money swilling around the UK may hamper Britain’s response to the Ukraine crisis. And London mayor Sadiq Khan is calling for a register of overseas property ownership to combat money laundering and stop the capital being dubbed “Londongrad”.Mr Khan said: “Ministers have turned a blind eye to the use of our capital city as a safe harbour for corrupt funds. Sunlight is the best disinfectant.” Nearly , properties in England and Wales are now owned by overseas-based buyers, up from , in . London now has , of these properties, with the highest concentration in Westminster where , neighbour Parliament.  Some are owned by allies of Vladimir Putin while many are left empty denying homes to Brits who need them. The lack of transparency means that many of these flats and houses could dodge sanctions the PM may slap on RussiansUkraine is invaded. Mr Khan added: ”Property in London plays a central role in harbouring illicit funds from around the world. That results in many properties being left empty when many Londoners are struggling to afford a home to buy or rent. “It will prevent the government acting on their tough talk about further sanctionsthey are imposed on Putin’s regime” The last estimate of corrupt money flowing into Britain put the figure at £billion a year. Labour now says recommendations from Parliament’s Intelligence and Security Committee report in  into Russian cash must be implemented in full.  The Lammy Reeves letter says: “There is much more we must do irrespective of the decisions made by President Putin, measures it should not have taken an army threatening Ukraine to put in place. “The government has been asleep at the wheel and needlessly left our defences down at home.” The pair want to see Companies House reformed to stop fraud, a registration scheme for foreign agents, new laws on computer misuse and a tightening of the rules on political donations. They also want an end to so-called “golden visas” which allow rich Russians to set up shop here.An analysis of Tory funding by Labour chair Anneliese Dodds shows that by last year Tory coffers had been swelled by a total of £,,. from Russian linked donors.Russian oligarchs flooded into Britain after Labour PM Gordon Brown decided any foreigner with a spare £million to invest could settle in the UK, few questions asked. It was such a successful fund raiser that in  Tory Chancellor George Osborne doubled the cost of investor visas to £million in exchange for full residency rights within five years. For £million the paperwork would be completed in two. A Conservative Party spokesman said: “The Conservative Party only accepts donations from permissible sources, namely iniduals registered on the UK’s electoral roll or U.K. registered companies. “Donations are transparently declared to the Electoral Commission and openly published by them.

Faye Hughes lost her eight-month daughter Nancy Thorpe and wants to honour all angel babies. The -year-old mum woke to a living nightmare when she found Jorgie-May, who was her youngest child, had passed away The mum, who has four other children, said little Jorgie-May had been ill in the months leading up to her untimely death. But she is determined to keep her daughteraposs name alive by raising money and awareness of Nancyaposs plight.On the fateful night before June , , Faye told North Wales Live : nothing would settle her.  That evening, the pair had lots of mummy snuggles before they both fell asleep. But when Faye woke and found Jorgie, her world was broken. She said: Jorgie was born on October ,  at .pm with my mum and sister at my side. My family was complete. I was the luckiest mummy alive to have beautul children. But, on December , , Jorgieaposs le changed. She was admitted to hospital in Bangor with breathing dficulties. She was so poorly she was nearly vented offand taken to Alder Hey. I thought that was the worst day, but that was still to come. Jorgie scared the doctors because she couldnapost keep oxygen in her body or generate it around her body like other children. She was monitored at Bangor in case we did have to go to Alder Hey, but my girl smashed it and was allowed home in time for her brother and sisteraposs Christmas shows. She was finally diagnosed with bronchitis.From that moment on, we were regulars at the doctors and hospitals.We had an amazing Christmas at home as a family. aposBring on ,apos we all cheerfully said on New Yearaposs Eve. But we were still regular patients at the doctors come January, February, March, April and May because I was so scared for her breathing. I remember a doctors appointment where Jorgie had to be put on a nebuliser because her breathing was bad. Faye added: Then came the night of June , .  Faye said she took her daughter, Phoebe dancing while Jorgie stayed home with dad, Rob. She didnapost seem right and was full of cold and snotty, Faye recalled. The mum put her children to bed but nothing would settle Jorgie, said Faye. At .pm, we went downstairs and had Calpol and mummy snuggles, she said. I put Jorgie to sleep next to me and we both fell asleep. We both woke at around .am when Rob got home from darts. Again, me and my girl went back to sleep as the only thing that would settle her was me. It was am the next morning when I woke and something was telling me to look at Jorgie. That feeling no mum should ever feel. My world was broken. My Jorgie-May fell silently to sleep. I just knew in my heart she was gone. I just remember screaming my house down. The days after her funeral most of the time were a blur.

It will cost us, the taxpayer, £,. That’s the price of the civil service and police time spent probing No parties that should never have happened. The nation is rightly furious that the Prime Minister cared so little for the Covid rules he himself imposed that he put living it up before his duty to protect lives and livelihoods. Our PM gave not one jot about those who were forbidden from saying a final face-to-face goodbye to a dying loved one – or the family get-togethers we all did without because we were obeying his rules. Patsy Stevenson is angry too. She was fined £ for breaking lockdown restrictions to honour the memory of murdered Sarah Everard.  There was no cheese and wine at the vigil Patsy attended on London’s Clapham Common. Yet police pinned her down to arrest her, while ignoring food and booze pouring into No. The cost of the Partygate inquiry would be better spent on shielding women and girls from the kind of predator who snatched Sarah’s le away. And this investigation would not be needed had Mr Johnson and his staff accepted that rules also apply to them. This PM is on borrowed time. We will party – legally – when it finally runs out. A great honour for Camilla Camilla Parker Bowles may have been a skilled horsewoman, but she had a rough ride of it when she became Duchess of Cornwall. Many people could not forgive her for the part she played in the break-up of Prince Charles and Princess Diana’s marriage. But that was nothing compared to the fences the Queen had to jump within her own family while trying to maintain the dignity of royalty and respect for the monarchy. Both were tarnished when grandson Prince Harry turned his back on royal duties and skipped off to America to give a toe-curling interview to Oprah Winfrey, and strike ­embarrassing deals with Netflix.  It pained the Queen greatly when she had to strip her favourite son, Prince Andrew, of his titles as he faces accusations of sexual assault in a US court. But her duty to the nation demanded it, and the Queen has always put that before personal feelings. Throughout, Camilla has been steadfastly by the Queen’s side, her support in times of trouble. And just like the Sovereign, she negotiates the pathways of public le without putting a foot wrong – a ready smile and a kind word are always on her lips. The Queen is not one to ignore such loyalty and dedication. And today, as she becomes the first British monarch to reign for  years, she wants the world to know that when the time comes, Camilla will be called Queen Consort. We are delighted Camilla is to receive the honour. As they say in royal circles, she’s a jolly good fellow. And so say all of us.

Julia Samuel, who was friends with Diana, said the late princess started the tradition that the godparent should buy a gt for the children that was the most hilariously inconvenient and dficult to make.She shared her memories of the eccentric tradition in an episode of the podcast How to Fail with Elizabeth Day. “So I do to George what [Diana] did to us... which is give impossible toys which are really noisy, take a lot of making, she said.  “I come in slightly tipped by the size of the present that William then has to spend days putting together and then put all the machinery together. It makes awful tooting noises and lights flashing and all of that. That makes me laugh and it makes George laugh.”Ms Samuel spoke about how much Diana would have loved her grandchildren Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis.The godmother, , said the young prince is amazing and that it is heartbreaking for all of them. “He’s funny and feisty and cheeky and God [Diana] would have loved him so much. That is heartbreaking for all of them,” she added.Ms Samuel, who is one of Prince George’s seven godparents, used to work in publishing before training as a counsellor, reports the Express.She met Diana at a dinner party in  and helped create Child Bereavement UK in .  The godmother received an MBE in  and now works as a bereavement counsellor in the paediatrics department at St Mary’s Hospital Paddington. Royal expert Katie Nicholl believes Prince William and Kate are careful when it comes to the presents they buy their children, despite living a le of privilege. She told OK! magazine: “George enjoys his iPad at school, both he and Charlotte are quite tech-savvy and, like most children, there probably are technical gadgets and such like on their wish list.  “Iaposm sure theyaposre not going to want for anything, but when it comes to technology and screens, they are careful not to spoil them with extravagant gting.” She added: “If it is something that happens to be a computer game or something like that then they are cautious of screen time so it could be a more practical gt.”It follows reports that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are wanting to move from London to Windsor. The couple made Kensington Palace their official home along with their three children after marrying in . They are regularly seen taking George, Charlotte and Louis on the school run and reportedly love doing fun activities such as baking, crafts and playing in the garden. But Kate and William can be strict when needed according to a source who said there is one rule in their home that the couple is firm on keeping and will likely apply in the new house.They told the Sun : Shouting is absolutely ‘off limits’ for the children and any hint of shouting at each other is dealt with by removal.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Prince GeorgePrince WilliamPrincess DianaRoyal Family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The monarch, , said her reign has been a time of extraordinary progress socially, technologically and culturally, and said she feels a sense of hope and optimism ahead of her Platinum Jubilee. The longest-serving monarch in British history said she will be eternally grateful for, and humbled by, the loyalty and affection that you continue to give me. She also voiced her confidence that her son Charles and his we Camilla would be given the same support you have given me.She paid an emotional tribute to Prince Philip, saying he was a partner willing to carry out the role of consort and unselfishly make the sacrices that go with it. Here is the Queenaposs statement in full Tomorrow, th February, marks the th anniversary of my Accession in . It is a day that, even after  years, I still remember as much for the death of my father, King George VI, as for the start of my reign. As we mark this anniversary, it gives me pleasure to renew to you the pledge I gave in  that my le will always be devoted to your service. As I look ahead with a sense of hope and optimism to the year of my Platinum Jubilee, I am reminded of how much we can be thankful for. These last seven decades have seen extraordinary progress socially, technologically and culturally that have benefitted us all and I am confident that the future will offer similar opportunities to us and especially to the younger generations in the United Kingdom and throughout the Commonwealth. I am fortunate to have had the steadfast and loving support of my family. I was blessed that in Prince Philip I had a partner willing to carry out the role of consort and unselfishly make the sacrices that go with it. It is a role I saw my own mother perform during my fatheraposs reign. This anniversary also affords me a time to reflect on the goodwill shown to me by people of all nationalities, faiths and ages in this country and around the world over these years.  I would like to express my thanks to you all for your support. I remain eternally grateful for, and humbled by, the loyalty and affection that you continue to give me. And when, in the fullness of time, my son Charles becomes King, I know you will give him and his we Camilla the same support that you have given me and it is my sincere wish that, when that time comes, Camilla will be known as Queen Consort as she continues her own loyal service. And so as I look forward to continuing to serve you with all my heart, I hope this Jubilee will bring together families and friends, neighbours and communities - after some dficult times for so many of us - in order to enjoy the celebrations and to reflect on the positive developments in our day-to-day lives that have so happily coincided with my reign.

The monarch, just hours away from becoming the first British sovereign to reach a historic  years on the throne, joined members of the local community in the ballroom of Sandringham House to mark her milestone.Yvonne Browne, vice-president and chairman of the Sandringham WI, described the Queen as being on sparkling form. The event was the largest in-person public engagement the Queen had attended since before her recent health scare in mid October. The -year-old head of state arrived at the event with a wooden walking stick she rested on sagely as she leant forward to chat to the visitors. The guests were seated around tables waiting for a tea to be served but stood up respectfully to chat to the Queen. Wearing an Angela Kelly wedgwood blue crepe with white brocade dress, the Queen, who beamed with delight throughout, also carried her trademark black handbag. She cut a cake decorated with the Jubilee emblem to begin her Platinum year. Among the guests were members of the Sandringham branch of the Womenaposs Institute, Sandringham Estate pensioners and representatives from two local charities West Norfolk Befriending and Little Discoverers. The Queen also met former cookery school student Angela Wood who helped to perfect the famous dish coronation chicken served to guests after the Queenaposs  Coronation ceremony. Mrs Wood made the Queen laugh when she told the monarch she spent days and days altering it for Constance Spry and Rosemary Hume.  Commenting on how the recipe for coronation chicken has likely developed over the years the Queen told Angela Wood: Itaposs probably changed because in those days we did some things quite dferently. Shaun Mason, a junior sous chef, had created tiny bite size morsels of the coronation chicken, chicken with curry spices, apricot in a savoury tartlet, and he carried a tray of his creations into the ballroom and announced they were available to sample. As the morsels were placed between the Queen and Mrs Wood to try, the room erupted with laughter when the Queen quipped Iaposll go away, she turned to add: You can tell mewhen I come back. On October , the Queen held a Windsor Castle evening reception for delegates for the Global Investment Summit. But the next day she cancelled a two day trip to Northern Ireland, was secretly admitted to hospital for preliminary tests, before being put under doctorsapos orders to rest and only carry out light duties.  Before the pandemic the Queen would visit her WI colleagues at West Newton village hall every year as part of her winter stay on her Sandringham estate in Norfolk. The Queenaposs Platinum Jubilee will be celebrated across the country during an extended June Bank Holiday in honour of a monarch who has left an indelible mark on the le of the nation. But February , the date of the Queenaposs accession to the throne, is a poignant period for the Queen, as it is the day her father King George VI died in . She is already the nationaposs longest reigning monarch, and the longest still-serving sovereign in the world. During the reception the Queen also met representatives from West Norfolk Befriending a charity which aims to reduce the social isolation experienced by the elderly by matching them with trained volunteer befrienders who visit on a regular basis.  And she spoke to members of Little Discoverers which provides early education for pre-school children with movement dficulties and delayed development. When the Queen was presented with a copy of a Loyal Address written by primary schoolchildren from West Norfolk the head of state gave a frank opinion on public proclamations she has heard during her long reign. The Queen seemed to approve of the words from the younger generation who said about the Queen: You have shown a caring manner, determination, and dedication to help other people. We think youaposre doing a great job! We are very lucky to have had you as our Queen for so long. We are proud of you for helping us through this pandemic with your inspirational words, and by your actions setting a good example, especially as the last year has been so hard for you. After reading the address, on display in the ballroom, the Queen said to laughter from the guests: Most addresses are usually pompous...this is so much nicer.  The afternoon reception which the Queen clearly enjoyed ended with the cutting of an iced Victoria Sponge with the Platinum Jubilee logo as its decoration. Lady Dannatt, the Lord-Lieutenant of Norfolk, told the Queen the cake was turned upside for the benefit of the press photographs and the quipped to laughter I donapost matter  When it came to cutting the large cake the Queen thinking aloud said: Iaposll put the kne in, seeit works and she drove the kne in vertically and left it place adding somebody  can finish it off.

Abraham said he was thinking how he could face Godhe didnapost help, adding: It is my duty, my religion, in that moment I knew I had to act. But after the attacker was left dead, Abraham was in shock. I was in shock. I took my head in my hands and thought, aposHow has this happened apos Iaposd tried to save a womanaposs le and Iaposd killed a man. I said a prayer: aposGod forgive me for what I have doneapos.  Detective Chief Inspector Neil Rawlinson, from the Met’s Specialist Crime Command, earlier said: “Having reviewed the CCTV evidence and taken statements of numerous members of the public and attending officers, as well as reviewing the legal position regarding self-defence and defence of another, a decision has been taken that the driver of the car, a -year-old man will face no further police action. “He is considered a vital witness to our investigation and will be offered support from professionals to help him come to terms with the terrying situation he was confronted with. “It is vitally important that when a person dies there is a thorough investigation into all of the circumstances and this has taken place. Such decisions must be thoroughly examined and while this process takes time this has been a priority for my team. The manaposs legal advisors have been informed of this decision. “Inquests have opened in relation to both deaths and my team will continue to work to provide evidence for the Coroner. We continue to appeal for witnesses to this incident who have yet to speak to police to come forward and do so.”Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON politan PoliceKne crime\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The pong has also hit A-list neighbours Oprah Winfrey, Ellen DeGeneres, Katy Perry and Orlando Bloom. A local in Montecito, Calornia, said: “It smells like offal that has been rotting in the sun. It makes my stomach churn. “I’ve seen lots of homeowners closing their windows when it wafts over.” The stench is coming from the Andrée Clark Bird Refuge, a -acre saltwater marsh.  Local officials say the problem is likely to go on until improvement works this autumn. Cameron Benson, clean water manager for the City of Santa Barbara, said: “Water can become stagnant there. “The odour issues are sporadic and sometimes they are worse in some conditions.” MockedThe bird smell is the latest reason for Prince Harry, , and Meghan, , to complain about the home they share with kids Archie, two, and Lilibet, seven months.We told how they have had to put up with smells from a nearby cannabis farm. And we revealed they are not “over the moon” with the £million property and are enquiring about other houses.  Speaking about the bird refuge, Mr Benson added: “Our goal is to improve water quality and wildle habitat there.” On Thursday Harry was mocked over his web lecture for corporate coaching firm BetterUp on how to avoid burnout. One critic wrote: “Just think of those who have worked long hours and still can’t make ends meet, it must be very dficult being a millionaire for him and his family.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Prince HarryMeghan MarkleRoyal Family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The womanaposs step-mum threw a tantrum and started saying things like, your dad is married to me, you canapost be in a picture with just your mum and dad, and itaposs disrespectful to our marriage. My stepdad didnapost care because he doesnapost have a temperament of a toddler and my mum was willing to do it, she said, but her dad sided with his new we. I told him it was one picture that his daughter wanted to have a keepsake of to remember her wedding.But noamount of pleading would make him change his mind.He told me he loved me very much but that his we wouldnapost be comfortable with it and so he couldnapost, and instead he suggested they take more photos as a group, which she declined.

But dieting can be tough, and who has the time to plan out dferent healthy meals for each day of the week  Now, Iceland has you covered. The frozen food giant has teamed up with Slimming World to sell a series of meals that are designed to help you lose weight, but are they any good  Intrepid journalist Dianne Bourne, from the Manchester Evening News, has now put her tastebuds on the line as she dined out on seven meals from the range - and documented the effect on her weight loss.What do you think of the frozen Slimming World meals  Let us know in the comments... Day Chicken tikka and rice lunch bowl - £. Dianne said: A great way to kick off the week of taste tests - with one of the lunch bowl meals - designed, as the title suggests, as a lighter daytime option. This is a new one to the range and I enjoyed what was a satisfying mix of crunchy vegetables, rice and tasty tikka-coated chicken pieces which was also pretty filling. Rating:   Chicken carbonara - £.  Dianne said: I was not holding out much hope for this one as it smelt slightly unpleasant as it cooked away in the microwave. Billed as a aposcomforting pasta dish with seared chicken, smoky pork strips, mushroom and spinach in a white sauceapos it did not look all that inspiring or comforting when I poured it into my dish. There were around eight pieces of chicken and a few strips of pork, and my first thought was that it seemed to taste very salty and the consistency was a bit gloopy. For me, I think Iaposd rather stick with making my own carbonara - as the Slimming World versionis a fairly simple and much cheaper recipe to make from scratch. Rating:    Day  Caullower and chick pea dahl - £. Dianne said: This can be eaten on its own or as a side dish. It probably would have been better as a side dishIaposm honest as I found it a bit unfulfilling as a lunch dish. It had a pleasant curry hit though and I like the crunch of the caullower with the chickpeas. Rating:   Chilli Con Carne - £.  Dianne said: A really hearty dish with large chunks of meat in a rich sauce and the rice was nicely herbed up. If you werenapost doing Slimming World youaposd think this was just a regular chilli ready meal, which is probably the best compliment I can give it. Indeed, my friendaposs strapping -year-old lad aposaccidentallyapos microwaved himself one of these and gave it a big thumbs up as well, so itaposs definitely good in the aposgenerous portionapos stakes. Rating:   Day  Cowboy hotpot - £.  Dianne said: Itaposs safe to say this was the dish I was most looking forward to. I mean, it has cowboy in its title and sausages and potato in it so whataposs not to love  Well, unfortunately the dish itself was what I could not learn to love. It said on the packet it was best cooked in the oven and I followed the cooking times to the tee, but it came out very dry and stodgy. It just did nothing for me at all - the sausages were firm and dry and the potatoes also had a powdery consistency on top. So disappointed with this one, definitely not a yee-ha moment from me. Rating:   Beef vindaloo - £.  Dianne said: However, tea time well and truly gave me one of the highlights of the week - in the new beef vindaloo dish. This was a real treat. A really brilliant hit of spices in a rich tomato sauce with flavoursome lumps of beef. Rating:   Day  Moroccan style chicken soup - £. Dianne said: Again, a very off-putting smell from the microwave, but once cooked this one was pretty delicious. A really interesting spice mix with a decent amount of heat, and lots of pulled chicken which made this one a warming and filling soup dish that I would definitely buy again. Rating:   Beef Lasagne - £.  Dianne said: This one has been a favourite of many SW-ers for a while now, but theyaposve just introduced a new recipe. So it is as good as the old one  Well, I was pretty excited about this one - because itaposs even better. The new recipe has finally nailed the elusive creamy cheesy aspect of the lasagne that is not easy to do.  Taking a nosy at the recipe card on the inside, it appears to be a mixture of butternut squash, potato and the magic Quark that has created the delightful crispy cheesy topping here. A word of warning on this one though - while it can be cooked in the microwave, it does say for best results stick in the oven. And, while it does take a mammoth  minutes, it tastes sooo much better this way to get that cheesy crunch. Rating:    Day  Naked beef burrito - £. Dianne said: A good amount of spice kick in this one, and itaposs quite a satisfying lunch pot. If you have your HEA of cheese available I feel like it would be nicer with this mixed in - I added some peppers and salad on the side. Rating:   Hunteraposs chicken - £.  Dianne said: This one has to be cooked in the oven and is a large portion for two, so my other half got roped into eating this one with me. It had a long cooking time of over an hour this one - and Iaposm not surethataposs why the chicken was a bit dry and chewy. And oneaposs thing for sure, it looked absolutely nothing like the glossy image on the packaging when it came out of my oven. But the overall flavour was ok - although the barbecue sauce was a tad on the watery side. My feeling is this one would be much easier and better to simply recreate yourself at home - itaposs just a rasher of bacon plonked on some chicken really. Rating:    Day  Colcannon Mash - £ Dianne said: Running a bit out of options at this stage, I decide to try the colcannon mash which I team with steamed broccoli and salmon. The mash is, like a lot of the meals, a tad on the salty side but teams well with salmon and I like that you can taste the cabbage in the mash mix. This is a convenient one to have in the freezer for those moments you canapost be bothered making your own mash. Rating:   Smoky meatball tray bake with potato wedges - £  Dianne said: The meatballs were on the dry side, but had a decent flavour punch, and were extremely pleasant when mushed together with all the smoky tomato and chickpea sauce. There was a decent size portion for two of us, although we did add lots of vegetables for speed. This was a really tasty one - but Iaposm afraid it canapost get full marks this one for the sheer faff factor. It took hr and mins to cook in the oven which comes in very low on the convenience factor - as does the vast size of the packet that I needed to try and wodge in my not very sizeable freezer. Itaposs also pretty expensive for this style of dish. Rating:   Day  Slimming World chips - £. Dianne said: Itaposs the last day, so Iaposm going all out with the curry and chips on the menu. And thereaposs literally nothing  left to eat. So I bung some of the frozen chips in the oven and serve them with some baked beans. Now with these frozen chips, people either love them or hate them from my experience at Slimming World group.  I have personally perfected a good flavour by sprinkling some syn-free spice on them and then spraying them with low-calorie spray. They do have a slightly strange consistency, but they are a convenient option to have ready-made in the freezer when you canapost face peeling and chopping up potatoes and cooking from scratch. Rating:   Chicken tikka rogan josh - £.  Dianne said: Ending the week on a high with this classic curry. The Slimming World chicken tikka masala has been a bit of a staple since the Iceland range was first launched, but this new rogan josh version might even trump it for me. Loved the spice on this one, and the added lumps of tomato and pepper. You could almost be eating a aposrealapos takeaway curry. Rating:   Did it work  Dianne said: Well, this is the big question isnapost it  After a whole week of eating the ready meals, and sticking  per cent to the Slimming World plan throughout the rest of the day, Iaposd have been guttedI didnapost lose any weight. But guess what  I did. I lost a whopping lbs. Which just goes to show sticking to aposfree foodsapos and the rest of the rules of the Slimming World plan does do the trick.Do you have a story to share  Weaposd love to hear all about it.

Now, the cousin is getting married and the younger woman didnapost want him walking her down the aisle - and now the whole family have been left ided. What do you think the dad should do  Let us know in the comments...Taking to Reddit, the woman said: While the bullying decreased it never went away, she still makes fun of me because Iaposm single, because Iaposm dumb, etc etc. When she got engaged she excluded me from the bridal party and it wouldnapost matterit wasnapost for the fact that she included the rest of the family. She took my parents to dinner last week and asked my dad to walk her down the aisle and I donapost know what excuse he gave her but after that, he came to my room and asked meI would be okay with this.  I was honest, I said no. I told him that she made most of my le hell, even before my uncle passed away and since I was his only daughter, I thought it would be an experience between us. Well, my dad told her no and now my cousin is blaming me, telling everyone that I forced him, that I was a jealous little b***h and thatI donapost fix it then I wouldnapost be welcome at her wedding.  My mum and my aunt sided with her that it was a low blow on my part and most of her family is saying that it wasnapost fair. After sharing her story online, other Reddit users rushed to the womanaposs defence and said that they too would be uncomfortable,they found themselves in a similar situation.

Then another wrote: He asked, you answered. The people in your family are cowards and nasty for coming at a teen like that over a grown manaposs decision And a third added: Your father is an adult and can make his own decisions.

Thankfully, one mum has done some of the hard work for you and has shared a few baby items that probably donapost need to buy.Frances Chie regularly shares parenting tips and tricks on her TikTok @lovefranceschieein order to help other people navigate parenthood.In a recent video, that has been viewed more than . million times, she revealed four baby items that are a big waste of money - and some might surprise you.

Lastly, Frances said newborn detergent is an unnecessary purchase and that you could just use the same detergent as you use for the rest of the family. It is .

Moore, founder of womenaposs blouse brand Elizabeth  Clarke, has a dferent theory and thinks she may have unearthed the reason once and for all. Why do you think womenaposs blouses button on the opposite side to menaposs shirts  Let us know in the comments...One thoery is that menaposs shirts had buttons on the right side because most men held their swords in their right hand. This meant they needed to be able to unbutton their shirt quickly to duel and unbuttoning using their left hand was faster. As to why womenaposs buttons are on the left, many believe itaposs because women tend to carry their babies in their left arms.  Itaposs possible that womenaposs shirts were designed to be opened or closed with the free right hand to make breastfeeding easier, so they were buttoned on the left and open on the right. It also may be because way back when women were expected to ride horses sidesaddle. Buttoning up on the left may have kept the breeze from blowing up their shirts as they galloped across fields.  Another possible explanation for the iation in button placement could be traced back to the rise of emancipation when women began to abandon their girdles in favour of pants and other traditionally male clothes. As a practical technique of distinguishing between menaposs and womenaposs clothing, manufacturers placed buttons on the left side of womenaposs clothing. Melanie M. Moore, founder of womenaposs blouse brand Elizabeth  Clarke, has a dferent theory. When buttons were invented in the th century they were, like most new technology, very expensive, she told Today. Wealthy women back then did not dress themselves — their ladyaposs maid did. Since most people were right-handed, this made it easier for someone standing across from you to button your dress. There are a iety of possible reasons as to why menaposs and womenaposs shirts are buttoned dferently. At this point though, it all comes down to good old-fashioned tradition.Do you have a story to share  Weaposd love to hear all about it.

Thereaposs truly nothing more comforting than a big bowl of pasta and tomato sauce, and the good news is, you can make it when youaposre on a budget or your cupboards are bare and you havenapost had chance to get to the supermarket.Due to the fast-paced nature of modern le, itaposs no surprise that many people opt for sauces out of a jar to save on time and effort, but the truth is many of these jars are jam-packed with sugar and additives and can cost more than the ingredients themselves. According to Italian American food writer Marcella Hazan, a good pasta sauce is remarkably simple and economical, too, meaning itaposs far cheaper and healthy than any store bought products.  Marcella, who died in , was born in Cesenatico, Italy, in  and went on to open a New York cookery school and write hugely respected cookbooks, so what she says goes when it comes to a good old pasta sauce. In one of her books, Essentials of Classic Italian Cooking, Marcella advises using only three ingredients in tomato sauce: tinned tomatoes, an onion and a generous knob butter. We told you it was simple. The  recipe is still revered by food writers and cooks alike. No chopping is required. And pasta and tomato sauce is always a hit round the family dining table. Marcellaaposs precise instructions are to put half a peeled onion into a pot with butter and tinned tomatoes and to leave it all to simmer for  minutes. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. Food publication Delish dubbed the sauce the best in the world. Her husband Victor talked to Epicurious about her efficient methods: Marcella was a genius when it came to taste. She had an immediate understanding about how flavour affects a dish.She asked herself, aposWhy chop an onion  Why saute  Iaposm going to put the onion, tomato, and butter together and forget about itapos. Is it really the best in the world  Itaposs a bold claim and a subjective one. But Italians are famous for their simplicity in cooking. Itaposs all about the produce – tomatoes being one of the most important. No other preparation is more successful in delivering the prodigious satisfactions of Italian cooking than a competently executed sauce with tomatoes, Marcella says in her book.  Her sauce is very rich. Others favour dferent techniques. Jamie Oliver adds four cloves of garlic and garnishes with fresh basil.BBC Good Food recommends starting with a classic mirepoix base , and scores of top chefs use ious herbs and oils and other trickery to elevate their dishes. Anchovies are good. Food writer Felicity Cloake suggests the more classic use of olive oil in tomato sauce. She also puts in a pinch of sugar and some red wine vinegar.The thing to do is experiment. Garlic or no garlic, parsley or thyme or basil or rosemary, as long as the tinned tomatoes are good and thereaposs parmesan on the table, we imagine people will be well fed.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

Although the SAS and SBS are still in Syria and Iraq, the numbers of troops there are believed to be relatively small.

I had actually played with Scotty when he was on loan at Brechin City from Dunfermline, so I knew what he was capable of. I knew he would fit into our philosophy and how we want to play the game.“My intention was to give him - minutes, but he came on early and worked his socks off and got his reward with the goal and then we had to being him back off because his legs had just went at that point.“He probably needs a bit more game time in terms of match fitness and sharpness but when he gets up to full speed, he will be a real asset for us.“We went short-term and this gives him a chance to get back playing and enjoying his football. And it gives us the opportunity to let him see what we are about and come the end of the season we will probably assess that again.“Everyone knows Gala is a great club. I think that little bit of professionalism and trying to do things in the right manner will help bring him on. He came down and trained with us and as soon as he met the chairman and the boys make everyone feel welcome when they come to the club .“There is a real togetherness there so I think it will suit Scotty going forward so it’s up to him what he does from here until the end of the season. I told him that he will get an opportunity to play but he needs to show me that he’s here to contribute.“He has a good pedigree at Dunfermline and Celtic as a kid and he’s got a good attitude but has just lost his way a bit in terms of going on loan to Brechin City when they were in League Two. It was a tough ask to come in and play men’s football when they were just desperate for results. So it probably wasn’t the ideal fit for him. Going forward, coming to us will suit him as he has an eye for a pass and an eye for a goal and is comfortable on both feet. He can go outside or inside and has a bit of pace. He’ll be a really good addition. “"},{"url":null,"title":"natural-beauty-history-borders-inspires-photographers","story":"A COLOURFUL image of sheep grazing on the purple heather of The Gypsy Glen in the Tweed Valley has been ranked by VisitScotland as the most popular Scottish Borders social media post of .The photograph by @becky__ received more than , likes when it was shared by the national tourism organisation on its Instagram account, making it the highest performing post of the region last year.An image of Sir Walter Scott’s ancestral home at Abbotsford House near Melrose was ranked second most popular post for the region.

This sparked a furious debate in the House of Commons.No guarantee was given by the Prime Minister that an unredacted report would be made available to MPs.In response Borders MP John Lamont said: “It is deeply frustrating that Sue Gray has been unable to release her full report so that we can see the full facts of what has gone on. The country has a right to see the evidence for themselves and it must be published in full when the police investigation concludes.”MP for Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale David Mundell said: “The document which has been presented by Sue Gray is an update on her investigation into alleged gatherings on Government premises during Covid restrictions. It details a number of alleged gatherings, all but four of which are now subject to a separate investigation by the politan Police and, as a result, details of those events have not been reported in the update in order not to prejudice the police investigations.“My strong view is that, when it is possible, the report in its entirety should be published, as I believe everyone has a right to see what has been established.”Both also insisted that anyone found to have broken the lawshould be held accountable.Mr Lamont added: “No one is above the law. Not even the Prime Minister.

By closing them off, you will cut out the draught and also ensure that any heat in your property isn’t escaping into that room.Get draught excludersA big reason why your home may not be retaining heat very well is because of draughts.Allowing cold air to get into the home will bring the overall temperature down.If you can stop these draughts from getting in, it will make a huge dference to the temperature in your home.Get cookingEating hot food will help to warm you up and the process of cooking the food will throw heat out into the kitchen and surrounding areas, meaning your home will warm up as a result.Consider getting rugsIf your house is fully carpeted, then you needn’t worry about this option, as that will help insulate your home.However, you can lose a considerable amount of heat through floorboards or tiles, so putting a rug over the top can make all the dference in your home’s heat retention.Put tin foil behind your radiatorIf on the occasion you do have the heating on, which you should because it is good for home’s condition, then you should put foil behind your radiators to make sure the heat is forced into the room, rather than getting lost in the wall."},{"url":null,"title":"royal-mint-reveals-10-rarest-50p-coins-circulation","story":"The Royal Mint has revealed its top ten rarest  pence coins in circulation.The move to \"new money\" pounds and pence, happened  years ago this month, with the anniversary on  February .Since then, over  iations of the p coin have been circulating and several rare designs have been distributed.The famous Kew Gardens p remains the most coveted coin in circulation, with a mintage of just ,, the Mint said.Other rare designs include Olympic-themed ps minted in .Here, we look at the rarest p coins and how many of each have been made - and how much they could be worth.What makes a coin valuable The  pence piece has become the most valued and collected coin in the UK, with many collectable designs appearing on its heptagonal canvas.Its .mm diameter makes it the largest of any British coin, and allows space for decorative pictures.

and had a good chance to score when Robertson freed John McCallum to play in Andrew Renton.Renton advanced on the left side of the box, but the youngster#s touch when bearing down on goal was just on the heavy side, and allowed the keeper to lunge at his feet and collect the ball at the last moment.Kilsyth made it -

It was the Pupils who would concede it.In another move tinged with disappointment # the match referee failing to spot another offside in the build-up # a ball from the right flank was swung in to a player in an offside position, who held the ball up and worked it back to a central area where Finnart’s captain unleashed a strong strike high into the Pupils’ net.And while the Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils continued to work hard to claw their way back into the match they were undone with only a few minutes remaining by a smart counter-attack at the other end, which allowed Finnart’s number  to score from close range with a low, side-footed effort.On reflection, the Pupils were undone by moments of business-like quality – certainly for goals two and four from their hosts # and perhaps their own naivety against a canny and disciplined side who are challenging to win the WoSFL’s Division Four.Nevertheless, the Pupils can reflect on a decent, determined performance for much of this match.

Academy, said: “Ellie has always been a very hard-working student and always gives  per cent both in class and training at home.“To be offered the opportunity to represent not only her dance school but also Scotland in Australia is an amazing achievement and is a result of her determination and commitment.“All of the teaching staff at Dunedin Dance Academy are extremely proud of Ellie’s achievements.”Ellie will now embark on her  dancing season, with the upcoming Dance World Cup in Spain also on her busy schedule.And what of her plans for the future Ellie said: “I really want to be a choreographer at a dance school or have my own dance school, but I’m not very sure just yet – just something I can do with dancing.”Fiona also hoped that her daughter would forge a career in her passion.She said: “I think I’d like to see her become a professional dancer and definitely having a career in dance because she doesn’t think about anything .“It’s her

By closing them off, you will cut out the draught and also ensure that any heat in your property isn’t escaping into that room.A big reason why your home may not be retaining heat very well is because of draughts.Allowing cold air to get into the home will bring the overall temperature down.If you can stop these draughts from getting in, it will make a huge dference to the temperature in your home.Eating hot food will help to warm you up and the process of cooking the food will throw heat out into the kitchen and surrounding areas, meaning your home will warm up as a result.If your house is fully carpeted, then you needn’t worry about this option, as that will help insulate your home.However, you can lose a considerable amount of heat through floorboards or tiles, so putting a rug over the top can make all the dference in your home’s heat retention.If on the occasion you do have the heating on, which you should because it is good for home’s condition, then you should put foil behind your radiators to make sure the heat is forced into the room, rather than getting lost in the wall."},{"url":null,"title":"royal-mint-reveals-10-rarest-50p-coins-circulation","story":"The move to \"new money\" pounds and pence, happened  years ago this month, with the anniversary on  February .Since then, over  iations of the p coin have been circulating and several rare designs have been distributed.The famous Kew Gardens p remains the most coveted coin in circulation, with a mintage of just ,, the Mint said.Other rare designs include Olympic-themed ps minted in .Here, we look at the rarest p coins and how many of each have been made - and how much they could be worth.The  pence piece has become the most valued and collected coin in the UK, with many collectable designs appearing on its heptagonal canvas.Its .mm diameter makes it the largest of any British coin, and allows space for decorative pictures.

There will also be an opportunity for the SWPL  clubs to join the new organisation as a two tier structure is now the preferred option.All the clubs have to do to implement the change is tell SWF they wont be affiliating next season. No vote is required, and the Scottish FA will recognise the new top league as being the one which qualies teams for the Champions League.For all the reservations about the SPFL – and there are many – the organisation run by Neil Doncaster has been very proactive in the discussions over a new direction. SWF, by contrast, have come across as being reactive and seemed not to recognise that a majority of clubs wanted to know what alternative structure was on offer sooner rather than later.My understanding is that the clubs most likely to give SWF every opportunity to retain control, including Spartans, Aberdeen and Partick Thistle, contrasted the two approaches and concluded the SPFL was the better future option. Glasgow City, the only stand-alone womens club in the top ten, will go with the flow.The clubs will have representatives on the new board and the priority in the short term will be to ensure the subsidiary company is going to operate entirely in the interests of all concerned.

If you are  years old or above on the day the vaccinations are taking place in school, you will be able to access a vaccine.If you have not yet had a COVID- vaccine, it’s not too late. Appointments for first doses of COVID- vaccines are still available for anyone unvaccinated.”Is it safe to have a booster jabI’m pregnant London-based Dr Jenny Jardine from Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, who is also seven months pregnant and has had her COVID- booster jab, said: “Both as a doctor and pregnant mother myself, we can now be very confident the COVID- vaccinations provide the best possible protection for you and your unborn child against this virus. I would strongly call on all pregnant women like me,you haven’t had the vaccine yet, to either speak to your GP or midweyou still have questions and then book right away today.”Does a booster jab carry side effects Dr Okorocha said: “The COVID- vaccine is quick, easy and free. Don’t worry about the side effects. Like all medicines, the COVID- vaccines may cause some side effects, but most of these are mild and short-term, lasting no longer than a week, and not everyone gets them. Also,you weren’t able to get your booster dose because you had COVID-, remember to book your jab  days after you no longer have the virus.”How easy is it to get a booster jab Bradford-based NHS Dr Amir Khan said: “We know many people are juggling busy lives, which is exactly why the NHS is making it as easy as possible for you to get your booster. New walkin vaccination sites have been set up across the country, and existing sites have extended their opening hours, so as many people as possible can get jabbed as soon as possible. And, once you’ve had your vaccine, then why not encourage your friends and family to book as well, so we all have the best protection possible.”How effective is a booster jab Prof Patel said: “New analysis of vaccine efficacy by UKHSA has found protection against hospitalisation from vaccines is good against the Omicron iant. When the reduced risk of hospitalisation was combined with vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic disease, the vaccine effectiveness against hospitalisation was estimated as  per cent two weeks after a booster dose. One dose of any vaccine was associated with a  per cent reduced risk of hospitalisation among symptomatic cases with the Omicron iant, two doses with a  per cent reduction up to  weeks after the second dose and a  per cent reduced risk  or more weeks after the second dose.”Your booster jab is vital vw, px\"  copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Even so, there still seems to be some uncertainty about whether or not this date is set in stone. Meanwhile, there are many questions that remain unanswered about how the scheme will work in practice. #That is particular the case in our islands, where national schemes often fail to recognise local circumstances. That is why I felt it was important to bring together local stakeholders in Orkney and provide them with an opportunity to raise any questions or concerns with Circularity Scotland, the body responsible for overseeing the rollout of DRS.#I would also encourage any local business or community group with an interest in this issue to get in touch with me.#We have seen from the experience of other countries how such schemes can deliver real benefits in terms of reducing waste, litter and emissions. The success of DRS in Scotland, however, will depend on ensuring we get the details right, not just in our cities but in rural and island settings as well.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Does the minister agree with me that the UK Shared Prosperity Fund should be the source of replacement funding for organisations like EMEC, that no longer have access to Interreg funding  And what#s the Scotland Office doing to make that case within Government ”Responding for the government, Iain Stewart MP, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Scotland said:“I#m very pleased to say that I had the pleasure of visiting Stromness last summer, and saw for myself the huge potential that Orkney has to lead the country in renewable energy. I continue to speak with the Leader of Orkney Islands Council, to explore all the ways we can help fund these exciting projects.”Reacting after the exchange, Mr Carmichael said:“After years of success putting the Northern Isles on the map for green energy innovation, it could be easy to forget that the success of EMEC did not come out of nowhere. Consistent support through EU funding has reaped idends for our community and for the country as a whole. It is simply a no-brainer for the government to commit to continuing that backing in full – and I shall be making the case to the minister on this matter again.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

was three years old.With the Queen giving her blessing to Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall as a future King and Queen, it marks a signicant milestone in the prince’s destiny and in his relationship with his mother.The monarch, who has become the first British sovereign to celebrate a Platinum Jubilee, has called on the public to support the prince and the duchess when the end of her reign eventually marks the start of her son’s.Charles himself will issue a statement on the Queen’s historic Accession Day on Sunday in honour of his mother’s record-breaking reign. vw,vw,px, px\"The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall His future path to kingship had previously been boosted by the Queen, but never before has the monarch so directly referred to his future role as sovereign.The tricky question of whether the prince would take on the non-hereditary role as head of the Commonwealth when monarch was resolved in  when the Queen made a rare and public personal appeal at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in London for Charles to be chosen for the duty.“It is my sincere wish that the Commonwealth will continue to offer stability and continuity for future generations, and will decide that one day the Prince of Wales should carry on the important work started by my father in ,” she said.World leaders confirmed he would eventually succeed his mother in the symbolic role when king.Then the Queen paid her a poignant tribute to the prince at a party to celebrate his th birthday the same year. vw,vw,px, px\"The Queen formally investing her son Prince Charles with the Coronet of the Prince of Wales She described Charles as “a duchy original” and “a dedicated and respected heir to the throne to stand comparison with any in history — and a wonderful father”, adding: “Most of all, sustained by his we Camilla, he is his own man, passionate and creative.”The words served as a glowing queenly seal of approval for a future king.The past  years have already seen a royal family in transition.In , Charles opened the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meetingin Sri Lanka, representing his mother in the role for the first time.Writer Catherine Mayer, who was given rare access to the prince, said the same year that he was “joylessly” increasing his royal workload and believed becoming king would be akin to “prison”.Clarence House denied this was the case, saying this was not the prince’s view.Mayer wrote that the prince was “impatient to get as much done as possible” ahead of succeeding his mother as monarch.Charles has described how he wants to make the most of his position within the royal family.He told US’s Time magazine: “I’ve had this extraordinary feeling, for years and years, ever since I can remember really, of wanting to heal and make things better.”In , the year she turned , the Queen called time on her overseas travels, leaving long-haul destinations to the younger members of her family, and late Duke of Edinburgh retired from public duties in  at the age of .In , Charles began the practice of laying a wreath at the Cenotaph on Remembrance Sunday on behalf of the Queen as she watched from a nearby balcony instead.He announced a major restructuring of his charities ahead of his th birthday in , viewed as planning for the time when he will be king.His role as future head of the Commonwealth was secured the same year, thanks to the Queen.For the past three months, the Queen, now , has been on doctors’ orders to rest after spending a night in hospital for preliminary tests.The pandemic has led to the nation’s longest reigning monarch turning her hand to virtual appearances instead.At a Sandringham reception on the eve of her Accession Day, the Queen, whose husband Philip died in April, used a stick to rest on, but looked chatty and on form.It was her first major in-person public engagement for  weeks.Charles has dedicated decades of his le to royal duty and charitable work as he has carved out a role for himself as a king in waiting.The arts, the built environment, responsible business and enterprise, young people, global sustainability and rural affairs have been the focus of his philanthropic work.Inspired by his belief in harmony and sustainability, he has set up a host of charities, which raise more than £ million a year.His leading youth charity the Prince’s Trust helps disadvantaged and vulnerable young people, using practical support including training, mentoring and financial assistance, and is seen as one of his greatest successes.As patron of more than  organisations, Charles carries out nearly  royal engagements a year.The prince, who is known for his strong opinions, particularly on climate change and the environment, architecture and farming, has faced criticism in the past after accusations of lobbying government ministers on his views.In the s, he experienced turmoil in his private le, played out on a public stage amid his affair with Camilla Parker Bowles and his orce from Diana, Princess of Wales.In , Charles admitted adultery on national television, speaking to his biographer, Jonathan Dimbleby, while Diana subsequently went on Panorama to give a television interview in which she said there were three people in her marriage.Diana died tragically with her lover Dodi Fayed in a car crash in a Paris underpass.Grief-stricken Princes William and Harry were only  and  years old, and the Windsors faced a backlash over their treatment of Diana, dubbed the People’s Princess in the aftermath for her charity work and charm.Charles wed Camilla in ,

They had lost all seven of the matches they had played.In a statement the AOC revealed Gill had tested positive prior to the Games but had been allowed to compete under close-contact restrictions.The AOC is making arrangements for curlers Tahli Gill and Dean Hewitt toto Australia, after Tahli ed a series of positive COVID tests late yesterday.👉 https:t.co SpxEtsRkQ#ChasingWinter | #Beijing | @OWI_AUS pic hhaPkLPUo— AUS Olympic TeamFebruary , The statement confirmed: “Tahli had previously contracted Covid prior to the Games.“However, ongoing testing alternated between negative and positive. Fortunately, after discussions with the IOC and BOCOG, she had been free to compete under the Games’ close contact arrangements.“Sadly, further successive positive tests have ended their Olympic campaign.”The Australian pair played Britons Bruce Mouat and Jenner Dodds on Friday. It is understood to be unlikely that Gill’s status will impact their opponents, given she was already competing under close contact protocols.Australian Olympic Team Chef de Mission Geoff Lipshut paid tribute to Gill and Hewitt and said arrangements were being made to try to send the duo home as soon as possible.“Tahli and Dean have made Australian Winter Olympic history and there were just two matches left on their program. It’s very disappointing, but we are realistic about the rules and we have always accepted those rules,” said Lipshut.“We made the case that Tahli was at the end of the infection cycle but further positive results early this morning ended our hopes. Rather than remain in isolation, we now have the option of ing Tahli and Dean home.“They have been absolutely magnicent in the face of dficulty. Four of their seven matches went right down to the wire against the very best of opposition. It was a disrupted campaign but a very brave campaign.

Populations became more economically resilient, he said.The cost of using the Faroese tunnels was at first around the same as a ferry journey but over time as usage increased, tolls were slashed to less than a fth of that.Now, Mr Lamhauge said the debate was about whether to cut the tolls altogether.The meeting also heard questions from pupils at Mid Yell and Whalsay schools as well as input from some of the  or so people viewing the debate.Among the biggest subjects for debate was where would the first tunnel be builtMr Lamhauge said it took around  years to get such projects going.The Shetland Times...Ive been a reporter since  at newspapers in Lincolnshire and East Anglia.

They prefer instead to view Gaelic as a natural medium for their music # a not atypical outlook for their island generation raised with the language as part of their education during the s.And this should be encouraging, for the key to the future survival of the language will lie not in its exceptionalism, but in its ordinariness.While Gaelic may be natural to Niteworks, what sets them apart is how they use it. Their trademark sound is forged from the rich Hebridean song tradition of their native communities, and the dance music they listened to in their bedrooms, and later in Glasgow nightclubs.They have just released their third album # A’ Ghrian,– which follows the eponymous debut album of  and Air Fàir An Làwhich came out in .In what should have been one of the marquee events of Glasgow’s Celtic Connections festival, last Friday Niteworks should have been on stage with the Royal Scottish National Orchestra. But to immense frustration and disappointment, Covid restrictions were not been lted in time and the concert has been rescheduled for the summer.Unsurprisingly, lockdown and the pandemic are themes that have influenced the new album, says band member Allan MacDonald.. “It has been over two years since I have been to a club as a punter.“That was a huge part of our lives. I wouldn’t say it has changed our musical tastes, but what we listen to at home now is dferent to what we would listen to in a club.“That has influenced us and the direction we are going as a band. We’re also getting a bit older, there’s two in the band that have young families now and this album is perhaps a bit more reflective than the others.”It is approaching  years since the quartet put on their first gig – at Braes Hall as part of the year of Highland culture celebrations in . Their first EP followed in , and Niteworks have since become regulars on the festival circuit # including annual appearances at SkyeLive in Portree.They aren’t full time as a band, however, and online rehearsing was a familiar process to them long before the outset of the pandemic.Allan, who is from Braes and from a family of pipers, works in renewable energy and is based in London. Synth and keyboard player Innes Strachan from Breakish works in sound production in Glasgow drummer Ruaraidh Graham, also from Breakish, works in Edinburgh for Historic Environment Scotland and bass player Chris Nicolson, from Braes, is with the BBC in Inverness.One of their ‘lockdown projects’ included writing the music to mark Edinburgh’s Hogmanay, and in turn this led to the orchestral collaboration and the more ‘expansive and cinematic’ sound of the new album, says Ruairidh Graham.“We were partly inspired by our work writing the music for Edinburgh’s Hogmanay Fare Well film that reflected on what  had been like for many during the pandemic,” he adds. “The nature of the project required broad expansive sounds, and that led to us going further in that direction through the writing and recording of the album.“Our upcoming orchestral concert for Celtic Connections further reinforced our desire to keep down that path.”There is an abundance of vocal talent to be found on A’ Ghrian, including from long-time collaborators Sian . Celebrated Scottish singers Kathleen MacInnes, Beth Malcolm, Hannah Rarity and Alasdair Whyte also feature, and Niteworks have incorporated English folk and Scots songs into their repertoire for the first time.The album, which was funded by Creative Scotland and recorded in autumn , also features Fiona MacAskill, Aileen Reid and Laura Wilkie of Kinnaris Quintet alongside Susan Appelbe on strings.A’ Ghrian is available to buy on CD and stream and download on all digital s, and the band will tour the until the end of . A documentary on the band is also due to be aired on BBC Alba soon."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Mating-male-and-female-adders-Vipera-berus.-©Lorne-GillNatureScot-1-scaled.jpg","title":"tobar an dualchais brides day the birthday of","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine or ‘the dead month’.   or Saint Bride’s Day. This falls in with ‘Candlemas’ on nd February as a Christian festival and a traditional end of the Christmas season. Candlemas commemorates the presentation of the infant Jesus at the Temple in Jerusalem as described in St Luke’s Gospel and when some denominations bring candles to their church. Candlemas is also one of the so-called ‘Quarter-days’ marking the changing seasons of winter, spring, summer and autumn. It is followed by Whitsun, Lammas Day and Martinmas as the term-days with their administrative and legal implications for the payment of rents and flittings. Saint Bride or Saint Bridget has been one of the most popular of the saints of the celtic church. Of course, there were many ‘Bridgets’, but the one whose festival date is on st February was ‘Bridget of Kildare’ in Leinster whose death was dated to AD . Bridget was one of the patron saints of Ireland and is remembered in the tradition of plaiting rush crosses around st February to set over doors and windows to protect the home from fire and other danger.   or the endearing ‘Bride’s little fosterling’.’ . ‘Bride’s Day, the birthday of spring’. century, traditions of Saint Bride were collected by Alexander Carmichael among his prayers, hymns, blessings and charms from the Hebrides. He suggests that accounts of Saint Bride were not easily recovered and summarised the tradition: ‘The serpent is supposed to emerge from its hollow among the hills on St Bride’s Day, and a propitiatory hymn was sung to it. Only one verse of this hymn has been obtained, apparently the first. It dfers in dferent localities: [Early on Bride’s mornThe serpent shall come from the hole, I shall not molest the serpent, Nor will the serpent molest me.’ The snake is a powerful element in mythology and religion and a creature to be respected as the ‘hymn’ makes clear. Familiar in the snake coiled round the rod, it is a symbol of medicine and healing, and the appearance of the adder or snake on Saint Bride’s Day offers a feeling of hope and transformation, and of turning the corner with the ening of the days. . century. .!... !"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Donnie-Munro-picture-scaled.jpg","title":"special donnie munro concert to bring skye live back with a","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe island#s premier music festival is set toin style on Thursday th May # following a two-year break due to the pandemic # with an opening night extravaganza # ‘Coming Home: An Evening with Donnie Munro and friends’ and featuring special guests in the form of multi-award-winning Gaelic supergroup Mànran.The show will be Donnie’s first in his hometown since  and will see him perform with a full eight-piece band line-up on the spectacular Skye Live Festival site at Am Meall in Portree. The singer said: #This offers me a fantastic opportunity to bring this amazing line-up, featuring some of Scotland’s top musicians together, for an exclusive performance to open this year’s Skye Live Festival.He added: #It has been fantastic to watch the festival grow in strength, year on year, in what must be one of the most special and unique festival locations anywhere in the world, and to see it become internationally recognised as, ‘one of the best boutique festivals in the country’, is just fantastic for the island, and it is such a great honour for me to be invited to be a part of it all and to be bringing the music back home here to where it all began.#Joining Donnie Munro on the night will be Mànran, internationally recognised as one of the most iconic and respected Scottish bands on the road today.

They all have had their own personalities and have brought dferent qualities to the job and I’ve enjoyed working alongside each one.”Another positive change Muriel witnessed was the reduction of the speed limit outside the school to mph.“This really helps,” explains Muriel. “It’s such a busy road, especially with all the lorries coming from Larne so mph at arriving and leaving times is vital.“I’ve had a few near misses with speeding vehicles over the years soeveryone sticks to the mph limit it makes it alot safer for the children.”Although looking forward to her retirement, there are aspects of the job Muriel says she will greatly miss.“I’ll miss everyone I work with and of course the children! “I’ll also miss waving at everyone in the mornings and afternoons because I’ve built up alot of friendships over the years and got to know alot of the parents. I made a great friend through the school, Stella Rea who has sadly passed away, but she was something  and a great lady!“I’ll also miss the children and hearing all their stories and woes! I’ve seen many a fall and tumble and witnessed many games in the playground over the years and can truthfully say I’ve enjoyed every minute.”Chairman of the school’s Board of Governors, Mr Jim Allister paid tribute to Muriel’s years of service. He said: “Often schools are valued and judged on the quality of their teaching etc, but equally often the role played by the support staff is taken for granted.“In Muriel we had for decades that invaluable asset of a dedicated partner in delivering the pastoral care and support to our pupils for which Moorfields is renowned.“Not only has she kept generations of children safe in crossing the very busy main road, but she has been that reliable, compassionate point of contact for so many. Through all weathers, Muriel was there to do her remarkable job with the understatement that betokens her caring commitment.“The school is immensely grateful for her decades of service and wish her well in her retirement.”As Mrs Cupples embarks on this next phase of her le away from Moorfields Primary School she was keen to thank all the staff, pupils and parents for their support over the years.“I just want to say thank you to every single one of you who have made my time here so pleasant. Also a massive thanks for all the gts, the cake, the cards and well wishes you all have given me.

Wrightbus sales and business development director, John McLeister, is a huge advocate of apprenticeships. He joined the firm  years ago as an apprentice before working his way up through the ranks.“We’re proud to say our apprentices are playing a key part in driving the business forward,” said Mr McLeister. “We eventually want to have up to  per cent of our workforce on an apprenticeship, via our ious Engineering  Technology Higher Apprenticeship programmes and our general Apprenticeship NI scheme, and this latest recruitment drive will help with that ambition.“They bring ersity, bags of enthusiasm and a fresh approach to problem-solving.”Wrightbus apprentices receive on the job training, working alongside a highly skilled workforce who often act as coaches mentors, along with a college day release programme to back up what they’re learning.Former apprentice Karsten Hall, who started as a design apprentice and now works as a manufacturing engineer, chose a Wrightbus apprenticeship because he wanted to make a start in the world of work.“I wanted a job that provided training and opportunities for progression. I was interested in engineering, so I decided to apply for a Wrightbus apprenticeship,” said Karsten.“From my time on the shopfloor, I gained a lot of hands-on experience with most parts of the build process and a better perspective of how parts are actually assembled and how they can be improved, which helps me in my current role as a manufacturing engineer.”Wrightbus employee Hannah Currie said: “Learning with hands-on experience made a big dference for me, helping with the progression of my career. ‘The experience working with the time-served tradesmen and women, and having such a iety of technology and buses can help you develop so much more knowledge and skills to help you along the way.

We will continue to partner with the company to identy their training requirements and look forward to strengthening the College’s partnership with Wrightbus in the future.”The National Campaign celebrates the contribution that hundreds of thousands of apprentices make every year to the UK’s economy and encourages more businesses to look to apprenticeships as a solution for recruitment, training, and workforce development. Wrightbus HR Director, Nicola McCloskey, said: “Our apprentices are an invaluable part of our business and we would like to recognise them and thank them for the hard work and effort they put in. They often bring with them new skills and energy, and we’re looking forward to adding to the ranks with this latest round of recruitment.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1643983884189.jpg--covid_19___fri_4th_february_figures.jpg?1643983884000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20220204newscovid 19 fri 4th february figures","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows one further coronavirus related death and , new positive test results.

Credit: Kelvin Boyes   Press Eye. FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueProfessor Mike TildesleyLisa SmythTwitterFebruary   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailTake a quick glance at the Department of Health’s Covid- dashboard, and it is obvious that cases of the virus are surging in young people.There have been , positive cases in children aged five to nine over the past seven days. A further , youngsters in the  to -year-old bracket tested positive over the same period.If the figures don’t convince you, speak to any parent. Families that have managed to steer clear of Covid since it arrived almost two years ago are now being struck down by the virus.First, a classmate who is a close contact of a parent with Covid comes to school. Under the rules, they’re allowed to attend as long as they have a negative lateral flow test for  days, but many are going on to develop a Covid infection they then pass on to classmates.It doesn’t help that a child can spend all day sitting next to a friend who later tests positive for Covid — and they are not even considered a close contact.Then, the virus ripples out through year groups. Siblings become infected and, very quickly, large swathes of multiple year groups are unwell and isolating.Professor Ian Young, the chief scientic adviser, said that the highly infectious nature of Omicron meant most schools would be hit by an outbreak,they had not been already.The situation is further exacerbated by the fact that most children are not vaccinated, and there is evidence that previous Delta and Alpha infections do not protect against Omicron.“There is quite a large proportion of under-s with limited immunity,” said Prof Young.“What tends to happenthe virus gets into a classroom or school [is that] it will transmit pretty easily. While [the protections] can reduce the risk, they can’t stop it completely.“There are some schools with quite severe outbreaks and other schools which have had not so much Covid, but sooner or later, most schools are going to have to experience some virus.”So, while we know children are less likely to suffer severe illness from Covid-, it does not mean the impact on their lives is not severe.Even for those children who are asymptomatic, and setting aside the threat posed by long Covid, self-isolation rules are taking their toll on schools.NASUWT national official Justin McCamphill said: “We’re hearing instances where half the school is off with Covid, and then in some schools, it’s half the teachers.“That’s then having a major impact because whole year groups are having to be sent home, and I think that’s being borne out by the absence figures.“That’s causing real anxiety, especially for the exam classes. “I would say this is the worst we have ever seen. It’s becoming impossible for schools to run normal business.”Mental health champion Siobhan O’Neill is also concerned about Covid’s impact in schools.“There have been studies that show really clearly that young people have been displaying signs of stress throughout the pandemic, and young people need their peers to cope with stress,” she said.“They play together to help process that stress. When they don’t get that chance to be together, it does have an impact.“The short answer is there will be an impact on children’s mental health. Most children will be fine, but young people will develop mental ill-health.”Prof O’Neill said this could manest itself in a number of ways, including eating disorders and self-harm behaviours used as a coping mechanism.We know that the negative impact of the lockdowns on children was a major driving factor in reopening schools and keeping them open even as the highly infectious Omicron strain arrived on these shores.But with case rates now so high, when can families and schools expect some respite With , new cases and a further death in a person aged over  recorded yesterday, it is obvious Covid has not disappeared. Yet, Professor Mike Tildesley, an expert in infectious disease modelling at the University of Warwick, is hopeful the situation in schools will begin to improve in the coming weeks.“It’s always hard to predict, but my hope is that we get towards the end of February and start to see cases go down,” he said.However, he warned the removal of other restrictions was likely to result in at least a plateau in the case rate. “The situation is slightly complicated by the end of interventions,” he said.Prof Young is also optimistic that we may soon begin to see a downward trend in case numbers, which will eventually allow more children and teachers toto classes.“We have seen an overall increase in the case numbers of over %, and that’s been largely driven by cases in people aged  and under,” he said.“We have also seen a small increase in adults between  and , and I’m pretty sure those are parents of schoolchildren [because] there is a high risk of household transmission once Covid gets into a household.“There is a secondary peak, and I don’t think we’re over the top yet.“I think that there is a big question over how rapidly it’s going to decline. “It could be relatively slow and, certainly, it could take a number of weeks, but I would expect it to be well declined by Easter.”With Covid expected to continue to circulate at fairly high levels in schools in the coming months, what do the experts believe should be put in place to help alleviate the situation Prof Young said continuing measures such as ventilation, face coverings and vaccination would prove crucial.However, Prof Tildesley said he would like to see face coverings removed from school settings as soon as possible.Meanwhile, Prof O’Neill called for vaccinations to be made available to younger age groups.“There is evidence of increased hospitalisation of children with Covid,” he said.“I’m disappointed that vaccination isn’t available to children, I think, at the very least, there should be that choice so parents can weigh up the benefits versus the risks.”Related topicsDepartment of HealthDepartment of EducationMore On Department of HealthPolitical instability the last thing NI needs, says business chief Simon Hamilton PremiumScrapping hospital car park charges in Northern Ireland ‘would cost cash-strapped health chiefs almost £m a year’ and could damage patient care, Stormont toldOver £k to be allocated to three mental health organisations in south and west BelfastNewry district tops league table for highest Covid infection rates in UK PremiumIrish FA chiefs front up and tackle the burning questions as they launch their new strategy - A Roadmap for FootballMost ReadSam McBrideOpinionPeculiar moves by DUP hint at party spat undermining sea border strategyDonna Traynor discrimination case against BBC set to open on ThursdayA measure of support for DUP’s great gamble in the heartland of unionismPaddy McCourt #absolutely denies# sexual assault allegationViral footage shows fridge being destroyed in Holyland area of BelfastTop VideosPlayEast Belfast reacts to First Minister Paul Givan#s resignationPlayth anniversary commemoration for  Sean Graham#s bookmakers atrocity on Belfast#s Ormeau RoadPlayVideo: *Graphic content* Iraqi soldiers reportedly executed by ISISLatest CoronavirusMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling averageCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Three deaths and , new cases reportedNI head teachers facing ‘chaos’ amid Covid battle and budget cuts, says association chiefHealth Minister Robin Swann facing judicial review over treatment of NI care home residents during pandemic‘PM made a mockery of my lowest point’, says Co Down man who stood outside graveyard while daughter was buriedLatestIan KeatleyOpinionUlster now need to develop a ruthless streak to reach next level and really challenge LeinsterQueen’s show of support for heir to the throne Charles as future kingMichael SadlierOpinionIn beating Wales, this was akin to a training ground exercise for IrelandLiam BeckettOpinionDon’t let the small group of idiots ruin the fanfare in Irish League footballDavid Healy can go right to the top of management game, says his midfield-general, Chris Shields,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It did not comment when asked about how much of the £.m was intended for bank charges.Mr Lyons said the scheme had been a huge success, with .m cards dispatched, and spending using the cards had boosted the economy by £.m.Related topicsGordon LyonsDepartment for the EconomyUlster Unionist PartyAlan ChambersMore On Gordon Lyons PremiumViewpointOpinionWorking at home now a viable option PremiumPoliticians question Invest NI handing out £.m to fossil fuel extraction firmsDress to impress: ASOS seeks new NI tech recruitsStormont minister Lyons ‘confident’ over Boris Johnson’s pledge to replace EU fundingHigh Street scheme payments to , accounts ‘won’t have to be spent local’Most ReadSam McBrideOpinionPeculiar moves by DUP hint at party spat undermining sea border strategyDonna Traynor discrimination case against BBC set to open on ThursdayA measure of support for DUP’s great gamble in the heartland of unionismPaddy McCourt #absolutely denies# sexual assault allegationViral footage shows fridge being destroyed in Holyland area of BelfastTop VideosPlayEast Belfast reacts to First Minister Paul Givan#s resignationPlayth anniversary commemoration for  Sean Graham#s bookmakers atrocity on Belfast#s Ormeau RoadPlayLook inside Northern Ireland#s Game of Thrones Studio TourLatest Northern IrelandIan KeatleyOpinionUlster now need to develop a ruthless streak to reach next level and really challenge LeinsterDavid Healy can go right to the top of management game, says his midfield-general, Chris ShieldsDonna Traynor discrimination case against BBC set to open on ThursdayFamilies vow to get justice on th anniversary of Ormeau Road bookies atrocityCovid and children in Northern Ireland: ‘It’s becoming impossible to operate normal school business’LatestIan KeatleyOpinionUlster now need to develop a ruthless streak to reach next level and really challenge LeinsterQueen’s show of support for heir to the throne Charles as future kingMichael SadlierOpinionIn beating Wales, this was akin to a training ground exercise for IrelandLiam BeckettOpinionDon’t let the small group of idiots ruin the fanfare in Irish League footballDavid Healy can go right to the top of management game, says his midfield-general, Chris Shields,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

However, the numbers slowly dwindled, and by  only three remained — Maggie, Ginger and Furby.The trio, nicknamed the ‘securi-cats’ by former Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness, made the headlines in  after a number of retired civil servants were banned from caring for the animals.Despite having looked out for their furry friends for years and feeding them every day, they were denied access after being deemed a “security risk”.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Thanks to this newspaper, however, the group soon secured freedom of access to the cats once again.In , Ginger and Furbie died just weeks apart, leaving Maggie alone on the estate for the past few years. As the final Stormont cat finally takes her leave, her departure has been described as the “end of an era.”Maggie is of a similar age to Larry the cat, who has served as ‘chief mouser’ to the Cabinet Office at  Downing Street for the past  years.While she may not share the fame or following of Larry’ssocial media account, Maggie is highly thought of by those who knew her.Peter Cardwell, who previously served as a special adviser to the late Northern Ireland Secretary James Brokenshire, said that seeing Maggie as he walked into work always brightened up his day.He added: “I was a huge fan of the cats. I’m a cat person and I took a real interest in them soon after starting at Stormont House.“I remember Stormont collapsing in early . At that time, it was a very serious job and there weren’t too many laughs for a while. “But just seeing the cats and talking about them, they brought a smile to people’s faces.”“I recall having a conversation with James Brokenshire about the cats which Lord Caine, who had been a special adviser to numerous Northern Ireland Secretaries, was also listening to.“We were walking along a corridor and he said he had learned more about the cats in the last  seconds than he had in all his years at Stormont House.”It is understood that Maggie’s departure comes as the Northern Ireland Office prepares to move out of Stormont House and into a new location in Belfast city centre.Related topicsPaul GivanMore On Paul Givan PremiumJon TongeOpinionGambling with future of NI politics will never pay off PremiumSam McBrideOpinionPeculiar moves by DUP hint at party spat undermining sea border strategy PremiumA measure of support for DUP’s great gamble in the heartland of unionism PremiumViewpointOpinionCrisis at Stormont means we all suffer PremiumSuzanne BreenOpinionDonaldson had no choice, but his risky tactic could backfireMost ReadSam McBrideOpinionPeculiar moves by DUP hint at party spat undermining sea border strategyDonna Traynor discrimination case against BBC set to open on ThursdayA measure of support for DUP’s great gamble in the heartland of unionismPaddy McCourt #absolutely denies# sexual assault allegationViral footage shows fridge being destroyed in Holyland area of BelfastTop VideosPlayEast Belfast reacts to First Minister Paul Givan#s resignationPlayth anniversary commemoration for  Sean Graham#s bookmakers atrocity on Belfast#s Ormeau RoadPlayVideo: *Graphic content* Iraqi soldiers reportedly executed by ISISLatest Northern IrelandIan KeatleyOpinionUlster now need to develop a ruthless streak to reach next level and really challenge LeinsterDavid Healy can go right to the top of management game, says his midfield-general, Chris ShieldsDonna Traynor discrimination case against BBC set to open on ThursdayFamilies vow to get justice on th anniversary of Ormeau Road bookies atrocityCovid and children in Northern Ireland: ‘It’s becoming impossible to operate normal school business’LatestIan KeatleyOpinionUlster now need to develop a ruthless streak to reach next level and really challenge LeinsterQueen’s show of support for heir to the throne Charles as future kingMichael SadlierOpinionIn beating Wales, this was akin to a training ground exercise for IrelandLiam BeckettOpinionDon’t let the small group of idiots ruin the fanfare in Irish League footballDavid Healy can go right to the top of management game, says his midfield-general, Chris Shields,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

resolved in  when the Queen made a rare and public personal appeal at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in London for Charles to be chosen for the duty.“It is my sincere wish that the Commonwealth will continue to offer stability and continuity for future generations, and will decide that one day the Prince of Wales should carry on the important work started by my father in ,” she

the Windsors faced a backlash over their treatment of Diana, dubbed the People’s Princess in the aftermath for her charity work and charm.Charles wed Camilla in , and the pair have been married for

They went through a few phases, allowing their out half to burst through a couple of tackles to score and take a - half time lead.Playing with the conditions in the second half, Ballynahinch started the on the front foot but fell foul of the referee at the breakdown, allowing Lurgan to pin them back in their own .The visiting forwards then went to work, carrying hard and scoring another try.The conversion left the home side  points down, but they hit back almost immediately with some great attacking rugby creating space for Callum McCargo to smash his way over.The game was on the line at this point, but a lack of composure allowed the excellent Lurgan full back to punish weak tackling and score a long range try.Left with a mountain to climb, Ballynahinch once again played some superb rugby with great interplay between centres James Graham and Harvey Campbell creating space for Sam Hamilton to dash for the line.He was stopped short but desperate Lurgan defending saw them receive a yellow card before Matthew McAuley reduced the deficit to five points with a try from a quickly taken penalty.A smash-and-grab victory against  men with only a minute on the clock demanded error-free rugby and after an excellent restart Ballynahinch moved upfield.However a knock-on saw the referee blow his whistle for full time and Lurgan earned a deserved victory.Both sides can be proud and the game was played in a superb spirit with the teams having lunch together in the clubhouse..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2February2020_Mourne.jpg","title":"Beauty of local landscapes feature in exploration events  ","story":"SEVERAL familiar locations in Downpatrick, Newcastle and Strangford are at the heart of this monthrsquos Northern Ireland Science Festival.There will be a selection of events between February  and  with people across the district encouraged to explore something new as ious venues prepare to play host to a series of stirring events.The so-called STEM celebration mdash which has grown to become the largest of its kind in Ireland mdash boasts more than  events over  days.On February , the St Patrick Centre in Downpatrick is the venue for the Patrick  The Pagan Hills event which provides an opportunity to follow in the footsteps of both the patron saint and pagan in an exploration of the landscape that Patrick himself encountered when he ed to Ireland nearly , years ago.On February  and , the Strangford Activity Centre is hosting a ldquopaddle back in time kayak adventure to Mahee Island following a traditional smuggling route undertaken by Daft Eddie and the Merry Hearts.There will also be an opportunity to discover ruins of the monastic site of Nendrum, le in the monastery in the Middle Ages and the role played by the Vikings in the Strangford Lough area between the th and th centuries.The Strangford Activity Centre is also hosting ldquopaddle with a purpose on February  and  with participants invited to do their bit for the environment by joining a clean-up of Strangford Lough.And ldquoforaging afloat on February  and  at the same venue sees people joining with the Centrersquos Rory Martin and Andrea and Graham Gannon of Peninsula Kelp for a unique guide to the sights and flavour of the area as spring arrives on the lough and with it an array of seasonal wild food.On February , therersquos an opportunity to discover the wonders of the Mournes at a range of festival events.During the Diamond Rock Walking Tour on February , guide Peter Rafferty will explains how to identy erse rock types and how the Mournes were formed, alongside learning about the amazing geology and history of the area at the Geology on the Rocks event on February .The following day, the Men of Mourne ndash Stone  Steel hiking tour takes place with an opportunity to hear stories of hardship and endurance as participants take to rocky mountain tracks.During the Mourne Stone Walling ndash A Granite Kingdom event, therersquos a chance to experience the beauty and hard graft behind the ,-year-old craft of dry-stone wall building. A date for the event has yet to be confirmed.On February  at the Newcastle Community Cinema, Film Hub NI is inviting families to a special screening of lsquoThe Snail and the Whalersquo, a joyous, empowering story about the natural wonders of the world and discovering that no matter how small you are, you can make a dference.And to coincide with this special screening, NI Science Festival has organised an interactive seashore adventure with Beach Schools NI which will take place a short walk from the cinema and is included in the ticket price.Festival director, Chris McCreery, said the event exists to engage audiences, stimulate discussion, and ignite interest in the wonders of science, technology, engineering and mathematics.ldquoWe are confident that this yearrsquos erse programming will expand the horizons of festival goers of all ages and abilities across Northern Ireland, he added.The Science Festival is supported by the Department for the Economy, Belfast City Council, Tourism NI, Derry City and Strabane Council, Queenrsquos University,Ulster University, British Council Northern Ireland, MCS Group, The Open University NI, Innovate UK, Matrix NI, Film Hub NI and Arts and Business NI..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2February2020_CD.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C  February 5%2C 1992  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK ndash The Downe Hospital has been identied as the possible site of a new police station in Downpatrick.The Police Authority has expressed an interest in the large site in a move which would pave the way for the construction of a new Downe Hospital, utilising Lecale House and the Maternity Hospital as the core buildings on the Ardglass Road.The present Downe Hospital, medical assessment unit and nurses home would then be completely demolished to make way for a new police base.Police Authority officials toured the hospital complex before Christmas and are reported to be impressed with both the size of the site and its central location.The officials have also held informal discussions with representatives of the Eastern Health Board who are also believed to be attracted to the plan.The revenue generated by the sale of the massive complex would go a long way to paying for the construction of a new hospital which politicians have called for on numerous occasions.A spokeswoman for the Police Authority said it is not normal policy to comment on such matters, and she added that there is still a commitment to build a new police base on the Ballydugan Road.Although the Authority has obtained outline planning permission for the Ballydugan Road site, it is believed that the nature of the land and the potential size of the highly fortied station is causing concern.Publicly the Authority is pressing ahead with plans to build there, but behind the scenes it has continued to look at possible sites in ious town locations.The Downe Hospital has now emerged as the surprise front-runner although evensuch an ambitious plan is approved, it will be many years before a police station is operational on the site.ARDGLASS ndash A special sub-committee has been set up by Down District Council to consider the European Communityrsquos review of the common fisheries policy.The committee is to be empowered to provide a response to the document.Ardglass SDLP councillor, Mr Dermot Curran, said some of the systems that were being introduced by the EC are not very helpful to the people employed in the fishing industry. Others were, such as decommissioning, but are not being put into action.ldquoIn all of these schemes there is nothing to protect the people employed in the industry. Government must do something to help the plight of these people, said Mr Curran.He complained that these workers are treated as casual labour with no claim to redundancy or national assistance.ldquoThe fishing industry plays a very important part in the economy of Northern Ireland and we must protect it and the people who work in it. Government should set up systems to ensure that everybody is treated fairly, he said.Ulster Unionist, Mr Gerry Douglas, said something has to be done to assist and to at least ensure that the processing industry is retained in Down District.KILLINCHY ndash The  new jobs announced by the Northern Ireland Spinners group as part of a pound.m investment will have no direct impact on its Killinchy factory.A spokesman for the company explained following Thursdayrsquos official announcement that the expansion of the firmrsquos sister factory in Newtownards will have no adverse impact on the Killinchy operation.ldquoThey are sister factories, both concentrating on very similar yarns, he said.ldquoWe have already completed major expansions at Killinchy, virtually replacing all the machinery we had. Killinchy is a very modern mill, as modern as Newtownards, he added.Mr Ray Dinsdale, chief executive of Richards Plc, the Aberdeen-based parent company of Northern Ireland Spinners, said: ldquoThis investment will strengthen the position of Northern Ireland Spinners as the largest United Kingdom spinner of semi-worsted yarns for carpet manufacturers.ldquoOur strategy is based on the expansion of the business into Europe, and the investment will mean that Northern Ireland Spinners will be of the size required to enable it to offer the economies of scale and cost reductions which are required to win business from major carpet manufacturers in these competitive markets, added Mr Dinsdale.CROSSGAR ndash Crossgarrsquos loss has been Bangorrsquos gain with a -job factory picking up an important quality certication.The firm of Dunn and CompanyLtd. was set up in Crossgar in , and it has now picked up the BS quality certication.After four years of trading, the company relocated from its premises in Crossgar to a factory unit based in Balloo industrial estate, Bangor.It manufacturers special purpose valves and precision components for industrial application with  per cent of it business going to the export market.It currently employs  people and has plans for further expansion, explained Mr Ron Dunn, managing director.When asked why the company left Crossgar, Mr Ron Dunn, managing director said: ldquoThere was not enough room in Crossgar.ldquoWe occupied part of the premises of my brother, Sam, but there was just nothing available in the Crossgar area at that time when we employed three of four people.His brother continues his own successful firm manufacturing machine tools on the Saintfield Road, Crossgar.BISHOPSCOURT ndash Planning Service officials have been urged to attend next monthrsquos first bike race at the former Bishopscourt base ndash before reaching a decision on a planning application for a permanent circuit.The plea has been made this week by local SDLP councillor, Mr John Ritchie.ldquoI would expect they will understand the necessity to attend to make an informed judgement on the matter, explained Mr Ritchie.ldquoAfter that date I would hope a decision would not be long delayed.Mr Ritchie said he had read the petition against the proposed race track and seen the comments of those members of the Ballyhornan Development Association who support the proposal. He had also read the details given by the two developers.ldquoThere are a number of issues involved. I understand that there can be up to  meetings without planning permission per year the equivalent of one a month and two a month in two summer months. I would have thought this wasnrsquot unreasonable.SAINTFIELD ndash The centre of Saintfield was sealed off for three hours on Friday afternoon after the discovery of a suspicious package in a telephone box.The area around Crossgar Road and Toddrsquos Hill was closed as army bomb disposal experts carried out an examination of the device.The device which consisted of cassettes, a battery pack and wires, was described as an elaborate hoax and was taken away for examination.NEWCASTLE ndash Mentally handicapped people from all over Northern Ireland will soon be benefitting from a remarkable transformation at Newcastlersquos Ruby House.For the past year passers-by have seen the conversion of the Bryansford Road complex from a row of not-so-attractive seaside resort houses into aspacious and modern residential home which now offers accommodation for  mentally handicapped adults.This year the holiday home is expected to provide upwards of  holidays for mentally handicapped people from all over the Province.The Ruby House Group now has three centres in Newcastle, including a converted house in Main Street and the purpose-built Mary Murray House in the Lawnfield.STRANGFORD ndash A single Strangford Lough management committee is to be launched in the spring by the Environment Department.It will consist of about  representatives of lough users, the community around the lough and those with specialist knowledge of the area.This weekrsquos announcement reflects some of the views expressed by the Strangford Lough Nature Conservation Association the body which was set up a few years ago in protest against restrictive DoE proposals.The new body will have the development of management proposals for the lough area as its main task.

Connor Kelly had a chance for the visitors, but Celtic Bhoysrsquo goalkeeper, Nathan Curran, was on form and saved.It was a balanced game as both sides had their chances with Killoughrsquos Kevin Groves coming close in the th minute and Celtic Bhoysrsquo Jordan McCoubrey pushing forwarding search of an opportunity in front of the net.Killoughrsquos Gareth George had to be subbed due to an injury on his ankle and Declan Looney came on in the rd minute of the game. Jack McLaughlin had a one on one chance facing Curran, but the ball went straight at the lsquokeeper before it was cleared.The visitors were keeping up the pressure to level the score, with a surging run up the left wing from Looney, who passed across to find Connor Kelly, but again Nathan Curran saved.The second goal of the game came from a similar scenario to the first ndash a lacklustre kick out that found the feet of Jay Gibney again and Celtic Bhoys went two up going into half-time.Two errors by Killoughrsquos goalkeeper saw the hosts leading at half-time and all of the play was going down the right side of the field.Killough signalled their intentions that the game was not over, as Declan Looney looped the ball into the danger zone, and Nathan Curran somehow got his hand to it to push over the bar.Jay Gibney was set for his hat-trick in the th minute when the Killough custodian came out to stop him in his tracks. Gibney managed to manoeuvre round him, but the ball was cleared by Sean Burns. Celtic Bhoys had another chance to go three up, as three of their players from a free-kick stood looking at one another and the chance went a miss.Killoughrsquos Declan Burns played a great ball from the middle of the field to Declan Looney, who found team-mate Daniel Taggart. The striker saw his shot saved, but the rebound fell to Kevin Groves, who finished to bring his side back into the game with  minutes to go.Celtic Bhoys made a couple of substitutes in the next ten minutes, with Sean McMahon going up front and Sean Ferris ping back into midfield.As the clock ticked to the th minute, Killoughrsquos McLaughlin fired in a free-kick to the head of Eamon Gargan.However, man of the match Nathan Curran pushed the ball at full stretch over the bar.In the final five minutes of play it was all attack by Killough. Kevin Groves had a chance which was denied with Declan Looney quickly following up, although there was no way to find the leveller. It was in the last minute that the Killough goalkeeper made a clearance mistake that saw Shaun Megahey score to break Killough hearts.Celtic Bhoys will be very happy with the win, while Killough will count their missed chances. Nathan Curran made the dference in a tight game, and Killoughrsquos young Crangle will have learnt a lot from the contest for the remaining matches of the season.Celtic Bhoys: N Curran, S Megahey, R Quinn, R Fitzpatrick, M Rice, C Doherty, B Tracey, P Casey, J Gibney, J McCoubrey, C Kerr.Subs: E Kelly for P Casey, S McMahon for J McCoubrey, S Ferris for Conaill Kerr.Killough FC: J Crangle, R Burns, E Gargan, C Burns, S Og Burns, D Burns, C Kelly, G George, D Taggart, K Groves, J McLaughlin.Subs: D Looney for G George, K Tierney, C Doyle..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2February2020_Wave.jpg","title":"It’s like a little  safe haven here%2C somewhere you can come and cry and not get judged  ","story":"TEARS still spring easily to the eyes of Dympna Kerr, the sister of Columba McVeigh, one of the lsquoDisappearedrsquo victims.Once she begins to talk about her  year-old brother, whose body has never been recovered after he was abducted and murdered by the IRA in , after nearly  years of dealing with his loss the pain remains.Last weekend, the Donaghmore woman left her home in St Helenrsquos in Merseyside to travel to a welcoming building in the coastal village of Killough.At the newly named Wave By The Sea centre in Castle Street, Dympna spent precious time speaking with longstanding friends who are also relatives of the Disappeared. The main dference is that they have been fortunate to locate the bodies of their loved one. Several searches have yet toher brotherrsquos remains to the family but they remain hopeful.ldquoItrsquos like a little safe haven here, somewhere you can come and cry and not get judged. The people you are crying to know why you are crying as they understand, explained Dympna about her lasting need to connect with people with shared experience.ldquoGoing to the Wave house in Belfast is like going home. Itrsquos like getting a hug as soon as you go across the door. And itrsquos the same here as Irsquove already been several times.The help and support of the iniduals who make up the Wave Trauma Centre quietly helps thousands of people like Dympna who have been bereaved, injured and or traumatised by the decades of conflict in Northern Ireland.The building has been provided by the local trustees of The Kinder Project, a charitable Dutch organisation that began its association with Northern Ireland in the s for the education and social welfare of disadvantaged children and young adults.The hostel now provides residential breaks for a maximum of  people, providing rooms for families and iniduals, who use the time to break away from their lives still traumatised and dealing with the physical and emotional aftermath.Counselling and complimentary therapy sessions are offered and other courses are provided by Wave to help those who come, many of whom have never sought help before.Itrsquos the sixth centre around the province that Wave has established, along with r satellite projects, with support funding from the Victims and Support Service, NI Executive, Special EU Programmes Body and charitable donations.One of the Troubles survivors who wished the service had been available locally for him and his family is Killough man Peter Heathwood.Peter knows the benefit of support from Wave. In September  he was left paralysed after a Loyalist gun attack in his Belfast home as he played with his youngest daughter in his living room mdash bullets missing the baby by inches.His attack was witnessed by his late we and two eldest children. His father Hubert died from a heart attack at the scene when he saw his apparently dead son.As a member of the Wave Injured Group, he has campaigned for years for a state pension for people left physically or psychologically injured from the conflict.He has yet to receive his pension, even though he applied for it last autumn.ldquoI had to travel to Belfast night and day and only discovered Wave when I went on to the Victimsrsquo Forum years after my shooting, said Peter.ldquoMy we died at  with a diagnosis of PTSD and suffered with flashbacks. If I had found Wave earlier, I reckon it could have saved her as she could have met other women and shared stories and experiences.ldquoWhen I was shot, I passed out but she saw me lying there with blood pumping out of me, children screaming and my father dying. She could never deal with the fact that she opened the door to the gunmen. But I told her thatshe hadnrsquot have shouted a warning to me, I would have been dead as I was able to get up and slam the door.ldquoEven in this village, there are people who moved from Belfast and a lot of them lost relatives in the Troubles, uncles, fathers, grandfathers and many of them never speak about it. I didnrsquot really talk about it to my own children as you didnrsquot want them to be filled with hate.Peter said that even on holiday when people asked what happened to him, he would say he was injured skiing in the French Alps, a more sanitised version of his attack mdash purportedly in mistake for another man mdash as he enjoyed an evening at home with his family.ldquoWave is a fantastic organisation. We are completely cross-community. Everyone has been hurt by all groups and thatrsquos the great strength of it, said Peter.ldquoI would really encourage anyone who has affected by the Troubles and has never sought help to come along to Wave. Itrsquos never too late to talk.Waversquos chief executive officer, Sandra Peake, says that the new centre will help  people in the immediate area and around  from the district, in addition to providing weekend residential breaks from families across Northern Ireland, Britain and the Irish Republic.ldquoThis wouldnrsquot have been possible without the generosity of the Kinder Project, explained Sandra, who said that the building has been fitted out to reflect a more comfortable family style accommodation.ldquoWe had initially done some work in Downpatrick about  years ago to see what we could have provided but have always been keen to provide a local base, which Kinder has now provided to us.ldquoThe welcome from the people and the shopkeepers of Killough has been brilliant. They seem to know why our visitors are staying here and give them a respectful place and go beyond and above to help them.ldquoSome of the families have enjoyed paddle boarding lessons on the water with children experiencing this type of activity for the first time. One grandmother got to sleep in a bed for the first time in years as she normally sleeps on the couch to let her grandchildren have the bed.Wave By The Sea is much more than a weekend or holiday break.ldquoWe aim to provide a holistic service here for people. It will start with an outreach case worker working with you to establish what your needs are and then that moves us into seeing what we can provide, whether its counselling, physiotherapy, group support and so on, Sandra continued.ldquoSeventy per cent of Waversquos work is service provision, the remainder is trauma education. We have a whole range of short trauma courses now and we hope to run courses her.ldquoThey deal with how trauma affects families, recognising the impact of trauma and how to build resilience, the intergenerational impact and issues such as trauma addiction as we would see people with issues. We also provide trauma education for healthcare professionals and student doctors, nurses, and social workers.She predicts an increase of demand for services as new referrals increased last year in part due to interest in the Injured Pension scheme and the proposed Legacy proposals.ldquoThe majority of people coming to us now have never gone anyway for help. But dferent things are stirring memories. We hope to provide counselling and complementary therapy sessions in Newcastle within a few months.Sandra is recruiting a Health and Wellbeing caseworker who would be based in Killough but would also work in the Newcastle area and stressed that all services were provided on a confidential basis.One of the trustees of the Kinder Project, local man Dr Finbar McCormick, is delighted that the building is being used by Wave.ldquoKinder was a Dutch charity that took children from troubled areas to Holland in the s and then established a local centre in Killough for breaks, he explained. ldquoChildren from other troubled spots like Kosovo and the Balkans were also taken for holidays here over the years.ldquoWith the peace process, the need for the Kinder House just fell away and we were looking for another group to pass it onto so that they could make good use of it.ldquoI happened to meet Peter, who I know, one day while out for a walk and I said to him that we really needed to find another group to use the hostel. Peter said that he would mention it to Wave and that was about  months and Wave has been using it for the last six months.ldquoIt was an excellent choice for us as we really wanted to keep the place going and Wave will continue the same aims that Kinder had.To apply for the caseworker position or to access services, visit Wave www.wavetraumacentre.org.uk or ring   ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2February2022_Kilcoo.jpg","title":"Kilcoo set for Croker  ","story":"KILCOO are officially back to back All-Ireland Senior Club Championship finalists after a gruelling clash with Cork side, St Finbarrrsquos, was dramatically settled in extra-time on Saturday.In a thoroughly entertaining contest that had twist after twist, Mickey Moranrsquos men eventually booked their place to contend for the Andy Merrigan Cupwhich has agonisingly eluded the local outfit over the last few years.With the headlines seemingly written in the dying seconds of regulation time, Kilcoorsquos Paul Devlin steadied his frame to send the deciding free between the posts.However, a moment of off-the-ball madness from team-mate Aidan Branagan resulted in a sending off and a further  minutes of added drama.Despite this, the Magpies showed their stamina and experience within this competition and managed to finish comfortably five points adrt from their opponents.The scene was set at a mild Portlaoise venue as sunshine attempted to split through the clouds and past the overshadowing OrsquoMoore Park spectator stands where the Ulster and Munster champions prepared to lock horns.Although the local side won referee Brendan Cawleyrsquos throw-in, it would be The Barrrsquos who would open the scoring from a Cillian Myers-Murray effort.Kilcoo replied rapidly through the reliable Ryan Johnston, who navigated his way past the opposing defence to curl one over the bar to level the tie.The Magpies would soon be soaring when they immediately turned over possession and saw an opportunity for the first goal of the match.Jerome Johnston cleverly spotted his brother, Ryan, and played a quick hand pass into his path where he made no mistake in burying his effort into the top left corner of the net beyond the ing Barrrsquosrsquo custodian, John Kerins.Despite this early blow, the Cork-based outfit remained determined and went on the offensive.Eoin McGreevy took the mark and kicked over before receiving a yellow card for a high tackle on Ryan Johnston.Kilcoorsquos Conor Laverty was rewarded for his tireless work ethic in the form of winning a free, although team-mate Paul Devlin saw his effort uncharacteristically drt wide from what was a very straightforward chance.Colin Lyons was the latest to enter Cawleyrsquos book with  minutes played following a late tackle on Niall Branagan that left the Kilcoo number two worse for wear.Steven Sherlock successfully converted his first of ten frees for The Barrrsquos to bring his side to within a point, but Laverty answered this with a score from play to widen the winning margin once more.St Finbarrrsquos were notably the physically bigger side and it was clear they were initiating a rougher style of play.This was evident after Sherlock again split the posts from a free, when Kilcoorsquos Ceilum Doherty looked to reply and instead was clattered by defender Sam Ryan.This time, Devlin made no mistake with his attempt which would have helped settle his nerves from his earlier miss.Sherlock pointed his third free of the match in retaliation in what was now a tit for tat contest.However, The Barrrsquos managed to swing the tie hugely in their favour when Kilcoorsquos Daryl Branagan forfeited possession close to his goal and the onrushing Eoin Comyns took full advantage.The Barrrsquos number nine quickly passed to team-mate Sherlock, who set up McGreevy for their sidersquos first goal of the match.Despite the efforts of Kilcoo lsquokeeper Niall Kane, McGreevy managed to creep his shot round the custodian to fire his team into the lead minutes before half-time.With seconds to the interval, Denis OrsquoBrien received a yellow to join the growing list of his St Finbarrrsquos team-mates to go into the refereersquos book.As the whistle sounded, both sides engaged in some roughhousing as tensions reached fever pitch.Half time: St Finbarrrsquos - Kilcoo -.The Barrrsquos won the second half throw-in and went on the attack through a surging Sherlock run that resulted in a free - which he duly converted.This sprung The Magpies into action with rising star Shealan Johnston running past three defenders before kicking over the bar for a magnicent solo point. Team-mate Devlin then converted a free to pile on the pressure.Opposing number eights, Dylan Ward and Ian Maguire, were having a notable midfield battle which drew attention fromboth sets of supporters on numerous occasions but often it was the Kilcoo man coming out on top.lsquoKeeper Kane kicked an effort off the ground and over the bar on the rd minute before Eugene Branagan scored a point from play to give The Magpies the lead.As was the theme of the contest, Sherlock knocked over a brace of frees for the Munster champions and the score line swayed once more.Daryl Branagan curled two points from play over the bar before Ryan McEvoy was shown the yellow card for a foul on the opposition. Sherlock duly converted the resulting free and now the game was in its last ten minutes of regulation time.Ward received a yellow card for more off the ball antics with Maguire but Kilcoo kept on scoring through the left boot of Devlin, who split the posts after receiving a neat pass from Daryl Branagan.As the officials indicated four additional minutes, The Magpies held a narrow one point lead with the scores reading - to -.On the rd minute, The Barrrsquos were afforded the chance to draw level from a long ranged free which Sherlock made no mistake in doing.With seemingly one lastthrow of the dice, Kilcoo launched the ball forward to the experienced Devlin, who drew the foul as he attempted to pick up the pass.With what everyone thought was the final kick of the game, Devlin prepared to knock over his free and send his side through to a second successive All-Ireland final.However, there would be one last twist before the whistle.To everyone in attendance and those watching at homersquos disbelief, Kilcoo joint-captain Aidan Branagan, who was only on the pitch for a matter of minutes, needlessly collided with Barrrsquos replacement Adam Lyne off-the-ball.After brief deliberation, referee Cawley gave Branagan his marching orders in the form of a red card and reversed his decision from a free to a throw ball.The full-time whistle sounded seconds later and the game headed to extra-time.Despite the high drama, Kilcoo would not be denied and dominated the following duration of the contest.Custodian Kane was first to kick over, before Anthony Morgan doubled the deficit. Sherlock pulled one back for The Barrrsquos from a free but Micheal Rooney quickly cancelled this out at the other end.Devlin extended the lead to three and yet again Sherlock proved reliable for The Barrrsquos through a converted free.However, Kilcoo clearly had prepared for these extraminutes and scoring opportunities looked to be seldom for their opposition, although Colm Barrett did split the posts after Devlin curled over another point.lsquoKeeper Kane saw his rsquo sail over the bar to restore a two point lead and from here St Finbarrrsquos ran out of gas.Jamie Burns saw red for the Cork side after punching out at Doherty, and Kilcoo were now afforded the extra space to stamp their authority in the closing minutes.Despite Ward picking up a late black card, a brace of Doherty points rounded off the scoring as the match finally reached its climax at - to -.After the contest, Kilcoo lsquokeeper Niall Kane spoke about his sidersquos performance and reaching yet another All-Ireland final.ldquoWe knew it was going to be tough when you get to the last four in Ireland, he said.ldquoYes everybody was saying Kilcoo were going to be red hot favourites, but deep down we knew St Finbarrrsquos are no walkover and they proved that.ldquoItrsquos only a semi-final, therersquos nothing won yet so we are back at it in the morning, get our recovery and training Monday night.St Finbarrrsquos: J Kerins S Ryan, J Burns, C Scully C Lyons, B Hennessy, A OrsquoConnor I Maguire, Eoin Comyms D OrsquoBrien, S Sherlock , B Hayes C Myers-Murray , E McGreevy , C McCrickard.Subs: E Dennehy for C Myers-Murray, C Barrettfor D OrsquoBrien, M Shields for E McGreevy, A Lyne for C McCrickard.Kilcoo: N KaneN Branagan, R McEvoy, Aaron BranaganM Rooney, D Branagan , E BranaganD Ward, Aaron Morgan C Doherty , J Johnston, S JohnstonC Laverty, R Johnston , P Devlin .Subs: Anthony Morganfor Laverty, Aidan Branagan for Aaron Morgan, C Laverty for Aidan Branagan, T Fettes for R Johnston, J Clarke for M Rooney.Referee: Brendan Cawley ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2February2020_Death.jpg","title":"Marc (18) remembered as ‘an unassuming and polite young man’  ","story":"THE funeral of a teenager who died in a road accident near Castlewellan at the weekend takes place later today.Marc Quinn died after being struck by a car on the Newcastle Road in the early hours of Sunday morning.It is believed that Marc, who celebrated his th birthday last Wednesday, was walking home when the accident occurred shortly before .am.He was treated at the scene before being taken to hospital, but sadly died a short time later.Police are appealing to anyone who witnessed the incident to contact them.The funeral cortege will leave Marcrsquos home in Annsborough today at .pm for Requiem Mass in St Malachyrsquos Church in Castlewellan at pm, to be followed by interment at St Maryrsquos Cemetery, Aughlisnafin.Marc was a talented Gaelic footballer who was a senior player for Aughlisnafin GAC.His mother, Jenny, is the club secretary, and his father, Garry, is a former player.

Tourism currently represents a considerable percentage of Northern Ireland’s GDP, but unsightly rural roads and hedgerows are unlikely to inspire atrip and can damage the perception of our region.”David Brown, Deputy President of Ulster Farmers’ Union said illegal dumping is an increasing issue in rural areas: “Fly-tipping is a scourge on the countryside and one that too many of our farmers have experienced first-hand. Dumping unwanted waste in rural areas is dangerous to human health and harmful to livestock and wildle. In the past, there have been issues where fly-tipping waste polluted watercourses and contaminated land.“When unwanted content is dumped on a farmer’s land, it becomes the responsibility of the landowner to dispose of, while local councils are left to take ownership of waste on public land and highways. This is both costly and time consuming for farmers and ratepayers.“Since the pandemic began, the amount of litter being dumped on farmers’ land has increased, with many rediscovering the outdoors for recreation. I urge all countryside visitors to be more considerate of those living locally, and of animals and to commit to taking their waste home with them.”——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.It is also true that among the much larger group of voters who are pro Union, but do not vote for ‘unionist’ parties , there was very signicant opposition to Brexit.Therefore, runs the criticism, that large bloc of people who are both overtly unionist in their voting intentions, and who voted to quit the EU, should ‘own’ the current crisis . I have previously written about how unionists in NI did not display any of the nervous reaction to the prospects of Brexit that Gibraltarians did at the time of the plebiscite. The latter had such a sense of their own vulnerability, surrounded by a Spain that feels lasting resentment over the peninsula’s British status, they voted % to stay in the EU.Many of the loudest critics of unionism, and its support for Brexit, hector it for not having seen the merits of the EU and of the single market and for instead endorsing the supposed insularity of little Englanders and so on. My own criticism of unionism in the run-up to the  referendum is that there was a failure to think realistically.The view that Brexit was driven by English nationalism is self-evidently wrong and it confuses two separate issues: the dominance of England within the UK, and the strain of English nationalism.England is dominant for simple numerical reasons: it makes up % of the nation and so will always dominate almost every aspect of cultural, economic and political le in the UK. But there is no proof that English nationalism drove Brexit. England was almost evenly ided, with % of voters opting to leave the EU, and % preferring to stay.The other three home countries of the UK were sharply ided too.Wales had almost a high a percentage of Brexiteers as England, at just under % of those who voted in the watershed  EU poll. In Northern Ireland, approaching half of voters wanted out of Europe.And even in Scotland, almost % of those who cast a ballot in the referendum were pro an EU exit.The UK would have been in deep troubleBrexit really had been driven by English nationalism, and— say — % of England had backed it and only % of Scotland. Instead the UK was unied in one respect: every part of it was split.In  I thought the arguments in favour of Brexit were very strong, but so too were the arguments against. In the end my own opposition to an EU departure was mainly because I felt that it would put the UK in peril .Butthere is a unit in Europe that could operate successfully outside the EU it is the British Isles — and I use the term consciously as a geographical one.If majorities in the four parts of the UK and the Republic of Ireland were all happy to live outside the EU then it would be easier to deliver the UK and Ireland as an internal free-trade area with strong links to Europe and America . It is not impossible that such a day will come, depending on how Brexit pans out in the coming years.The big unionist miscalculation in  was the ability to deliver a full Northern Ireland departure from the EU. That was only possible with massive political support for unionism in London. I know people in Westminster who point out that sympathy for unionism now is far greater than it was at the time of the  Anglo Irish Agreement. Even so, it is nowhere near where it needs to be for seismic change like Brexit.I perhaps had a heightened sense of this in  because I had been monitoring developments relating to the legacy of the Troubles.It has been extraordinary to behold themuted reaction to the way in which republicans are being allowed to win the narrative of what happened after .The whole apparatus of the UK state has been turned against itself – a country that saw off three decades of terror and prevented civil war. I remain unwavering in my view that this is a moral collapse both within NI and within the corridors of power in London.While the Republic continues to delight republicans by repeatedly trying to humiliate the UK over legacy in both Europe and the US over alleged past wrongdoing by the security forces, there is still no pressure applied to Dublin, and not so much as a UK demand for an inquiry into the long and stubborn Irish extradition failures of known and fanatical murderers, as a result of which so many people were killed in border areas.Given that enduring weakness towards the Republic of Ireland, what chance was there of MPs standing up to Ireland over Brexit None of this is to say that protocol is even remotely justied. As an opponent of Brexit, I feel all the more resentful over its implementation. I agree with Owen that some unionists seem not to grasp the disastrous implications of the protocol.The belated signs of flexibility from the EU over checks show how much of the Brexit border challenges could have been resolved by EU exceptions being made for bilateral UK-Ireland arrangements.I am just trying to understand some of the reasons why we are in this mess. And we can only hope that the resolve shown by London in overhauling the protocol, which mysteriously began to evaporate in November, s.European UnionNorthern IrelandBrexitProtocolEurope  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularBoris’ drinks party antics have stirred more fury than his betrayal of the UnionBen Lowry: Unionism has been stymied by lack of support in LondonTUV: We led on Northern Ireland Protocol and the DUP followed after usOwen Polley: Finally DUP does something to show gravity of Protocol predicamentDUP protocol stance has support in London says MP Sammy WilsonMost PopularBest high street wedding dresses UK :  bridal dress styles for every type of bride - from Coast to AsosWeight loss: can a Lumen ‘metabolism reader’ help you lose weight more easily  How it worksBest baby car seats UK : best toddler car seats from birth to , including Maxi Cosi, Halfords, CybexBest men’s hiking boots  UK: what to look for in a men’s walking boot, best from On, Berghaus, SalomonLumie Sunrise Alarm review: how does it work, does it help with SAD, and is it any good                        This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-fbyfCU sc-GEbAx ueSoA gsnYBQ\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperCoronavirusMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

The comic is optimistic as the pandemic reaches its endgame and feels the speed at which scientists developed a vaccine for the virus was nothing short of miraculousBasically, he has always had a bit of a mouth on him, and has used it to maximum effect - compering the Empire Laughs Back Comedy Club in Belfast for years, a comedy hotspot where Patrick Kielty first honed his craft and also turning up as a regular on BBC NI’s The Blame Game alongside Tim McGarry and Colin Murphy, but his solo material almost always sells out in venues across Ulster, mostly because he is so adept at being an equal opportunities offender, as in, he mercilessly satirises both sides of our historic ide with equal amounts of savage glee.Even while he is able to strut on stage to do standup with nerves of steel, what he calls the “martial art of the performing arts, because it’s just you up there with a microphone, no set, nowhere to hide and you have to be like lightning in keeping hecklers in place”, he maintains that off-stage he is actually a rather reticent character, and while others may have been lamenting the pains of social distancing, he, in fact, “rather enjoyed it.”Father-of-two Jake said: “I have no idea why, and it would take the best kind of therapist or psychologist there is to explain this weird paradox in my personality, but If I walk into a room and there’s five people and I don’t know anybody, I will go into a corner, almost asI am completely socially dysal or some kind of monosyllabic hermit out of their enclave. Then, on the other hand, for some reason I have never felt uncomfortable walking out on stage, be it in front of  or , people. I feel at ease and at home up there and it’s like a dferent part of me taking over, although it’s not asI’m assuming a dferent character, it is very much authentically still me. I just can’t explain that contradiction in me.”He’s been doing standup for over  years now, in all kinds of places,some more down at heel and some more swish, but although the years have made him a pro at embarrassing hecklers into shamed silence, he maintains that comics never lose their fear of completing falling apart on stage, and that in fact it is an intrinsic part of perfecting the ‘martial’ art of successful standup.Jake larking about at home where he has been incarcerated, like many of us, working from home on comedy sketches for YouTube and what he calls anti-social media“Sometimes you can walk into a gig, and for whatever reason, the chemistry in the room or whatever, it’s just not going to work, no matter what you do. I have read, even, about gigs that fell apart for Billy Connolly.A while back a mate of mine named Michael Smiley was compering a gig at a theatre in London and he had seen me doing a lot of political satire and stuff and asked me to go over there and do a show. So I went over and I can’t even remember what joke I began with but I couldn’t even see the audience and they couldn’t see me. It turns out it was a really lefty, sort of right-on crowd, and I can’t remember what I began with, but I completely died on stage.“At one point somebody threw a plastic glass. It was a total disaster and I walked off to the defeated sound of my own feet on the floorboards in silence. That was one of the those gigs where I still wake up at am in the morning in a cold sweat thinking about it.“But it was my fault! You have to gauge an audience and feel the vibe in the room and connect with the people in front of you.”His new show is focused on our response to the Covid pandemic, which has managed to change the world and all of our lives, forever: “At the start of it all I felt like it was actually the apocalypse,” he confesses. “I took to the house, but I was actually thinking of digging a moat around it too. Being a reader, I had read a lot over the years about how bad pandemics can be. I knew all about the Spanish flu, I knew all about the Ebola outbreaks, I knew about the dangers of a flu pandemic, so none of that reading made me feel remotely calm or rational about what was happening.Jake is cute as a button visiting Santa aged approx three alongside his three younger brothers Connor, Barry and Damien. Today he might be pushing  but feels about  at heart. Perhaps a le in comedy prevents ones soul from growing old “But I think because of what we have been through here over the past  years there is a stoicism to the NI psyche, and an attitude where we just go, ‘Right, whatever, let’s get on with it’. Not much shocks us and so we’ve persevered.”‘WHY I ACTUALLY CALL IT ‘ANTI-SOCIAL MEDIA’Jake is positive that we are finally reaching the endgame of the pandemic. “I can see an end in sight to the Covid nightmare and it’s all down to the hard work and genius of scientists who developed this vaccine. That they came up with a vaccine so quickly was to me miraculous. But I think a lot of the advances we have made medically are amazing. I can’t wait for the moment when we look back and go ‘Yeah, that was horrendous, but now we know how to respond to something like this.’ “People say ‘Oh, maybe a better world will emerge from this, but I think that’s being a bit idealistic, I mean I think we will always revert to type. “People say we really came together via social media and so on, but I actually call it anti-social media. Online we just peddle disinformation and people’s susceptibility to being conned is frightening to me, I mean people can be swayed into sharing very strange views. The level of mind control that people live under is frightening and there’s this confirmation bias where they find  evidence for their views and just keep going on in a loop.”‘I WAS BORN IN BELFAST IN , SO MY BIGGEST CHALLENGE HAS BEEN STAYING ALIVE’“I was always quick, even at school, I had the quick answer back for the teacher,” reflects Jake O’Kane on his childhood.His family moved around a fair bit during his youth because of the Troubles and north Belfast being a rather precarious area at the time.“I started off going to two primary schools in north Belfast, local dficulties there as I would describe it, meant that I had to move about an awful lot. One school was up in Moneymeena and I went from there to a boarding school in the Republic.“I was incarceratedthere in St Michael’s for five years until I escaped. It had been full of priests, but over time they ran out of them. I was always running south, meaning to head for Dundalk, but always ended up towards Newry. I was good at sports and English and that was it. But because I had so much movement in my early education stage, you know, I missed out on a lot of maths, physics and chemistry and couldn’t get my head around it. I was a painfully shy child.”But as he got older he found himself becoming increasingly sharp-tongued, swt to fire back wittily at those around him and engaging in his secondary school class debates with vigour.“When we did politics they used to set me up to get the argument started with the teacher, to get a bit of craic going. I seem to have a quick brain that way for getting things started or turning things around or seeing it from a dferent angle.”I ask him what the biggest challenge he has faced in his le so far is Without missing a beat he responds: “Well, staying alive. Not dying! And it’s getting harder the older I get. I was born in , the worst time in this country’s history to be born, really. It might have been easier in Darfur or somewhere, I reckon.“So most of my le was about trying to stay alive and that is the ongoing challenge. Isn’t that the case for us all ”It might surprise people to know that as a comedian and therefore a comedy writer, Jake is a voracious reader and is always bemused when doing Zoom calls and people are impressed by the manold titles on his bookshelf behind him: “You can’t write unless you read - the two go hand in hand. If you ask me what my favourite book is it’s like asking who your favourite child is. It depends where you are in le. Dferent books affect you at dferent times. “I’ve a lot of books and I do read a fair bit. I’m not so big into fiction, more history, biographies and politics, and all that stuff. But novels have just never appealed to me.”QA: ‘I ACTUALLY ENJOY HOOVERING THE CORNERS OF CEILINGS AND UNDER CARPETS’Tell us your earliest childhood memories I find it hard to remember what happened last week, never mind when I was a child. I remember being at my granny’s. One morning I got up, we lived in the middle of the Sperrins and my aunt was making bread down stairs.You could smell that coming up the stairs and there was laughter and chat and that was a nice memory.Who makes you laugh the most Billy Connolly.Who is your best friend My we. I’m actually not a very social being, I’m quite an introvert. Covid - everyone has been crying about social distancing, but I find it quite nice.Ideal way to spend a day off I’d spend it with my family and we’d go for a walk somewhere although I can’t get my kids out. They are  and  and they have no interest. My son is always wired into a computer game. With my daughtershe gives me the wrong look and doesn’t want to do something she actually frightens me.I’m coeliac and so I’d like to also maybe order a Pizza Express who are very good at catering for that sort of thing. I eat from there so much I should really be buying shares from the place.Describe yourself in three words Grumpy, short-tempered, kind.Proudest achievement My children. But they are completely mortied by me. What kind of music do you like to listen to in your downtime I have no taste in music which my we has lamented about since we first met. But I was a child of the s so I loved The Beatles.If you could have an ideal dinner party at which you could invite anyone from history, who would you bring Alexander the Great, he was some pup, Oscar Wilde and Gandhi, just so we could have a vegetarian option. I can’t cook, being from North BelfastI ever went near the kitchen my mummy would have beat the head off me and now my we does all the cooking.But I do the cleaning which works out well because I have OCD and it really bothers me when she doesn’t hoover right up into the corner of the ceiling or under carpets, which I find very distressing. We have a clear demarcation of duties which works very well. I love my hoover, you have no idea. If you said to me, you have to get rid of either your car or your hoover then that’s it, the car is gone.See Jake O’Kane’s Maskerade show on Feb  at the McNeill Theatre, Larne Feb  at the Burnavon, Cookstown Feb -, Grand Opera House, Belfast Feb , Canal Court Hotel, Newry March , Strule Arts Centre, Omagh March , Ardhowen Theatre, Enniskillen and TBC - at The Braid, Ballymena."},{"url":"http://www.penarthtimes.co.uk/news/resources/images/13439817.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % less display advertising when reading our articles.Those ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local services.

They say that the beach is a sand and shingle beach and has a reputation for being one of the cleanest in the region. There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

one of the restaurants most popular and profitable dates.Alan, the manager of Casa De Margarita, said: \"You could have people over at your home, but you couldnt go to a restaurant.\"It was frustrating and we had a lot of cancelled bookings.\"The issue was compounded because the restaurant had stopped taking bookings, thinking that they were going to have the maximum amount of people in.However, Alan said that being on the Esplanade has helped the restaurant, especially as they have outside seating.He said: \"We have been lucky with the location.\"If its dry, then people go outside evenit is cold.\"However, he did go on to say that he was disappointed with the Vale Council for not offering more support, especially in the case of not allowing heaters for the outside seats.This is because heaters are not allowed on the pavements.Alan said it is too early to saybusiness is improving following the lting of restrictions.Pickfords Galley  Bar with RoomsPickfords Galley  Bar with Rooms has been open since January ,  - just before the beginning of the pandemic.Therefore, despite being officially open for two years, they have only been open to the public for about two months including before lockdown.Despite being closed for some time, the restaurant has still been able to operate a takeaway service and has taken the opportunity to develop slowly.Huw Pickford, one of the owners, said: \"Ithelped us grow and develop slowly.\"We opened sections slowly but surely.\"He credits the location on the Esplanade as being vital to keeping the new business afloat.\"The main thing that really helped us was the weather and the location,\" said Mr Pickford\"If we were one or two streets back then we wouldnt have survived.\"The restaurant is already highly regarded, with it being one of the highest rated restaurants in Penarth on Tripadvisor.At the same time as thriving as a new business during a dficult time for hospitality, Pickfords has carried out charity work for organisations such as the NHS.Mr Pickford is optimistic for the future and believes that the business will only grow further as restrictions are eased. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community -

The visit was hosted by the Parliament of Ghana, UK High Commission, and other key partners.We were given a warm welcome and held candid discussions on issues including Covid, conflict and climate matters. We met local women traders and the Chamber of Commerce, as well as MPs from countries across Africa and other key figures. There were lots of discussions about how they view the UK and our mutual partnerships going forward, how we tackle global challenges, and how we fight for human rights and gender justice together.After arriving back in the early hours, I was then straight back into Westminster for anFriday sitting in Parliament – a very important one – as I joined other MPs to support my colleague Rosie Cooper MP’s British Sign Language Bill, which aims to make BSL an official language of the UK.I had a chance to thank local BSL interpreters and deaf community activists, saying: “I add my wholehearted support to this Bill. Like many hon. Members, I have campaigners in my own constituency, such as Stuart Parkinson, an activist for the deaf community with Cardf Deaf Centre, but I also pay tribute to the work of the Association of British Sign Language Teachers and Assessors.

Overall, eight per cent of the entire study group would not agree to a vaccine.Around a quarter of all those in the study also admitted to at least occasionally breaking the rules.The authors concluded: “While pandemic responses should consider how best to reach those suffering from ACEs, longer term, better compliance with public health advice is another reason to invest in safe and secure childhoods for all children.”Previous research has suggested that mistreatment as a child may undermine trust in the future, including of health and other public services.The latest study suggested thatpeople had mistrust in one area, this was replicated in other areas.For example, four out of  people reporting low levels of trust in NHS Covid- information also reported vaccine hesitancy, compared with just six per cent of those who did trust this source of information.The study was funded by Public Health Wales and carried out by public health experts.This article originally appeared on our sister site The National. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

called on the public to support the prince and the duchess when the end of her reign eventually marks the start of her son’s.Charles himself will issue a statement on the Queen’s historic Accession Day on Sunday in honour of his mother’s record-breaking reign. vw,vw,px, px\"The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall His future path to kingship had previously been boosted by the Queen, but never before has the monarch so directly referred to his future role as sovereign.The tricky question of whether the prince would take on the non-hereditary role as head of the Commonwealth when monarch was resolved in  when the Queen made a rare and public personal appeal at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in London for Charles to be chosen for the duty.“It is my sincere wish that the Commonwealth will continue to offer stability and continuity for future generations, and will decide that one day the Prince of Wales should carry on the important work started by my father

respected heir to the throne to stand comparison with any in history — and a wonderful father”, adding: “Most of all, sustained by his we Camilla, he is his own man, passionate and creative.”.removeThe words served as a glowing queenly seal of approval for a future king.The past  years have already seen a royal family in transition.In , Charles opened the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meetingin Sri Lanka, representing his mother in the role for the first time.Writer Catherine Mayer, who was given rare access to the prince, said the same year that he was “joylessly” increasing his royal workload and believed becoming king would be akin to “prison”.Clarence House denied this was the case, saying this was not the prince’s view.Mayer wrote that the prince was “impatient to get as much done as possible” ahead of succeeding his mother as monarch.Charles has described how he wants to make the most of his position within the royal family.He told US’s Time magazine: “I’ve had this extraordinary feeling, for years and years, ever since I can remember really, of wanting to heal and make things better.”In , the year she turned , the Queen called time on

died in April, used a stick to rest on, but looked chatty and on form.It was her first major in-person public engagement for  weeks.Charles has dedicated decades of his le to royal duty and charitable work as he has carved out a role for himself as a king in waiting.The arts, the built environment, responsible business and enterprise, young people, global sustainability and rural affairs have been

We are pleased to be working in partnership with RSPB NI thanks to financial support from DAERA on this project. Works carried out on site include coner and gorse removal, mowing and rush control, ditch blocking and hedgerow restoration, spoil removal, invasive species management and additional ecological surveys.“Peatlands are terrestrial wetland ecosystems in which waterlogged conditions prevent plant material from fully decomposing and peatland such as Keeran Moss has been accumulating since the last ice age, around , years ago.“Peatlands cover only about % of the earth’s land but they store huge amounts of carbon - twice as much carbon as all the world’s forests. Around % of Northern Ireland is covered by peat, but it is estimated that around % of this is in a degraded state. Due to lack of awareness of the importance of peatlands many sites have been overexploited, damaged by drainage, and mined for fuel. It is crucially important we conserve this important habitat and encourage other land owners to do so.”The RSPB’s Gregory Woulahan explained how the partnership approach to the area was proving beneficial.He said: “RSPB NI completed a Conservation Action Plan for the Garron Plateau in Mid and East Antrim and NI Water delivered extensive peatland restoration works as part of the Co-operation Across Borders for Bioersityproject. CABB is funded through INTERREG VA which is delivered locally by the Special EU Programmes Body. We are really delighted to be working in partnership with the council on Keeran Moss another important peatland site.“Initial surveys at Keeran Moss indicate a range of rare and threatened species including snipe, grasshopper warbler, willow warbler, redpoll, and reed bunting. Restoration works will ensure the peatland is restored and protected so that it could provide a home for other priority species such as hen harrier, curlew, lapwing, and dragonflies in the future.”World Wetlands Day is a campaign to promote the importance of wetlands globally. Gregory added: “A call to take action for wetlands is the focus of the  campaign. It’s an appeal to invest financial, human and political capital to save the world’s wetlands from disappearing and to restore those we have degraded. A fitting day to visit this important local wetland site.”The progress has been welcomed locally too. One resident said: “As a resident in the Loughmourne area of Carrickfergus, I am delighted with the initiative to regenerate the habitat of the Keeran Moss.“I welcome this regeneration project to protect the flora, fauna and bird le from further damage in one of the last bog areas in Carrickfergus. “It has been particularly beneficial to me during the pandemic to watch and listen to the resident and migrant birds on my daily walk, such as buzzards, stone chats, grasshopper warblers, goldfinches as well as seeing hares grazing in the fields nearby.“I feel very privileged to have such a resource on my doorstep and look forward to an increase in wildle here such as newts and frogs, beetles, dragonflies, damselflies and waders like Jack snipe, common snipe and the elusive water rail. I offer my full support and wish the team every success.”Read More Read MoreWoodburn Forest anti-social behaviour to be tackled by ‘reconvened’ task forceCarrickfergusMayor  \"       \"   for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from NorthernIrelandWorldSign Up       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    ]]Most PopularWarning from Lisburn police...NewsReports of suspicious vehicles in rural areas...NewsIslandmagee drink drive motorist claimed he fled in car fear...NewsGlengormley traffic collision: pedestrian in critical condit...NewsPolice dog tracks down runaway driver after car crash...NewsMost PopularSofas UK: best sofas and couches to furnish your home, whate...RecommendedBest baby prams UK : we review travel systems and pushch...RecommendedReady your garden for spring with one of these gorgeous gaze...RecommendedHow to chose a perfume for your we or girlfriend, and reco...RecommendedBest pancake pans UK : from non-stick to cast iron, thes...Recommended                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleYour Northern IrelandRecommendedMore from Northern Ireland WorldAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessArchiveSubscribeEventsPlace your AdReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-fbyfCU sc-GEbAx ueSoA gsnYBQ\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationEnvironmentPeopleRead ThisFootball\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      FootballIrish League FootballSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCarsFamilyRetroOpinionYour NI\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Your NI​Antrim and NewtownabbeyArmagh Banbridge and CraigavonBelfastCauseway Coast and GlensLondonderry Derry City and StrabaneLisburn and CastlereaghMid and East AntrimMid UlsterFermanagh and OmaghNewry Mourne and DownArds and North DownMust ReadContact usAdvertise My BusinessFollow us           \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Last year, more than one million people all over the UK counted over  million birds. Setting some quiet time aside to watch your local wildle and get outside does not only benefit conservation and science, but can also be beneficial to your mental and physical health as you will spend time outside, either by yourself or with your friends or family, to concentrate on nature at your doorstep.“These events are part of Council’s #embRACE programme which celebrates ersity in Mid and East Antrim. Delivered by Council’s Good Relations Programme, the initiative continues to develop mutual understanding, respect for cultural traditions, the principle of interdependence and positive cross-community and positive race relations throughout the borough. Only by working together can we truly help our local environments flourish.”Pupils from Kells  Connor PS with Mayor Cllr William McCaughey on the Big Garden BirdwatchRSPBCouncilSpring\"\" for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from NorthernIrelandWorldSign Up     \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"  \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"  \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"   Most PopularWarning from Lisburn police...NewsReports of suspicious vehicles in rural areas...NewsIslandmagee drink drive motorist claimed he fled in car fear...NewsGlengormley traffic collision: pedestrian in critical condit...NewsPolice dog tracks down runaway driver after car crash...NewsMost PopularSofas UK: best sofas and couches to furnish your home, whate...RecommendedBest baby prams UK : we review travel systems and pushch...RecommendedReady your garden for spring with one of these gorgeous gaze...RecommendedHow to chose a perfume for your we or girlfriend, and reco...RecommendedBest pancake pans UK : from non-stick to cast iron, thes...RecommendedThis website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleYour Northern IrelandRecommendedMore from Northern Ireland WorldAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessArchiveSubscribeEventsPlace your AdReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\" ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-fbyfCU sc-GEbAx ueSoA gsnYBQ\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement     \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"  \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"  \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"   Sign in\"Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationEnvironmentPeopleRead ThisFootball\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"FootballIrish League FootballSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCarsFamilyRetroOpinionYour NI\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Your NI​Antrim and NewtownabbeyArmagh Banbridge and CraigavonBelfastCauseway Coast and GlensLondonderry Derry City and StrabaneLisburn and CastlereaghMid and East AntrimMid UlsterFermanagh and OmaghNewry Mourne and DownArds and North DownMust ReadContact usAdvertise My BusinessFollow us     \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"  \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"  \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"   \" fill\"#ea\"  to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.
