Former Take That star Williams credits Teddy with helping prevent his life from spiralling into drug addiction.Alongside George as page boy will be Louis de Givenchy, six, son of Olivier de Givenchy, managing director at JPMorgan Private Bank.

Her brother James, Viscount Severn (right), ten, is considered shy but is said to be a \u0027delightful\u0027 boy in private. They are both the stewards And, in a charming touch, Eugenie and Mr Brooksbank have involved her uncle Prince Edward\u0027s children Lady Louise and James, Viscount Severn.At 14 and ten, they are slightly too old to be a bridesmaid or page boy. But their role as \u0027special attendants\u0027 is a thoughtful way to involve them.\u0027It was a really sweet thing to do and I know the children and their parents are very touched,\u0027 a source said.Mr Brooksbank, 32, has asked his younger brother Tom, 30, to be his best man. The ceremony will take place at 11am at St George\u0027s Chapel in front of up to 800 guests.Most members of the Royal Family will be present, except the Duchess of Cornwall, who has declined citing a prior engagement in Scotland.There have been suggestions that Prince Philip, 97, who has a notoriously fractious relationship with the Duchess of York, will \u0027see how he feels on the day\u0027.

There are over 100 ethnicities in this country, most of which are as different from each other as they are from white Brits.\u0027Forcing businesses to report on pay will result in meaningless statistics because the numbers for particular ethnicities within one firm are likely to be statistically insignificant, where nothing can be really be gleaned from them.\u0027Essentially the Government would be burdening businesses with more bureaucracy without any useful return.\u0027          The NHS will be among the employers required to set out plans to increase high-level recruitment from ethnic minority backgrounds Matthew Fell of the Confederation of British Industry said pay transparency could be a catalyst for action.But he warned: \u0027Reporting must be done in a way that is supported by both businesses and employees, to recognise the wide range of ethnic groups and legitimate staff concerns about intrusiveness where sample sizes are small.\u0027  Today\u0027s announcement comes a year after the Prime Minister published a disparity audit she ordered when she entered Downing Street to show how people of different ethnic backgrounds were treated.In 2017, average hourly pay for white workers was £11.34 – 10p higher than for the other ethnic groups together. The gender pay figures published in April were criticised by some as a blunt measure that failed to account for why men and women might be doing different jobs and on different salaries.The average – median – salary difference was 9.7 per cent in favour of men. The figures showed that 78 per cent of employers paid men more than women on average, and 14 per paid women more. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/03/19/4FABCD3600000578-0-image-a-8_1535997687619.jpg","title":"Hundreds children sent home false widow spider infestation closes EIGHTH London school","story":"    Godwin Junior School in Forest Gate, east London closed its doors today amid reports of false widow spiders on the premises. It marks the eighth London school to close as a result of the spider - a relative of the deadly Black Widow          The schools gates have been shut and the school issued a statement yesterday saying: \u0027Godwin Junior School will be closed on Thursday and Friday due to circumstances beyond our control\u0027          Spiders and cobwebs can be seen on the gates of Godwin Junior School this morning as it announced it would be closed until at least October 15          Highfield Primary School (pictured) in Enfield, north London has also announced it is closed.

A view of the Quire in St George\u0027s Chapel at Windsor Castle, where Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank will become man and wife in a ceremony starting at 11am          Princess Eugenie and her fiancé Jack will marry at St George\u0027s Chapel at 11am, followed by a 15-minute carriage procession down part of Windsor High StreetTHE CARRIAGE PROCESSION Eugenie and Jack\u0027s journey will be a shorter affair than Harry and Meghan\u0027s, which followed a two-mile route and took around 25 minutes. They will leave from the Royal Mews out of Windsor Castle and travel on to part of the High Street, before returning via Cambridge Gate, but they will not travel down the Long Walk like Eugenie\u0027s cousin and his bride.It will follow the same route as the procession of Prince Edward and Sophie Wessex, who also married at St George\u0027s Chapel.The couple may well decide to travel in the Ascot Landau, a smaller and lighter carriage than the State Landau with basket-work sides, which was the choice of Peter Phillips and Prince Edward and their brides for their St George\u0027s Chapel weddings.           The couple will exit Windsor Castle and travel down part of the high street past the Soldier\u0027s Statue before heading back up part of The Long Walk to the castle grounds, which will take around 15 minutes           Eugenie and Jack will take part in 15-minute carriage procession following their ceremony, although they will take a shorter route than Meghan and Harry (pictured) and will not travel down The Long Walk THE GUESTS Rather like Harry and Meghan, who married at the same venue in May 2018, Eugenie and Jack are predicted to be surrounded by A-list invitees.There\u0027s expected to be some crossover of social circles with Amal and George Clooney, James Blunt, Cressida Bonas, Elton John and the Beckhams all tipped to attend their second royal nuptials of the year.But Eugenie\u0027s guest list is set to have an extra sprinkling of edginess in the form of a younger, cool crowd that includes pop singer Ellie Goulding, Cara Delevingne and Suki Waterhouse, and modelling royalty Kate Moss and Cindy Crawford.           Princess Eugenie speaks to consultant orthopaedic surgeon Jan Lehovsky during a visit to Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital in Stanmore, North London, in April 2014The bride\u0027s mother Sarah Ferguson confirmed that surgeon Jan Lehovsky, a doctor at the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital in Stanmore, who performed corrective surgery for scoliosis on Eugenie when she was 12, will be among the guests.The consultant orthopaedic spinal surgeon also fitted two 1.5-inch screws to Eugenie\u0027s neck in the eight-hour procedure, which help her to stand straight to this day. \u0027She did have what would have been very serious curvature of the spine,\u0027 the Duchess of York told the Evening Standard. \u0027She certainly will be an extraordinary example of great work from the RNOH. The wedding is about love, future and inclusivity.\u0027          Amal Clooney and her husband George were among the A-list guests at Harry and Meghan\u0027s wedding at St George\u0027s Chapel, Windsor in May 2018          Eugenie\u0027s pal Ellie Goulding (pictured together at a ball in London in 2016) is expected to be on the star-studded guest list. They\u0027ve been spotted on the town together and Ellie is also friends with Eugenie\u0027s sister Princess BeatriceMEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC AND CHARITY REPS WHO GOT AN INVITE The couple invited members of the public to apply to join the celebrations in the grounds of Windsor Castle and sent out 1,200 invitations after whittling down 100,000 applications. They will be joined by representatives of charities and organisations supported by the couple - including the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital where Eugenie received treatment for scoliosis.The Teenage Cancer Trust, the Salvation Army and the UN Trust Fund to End Violence Against Women will also be represented.Eugenie has also chosen to include her former schools St George’s School and Coworth Flexlands School by inviting youngsters from both, as well as members of the community from around Windsor, Castle residents and Royal Household staff.          More than 1,000 members of the public and charity representative have been invited to gather in the grounds of Windsor Castle to get the first glimpse of the newlyweds just like at Harry and Meghan\u0027s wedding (pictured)THE DRESSPunters have been making last-minute bets on which designer has created Eugenie\u0027s wedding dress.Erdem remains the favourite with some bookmakers at 21, but Ladbrokes said there has been a flurry of bets for British design brand Suzannah, with odds cut from 92 to 31.While Paddy Power suspended betting on Stella McCartney after a large number of punts on Sir Paul McCartney\u0027s daughter. Eugenie previously revealed in an interview with British Vogue that her wedding dress designer would be British. \u0027I\u0027m not telling anyone who is making it, but I can say it is a British based designer,\u0027 she told the magazine.Her revelation that the designer has been British-based has increased the speculation around Erdem.The brand\u0027s eponymous designer Erdem Moralioglu, who is originally from Canada, had been been widely tipped to get the big job of designing the Duchess of Sussex\u0027s wedding dress.           Princess Eugenie wearing a floral Erdem dress to a meeting at UN HQ in New York in July 2018.

Harry and Meghan and Princess Eugenie and her fiance Jack Brooksbanks are also set to marry at St George\u0027s Chapel this year FuneralsThe church has been the setting for many historic funerals including the Queen Mother\u0027s private committal service following her Westminster Abbey funeral in 2002, and in the same year, Princess Margaret\u0027s small, private funeral.The funeral of the Queen\u0027s father, King George VI, took place at St George\u0027s in 1952.                         "},{"url":null,"title":"The readings hymns Andrea Bocelli order service Eugenie Jacks Royal Wedding","story":"    The Order of Service: Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank will have a number of prayers, hymns and the national anthem during the ceremonySt George\u0027s ChapelSet in the lower ward of Windsor Castle, St George\u0027s Chapel is a building of rare beauty, begun in 1475 by King Edward IV. The chapel, built in the striking English Perpendicular Gothic style of the period, was intended both to be a new and fitting home for the College of St George and the Order of the Garter (founded over a century previously in 1348), and to be a royal chapel in which the sovereign and the royal family might worship God and to which they might come on various occasions, some solemn, and many, like today\u0027s wedding or the Garter Service in June, celebratory, to receive God\u0027s blessing and to hear prayer offered in God\u0027s presence.The opus dei, or daily round of prayer, is offered by the members of the College who live in the precincts of the chapel and whose duty it is to pray morning and evening for the sovereign and the companions of the Order of the Garter.There are 23 services each week, all of which are open to members of the public.Perhaps the Chapel\u0027s most striking feature is the vaulted stone roof of very wide , held up only by the light and graceful walls and the external flying buttresses.Most of the coloured bosses on the roof of the Chapel bear the badges and arms of King Henry VII and those of his court who helped to build part of the chapel, finished in 1528.The boss in the roof over the organ screen bears the arms of King Henry VIII, who is buried in a vault beneath the quire of the chapel.The great coloured glass West Window is one of the finest in England.In seventy-five lights, the vast majority of which date from between 1503 and 1509, it depicts a host of warrior saints, archbishops and kings and, in the bottom right hand corner, with hammer in hand the likeness of William Vertue the mason and architect responsible for the building of the nave and quire vault.Those seated in the quire of the chapel are able to see one of the chapel\u0027s greatest treasures, the carved oak stalls dating from between 1478 and 1485.Each stall is a work of art and a triumph of craftsmanship, each unique in its detail.          Princess Eugenie and Mr Brooksbank will marry in St George\u0027s Chapel which is detailed in the order of Service Above each of the companions\u0027 stalls hangs his or her banner and on the canopy of a knight\u0027s stall is his helmet and crest and sword of knighthood, symbolically half-drawn from its scabbard to show his readiness to take up arms in defence of the sovereign and the realm.The lady companions do not bear arms. On the back of the stalls are nearly 800 plates which commemorate knights of the Garter past and present.On the High Altar is a jewelled cross, given by Queen Victoria, and two silvergilt candlesticks dating from the reign of King Charles II.Also displayed are three gilt dishes of very great size, elaborately embossed one was intended to have been the gift of Mary of Orange, sister of King Charles II, while the other two smaller dishes are the gift of Anne Hyde, Duchess of York, wife of the future King James II.Looking down on the Quire from above is the wooden oriel window installed in the Chantry Chapel of King Edward IV by King Henry VIII so that his Queen, Katherine of Aragon, might watch the ceremonies of the Installation of Knights of the Garter in the quire below.The window bears the arms of Henry and Katherine and the intertwined Tudor Rose of England and the Pomegranate of Aragon.It has frequently been used as a royal pew or watching chamber and it was from this vantage point that Queen Victoria watched the wedding in the chapel below of her son, the Prince of Wales, to Princess Alexandra of Denmark on 10 March 1863.It was at this same wedding that the fine East Window, created by Messrs Clayton and Bell in commemoration of the late Prince Albert, was first seen.The service is led by the Right Reverend David Conner KCVO, Dean of Windsor.The prayers are led by the Most Reverend and Right Honourable John Sentamu, Archbishop of York.The service is sung by the choir of St George\u0027s Chapel, conducted by Mr James Vivian, director of music, St George\u0027s Chapel, Windsor Castle.The organ is played by Mr Luke Bond, Assistant Director of Music, St George\u0027s Chapel, Windsor Castle, Miss Lucy Morrell, organ scholar, St George\u0027s Chapel, Windsor Castle, and Mr Peter Roper-Curzon, a member of the bride\u0027s family.Mr Andrea Bocelli, tenor.Mr Carlo Bernini, conductor.Mr Barry Wordsworth, conductor.Musicians from the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra.The state trumpeters of the Household Cavalry.Music before the service:Miss Lucy Morrell, organ scholar, will play:Organ Sonata No. 3 in A Major Felix Mendelssohn (1809-1847) Con moto maestoso, Andante tranquilloPrelude and Fugue in G Major, BWV 541 Johann Sebastian Bach (1685-1750)Chanson de Matin Edward Elgar (1857-1934) 9.40 am Mr Luke Bond, assistant director of music, will play: Mohrentanz Tylman Sustao (1510-1570)Sinfonia from Cantata BWV 29 Johann Sebastian Bach (1685-1750)Presto comodo (from Op. 28) Sir Edward Elgar (1857-1934)Intrada Grayston Ives (b. 1948)Allegro (from Trio Sonata No. 5), BWV 529 Johann Sebastian Bach10.15 amThe Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Mr Barry Wordsworth, will play:March from A Moorside Suite, H. 173 Gustav Holst (1874-1934)Suite for Strings: John Rutter (b. 1945) 1.

The brand’s high-street stores are closing, but its 145 department-store concessions will carry on trading as part of the sale to sister brand Karen Millen as part of an 11th-hour rescue deal.Staff were told on Thursday night that Coast had entered administration due to “difficult trading conditions” – but was then partly rescued by Karen Millen. The stores and its international outlets will remain in the hands of the administrators PricewaterhouseCoopers.“The businesses had been facing financial difficulties due to structural challenges in the retail space and specifically the concession partner market, as well as a softening of demand for occasionwear,” said Mike Denny, one of the joint administrators. “This sale puts the ongoing business on a firmer financial footing.”“Regrettably, other parts of the business, including 24 retail stores, were not included in the transaction,” continued Denny. “We will make every effort to help those employees in parts of the business that were not included in the sale.”As part of the pre-pack administration deal, Karen Millen is buying the website and department-store concession arm, but not its UK or overseas stores. The company said it would continue to accept gift cards and returns.Karen Millen’s chief executive, Beth Butterwick, who described Coast as a “much-loved” fashion brand, said: “We are excited to be welcoming over 600 Coast employees to the Karen Millen family. Our expertise and infrastructure puts us in a unique position to create a lean and profitable business, ensuring it remains a thriving destination in department stores and online.”Coast has been affected by tough high-street trading conditions that have also sparked the collapse of House of Fraser and problems at Debenhams, which has issued three profit warnings this year. More than 1,000 suppliers were left out of pocket when House of Fraser went bust in August, with Coast owed £1m. Its last set of accounts show Coast making only a tiny profit on sales of nearly £80m in the year to 25 February 2017.Coast is owned by Aurora Fashions, which also owns retailers Oasis and Warehouse. The group is in turn owned by the Icelandic bank Kaupthing, which also owns Karen Millen. Kaupthing has been trying to sell its fashion interests for some years, having inherited them after the collapse of Icelandic investor Baugur during the financial crisis. The news comes at a difficult time for the sector, with the likes of Maplin and ToysRUs all collapsing this year. New Look, Homebase and casual dining chains have also had to slim down their store portfolios, and Patisserie Valerie are the latest to hit the buffers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f0821c8ff131d10c37e3b6a3d6a5cf42ac5d7d13/0_235_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=148ff5fbbc9220443178cf243afd65d4","title":"mini ikea planning studio spin off store opens central london","story":"Bedroom and kitchen-focused Planning Studio marks firm’s shift to city centresThe UK boss of Ikea has unveiled a spin-off chain of kitchen and bedroom showrooms and described the new high street outlets as the “tip of the iceberg” as it changes its business model to appeal to online shoppers.The first Ikea Planning Studio opened in central London on Thursday, offering shoppers one-to-one advice sessions, a level of service typically absent from the retailer’s sprawling out-of-town warehouses.After spending decades battling planners to build 35,000 sq metre sheds on the outskirts of cities – Ikea has opened 21 of them over three decades – the change of tack by the world’s largest furniture retailer is a dramatic one. The showroom – on a stretch of Tottenham Court Road, central London, known for furniture stores – is just 400 sq metres and took months, rather than years, to open.The sales slowdown has spurred the new group chief executive, Jesper Brodin, who took over last year, into action as the company starts a new chapter after the death of its influential founder, Ingvar Kamprad. Brodin has signed off on a raft of store experiments as well as the purchase of gig economy odd-jobs company TaskRabbit.“The big units are the most important assets we have. The biggest part of the growth is online but the stores themselves are also growing.” Ikea’s UK turnover is close to £2bn.The transfer of sales to online is undermining the economics of running large high street chains, with many stores hit by hefty increases in business rates after last year’s revaluation. At the same time, shoppers are reining in spending on clothing and household goods because of a squeeze on spare cash and a shift to renting rather than owning homes.“The housing market is really lacklustre and on top of that people are telling us they are worried about making big ticket purchases, as well as Brexit and their levels of credit and debt,” said Retail Economics’ chief executive, Richard Lim. “The structural shift is towards online and some chains simply have too many stores.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c675979078695e352d175927f2cd3fb0f384fc69/320_600_5801_3481/master/5801.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a0ed1ed23da5780f4df1ab2065bd815e","title":"patisserie valerie to cease trading without immediate injection of capital","story":"Board of cakes and cafe chain says it is ‘assessing all options available to the business’The stricken cakes and cafe chain Patisserie Valerie is teetering close to collapse after admitting it needed “an immediate injection of capital” to survive.The blunt statement from the directors of the 200-strong chain, which has nearly 3,000 staff, came less than 48 hours after the company said it had discovered a multimillion-pound black hole in its accounts and was suspending its shares.The company – valued at £450m when trading was halted – was unable to say if it would be able to pay staff wages this week.It later revealed it was facing a winding-up order from HMRC over an unpaid tax bill of more than £1m that was filed in the high court in mid-September but which the firm’s directors had been unaware of.On Thursday, the board said it needed new funds to continue trading “in its current form” and revealed there was a “material shortfall between the reported financial status and the current financial status of the business”. Patisserie Valerie said it was “assessing all options available to the business to keep it trading and will update the market in due course”.Those options are likely to include an emergency loan or a white knight bidder who may prefer the business to go into administration first in order to ditch any debts.The 92-year-old cake chain has not said how much cash it needs, or estimated the size of the accounting black hole – though it is said to be more than £20m. Insolvency experts said that any rescue bid would be extremely difficult unless Patisserie Holdings, the Aim-listed owner of the cafe chain, was able to establish the scale of its financial problems.Duncan Swift, head of food advisory at the accountancy firm Moore Stephens, said some suppliers to Patisserie Valerie’s trading subsidiary, Stonebeach, had already halted deliveries until the position of the company was clarified.Swift said Stonebeach should not be able to make new orders or take credit from suppliers, adding that only products already in transit and unable to be recalled were likely to be delivered in the coming days.The chain’s finance chief, Chris Marsh, who has worked for the company since 2006 and banked a £700,000 profit selling share options in July, has been suspended from his role. visited five Patisserie Valerie branches in central London, where staff claimed they had not been told anything about the company’s financial problems. Store managers said it was “business as usual”.“We don’t know anything,” said a young female employee from Portugal who declined to be named. “We are a bit worried, but there is nothing we can do. Also this is London, if I lose this job I can get another one.”Another staff member said: “We are a big company and I think they are going to find a solution. We don’t know anything apart from what we read in the newspapers.”The winding-up petition filed by HMRC enables other creditors to call in their debts and is likely to have prompted banks to freeze Stonebeach’s accounts. Credit insurers are also understood to have withdrawn cover for the company’s suppliers. Patisserie Holdings declined to comment.All transactions from 5 October are subject to scrutiny and in such cases the directors could potentially be held personally accountable for trading while insolvent.Patisserie Holdings has called in PricewaterhouseCoopers to carry out a forensic analysis of its books.It is also expected that the Financial Reporting Council and the Financial Conduct Authority regulators will examine the issues at Patisserie Valerie. The Serious Fraud Office could also potentially look into the matter.

In sporting terms, we are leaving some of our best players “on the bench”.Against this background, the announcement by the prime minister on Thursday that the government will introduce ethnicity pay reporting is an important step. Larger companies and public-sector organisations will have to publish data showing whether they pay their people fairly. And talented ethnic-minority people will be able to see which organisations have turned their commitment to ersity into action.This isn’t about “quotas” or promoting people who don’t deserve it. Employers need data to identify what steps to take to improve fairness in the workplace. And the fact employees can see where pay gaps are greatest will encourage leaders to take stronger action.During a roundtable discussion with the prime minister, the chief executive of RBS, Ross McEwan, said: “All of us here know that the greater the ersity within our businesses, the more shareholder value we can create. With more women, black, Asian and minority ethnic staff we’re more productive, and better reflective of the communities we serve ... As with gender pay gap monitoring the time has come to tackle the ethnicity pay gap.”It’s also encouraging that more than 80 high-profile businesses and organisations, including NHS England, Standard Life Aberdeen, Norton Rose Fulbright, Saatchi \u0026amp Saatchi, KPMG, RBS, the civil service and WPP have signed up to a new race at work charter, committing themselves to action and leading the way on increasing ethnic-minority representation in the workplace.There are many other issues on which we also need to make progress.

I’m on the roof getting down a shoe. I’m a taxi service I drive the children to sports events. I’m also the dinner man. Until recently, I was the cleaner one day a week. Another female head has had to become an expert in electrics and drainage.”Some heads described feeling under pressure because of increased “parent power”, and felt obliged to go to extra lengths to keep parents happy, so as not to lose any pupils to a neighbouring school.One rural headteacher said: “There is often a need to walk a diplomatic tightrope with parents. Many schools are not at capacity, so if a relationship with a family breaks down, they often just move their children elsewhere.”Others alluded to issues associated with “rural poverty”, with many families just below the eligibility threshold for free school meals and pupil premium – which brings additional funding to a school – but still struggling to get by.“Recently they built new ‘affordable’ housing locally, but it was £285,000 for a house,” one headteacher told researchers. “You can’t afford that if you are a farm labourer. It’s not affordable for families.”A Department for Education spokesperson said new national funding arrangements meant that a small rural primary school could attract up to £135,000 in funding to meet their fixed costs: “We recognise the importance of rural schools, the role they play in their communities and the challenges they face, which is why we have introduced a new factor in the national funding formula to recognise that and set aside £25m specifically to provide support these schools.”"},{"url":null,"title":"the ss19 takeaway 10 of the most stylish trends from the shows a photo essay","story":"After one month, four cities and hundreds of shows, the common threads have started to weave their own stories for next summer.

But with the reviews published and all being said, shown and done, what are the trends that will trickle down into our wardrobes next summer? Read on to get an insight into what springsummer 2019 is going to look like.Responsible for the heyday of Alexis Colby, Bananarama and Prince, the 80s is the decade that keeps on giving. Designers mined the most popular fashion references: at Moschino, Jeremy Scott presented it in pin-sharp suits that were double breasted and worn with wide-brimmed hats at Balenciaga, Gucci and Escada, it was all about the power shoulder, too, seen in bold primary-hued blazers and knee-length dresses.Hedi Slimane at Celine and Isabel Marant were thinking after dark with their take on the trend, seen in the former’s ruffled and puff-skirt mini-dresses and the latter’s stonewashed-denim looks. Not one for wallflowers, the 2019 take on the trend is all about more, more, more.Designers took their cue from the beach for one of the most prevailing trends of the season and it came in many guises. Oscar de la Renta and Rejina Pyo both found beauty in accessories that looked as if they had been beach-combed think shell necklaces and stone embellishment found on the plackets of skirt suits.Elsewhere, the seaside inspiration was more focused on maritime references. Rope was a recurring theme at Chloé, Monse, Courrèges, The Row, Ports 1961 and Victoria Beckham, found in accessories, details and motifs. Fishermen’s hats, meanwhile, riffed off life on the ocean wave and were seen at 3.1 Phillip Lim, Michael Kors and Boss.Fringing was a firm favourite at Anna Sui, Michael Kors, Sonia Rykiel and Chloé. From suede to jacquard, leather to silk, affects ranged from perfectly polished to deliberately undone.At Loewe, Jonathan Anderson’s mishmash of textures and stimuli of kinetic space meant that they popped up and bobbed along on bags, while at Longchamp they extended from skirts to satchels, carried low so as to sweep the ground. The trim was especially elevated at Givenchy – where it was dramatic in rhinestone – and at Area, which added fringe embellishment to boots and bodystockings. There was a distinct sense of the city hippy in every fashion capital this season, steeped in the nostalgia of rambling road trips and sandy summer days. At Chloé, creative director Natacha Ramsay-Levi was all about incorporating summer keepsakes (such as anklets, market scarves and magpie-worthy trinkets) into a back-to-work uniform at Jil Sander, Loewe and (of course) Missoni, joyous and multicoloured crochet with home-spun appeal was crafted into beautifully cut trophy pieces while Carolina Herrera incorporated the flower-power aesthetic to patchwork suede boots.Far from thrifty, these pieces were polished. The best example came from Marni creative director Francesco Risso, who went down the road of souvenir chic with several looks featuring postcard-like pictures, but executed it in sculpted satin and pencil skirts with decadently embellished trim and decadent charm belts. Elsewhere, the most distinctive of bohemian summer coverups, the cotton kaftan, was reimagined in silk at Richard Quinn, Oscar de la Renta and Saint Laurent.The elevation of the ordinary has become commonplace on the catwalks (blame Vetements and Balenciaga wunderkind Demna Gvasalia who, for example, has single-handedly re-established the anorak as a must-have) and this season designers’ attentions have turned to surfing.Given fashion’s ongoing penchant for late-90s to early 00s fashion, it makes sense that board shorts would make a comeback right about now too. R13, Sportmax, and Anna Sui all rode the crest of the wave. In their wake came scuba suits at Calvin Klein, rash-guard inspired tops at Richard Malone, and knitwear featuring surf motif intarsia at Michael Kors.Suits may have dominated the street style over fashion week, but on the catwalk, skirts reigned supreme. The silhouette of choice for springsummer 2019 is that shape so synonymous with the 1920s: the drop waist. Favoured for its insouciant, relaxed and languid sensibility, it sauntered down the runways of Anna Sui, Carolina Herrera, Vacquera, Molly Goddard and Hugo Boss.At Erdem and Rodarte, they were cut from rich and sumptuous lengths of taffeta – an approach contrasted by Proenza Schouler, where waists came dropped in denim, proving that this is a trend that works whatever the occasion.It’s all about the details next season, and two polar opposite ones in particular. First up: big bows were big news. Rodarte, Erdem, Miu Miu and Emilia Wickstead were the most distinctive adopters of this trend (the latter creating the most satisfyingly perfect fixtures for her models hair) striking an overtly feminine and lavish note.At the other end of the spectrum, models came armed with holsters. Call it the Virgil effect (the designer went big on them for his Louis Vuitton menswear debut in July) or call it a sign of female empowerment, but designers presented them in myriad form.At Calvin Klein, primary-coloured leather styles were worn over blazers Sies Marjan partnered his with tonal suits styled around the shoulders at Fendi, a belt version was worn to toughen up a classic dress while Gabriela Hearst, House of Holland, Michael Kors and Chloé all used it as a statement accent.The utilitarian theme marched through the collections to a resounding approval from the fashion press. At Givenchy, Clare Waight Keller hit her stride at the fashion house delivering a knockout collection full of functional patch-pocket trousers and sharply tailored separates that were punctuated with with D-ring belts Dries van Noten featured army-green twill and dresses with drawstring halternecks and elsewhere, Burberry (utility shirts), Tory Burch (precision-pressed tops) and Fendi (combat pants) all signed up.Part Ibizan bohemian, part Glastonbury reveller, nothing strikes a summer party note quite like tie-dye. This trend had a strong thread from the start of the shows: in New York, Calvin Klein and R13 enticed showgoers with their rainbow hues in London, Ashley Williams represented with bewitching black and in Milan, No.21 went neon and Mrs Prada put it on her signature A-line skirts.Not to be outdone, Paris gave it a twist of its own, with Christian Dior, Andreas Kronthaler for Vivienne Westwood and Paco Rabanne all stretching out the party vibe until next spring.It wasn’t just about the clothes at the shows. Several designers went all out with their spectacles for their moment in the spotlight, shifting the focus away from their sartorial creations. At Gucci, Alessandro Michele eschewed the runway for a theatre where models meandered around the stalls before making their way the stage for the finale at Christian Dior, creative director Maria Grazia got choreographer Sharon Eyal to mastermind a dance prelude to the show, which took place in a pop-up space on the outskirts of Paris and Giorgio Armani invited guests out to Milan Linate airport where, after entering through security, they were transported to the fashion house’s hanger where they were serenaded by Robbie Williams.Anthony Vaccarello at Saint Laurent also got in on the action, staging his catwalk on water at the Place du Trocadéro in Paris, while Ralph Lauren took over the Bethesda Terrace in Central Park to stage his 50th anniversary show. Also in New York, Telfar opted for an outside location on the banks of the East River (open air, in the rain) and created a vocal sound collage by South African performance artists Faka and Ian Isiah featuring Selah Marley and Austin Williamson.But it was Anya Hindmarch who really stole this show by opting not to show any clothes or accessories at all. Her Chubby Cloud installation at Banqueting House (which was also open to the public) comprised the world’s biggest white beanbag, which attendees sat on as they were serenaded by BBC newsreader Zeb Soanes reading a special shipping forecast and the Eric Whitacre Singers – and not a single fashion item in sight."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac0ee21f52deb099b783e6d290dd95a1dbb2400e/0_10_2280_1368/master/2280.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8eb8784b0fdef0434bbbd8ef5d4d9bf0","title":"ryan gosling movies ranked first man la la land","story":"Whether crooning in La La Land or essaying a blank would-be killer, the First Man star is capable of keeping all his characters’ contradictions on displayEven The Notebook’s writer, Nicholas Sparks, knew that there wasn’t much to Noah, the romantically deranged, mansion-restoring, beard-growing war veteran in this insipid tearjerker. “It’s a guy who falls in love and then he just kinda does nothing,” he admitted. But director Nick Cassavetes had sound reasons for choosing Ryan Gosling. “You’re not handsome, you’re not cool, you’re just a regular guy who looks a bit nuts,” he told him.Annoyingly kooky comedy in which the lonely Lars (Gosling) introduces his close-knit Midwestern community to his girlfriend, Bianca, who happens to be a life-sized rubber doll. Avoiding sleaziness by the skin of its teeth – it is only right he and Bianca don’t sleep together, Lars explains, since they’re both religious – this settles eventually for the tone of the self-help manual (“What we call mental illness … can be a way to work something out”).As the junior manager of a Democrat governor’s presidential campaign, Gosling gets to chart the slow curdling of idealism into disillusionment. He is part of a cast that’s so strong and starry (Philip Seymour Hoffmann, Marisa Tomei, Paul Giamatti, the film’s director, George Clooney) that it takes a good 30 minutes to notice that the film is all gloss and no grit.Middle-of-the-road, multi-strand romcom with Gosling as the pick-up artist who gives Steve Carell, newly separated from Julianne Moore, lessons in love before himself falling for Emma Stone. Notable for the fizzy rapport between Gosling and Stone in the first of their three collaborations to date.Neil Armstrong was notoriously reserved, but there is a thin line between enigmatic and empty, and Gosling, in his second film for La La Land director Damien Chazelle, isn’t always on the right side of it. There is grim humour, though, in the formal, buttoned-up way he addresses his children the night before he makes history: “We have every confidence in this mission.”Or: The Place Beyond Self-Parody. Gosling descends into feigned inarticulacy and mumbling method madness as a tattooed fairground stunt rider reconnecting with an old flame (played by his real-life wife, Eva Mendes). He is weirdly unable here to suggest the character’s dopiness without winking at the audience. There is just too much self-awareness: the lights are off but there’s still somebody home.This retro-flavoured musical reunites Gosling and Stone, but delivers one anticlimax after another: the opening traffic-jam showstopper is like a poor man’s Fame, the songs throughout more Magic FM than magical. But Gosling, who plays a pig-headed pianist earning a crust playing easy-listening standards, gets one of the highlights to himself, casually singing the tentative City of Stars as he strolls along a pier at night.Gosling’s signature role as a nameless stuntman-cum-getaway-driver. (“What do you do?” someone asks him. “I drive,” comes the Zen reply.) He gets a long way on his mute charisma, those feminine features so unlikely for a male action hero, and the ability to look fetching in a snazzy silver jacket. The film, though, is a bust: all flashy bodywork and no gas in the tank.Eye-catching early psycho-work from Gosling and Michael Pitt as the young Nietzsche-adoring students conspiring to commit the perfect murder. Sandra Bullock is on their tail in this partial retread of the Leopold and Loeb case that inspired Rope, Compulsion and Swoon.This modern-day Hamlet, set among US expats in Bangkok, re-teamed director Nicolas Winding Refn with Gosling following the success of Drive. The actor plays Julian, an impotent would-be avenger unable to kill his brother’s murderer Kristin Scott-Thomas offers bleach-blond comic relief as his taunting, incestuously inclined mother. Gosling’s performance is an exercise in studied blankness: you cannot tell if he’s acting or under anaesthetic.Gosling’s haunted, sorrowful face is a good fit for this moody sequel. He also has some pleasing chemistry with his blade-running predecessor, Harrison Ford, with whom he trades pointless punches before Ford finally says: “We could keep at this or we could get a drink.” The men duly drop their fists and repair to the bar. Would that more movie dust-ups ended that way.Gosling and Russell Crowe had both played violent, shaven-headed fascists early in their careers (Gosling in The Believer, Crowe in Romper Stomper), but by the time they teamed up for a missing persons investigation in Shane Black’s rambunctious comic thriller, they couldn’t have been more different. Gosling was now delicate and goofy, as light on his toes as a ballerina, while Crowe was an ungainly, unshaven lump. That mismatch lends the film its spark.With nearly a decade of family-entertainment wholesomeness behind him, it was useful for Gosling to have a calling-card role that drew a line definitively between his Mickey Mouse Club past and his adult future. Nothing could have done the job better than The Believer, an intense psychological thriller based on the real case of a Jewish neo-Nazi. The movie displayed early and incontrovertible evidence of the Gosling USP: an ability to hold a character’s contradictions and conflicts in view at all times.Gosling and his co-star Michelle Williams lived together while preparing to play lovers on the rocks in Derek Cianfrance’s gruelling marital drama. The fragmentary, non-chronological structure allows them to inhabit the happiness and optimism of the couple’s salad days as emphatically as the despair that later comes to overwhelm them. It’s as pleasurable watching them fall in love as it is excruciating seeing them fall apart.Think of this as Drugged Poets Society or To Sir, With Crack. As the drug-addicted Dan Dunne, a teacher who puts the “high” in high school, Gosling gives a frazzled but nuanced performance whether he is grandstanding in class or slipping into inaccessible corners of his own mind. His friendship with a pupil (Shareeka Epps), and his attempts to save her from a local dealer, provide the core of the drama, but the film is alive with curious, devastating details. Best of all is the scene in which Dan is approached by the father of a former pupil. The man wants to share the good news of his daughter’s recent academic achievement, and to congratulate this teacher who set her on the right path, but from within his druggy funk Dan simply cannot be reached.First Man is in UK cinemas from 12 October• This article was amended on 11 Oct 2017. A previous version stated that Gosling’s character in Half Nelson was addicted to heroin."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/129cffcc54fbdc023c787b82cf8844d6853b6cda/196_0_6524_3914/master/6524.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d3f39f81fff5ddc2aeb1a14834fa0848","title":"from garth marenghi to big screen horror what the lost boy of comedy did next","story":"Matthew Holness won the Perrier award at 26, made a much-loved series for Channel 4 and then … almost nothing. Now, at 43, he has made his first film, Possum, inspired by Jimmy Savile. And, no, it’s not a comedyMatthew Holness has been telling people for years that Possum isn’t a comedyfor years. “It’s not remotely funny,” he said when it was announced. “It’s not a funny film,” he reiterated before its premiere. Yet some people, “mainly comedy fans on Twitter”, still haven’t got the message.“I think they anticipate – would prefer – a Garth Marenghi film,” he says. “But thankfully the audience members who actually shell out for a ticket appear to know what they’re in for. Within reason …”Holness is not being funny. Possum is as sober as it gets. A psychological horror inspired by Jimmy Savile and set on Norfolk’s grimmest fens, it is very bleak, very clammy – and very good. Sean Harris stars as Philip, a disgraced children’s entertainer Alun Armstrong is Maurice, his malevolent stepfather. Dame Edna this ain’t – the title refers to Philip’s undead glove puppet.Still, you can understand the confusion. Holness is the great missing man of British comedy. After leading Cambridge Footlights in the late 90s alongside David Mitchell, Robert Webb, Richard Ayoade and John Oliver, he won the Perrier, aged 26, as Garth Marenghi, a horrifically prolific and vainglorious hack horror author (and spiritual cousin to Simon the IT guy, his bit part in The Office).And then … nothing. Well, bits and bobs. But, by and large, silence. Why no second series for Marenghi? And what of the genius behind him, who never gave an interview out of character and was rumoured to have retired to Norwich?Holness walks into a Taiwanese teahouse in Soho wearing the shirt, glasses and expression of a geography teacher. Mitchell describes him as “a deeply reasonable man” and nothing suggests anything other than sanity, kindness and caution. In an hour’s time, he’ll introduce a screening of Possum, so he avoids the beef because he doesn’t want to risk its accompanying raw egg.Holness, 43, is of the generation traumatised by public information films that graphically cautioned children against playing near lakes or railways, matches or farm machinery, hot irons or electrical sub-stations. One, Clunk Click, about fastening your seatbelt, features Savile gleefully smashing an egg in a box.As adults, says Holness, we have had to process the fact that this film was fronted by a “monster” who we were supposed to trust. “Our moral s were actually the worst of the lot.” Possum’s Philip speaks for all those abuse survivors whose silence was enforced. “The people forgotten. There was an entire industry shutting them up.”He has considered showing the films to his six-year-old daughter. “I think it’s a great shame that the government stopped making them as they do serve a purpose.” He grins over his chicken. “But they are a bit too scary. I think she might be truly frightened.”Holness had an “untraumatic” childhood in Whitstable in Kent. But he remembers being upset by the “sombre, everything going to crap” news bulletins of the 80s and has the enduring memory of a friend’s house burning down on their birthday. And when it came to horror, Holness was precocious enough that even fellow Whitstable resident Peter Cushing expressed concern that the six-year-old asking for an autograph knew so much about Hammer.Perhaps encouraged into a rich fantasy life by the fact that Van Helsing was just a few streets away, young Holness spent his free time pretending to be a warrior called Hawk. His reward for passing his 11-plus was a copy of Cushing’s autobiography, which the star inscribed at length, and its owner evidently treasures.At Cambridge, Holness became vice-president of the Footlights to Mitchell’s president – that way round, both men suspect, because of Holness’s lack of administrative nous (as treasurer, he stored the club’s substantial funds in a Tupperware box under his sink). This financial blind spot also tripped him up at the Edinburgh fringe. “You’re thrown into this business environment,” he says, “which I was not remotely prepared for.”Holness clocked quite quickly that he might not be equipped for a long career in comedy, he says. “The business is very tough. If you’re of a certain temperament, it’s great. But if you’re of a gentler temperament, then it’s quite a difficult and stressful profession. You couldn’t really relax.”“I think he was drawn to comedy entirely for the love of it,” says Mitchell, “with very little of the need to get attention and be looked at that most performers labour under. He has always been a brilliant performer, but I have never had the sense that he had a burning need to stand on a stage.” A half-hour documentary about the Footlights made in 1997 confirms this: Holness is front and centre in the film – but as director. He never performs.The other issue was the fate of Darkplace. When first broadcast, the ratings were low its following grew only later, on DVD and online. So a second series was rejected. Other shows came with caveats. Having “free artistic rein” was, Holness clocked, a one-off. A Darkplace spin-off – Man to Man with Dean Learner – wasn’t a fulfilling experience. “And I only really want to make stuff I’m happy making, not for the sake of getting my face on TV.”Actually, there have been comedies he has appeared in more recently: the Channel 4 sitcom Back (in flashback as Mitchell and Webb’s dad) the Radio 4 Scandi-noir parody, Angstrom. And there have been projects pitched that haven’t been picked up, and roles he regrets not taking (Daryl the neo-Nazi in Peep Show, for example). “But I get nothing from watching comedy shows,” he says merrily. “I don’t really watch much myself.” If he does, it’s Monty Python or The Young Ones. “Things I wanted to emulate.”But he swears he is done. “I’m too old for comedy now. You’ve got to really want it. I wasn’t that driven. You’ve got to be really hungry to succeed in it.”Holness’s happiness, thinks Mitchell, is indeed thanks to “swapping comedy for horror”. But also “swapping London for Norwich, settling down, starting a family, all that. When I first knew him, we were students and both found the world pretty intimidating. Matt seems to have come up with an excellent coping strategy.”It’s a striking phrase, for Holness’s balance can seem surprising – almost unnerving. What’s his secret? He thinks carefully. The projection of optimism, he says, in the expectation it will attract good things.Is that a new philosophy? New-ish, he says perhaps 10 years or so. He thinks more. In fact, there was an epiphany. A silly one, although it turns out not to be: “David Bowie releasing that album two days before his death. To turn that kind of event” – terminal illness – “into art is just stunning. I found that probably the most inspiring thing ever. Then I resolved to just think more positively and get on with things.”And with that he smiles mildly and exits, perfectly cheerful and composed, off to show people his incredibly disturbing, very unfunny film.Possum is released in the UK on 26 October This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

As my grandmother would have it – a motto to live and die by – Dull Not To.”Guadagnino, however, insists Swinton playing the role of a male was essential because the film is about female identity.Suspiria – a remake of Dario Argento’s 1977 original – centres on Johnson’s character, a young dancer who enrols in an all-female dance academy in Berlin, only to discover it is run by a coven of witches.’s reviewer Peter Bradshaw did not identify Ebersdorf as Swinton, but noticed something was amiss with the actor’s appearance, writing in his review that his “odd-looking face looks like prosthetic makeup”.Guadagnino said Swinton’s casting as a man would ensure “there will always be this element of femininity at its core. Being a film about the fantastic, it was important that we did not play by the book.”Oscar-winning makeup artist Mark Coulier was hired to transform Swinton. He used prosthetics to thicken her neck and built out her jaw to make it look more masculine.To add another layer to the ruse, Swinton then created an online profile for Ebersdorf on movie database website IMDb. The site now redirects to Swinton’s profile.The actor admits to regretting how the secret got out and had revealed she had one final trick planned.She told the New York Times: “Frankly, my long-held dream was that we would never have addressed this question at all. My original idea was that Lutz would die during the edit, and his In Memoriam be the final credit in the film.”Suspiria will be released in the UK on 16 November."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd1cab102cd6e50d35014f61abf90f0d61c36b0c/0_80_5460_3277/master/5460.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8717fd8addbdd9d4a65bac781bd48f7a","title":"croatia invoke grievance closed doors england nations league","story":"Gareth Southgate’s Nations League game given surreal edge by home side’s perceived slight before World Cup semi-finalOn the hills behind one of the stands, a small group of Croatia fans could be seen investigating whether there was a decent vantage point among the steep inclines and cluster of trees. On Friday night, when two of the World Cup semi-finalists renew acquaintances, it is tempting to think the owners of the high-rise apartments next door could make a few quid in bribes from the England supporters who have travelled to Croatia and might need some balcony space to watch the game. Otherwise, the gates will be closed.The primitive, caged end that would usually be decorated with St George’s flags will remain padlocked and that epic night in Moscow, with 78,000 people inside the Luzhniki Stadium and millions of others tuning in, will seem a long time ago.All of which means a slightly surreal evening lies ahead on Kvarner Bay. Croatia, one imagines, must be getting used to it, having played four other matches behind closed doors in the past three years. For England, however, this will be their 988th international since 1872 and the only time they have experienced a “ghost game” of this nature.Let’s not kid ourselves that England’s followers have always behaved in a way that enables the Football Association to take the moral high ground, but on this occasion it hardly seems fair that Uefa’s attempts to improve the behaviour of the home supporters means the away fans have to miss out too.Not that the ground will be entirely deserted. Uefa’s rules stipulate both football associations can have 75 passes each. Add in the local police, Uefa representatives, stadium personnel and an oversubscribed press box (where the radio commentators have been told to remember there will be no crowd noise and, if necessary, to talk more than usual), at least some of the 8,500 multicoloured seats in the Stadion HNK Rijeka will be taken.All the same, it is easy to understand why Gareth Southgate used the word “strange” – several times – to describe what awaits England and why John Stones said he could not remember playing in an empty stadium since his teenage days with Barnsley in the FA Youth Cup. Southgate was even asked whether he would ask his players to mind their swearing, on the basis that it could be picked up by the microphones because of the absence of crowd noise drowning it out.“Well, we’ve spent two years encouraging them to speak,” Southgate said, “so to stop them from speaking now would be slightly against what we’ve been trying. It’s for the television to decide where to put their microphones.” Nonetheless, he has mentioned it to his players in private.If nothing else, at least there will be no renditions of the Three Lions song that seemed to get under the skin of Croatia’s players at the World Cup and, judging by Luka Modric’s latest comments, might still be a factor in their motivation.That always felt like a slightly contrived grievance – the idea that “football’s coming home” was in any way disrespectful – when most people would think of it as just a bit of fun resurrected from Euro 96.“The song is humour,” Southgate said. “It is English humour but unless you are a fan of Fawlty Towers maybe you wouldn’t get the slant on it. I think it is interesting how we are viewed by the rest of the world when we travel and, as a result, I am always putting across the importance of representing the country in the right way. The rest of the world does view us in a certain way and, yes, feel that we have a sense of entitlement. I can only speak for this group of players and say that is not the way we operate.”Nevertheless, England’s hosts appear to think it necessary to create a little needle around the occasion. “We felt a bit disrespected,” Modric, Croatia’s captain, stated when the questions turned to the World Cup. “It wasn’t the players or the head coach, more the media and some commentary we could read or watch. We were not appreciated as much as we deserve and it was extra motivation for our team, even in a World Cup semi-final when you don’t need extra motivation. That’s how we felt and that’s how I felt.“Is that a problem for England? That’s something you have to answer yourself.”The more pressing matter for Southgate is that, in terms of the Nations League, this tie has the feel of a relegation six-pointer now Spain have beaten them both – in Croatia’s case 6-0. England face Spain in Seville on Monday and Southgate knows his team are in danger of being demoted."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c88b002cd76a0dd725bba2733bcfbb458521063e/419_150_2845_1708/master/2845.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=63501a3d339739d96e53313728b7f436","title":"fa review craig kline fulham owner shahid khan","story":"• Former club employee rails against would-be Wembley owner• FA to vote on sale to Shahid Khan on 24 October regardlessAllegations of malpractice made against Fulham by their former assistant director of football, Craig Kline, were raised as a potential barrier to the Football Association selling Wembley to the club’s owner, Shahid Khan, at an FA council meeting on Thursday.In the meeting to consider whether to sell the stadium to Khan for £600m, which was described by the FA as “a healthy discussion”, the chairman, Greg Clarke, was asked if Kline’s allegations could block the deal.The FA has said it is “reviewing” the allegations, which Kline has said publicly involve “systemic corruption, child endangerment and exploitation, and fraud” which he witnessed during his time at Fulham between 2014-17. Kline, who is understood to have agreed a settlement to leave the club last November, approached the FA last week and on Monday met one of the governing body’s senior governance investigators, to whom he made a statement.After Kline went public with his allegations on Twitter this week, Jim Woodcock, a spokesman for Khan, who also owns the Jacksonville Jaguars NFL team, responded by saying: “This is nothing more than the same ongoing nonsense and bogus claims made by a former employee who left the club in 2017. Nothing here merits a further response.”Clarke, who with the FA’s chief executive, Martin Glenn, is supporting the sale of Wembley to Khan so the proceeds can be invested in improving grassroots facilities, is understood to have told the council the two processes are being considered separately. An FA investigation into Fulham, which will be undertaken if the review finds Kline’s allegations serious enough, would not delay the council’s vote on 24 October about whether to approve the sale.Kline said: “I believe it would be unacceptable to everybody concerned with the sale of Wembley if a full FA investigation of my allegations is not carried out as part of the vetting process.”One council insider described the meeting as broadly supportive of selling the stadium, with many councillors persuaded that the proceeds, which Glenn has said could reach £1bn with matched funding could transform dilapidated facilities nationwide. A group of councillors is understood to have argued the FA does need to keep its own iconic stadium, whose £757m rebuilding it largely financed and has mostly now repaid, at great cost. Clarke and Glenn have pointed out that other countries’ football associations do not own their own national stadium.Other councillors are said to have been keen to be clear about the detail, both of the commercial deal itself – the FA is retaining the lucrative Club Wembley income and guaranteed matches under the outline agreement with Khan – and how the proceeds will flow to the grassroots.Khan wrote to all councillors on 5 October, giving assurances Wembley would remain England’s national football stadium and that he does not intend to move Fulham there. He said he is committed to keeping the club at Craven Cottage, where a renovation of the Riverside stand is due to begin in May.He released a statement which read: “I appreciate the time and consideration of the FA Council today in its review of my Wembley Stadium proposal. As I’ve expressed in writing to the FA Board and members of the FA Council, an agreement will provide exceptional opportunities to invest in the game while ensuring Wembley Stadium will forever be the national stadium of England, the undisputed home of English football and unquestionably one of the finest venues in the world.“I am committed to a partnership with the FA that will realise longtime resources for and benefits to the game and an extraordinary experience for all who will play in or visit Wembley for many years to come. In that spirit, I look forward to continuing to work with the FA Board, FA Council, Sport England, the mayor of London’s office and DCMS in the weeks ahead.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/77c37f751ef8b3b330d570139d9c5d963ab13eb3/0_264_3416_2050/master/3416.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ae9a49f1acdb94b109b1a82e4c7712bf","title":"israel scotland nations league match report","story":"Scotland squandered a half-time lead to lose 2-1 to Israel in their Nations League match in Haifa.Charlie Mulgrew’s penalty put Scotland ahead but there was no surprise when Isreal levelled, Dor Peretz making up for conceding the spot-kick to score with a close-range finish.Scotland were reduced to 10 men in the 61st minute when John Souttar was sent off for a second yellow card, which Alex McLeish described as “a really harsh decision by the referee”. Kieran Tierney then turned a cross from Beram Kayal past Allan McGregor with 16 minutes left.Scotland enjoyed a 2-0 win against Albania in their opening game at Hampden Park last month but will be looking for two wins against Albania and Israel next month to revive their play-off hopes.Israel had won only one of their past 10 games but looked the more dangerous early on and in the eighth minute Mounes Dabour headed over the bar after a Bibres Natcho corner.Scotland, unchanged from the Albania match, offered encouragement to the home side and McGregor had to make a save at point-blank range from a Peretz header. But the home side were stunned when the referee judged Peretz to have barged Naismith inside the box after the striker latched on to an Andy Robertson pass, and Mulgrew crashed the penalty past Ariel Harush.Israel came back strongly and the striker Ben Sahar skied a chance over the bar before McGregor had to make a save from a Kayal drive, with the Rangers keeper then watching a long‑distance effort from Dabour just clear the crossbar.The Scots were toiling. In the 39th minute Sahar sent an angled-drive against the post after escaping from Robertson and Stephen O’Donnell cleared the danger when the ball was returned across goal. The first half finished with McGregor parrying a powerful volley from Dabour.The Aberdeen defender Scott McKenna replaced Mulgrew for the start of the second half but Scotland continued to struggle. The equaliser came when Taleb Tawatha picked out Peretz who got the better of Robertson before poking the ball into the far corner of the net from eight yards.Things got worse for Scotland when Souttar, booked in the first half for a foul on Dabour, picked up a second yellow for catching the same man in the face with his hand at the edge of the box.McLeish told Sky Sports News: “I thought it was a really harsh decision by the referee. He was about 40 yards away from it. He wasn’t close to it at all. I don’t know if he’s had a signal from somebody else.“John has put his arm up just to protect himself, just as you do, and I thought Dabour milked it. The striker is clever. We did say before the game that Dabour was quite a wily striker. He’s stuck his foot in front of John and it’s looked like John’s kicked him but he’s actually impeded John. It’s only when you see these things in analysis that you can see the real thing.”McGregor saved Kayal’s free-kick and minutes later Tawatha hit the bar from inside the six-yard box but there was nothing the keeper could do when Tierney sliced a Kayal cross past him.Scotland pushed for an equaliser. Callum McGregor stung the palms of Harush with a 25-yard drive but seconds later his goalkeeping namesake made yet another save, this time from the substitute Dia Saba and the home side saw the game out."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/12c7e67ae43d9be67d1b9c882438d893c8dfaa44/472_205_2307_1385/master/2307.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9a71cfaad852e251fde876442c2fe5df","title":"real madrid sue newspaper cristiano ronaldo","story":"• Real claim to have ‘no knowledge’ of newspaper claims• Correio da Manhã stands by story published on WednesdayReal Madrid have taken legal action against a Portuguese newspaper that reported the club forced Cristiano Ronaldo to settle with the woman who accused him of rape.Real said the information published by Correio da Manhã is “categorically false” and was printed in an effort to “seriously damage the image of this club”.Real said they have “absolutely no knowledge of any of the information that the newspaper published with regard to the player Cristiano Ronaldo, and therefore the club was unable to take action on a matter of which it had no knowledge.”Correio da Manhã published an article on Wednesday saying that part of Ronaldo’s defence will be to say that Real forced him to settle.

The photo-sharing app revolutionised smartphone photography by giving users a series of filters. You could flick through your options (moody Sierra, cosy Nashville, or nostalgic Valencia?) and in an instant everyone was able to look like a professional photographer.Don’t ‘over back’ it “The biggest mistake people make when uploading pictures is effectively ‘over backing’ the image,” explains Francesca, a 16-year-old with just over 1,000 followers. “This is when someone over-edits the photo and the result is tacky.”This is such a key lesson to learn that if Instagram had a constitution, “Don’t over-edit” would be the No 1 rule, and the punishment would be zero likes. “A lot of people put way too many filters on a picture,” says Vinnie Cohen, a 14-year-old with nearly 2,500 followers.“I used to want to go out with loads of cameras and stuff but it’s too much, the image looks forced, it looks too professional, it doesn’t look authentic.”Don’t mess up the captionA picture is worth a thousand words, but sometimes words are worth a thousand pictures (which are worth a thousand words). So it’s important to make sure that you get the caption right.“Never say ‘cool’ or ‘lol’ – that’s so five years ago,” advises Molly Gibson, a 14-year-old who uses the app to post pictures of her friends. “And don’t like comments on other people’s posts – it makes you look like a stalker with loads of free time.”Francesca’s most popular post was a simple shot in her family home, but she believes it got so many likes because the caption was about saying goodbye to her friends after her GCSEs. “The best captions tell a story,” she says.Download editing appsThe Instagram filter is dead – long live the non-Instagram filter. Isla Brewer, a 15-year-old with roughly 2,000 followers, recommends VCSO and Afterlight as alternative editing apps.“The best filters on Afterlight for me are Woods, Flora and Cape,” she says. “On VSCO, my favourite filters are A6, HB1 and P5.” If that sounds a little complicated, don’t worry – Isla says pictures with no filter are “a huge thing right now”.If you forgo the filter, Isla recommends Snapseed to make small adjustments for brightness and contrast. “The Selective tool is also very useful if there are certain parts of the image you need to make adjustments to,” she says. “I always try to crop my pictures 4x5, because then it takes up more space on the feed.”Forgo a theme – and think in threesA few short years ago, anyone who was anyone had an Instagram “theme”. In short, this meant all their pictures matched a certain aesthetic – the same colours, borders, or angles were used in every shot. Nowadays, however, it’s all about the rule of threes.“The best tip I can give for curation is to remember your profile shows your photos in sets of threes,” Francesca says, “so it is important to make sure sets of three images look good together and don’t clash – it can ruin your profile.”The most important thing to remember – Molly says – is that you shouldn’t “spam” your followers by posting too much. “Otherwise people will get bored and you won’t get as many likes.”Location, location, locationIn case it needs stating, the backdrop for your photo is important. “The colours in your picture do have to semi-match,” warns Vinnie. “Obviously you’ve got to match your background with your outfit a little bit.” The teen advises against “random colours all over the place” and “loads of random people in the background”.Isla adds that angles are everything. “Before I take any pictures, the first thing I’ll do is take a look on Pinterest to give me ideas for poses and backgrounds. Then I’ll take a few practice shots.“I like to take around 100-200 photos before making a decision.”Get time on your sideAll agree there’s little more important than the timing for uploading your photo.“It’s important to post your photo when your followers are most likely to be on their phone,” Francesca says. That means first thing in the morning or at night (Isla likes to post between 6pm and 8pm).“If you don’t do this your post will most likely be ‘drowned’ by other people’s.”Be yourselfVinnie worries that popular posts are often devoid of personality, and is working hard to make sure his pictures say more about him and his life.“I know a lot of people who go out of their way to take pictures, but for me I feel like you get a much purer image of what you want from just finding it in your daily routine,” he says.“I want to portray an image that I feel is true to what I am, instead of just what people want to see.”Visit Tesco Mobile for more information and content on families and mobile"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53efb5bcbe0e31b0cd8cd53a12a39d55b697f039/1167_388_793_476/master/793.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a83244ae88d43ef66f040b233427c664","title":"teens without screens one familys attempt to rein in mobile phone usage","story":"How would writer  John Lewis and his family fare when they tried to limit their mobile phone usage? We challenged him to limit his family’s mobile usage for a week. Could it bring them closer? This is his diary.SaturdayWe are sitting down to dinner, all four of us, something that only happens a few times a week. My 13-year-old son Harry has his headphones on and is giggling at a YouTube video on his phone, occasionally getting cables caught up in his fork. My 16-year-old daughter Laurie is also multitasking as she eats, scrolling through memes on Instagram and getting flecks of fish curry on her screen.This is no way to eat a meal.My wife and I once tried restricting mobile phone use. We turned off the wifi at night, but my children used their phones in bed and ate through their data allowance in a couple of days. Looking at my family, though, it’s obvious we need to address the situation again. This time, we’ll do it using the “contract” about family phone usage that Tesco Mobile has devised with family tech expert Andy Robertson.“Right,” I announce, in my best Victorian Father voice. “The entire family is going to reduce its reliance on mobiles.”After much mocking laughter, we eventually agree on some basic rules. No phones at the dinner table. We will try to limit our mobile phone use. The children won’t accept friend requests from – or talk online to – anyone they don’t know. And this time, to avoid nocturnal data problems, everyone will leave their phone in another room when it comes to bedtime.SundaySitting on the sofa, I realise that I am baffled by what my children really do while pretending to watch their favourite TV shows.“What are you actually looking at?” I ask my daughter, whose face is glued to her phone.“Just … stuff. Instagram. Tumblr. WhatsApp. I can’t actually watch TV on its own. I have to have something else to do.”“This,” says my wife, “is why I used to smoke.”To distract our children from their phones, we play board games for the evening. It actually works – although, after an hour of hilarity and excitement, the game descends into rage, bitterness and tantrums.MondayWe are on holiday abroad. Within minutes of stopping at a restaurant or museum, the children have worked out the wifi password and are busy scrolling through Instagram and watching YouTube videos.So we pledge to completely avoid phone use when out and about. For a couple of hours, this is great – they engage with the sights, photograph buildings, ask questions and patiently listen as I bluff my answers. And then we get hopelessly lost and end up having to resort to Google Maps to navigate our way around the city.TuesdayIt is evening in the holiday apartment, and we play cards. As the only games we can actually play are Snap and Go Fish, we try to learn the rules to poker. Of course, we have to look them up online, on our phones, and have to repeatedly check back on whether a flush beats a straight.WednesdayWe continue our lengthy poker session. My wife and I are surprised when my son clarifies some of the more arcane rules and then explains, in great detail, how to play a variant of poker called Texas hold ‘em. It turns out that he has been playing a Texas hold ‘em app on his phone for much of the day. We have unwittingly created a gambling expert.ThursdayThanks to this experiment making me engage with my children’s phone usage far more, I realise that I now know what my children actually do on their phones. My son plays ridiculous shoot-em-up games, discovers obscure music on Spotify and YouTube, and watches endless drumming tutorials. He is also adept at quickly looking up information to use as ammunition in an argument, making him invariably right about all sorts of things.My daughter is scrolling through endless memes on social media and watching episodes of John Oliver and Trevor Noah giggling at comedy videos about history or playing logic puzzles or quizzes on the Sporcle website.During our holiday she read an entire playscript in German on her phone. Frankly, this is a relief. My wife and I have long lived in fear that dark forces on the internet could be preying on her, so we’re far happier with the German theatre discovery.FridayThe week is now over. Cutting down on phone use has not been easy. You realise how reliant we are on them for things such as maps and basic information.But I’ve realised something: there’s no problem with this. The problem is the kind of listless, passive reliance on your mobile for the sake of it. Restricting phone use actually reminds you that the internet is quite amazing. You could be learning Italian on Duolingo, teaching yourself how to change the oil in your car using an online tutorial, reading thousands of academic papers, or watching countless arts documentaries.I pick up my phone, flick through social media and consider getting into a furious political argument with someone on Twitter. Instead, I put the phone away and start reading a book. I should do this more often.Photography: Laura McCluskey for Visit Tesco Mobile for more information and content on families and mobile"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82670f10d81666d206f2d5aea1e16c275ebc668e/0_450_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d06c4dd55839ea44c75288d5f6429faf","title":"introducing the new guardian weekly","story":"Today, I am delighted to reveal a new-look  Weekly, a beautiful magazine featuring our best reporting and writing from around the world.Before the  launched our first website in the mid-1990s, the only way for most readers outside of the United Kingdom and Ireland to read our journalism was in the  Weekly.

Meet the star behind the addictive, inescapable single HavanaHollywood is used to famous people wandering around, but when Camila Cabello skips on to the terrace of the fancy Los Angeles hotel where she is staying, heads begin to turn. It is the morning after the American Music Awards, where she won four of the five categories she was nominated in. On Tuesday, she gave a knockout performance of her new single Consequences, with a full orchestra, in a ballgown fit for a Disney princess. But today, she looks like a student in jeans and a checked shirt hanging open over a Pink Floyd T-shirt. She asks that I sit next to her, rather than across from her. “I like to be close,” she says, shuffling up the sofa. She talks fast and at volume, in long sentences that eventually loop back to a point she was making five minutes ago. Considering that she is the pop star of the moment, she seems oddly unselfconscious.Cabello rose to fame as a member of the American X Factor-created girl group Fifth Harmony. As is often the way with pop groups, there is usually one you can’t take your eyes off. Cabello was that one. Even in the pop game, natural charisma is rare, but it was obvious from the audition stages of the show that she had buckets of it. Within moments, most of the people in the restaurant we are in are trying to pretend they aren’t looking at her.At 21, Cabello has had the year of her life. She has been draped in accolades for her debut album, Camila, and its addictive, inescapable single Havana. It wasn’t Cabello’s debut solo single – towards the end of her time in Fifth Harmony, she had tried a few tracks and collaborations on for size – but it was the one that felt most like her. It almost wasn’t a single at all her management wanted her to go with a song called OMG. Cabello fought for Havana. She had a gut feeling about it and suggested they put both out to see. Only the latter made it on to Barack Obama’s 2017 end-of-year playlist, and it has been streamed more than a billion times. “Everybody was like, it doesn’t have enough production, it’s not radio-friendly enough, it feels too slow, it’s a cool piece, but people won’t get it, only Latin people will get this. And I was just like, let’s just put it out and see what happens.” She smiles. “And …”I imagined some executive grumbling that it was too Latin, and ask if she was insulted. “No! The people who said that were my family,” she laughs.Cabello was born in Havana to a Cuban mother and Mexican father and lived between the two countries until her mother brought her to Miami when she almost seven. Her father followed 18 months later. “I had a Disney calendar where I would X the spots until my dad met up with us in the United States,” she recalls.Her family have always referred to her by her middle name, Camila, although she was born Karla, but she was too shy to tell anyone at her new school that she preferred to be Camila. It wasn’t until she auditioned for The X Factor, at 15, that she publicly reclaimed Camila. “They asked if I wanted a stage name, and I said Camila because I hated my name. I hated Karla. It was like this rebirth. I got to create myself again. I was Camila, and then suddenly I didn’t have to be this shy girl in the classroom.”Her shyness is something she has to deal with, even now. “I noticed yesterday, I get really nervous before awards shows, and whenever I go up to accept an award, like the first thing I think about is: fuck, now I have to …” Her hand jerks up to her mouth. “Sorry, excuse me!” She is hyper-aware of her young fans to the point of trying not to swear. She starts again. “Now I have to talk in front of all of these people because that’s not my comfort zone, you know?”She has a way of darting around seemingly unconnected subjects and lassoing them together, and at this point returns to moving to the US as a child. “I never thought about it when I was little, but there is something shocking about moving to a new country and not speaking the language.” When her new teacher asked her if she spoke English, she remembers, she lied and said: “Yes.” She puts on a thick accent to mimic her younger self. “I haven’t even said it until this interview, but I feel like there are memories of me being very introverted and shy when I was in Cuba. I hated family parties. I would start crying and lock myself in a room because I was overstimulated,” she says.She considers herself an unlikely pop star. “I always hear stories of people who became singers and musicians who put on shows for their families when they were very young or were the class clown or always singing in class, and people saw it coming for them. I don’t think people saw this coming for me.”Cabello is happy to talk about her family’s experiences of coming to the US because she thinks it matters to hear human stories. At the Grammys in January, she gave a speech in support of the Dreamers, the children of undocumented immigrants fighting to stay in the US. “I’m a proud Cuban-Mexican immigrant … and all I know is, just like dreams, these kids can’t be forgotten and are worth fighting for.” She once left the stage with Fifth Harmony shouting: “Don’t vote for Trump!”“It definitely hits really, really hard,” she says, of the current hostile climate. “I feel like, with everything in life, there has to be some kind of emotional trigger for people to look at something differently. When there’s just statistics, and talking, I feel like people lose the humanity.”When she was little, Cabello wanted to be on the Disney Channel her parents said she could audition for something, but only once she turned 15. When she did, instead of having the traditional quinceañera celebration, she asked them to drive her to North Carolina, 14 hours away, to try out for The X Factor. The producers told her she was an alternate who might get the chance to audition if there was time at the end of the day. For the first two days, there was no time. When she finally did sing, her cover of Aretha Franklin’s Respect wasn’t even broadcast. “I was so sad,” she says. But they liked her enough in the end to pull her into a group with four other girls, One Direction-style. Fifth Harmony were only third in the contest, but they were the ones who became stars.They were together for almost five years. Cabello started writing songs when she was 16, but the band had a five-album deal, so she assumed she would give them to other people. “I just wanted to cultivate my songwriting muscle. But then I was like, these stories are too close to me, and I’m kind of a control freak. I just like doing all of it.” Her solo ambitions fell foul of the Fifth Harmony vision and, in December 2016, they released a cutting statement informing their fans that Cabello had told them she was leaving, via her representatives. Cabello hadn’t known it was coming, and the animosity continued: a few months later, the group’s first performance as a four-piece saw them theatrically pushing a fifth figure off the stage at the MTV Video Music Awards. She thinks that being a teenager in that situation made it infinitely worse. “If I were older, I would have felt it differently. I think everybody would have handled it differently. But being really young was really hard and scary because I didn’t have enough life experience to, I don’t know …” She trails off. “Yeah, that was really, really hard.”When Cabello writes notes to her fans online – apologising for not being on social media enough, or announcing a new single, or even giving her side of the Fifth Harmony story – she always signs off with, “love only, Camila”. It is something she used to tell herself in the aftermath of quitting the group. “When I left the group, and when all that stuff was going on, I started to use this mantra to myself, of ‘love only’. Any time that I would feel scared, any time that I felt doubt, any time that I felt like I couldn’t do it, any time that I felt there was conflict between any of us, or on the internet, I would repeat to myself, and say to my fans, love only, love only. When it comes to the internet, it’s a powerful thing to say, because there’s no hatred here, no anger here, no resentment, no bad feelings, I don’t want any drama, I don’t want any negativity, just, love only. I won’t let anything else into my sphere.”Consequences marks the end of the Camila phase Cabello is already working on its follow-up, though she can’t tell me anything about it yet, other than that she intends to stay in Miami to work on it in the house she bought for her family last year. “I can’t be away from home any more.” True to form, she had to fight for Consequences people wanted her to release She Loves Control, an upbeat empowerment-banger that leans towards her sensual Havana side. But she decided to do a new orchestral version of a ballad instead.She brings up what her producer Frank Dukes said when she was weighing up recording a song that she knew would be big, but that she didn’t feel close to. “He gave me a good piece of advice, about protecting your excitement. That’s so true because, hopefully, I want to have a long career.” After the year she’s had, I laugh at the “hopefully”, and she looks aghast. “Well, it’s not guaranteed! You don’t know.

I love you no matter what.”In an interview earlier this week with Rolling Stone magazine, Buckingham blamed Nicks, his former girlfriend, for the rift, saying he was told by the band’s manager that Nicks was angry when Buckingham smirked while she was giving a speech at the January Grammy event."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/99e9fa2a25d9e1e446c75bb2a62b5ef3508e4fc8/1090_810_2520_1512/master/2520.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a10dbcb5653d43d7621022f234df5676","title":"could populism actually be good for democracy","story":"A wave of populist revolts has led many to lose faith in the wisdom of people power. But such eruptions are essential to the vitality of modern politics. By  James MillerEveryone seems to agree that democracy is under attack. What is surprising is how many of its usual friends have come to fear democracy itself – or perhaps to fear that a country’s people, too inflamed by narrow passions, risk turning politics into a distasteful blood sport, pitting The People vs Democracy, in the startling words of one recent book title.Observers have understandable qualms about political programmes that are alarmingly illiberal, yet obviously democratic, in that most citizens support them. In Poland and Hungary, democratically elected ruling parties attack Muslim migrants for undermining Christian identity. In the Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte rules with an iron fist, pledging to put drug pushers in funeral parlours, not prisons.Modern democracies all rest on a claim of popular sovereignty – the proposition that all legitimate governments grow out of the power of a people, and in some way are subject to its will. Yet when a large majority of a country’s people vehemently supports policies a critic finds abhorrent, many liberals, even avowed democrats, recoil in horror.Thus arises the possibility of a painful paradox: that “democracies end when they are too democratic”. So concluded a 2016 piece by the US political observer Andrew Sullivan, resurrecting an argument made two generations earlier by Samuel Huntington (in a 1975 report called The Crisis of Democracy, issued in the wake of the international student revolts of the 1960s).Even the leftwing scholar Chantal Mouffe, who has long championed raw populist conflict as the essence of “radical democracy”, seems distraught at current events. “Democracy that is in good working order – with conflict, but where people accept the existence of their adversaries – is not easy to re-establish,” she recently told an interviewer, gesturing implicitly toward tolerance, one of the most jeopardised liberal norms in the current context: “I’m not that optimistic.”Current affairs may seem especially bleak, but fears about democracy are nothing new. At the zenith of direct democracy in ancient Athens, in the fifth century BC, one critic called it a “patent absurdity” – and so it seemed to most political experts from Aristotle to Edmund Burke, who considered democracy “the most shameless thing in the world”. As the American founding father John Adams warned, “there never was a democracy yet that did not commit suicide”.For almost 2,000 years, most western political theorists agreed with Aristotle, Burke and Adams: nobody could imagine seriously advocating democracy as an ideal form of government. It was only at the end of the 18th century that democracy reappeared as a modern political ideal, during the French Revolution.Ever since, popular insurrections and revolts in the name of democracy have become a recurrent feature of global politics. It needs to be stressed: these revolts are not an unfortunate blemish on the peaceful forward march toward a more just society they form the heart and soul of modern democracy as a living reality.It is a familiar story: out of the blue, it seems, a crowd pours into a city square or gathers at a barnstorming rally held by a spellbinding orator, to protest against hated institutions, to express rage at the betrayals of the ruling class, to seize control of public spaces. To label these frequently disquieting moments of collective freedom “populist”, in a pejorative sense, is to misunderstand a constitutive feature of the modern democratic project.Yet these episodes of collective self-assertion are invariably fleeting, and often provoke a political backlash in turn. The political disorder they create stands in tension with the need for a more stable, peaceful form of collective participation. That is one reason why many modern democrats have tried to create representative institutions that can – through liberal protections for the freedom of religion, and of the press, and the civil rights of minorities – both express, and tame, the will of a sovereign people.Thus the great French philosopher Condorcet in 1793 proposed creating a new, indirect form of self-rule, linking local assemblies to a national government. “By ingrafting representation upon democracy,” as Condorcet’s friend Tom Paine put it, the people could exercise their power both directly, in local assemblies, and indirectly, by provisionally entrusting some of their powers to elected representatives.Under the pressure of events, another ardent French democrat, Robespierre, went further and defended the need, amid a civil war, for a temporary dictatorship – precisely to preserve the possibility of building a more enduring form of representative democracy, once its enemies had been defeated and law and order could be restored.But there was a problem with these efforts to establish a modern democracy at scale. Especially in a large nation such as France or the US, representative institutions – and, even worse, dictatorial regimes claiming a popular mandate – inevitably risk frustrating anyone hoping to play a more direct role in political decision-making.This means that the democratic project, both ancient and modern, is inherently unstable. The modern promise of popular sovereignty, repeatedly frustrated, produces recurrent efforts at asserting the collective power of a people. If observers like the apparent result of such an effort, they may hail it as a renaissance of the democratic spirit if they do not, they are liable to dismiss these episodes of collective self-assertion as mob rule, or populism run amok.No matter. Even though the post-second world war consensus over the meaning and value of liberal democratic institutions seems more fragile than ever – polls show that trust in elected representatives has rarely been lower – democracy as furious dissent flourishes, in vivid and vehement outbursts of anger at remote elites and shadowy enemies.It is important to sharply distinguish democracy from liberalism – two value-laden words that, in recent years, have become almost hopelessly conflated and confused, especially in the work of social scientists and western political pundits who fret that western liberal democracy, once the “promised land”, has become “the enemy” in places like Hungary.Unlike democracy, “liberalism” is a relatively late addition to our political lexicon. In Europe, the word first came into wide usage in the 19th century by various political theorists and statesmen in France, Germany and Italy, united in their horror at the bloodshed of the French Revolution, but otherwise varied in their positive views.Modern democracy also has no necessary connection to liberalism. The Protestant champions of popular sovereignty in the 16th century summoned it for the express purpose of dethroning rulers with whose religious views they disagreed: “It was not religious liberty they sought, but the elimination of wrong religions,” as the historian Edmund Morgan wrote in 1988.What is clear today is that while democracy may be widely admired, it is, in its liberal form, an embattled ideology. As the social scientist William Galston has sharply observed: “Few leaders and movements in the west dare to challenge the idea of democracy itself. Not so for liberalism, which has come under mounting attack.” One result has been the rise of popular movements in which a majority of ordinary citizens has embraced a narrow conception of solidarity and rallied around a leader who claims to embody the will of such a closed community.Another result has been a resurgence of traditional anxieties, notably in the UK and the US, about democracy and its obvious dangers. After all, why should we entrust the fate of the Earth to large numbers of ordinary citizens foolish enough to support self-destructive policies and manifestly unfit leaders?Most ancient authorities reviled democracy in Athens. Plato, perhaps the most widely admired writer in antiquity, and someone who lived under democratic rule in the fourth century, criticised the false beliefs that prevailed in a city governed by public opinion rather than true knowledge, and he deplored the “insolence, anarchy, wastefulness, and shamelessness” that those false beliefs facilitated. The historian Thucydides, another citizen of democratic Athens, who chronicled the Peloponnesian War with Sparta that ended with the defeat of Athens in 404, essentially blamed the power of the ordinary people of Athens, and their susceptibility to manipulation by mendacious orators, for this catastrophic outcome.Thanks to such critiques – as well as subsequent political developments, from the Macedonian empire of Alexander the Great to modern European monarchies claiming a ine right to rule – for a long time nobody much cared about the Athenian political system, or about democracy as a form of government.The Athenian democracy certainly doesn’t measure up by modern liberal standards: at its zenith in the fifth and fourth centuries BC, it did not choose most of its government by holding elections nor did it protect the human rights of its citizens, as it lacked any notion of such rights nor were the fundamental powers of the Athenian polis enshrined in a comprehensive written document.What Athens did have is a community in which every citizen was expected to participate in the political life of the city – and far more actively than in any modern democracy. At the height of democracy in Athens, an assembly of citizens, open to all, met at least 40 times a year. All political offices were held by ordinary citizens, randomly selected, and all legal judgments in the city’s courts were reached by large juries of ordinary citizens, similarly selected. And all this happened in a comparatively large commercial city that dominated the eastern Mediterranean world for nearly two centuries.These institutions were the result of a popular uprising in 508BC, against Spartan troops who had seized the Acropolis. Instead of acquiescing in a foreign occupation, the ordinary citizens of Athens spontaneously converged on the Acropolis and surrounded the Spartan army. It took only three days to drive the Spartans from the city – which suggests the popular uprising had numbers and force on its side.The result was a sweeping transformation of Athenian institutions and the subsequent appearance, for the first time in history, of “democracy”, as a word to describe a regime where power (kratos) was in the hands of ordinary people (demos). Henceforth all legislation in Athens had to be validated in the assembly, which was now open to all citizens, no matter how poor. Even more important was the use of a lottery to staff most city offices and juries, which nullified the corrupting advantages conferred in elections by wealth and family prominence.By empowering an impoverished multitude in this manner, critics charged, the assembly and democratic orators had in fact created a new kind of tyranny – a collective tyranny of the majority, a de facto welfare state that doled out money and patronage to the ordinary citizens who manned the imperial fleet and staffed the city’s courts and offices.For Plato, the key problem was epistemological: most people – “the many” – had no knowledge of truth and no clear pattern of justice in their minds. Democracy corrupted even intelligent citizens by leading them to dumb down their policies in order to pander to ignorant crowds. When they gathered “in assemblies, courts, theatres, army camps, or any other common meeting of a multitude,” the Athenian demos, Plato reports, would “blame some of the things said or done, and praise others, both in excess, shouting and clapping and besides, the rocks and the very place surrounding them echo and redouble the uproar of praise and blame.”After the eclipse of direct self-rule in the ancient world, the idea of democracy survived, barely. In the west, it was mainly used as a term of art, deployed by legal scholars, generally in two contradictory usages. On the one hand, democracy became a virtual synonym for violent anarchy: the Roman historian Polybius said “the license and lawlessness” of democracy inevitably “produces mob rule”, to complete a cycle through which all governments had to pass, going from best (monarchy) to worst (democracy, and then mob rule).On the other hand, Polybius also argued that democracy had a potentially constructive role to play. He suggested that the most durable political regime would be a republic that combined the three pure forms of government (monarchy, aristocracy and democracy) into interlinked branches that would check and balance each other, enabling a well-ordered republic to navigate the winds of time “like a well-trimmed boat”.In the centuries that followed, a tradition of republican thought emerged, based on the example of ancient Rome. During the Renaissance, some theorists working within the republican tradition cautiously suggested that ordinary people might have an especially useful role to play, especially as watchdogs and soldiers. Because they were jealous of their freedom, they would be vigilant spectators of executive and administrative conduct, on guard against malfeasance. The very passions of the people, which could generate a certain esprit de corps, could also be harnessed for the enhancement of a republic’s military might. Machiavelli, dreaming of a resurgence of Italian glory in the Renaissance, was eager to exploit popular ardour: “The best armies are those of armed peoples,” rather than paid mercenaries.At the same time, republican writers tended to agree that the chief danger to a mixed constitution came from the democratic element, because of its tendency to degenerate into violence and anarchy. Machiavelli warned that the people, left to their own devices, were “promoters of license”. Algernon Sidney, an English republican beheaded for expressing treasonous views in 1683, denied being a proponent of pure democracy. So did the Enlightenment philosopher Montesquieu, who pointedly worried about the “spirit of extreme equality” he assumed was typical of democracies. Even in the US, in the wake of a war against colonial rule by a distant monarch and amid expansive new assertions of the power of the people, political theorists handled the idea of democracy gingerly, if they acknowledged it at all.In this context, the political writings of Jean-Jacques Rousseau came as a shock. The key was the audacious way he redefined sovereignty in terms of democracy. Before Rousseau, “sovereignty” had implied brute force, empire and the ability to command. After him, it defined not the dominion of monarchs, but the legitimate power of a people. In the wake of the French Revolution, he came to be seen as a prophet, for writings such as this, from Emile, first published in 1763: “The great become small, the rich become poor, the monarch becomes subject are the blows of fate so rare that you can count on being exempted from them? We are approaching the state of crisis and the century of revolutions.”By the summer of 1792, militants inspired by Rousseau were arguing that political power, properly understood, belonged neither to a king, nor to a distant body of elected representatives, but rather to the people assembled in their local neighbourhoods, where they could discuss their shared fate face to face. Events came to a head on 10 August 1792, when a majority of these local assemblies resolved that only an armed revolt would assure that the French people were truly sovereign. At midnight, they seized the town hall in the morning they assaulted the king’s quarters at the Tuileries Palace, although by then he and his family had fled for their lives.The most radically democratic phase of the French Revolution thus began with a carnival of atrocities. But the violence cracked open a new world of political possibilities. For the first time since ancient Athens, direct democracy had become a concrete, collective goal – at least in the minds of the Parisian commoners streaming through the streets with their muskets and pikes.This uprising led to the dissolution of the French National Assembly, the convening of a constitutional convention and the public execution of the king after a show trial. The convention enabled Condorcet to draft the world’s first democratic constitution. But it was never implemented – a Jacobin coup forced Condorcet into hiding, and led to a reign of terror, which the Jacobin leader, Robespierre, argued was necessary to defend the nascent democracy from its many foes, both foreign and French.In the autumn of 1793, the new republic’s conscripts, on orders from Paris, embarked on a murderous rampage in the Vendée that killed some 250,000 people, most of them innocent men, women and children. The French Revolution had resurrected the idea of democracy – and produced a hecatomb on a grand scale.“Of this I am certain,” Burke declared, “that in a democracy, the majority of the citizens is capable of exercising the most cruel oppressions upon the minority.” In the aftermath of the French Revolution, his fears were widely shared by conservatives and self-described “liberals”.Fearful of armed crowds and the possibility of mob rule, the American constitution had been explicitly designed to empower not ordinary citizens, but a “natural aristocracy”. As Benjamin Rush, a signatory of the Declaration of Independence, explained: “All power is derived from the people” – but this power is not wielded by the people: “They possess it only on the days of their elections. After this, it is property of their rulers, nor can they exercise or resume it, unless it is abused.”To this day, the US remains a deeply flawed democracy. It still has an electoral college designed to thwart majorities. It still has a senate that guarantees inequality of political representation. It still is the scene of pitched struggles over the right to vote.Yet, this primordial American prejudice against democracy was almost instantly transformed by an equally passionate upwelling of American enthusiasm for democracy, in the wake of the French Revolution. Among the enthusiasts was Thomas Jefferson, who, in 1800, brought his Democratic-Republican party to power, and in this way also brought democracy – at least as a word – into the American lexicon.A generation later, Andrew Jackson, the first great American democratic leader – or, demagogue, to use the ancient Greek term of art for such a leader – became the US’s first plebiscitary president, imbued with imperial prerogatives in the eyes of his most ardent supporters. He was, after all, the only representative nominally elected by all the nation’s people (unless, of course, they were women, slaves or Native Americans – democracy in America in Jackson’s day was only the white man’s business).Jackson tried, and failed, to eliminate the electoral college. Such enduring limits to democracy in the US were, paradoxically, one reason why it was the first country to give birth to populism, both as a word and as a phenomenon. From 1892 till 1896, a People’s Party played a major political role in some parts of the US.At roughly the same time, Woodrow Wilson, arguably the country’s most ardent champion of democracy, criticised the populist movement and offered, instead, a new vision of the democratic system. A pioneering political scientist who would become the 28th president, Wilson pondered deeply the meaning of democracy, not just in the US, but in world history, where it marked in his view the highest stage of human evolution. In his private papers, after rejecting European conceptions of democracy as primitive, and corrupted by class conflict, he defined modern democracy “most briefly” as “government by popular opinion”.As Wilson concedes almost in passing, democracy in practice will always involve “the many led by the few: the minds of the few disciplined by persuading, and masses of men schooled and directed by being persuaded”. In other words, Wilson’s vision of self-rule is closer to Adams’s “natural aristocracy” than the popular sovereignty the French revolutionaries and American populists fought for.We find here a core ambiguity at the heart of modern liberal democracy, as Wilson understood it. All power in theory derives from the people – but in practice, the truest vessel of a people’s hopes will be its highest elected official when he enjoys the support of “public opinion”.There were, nonetheless, serious problems with Wilson’s recourse to public opinion. Views could rapidly change, and even an orator as persuasive as Wilson could not be sure if he had persuaded his fellows once and for all. Even worse – as Walter Lippmann pointed out in his landmark 1922 study, Public Opinion – in a complex political environment, where only disconnected bits of information are available to the average citizen, it was almost impossible in practice for the public’s opinion on any matter of moment to be either cogent or coherent.Lippman used for his epigraph Plato’s famous image of the inhabitants of a cave bewitched by shadows and unaware of the real world outside. The majority of modern men, Lippmann argues, are prisoners of shadowy and unexamined assumptions, immersed in private lives involving the pursuit of personal interests, with limited time and even less attention to give to public affairs.Lippmann’s conclusion is most bluntly stated in The Phantom Public: “The inidual man does not have opinions on all public affairs. He does not know how to direct public affairs. He does not know what is happening, why it is happening, what ought to happen. I cannot imagine how he could know, and there is not the least reason for thinking, as mystical democrats have thought, that the compounding of inidual ignorances in masses of people can produce a continuous directing force in public affairs.”In 1942, Joseph Schumpeter, an economist who had been born in Moravia and raised in Vienna before moving to the US in 1932 to teach at Harvard University, accurately summed up the strange results of merging a liberal democratic faith in public opinion with marketing methods refined by behavioural scientists. “What we are confronted with in the analysis of political processes,” he wrote, “is largely not a genuine but a manufactured will.”In his day, the primary tools for the manipulation of opinion were advertising and propaganda tailored to the results of public opinion polling. In our day, the integrity of public opinion is further threatened by the secrecy of many aspects of executive decision-making, and the increasingly sophisticated control of information by behavioural scientists and attention merchants, who are able to use new technologies to aim messages with unprecedented precision at responsive audiences.Schumpeter argued that the primary role of the people in a liberal democracy was in any case strictly limited: it was “to produce a government, or else an intermediate body which in turn will produce a national executive or government … the democratic method is that institutional arrangement for arriving at political decisions in which iniduals acquire the power to decide by means of a competitive struggle for the people’s vote.”In other words, modern democracy was not the rule of a sovereign people – instead, “democracy is the rule of the politician”, someone skilled at commanding public opinion and winning elections, whose power is chiefly balanced by his need for reelection, and the requirement that he leave office peacefully, should he lose the vote.Schumpeter was writing during the second world war, which had led to the total mobilisation of the civilian population in all combatant states. Worldwide, this unprecedented mobilisation led to the unprecedented slaughter of 60 million souls, the majority of them civilians, and six million of them Jews. In the US, it entailed a dramatic increase in the powers of the administrative state and of the state’s armed forces it also triggered a rise in the perceived need to keep key political deliberations and decisions concealed from the public.Faced with such facts, no wonder Schumpeter was pessimistic about future political prospects, fearing that a “socialist democracy may eventually turn out to be more of a sham than capitalist democracy ever was”.And yet, as the second world war unfolded, just as had happened during the first world war, there was a paradoxical resurgence of democratic idealism, inspired by renewed Allied claims that their victory would help forge a world “made safe for democracy”, just as Wilson had promised two generations earlier.After the horrors of two world wars, many hoped humanity would never again resort to violence on this industrial scale. After some hesitation, and with compromising caveats similar to those that undermined the League of Nations covenant – above all, a continuing effort to protect the imperial and racial prerogatives of the great powers – the victors agreed to create a new international organisation, the United Nations, and to ratify a new set of global principles, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted in 1948.It is easy to minimise the importance of a political document issued with no means of enforcing the norms it proclaimed. Yet the language of the declaration helped to inspire later human rights movements, and article 21 explicitly affirms that “everyone has the right to take part in the government of his country, directly or through freely chosen representatives”.Here is a key irony of the modern world: to this day, democracy, in most existing regimes, whether liberal or socialist or nationalist, is more or less a sham, even according to the criteria laid out in the UDHR, and just as Schumpeter said.Still, this “sham” also represents an epochal transformation: in the early 21st century, very few regimes, unlike most in the early 18th century, can rule over a subject population with impunity. On the contrary: the rulers of every contemporary regime that professes democratic values, however feebly realised, must periodically face the mundane threat posed by ordinary citizens, however uninformed, periodically queuing at a polling station, to exercise their right to vote, and so to transfer power, if they choose, to an entirely new set of political leaders.This is, as the Cambridge historian John Dunn puts it in the dyspeptic but accurate conclusion to his 2005 history of democracy, “a world in which faith, deference and even loyalty have largely passed away, and the keenest of personal admiration seldom lasts for long” – a wan description of what the modern democratic spirit has wrought.Yet this is also a world where the ideal of democracy is more universally honoured than ever before, and sometimes taken quite seriously, for better or worse.For example, in the decades since the ratification of the UDHR in 1948, most US presidents and diplomats have followed in Wilson’s footsteps by promoting liberal democratic expectations around the world – sometimes at gunpoint – just as communist regimes were trying at the same time to export their rival version of “democratic centralism”.So it is perhaps not surprising that our world has also witnessed, in virtually every country, poor or developed, socialist or communist, autocratic or liberal, a fitful, sometimes futile series of popular uprisings and protests, when crowds of ordinary people unite to demand a fairer share of the common wealth – and to claim for themselves a larger share in more truly democratic institutions. These revolts against remote elites are essential to the vitality, and viability, of modern democracy – even as (and precisely because) they challenge the status quo, destructive though that challenge may be.There are good reasons to be wary of what a people trying to exercise its sovereign rights may produce. Democratic revolts can create perverse results – and so can democratic elections. Despite the obvious risks, both Rousseau and Jefferson invoked a relevant maxim in defence of their own faith in ordinary citizens: Malo periculosam, libertatem quam quietam servitutem – “I prefer a dangerous freedom to peaceful slavery.” It’s an apt motto for these dark times.Adapted from Can Democracy Work?

This has led to raised eyebrows over the couple’s decision to copy Harry and Meghan with an open-topped carriage ride through Windsor, requiring road closures and an estimated £2m policing bill.The decision to broadcast the event live on television also raised eyebrows, although it will be shown on an extended version of ITV Daytime’s This Morning. The BBC reportedly resisted the suggestion of Prince Andrew to devote several hours of live coverage to the event.Presenters Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford will bring the appropriate gravitas to an event whose bridal party will include Prince George and Princess Charlotte, the children of Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge, and Theodora Williams, daughter of pop star and X Factor presenter Robbie Williams.While the wedding and reception costs will be met by the Queen and the couple’s families, the bill for traffic management, stewarding and policing will be picked up by the taxpayer.Harry and Meghan’s wedding in May, excluding security expenses, cost more than £1.25m, according to figures released by the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead, a sum later reimbursed by central government.But a spokeswoman for the council said that in terms of crowd numbers and associated stewarding and policing costs, it expected Harry’s and Eugenie’s nuptials to be “two very different weddings on two very different scales”.Not that anyone appears to have told the bride and groom. The invitation list stretches to 850 guests – 250 more than Meghan and Harry. The ceremony will be followed by a private reception hosted by the Queen, an evening party hosted by the Duke and Duchess of York and a reported second day of “festival-themed” celebration at Royal Lodge, Prince Andrew’s home within Windsor Castle’s grounds.The attendees have not been confirmed but alongside the Queen, Prince Andrew, the Duchess of York and other senior royals, they are widely expected to include celebrity friends George Clooney, for whose tequila brand, Casamigos Brooksbank acts as ambassador, Robbie Williams and wife Ayda Field, whom Eugenie met on holiday and, inevitably, the Beckhams.The attendance of the bride’s grandfather, the Duke of Edinburgh, who is 97 and has retired from public life, will reportedly be decided on a “wake up and see how I feel” basis. But the Duchess of Cornwall will not be attending due to a prior engagement at a school harvest festival in Scotland. As with Harry and Meghan’s wedding, 1,200 members of the public have been given tickets to hear a broadcast relay of the ceremony from outside the chapel doors.A history of art graduate from the university of Newcastle, Eugenie is a director at the London gallery Hauser \u0026amp Wirth. “We have very understanding bosses,” she said when asked about her charity work and other commitments.Like Meghan the groom is a very modern royal spouse, having met his princess while working in a bar in the upscale ski resort of Verbier.

But EU officials say that May has conceded that it will not contain a firm end date.Instead, the UK would stay in a customs union, likely to be described as a customs arrangement by the prime minister, on an indefinite basis. However, the British government would be able to point to criteria under which the arrangement would be terminated, fulfilling the British desire for it to appear to be a temporary arrangement.The nature of those criteria, and additional language to be used about the future deal, required by the UK to assuage concerns about the ultimate need for such a backstop solution to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, are still open to debate.The Irish backstop forms part of the exit treaty that the UK will sign with the EU when it leaves it spells out what customs and regulatory arrangements should operate in Great Britain and Northern Ireland in the event a comprehensive free trade deal cannot be signed by the two parties before the end of 2020 when the Brexit transition period ends. Hard Brexiters are concerned the UK could remain locked into the backstop arrangements indefinitely, particularly if it proves difficult to conclude a free trade deal.The challenge for May will be in selling the formulation to the whole cabinet and avoiding resignations. Full cabinet members concerned about the idea of an indefinite backstop and considered at risk of quitting include Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons who is very concerned about the lack of a time limit, and Esther McVey, the work and pensions secretary, who refused to specifically endorse May’s Chequers blueprint for Brexit earlier on Thursday – although she insisted that she was “completely supportive of the prime minister”.McVey’s formulation echoed that used on Tuesday by Penny Mordaunt, the international development secretary, who said that while “the prime minister can count on my support” she did not know “where this is going to end up”.Those present included Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister, Sajid Javid, the home secretary, Michael Gove, the environment secretary, and Liam Fox, the international trade secretary. No 10 said the meeting was an informal one, meaning no decisions were taken the key political meeting before next week’s summit will come on Tuesday at full cabinet, one day before the European council meeting begins.Earlier, No 10 played down suggestions that the government was on the brink of unveiling a Brexit deal. “There are big issues still to resolve. That was the case on Monday and it remains the case today,” the prime minister’s official spokesman said.The EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, told the European commission president and other commissioners in a private meeting on Wednesday that the principles of an agreement on the Irish border are largely accepted by both sides.May is struggling to contain restive hard Brexiters in her own party, and an angry DUP, which fears that she has already made too many concessions in negotiations going on behind the scenes ahead of next week’s critical European summit in Brussels.Shortly after the meeting began, the DUP leader, Arlene Foster, said that May and her cabinet colleagues who had told her they were unionists “could not in good conscience recommend a deal which places a trade barrier on United Kingdom businesses moving goods from one part of the kingdom to another”.The unionist leader said she feared that the EU was forcing Northern Ireland into a deal that amounted to “the worst of one world” in which the region would remain part of the single market and remain under the ECJ, and would remain subject to trade restrictions with the rest of the UK.A day earlier, the DUP had said it was prepared to vote down the budget if the prime minister in their eyes conceded too much ground to Brussels in the EU talks, risking an abrupt end to the confidence and supply agreement that has kept May in Downing Street since the 2017 election in which the Tories lost their overall majority.Foster alluded to that threat, saying these were “significant days for Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom as we know it” and concluded by saying the DUP and its 10 MPs “will take decisions based on what is best for everyone in Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom.”Michelle O’Neill, Sinn Fein’s vice-president, responded by saying that “the DUP does not speak for the majority of the people of the north on Brexit”. She said that the nationalist party supported remaining in the customs union and single market because it would give the north continued unfettered access to the EU market of around 500 million people and the British market of 67 million”.Whitehall sources said before the meeting that they expected that key members of the cabinet would also discuss how to handle the DUP. They suggested that senior ministers including Lidington, May’s de facto deputy, Northern Ireland secretary Karen Bradley and chief whip Julian Smith would try to find a solution to the DUP’s demands. “They’ll be discussing what we need to offer the DUP and how to get them on side,” one said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80c79dfe8e0e8cacce8f79f9bc4da38f4035084b/0_128_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d3ab325dc4e2b6505f4abd351063fdab","title":"second kent motorway is possible post brexit lorry park","story":"M26’s closure for site surveys angers local MP, amid wider concerns in Tory ranks about May’s Brexit plansA Kent motorway is undergoing a series of closures as work begins on turning it into a potential lorry park to deal with the possible impact of a no-deal Brexit.In the most significant practical work yet to prepare for the consequences of the UK crashing out of the EU, the M26 will be closed through the night until next week for site surveys before another set of closures in the month leading up to Christmas to install gates in the central reservation.The works, which drew the immediate anger of the local Conservative MP, got under way as Theresa May assembled her so-called “war cabinet” to brief them on the state of Brexit negotiations.The meeting took place amid growing concern in her own ranks that she is prepared to agree an indefinite customs backstop to ensure an open border in Ireland. Despite some signs that a deal was creeping closer, the meeting broke up with no clear indication that the terms of the withdrawal agreement would be immediately agreed.The start of the work was not disclosed to the MP Tom Tugendhat, who criticised the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, for apparently reneging on assurances. Grayling said he was confident that the contingency measure would not be needed after Brexit.The Department for Transport is developing plans under the codename “Operation Brock” to handle queues of thousands of trucks, should freight be unable to progress swiftly through the ports when the UK leaves the EU – possibly from March next year.Work has already started on the M20 motorway, with further closures ahead, where the DfT has earmarked a 13.5-mile stretch between Maidstone and Ashford as a holding park for thousands of trucks. The four-lane southbound carriageway will be closed, while a two-lane contraflow will allow traffic to continue to the Channel.Now it has been revealed that ministers are also planning to use the M26, a 10-mile motorway that links the M25 to the M20 in Kent starting 65 miles from Dover, to park more lorries.Highways England said: “As part of wider resilience planning, Highways England has been asked by the Department for Transport to develop plans to utilise the M26 to hold heavy goods vehicles, should further capacity be required in the future.“We will be undertaking site surveys on the M26 during October leading to the installation of two gates in the central reservation to support the safe management of freight in the future, if needed.”Although Highways England would not comment further on the details of their plans, the gates suggest that a contraflow system and car park would also be operated on the Kent motorway. Drivers will be erted around the M25 and M20 between 10pm and 5am, doubling the length of journeys.The news emerged as the furious local MP told the Commons that Grayling and Highways England had assured him and constituents that no works were planned up until Wednesday, when the closures started.Tugendhat, the MP for Tonbridge and Malling, said: “It’s come to a pretty pass when a member finds out that works have begun on a motorway to turn that motorway into a parking lot without consultation either with the local community or indeed with surrounding members.He called on the transport secretary to explain how planning permission was granted with “no consultation”. Locals believe the sudden closure could see many people choosing to drive on the parallel single-lane road through small villages in Kent rather than using the official ersion.Grayling asked to meet Tugendhat to discuss the issue: “I do not expect any of the contingencies that we have in place for a no-deal Brexit to be needed, because I’m confident we will reach a sensible agreement.”In 2015, disruption at Calais led to queues of lorries in Kent that were handled under Operation Stack, and the DfT has been searching for better ways to deal with stranded freight vehicles after roads were brought to a standstill. It has paid millions of pounds to the owners of the abandoned Manston airport in Kent as an emergency standby lorry park. While Operation Brock is still being drawn up as an interim measure, local council plans have shown that a dedicated lorry park is likely to be at least four years away.About 4m lorries cross the Channel between Dover and Calais each year, and hauliers have warned that the slightest delays will result in huge queues. Rod McKenzie, the director of policy at the Road Haulage Association, said: “It’s important that the government make contingency plans for a no-deal Brexit, but the concern is that this may be too little, too late – and it may have an impact on the rest of the supply chain in the Kent area, quite apart from the total chaos at the Channel tunnel and Dover.“We’re worried that if there is no deal by November, drivers are going to need permits, and make safety and customs declarations, which is disastrous. The government are finally getting their heads around the scale of it.”But he added: “Turning motorways into car parks frankly doesn’t really help. It’s more congestion and more pollution, which we’re all trying to cut down on – it’s not good news in any shape or form.”He warned that lorry parks would not solve the problem of just-in-time deliveries and perishable goods, and that they could spell appalling conditions for drivers: “Imagine spending 15 hours parked up on a motorway with no lavatory or wash facilities – the mind boggles.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/108674ec9a138763b9c41f05301275064d387635/195_0_4033_2420/master/4033.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=96f5efb36b499fe936d4b502a7af4bc1","title":"uk sport funding athletes tokyo 2020","story":"• ‘Aspiration fund’ totalling £3m set up by the government • Paralympic sports such as wheelchair rugby also eligibleOlympic sports such as badminton, basketball and surfing, which do not receive elite funding by UK Sport, will be able to apply for up to £500,000 of financial help from a new “aspiration fund” set up by the government.Paralympic sports, such as wheelchair rugby and goal ball, will also be eligible for the scheme, which is designed to help athletes from more sports to qualify for Tokyo 2020 and beyond.Tracey Crouch, the minister for sport and civil society, said the fund, which amounts to £3m in total, would enable more athletes the chance to inspire the nation.“UK Sport investment has transformed Britain into an Olympic and Paralympic powerhouse,” she said. “But there are sports, not on UK Sport’s world-class programme, that do a huge amount of good in communities that we can help on their path to the podium.”Liz Nicholl, the chief executive of UK Sport, called it a “fantastic opportunity” for more sports to get on track for the Tokyo Games.She said: “Many of the sports we are unable to support, while further away from reaching the podium, have great potential not only to inspire through their performances but also to have a social impact in communities across the UK.”Table-tennis, skateboarding, handball and baseballsoftball are also expected to apply for the scheme. To receive funding, which will run until the end of the Tokyo 2020 cycle, sports will have to convince the government they will engage and inspire communities.The announcement was given a cautious welcome by David Pond, the chief executive of GB wheelchair rugby, which lost all of its UK Sport funding after finishing fifth at Rio 2016. “Any additional funding will obviously help us,” he said, “but the reality is next year I need to raise £400,000 to help us prepare us properly for the 2020 Paralympics.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb5211e33af2e2f14e78bd1c9215048ace31ff86/290_0_1710_1026/master/1710.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3139a285b2230d52ba8a9e31a62bbba4","title":"tigers forever wildlife hike north east laos","story":"A guided trek on Mount Forever helps protect endangered tigers and also reveals an exotic array of other, less elusive, wildlifeThe camp was dark save for the fire and the more muted glow from a tablet about to reveal the secrets of the forest. We crowded over images – covertly captured on camera traps in jungle barely trampled on by human feet. On the screen, the mammals and birds of this remote Laos forest flickered into life: stump-tailed macaques, a silver pheasant, a snuffling sun bear, an Asian antelope, an Indian mongoose, a couple of sambar deer, and a pair of white spectacled Lao leaf monkeys. This photographic bounty was an animal jackpot up here in sky-scraping terrain on the Laos-Vietnam border.The Nam Et-Phou Louey national protected area cloaks 4,229 sq km of mountainous jungle in off-the-beaten-track north-eastern Laos and shelters a handful (between 10 and 25) of endangered Indochinese tigers, five other cat species (leopard, clouded leopard, Asian golden cat, marbled cat and leopard cat), white-cheeked gibbons and Asian black bears, civets, porcupines and 288 species of birds. It’s a rich animal oasis in a country known as a linchpin in illegal global wildlife trafficking. Its reputation for being a source and a transit point for tiger parts and elephant ivory makes for very unsavoury reading and is being discussed at the Illegal Wildlife Trade conference being held in London this week (11-12 October). Yet, up here on the slopes of Mount Forever (Phou Loeuy), the Wildlife Conservation Society is marrying animal conservation with ecotourism in a bid to ensure the survival of the last remaining band of Indochinese tigers in Laos, and other rare Asian animals.I signed up to a five-day Cloud Forest trek organised by WCS guides and local Khmu villagers that would see us summit Mount Forever (Laos’ third highest peak at 2,257 metres), stake out a salt lick and observation tower, collect memory cards from the eight camera traps we would pass in the park, and end the trek sleeping in suspended bamboo baubles in a forest clearing.At Navane village, where the 40km trek begins, I met local guide Puangsone, deputy village chief and a former hunter who told me he gave up hunting “as that only benefitted myself whereas ecotourism benefits my entire village”.After a night spent with a Navane family sharing kao tom (purple rice and peanuts wrapped in banana palm) and mushroom salad, we set off along a dirt track, live cockerel in tow (to eat later), accompanied by marigold butterflies and the shrill call of the green-eared barbet bird. Ferns and bamboo sprouted wildly and the higher we climbed, the more monstrous the size of the moths became.Then, after seven kilometres and at 1,000 metres, Khamphew, one of our guides, revealed one of the best things about this trek: cascading spring water that collects into pools. At Tad Ang waterfall, overlooked by banana fronds and glistening fernery, I stripped off and cooled down in the clear water, bathing separately from the male guides, according to Lao cultural mores.At Houey Kaneng, our first camp, we cooled off in another stream before gathering around Khamphew as he readied his tablet. Waiting for the animal portraits to emerge, I asked Puangsone about the rice offering he had placed on the wooden spirit post, close to our campfire.“When we arrive at a strange place, we have to ask the owners of this place to protect us and wish us luck. I offered the rice to the forest spirit here so that bad luck does not befall our lives.”As the animal shots downloaded onto the tablet, it broke the suspense. The tigers had eluded the cameras but there were beautiful tableaux of macaques and spectacled leaf monkeys with their dazzling facial markings. After a meal of rice cakes and eggs, and feeling secure that the spirit would protect me from any roaming animals, we settled down to sleep in the stilt huts of Houey Kaneng, built especially for the WCS trek.Woken early by the choir of birds, we set off the following morning into thicker ground working our way around gnarled liana knots, our path decorated with white and orange orchids. Under a perfect blue sky, we began the ascent.Below us, a sea of tree tops undulated in the breeze. Ahead, velvety moss-dressed trees lined our hike up a rocky staircase of jet black stones. It felt thrilling to trek where few had trodden before, accompanied by chattering birds all the way.At the summit of Mount Forever, surrounded by dainty white orchids, Khamphew told us the US military had a base up here before the Pathet Lao communist victory in 1975. In an attempt to contain the “red tide” of Communism in south-east Asia and stop Laos becoming, in US military parlance, the dreaded domino, a secret war was conducted in the country. Between 1964 and 1973, nearly three million tonnes of bombs, rockets and shells fell on Laos. Up here on Mount Forever, we found discarded oil drums, ammo boxes, and spent mortar rounds.It had taken seemingly forever to summit Mount Forever was that how it got its name, I asked? “No,” Puangsone, said, it was because during the secret war there were 50 families who were afraid of the bombing. They believed the spirit of Phou Louey would protect them if they sacrificed a black and a white buffalo.“They went to the mountain to make the sacrifice so they are protected forever but those families never came back so they are gone forever …”On the fourth and final night we stayed at the Poung Nyied salt lick camp, 12km from the end of the trek. Here in the middle of the forest six spherical bamboo sleeping pods – the “nests” – are suspended in the trees. Designed by UKCambodia architect Atelier Cole in 2016, they look like giant Pac-Mans skulking in the branches but their bauble shape is actually inspired by the pretty paper lanterns on sale in the night market in Laos’ former royal capital of Luang Prabang. Close to the pods is a simple, sleek observation tower, also designed by Atelier Cole, overlooking the natural Poung Nyied salt lick. As we climbed up the steps into the tower we received strict instruction not to make a sound, waiting to see if any animals would mosey in to suck up minerals. A barking muntjac startled us and every crackle, pop and snap of branches and leaves was sharpened in the quiet.With my binoculars, I zoomed in on what I thought was a tiger print but it was just my imagination conjuring up an image because I was desperate to catch a glimpse of a tiger.We climbed down and ploughed through swampish ground to retrieve more memory cards. Puangsone collected wild watercress, too, which we ate back at the camp along with freshly foraged wild raspberries. After three nights in stilt huts, the bamboo nests were a welcome change. High enough to be dangling, and to deter a prowling Indochinese tiger, I thought, as I climbed the little stepladder, and shuttered the “eyelid” of the pod cocooning myself inside. I lay there pondering the folktale about the malevolent tiger that was able to transform into a man to lure villagers to their death that Khamphew had just told us around the dying embers of the camp fire.• The trip was provided by the Nam Et-Phou Louey national protected area. The challenging five-day Cloud Forest Trek, including a night at the nests, costs from £404pp (when two travel). The easier two- or three-day trek to the salt lick and nests, covering around 12km at lower heights, costs from £135-£224pp (when two travel). Another option includes climbing Mount Forever on a more gruelling three-day trip without the base camp and Nests’ adventure (from £270pp when two travel). The boat-based Night Safari costs from £135 (when two travel). Food, drink, mosquito nets and sleeping gear is included. Treks run in the dry season only, from June to October."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b29c0ac6f69b7fe30d21c7c1eb7c4ee6440f3f34/0_222_2503_1501/master/2503.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b1e9bef50eb3d399439723642b32f2de","title":"strictly a show trial why all the fuss about seann and katyas snog","story":"Seann Walsh, Katya Jones, her husband and his dog have been in the UK papers all week. Is the ‘curse of Strictly’ more about moralistic BBC bashing?It all started with a snog. Since shots of Strictly Come Dancing contestant Seann Walsh’s drunken kiss with dance partner Katya Jones appeared on the front page of the Sun on Sunday, the story has been played out in the red-tops. Today, the pair have made front pages of the Sun, the Mirror and Daily Mail. Their crime? Not apologising enough for said snog when they appeared on the Strictly spin-off It Takes Two to apologise for their actions.It is not surprising the duo have been pilloried by the press. The popular press love stories about the relationship-ending “curse of Strictly”, whose victims include rugby player Ben Cohen (who left his wife and now has a child with his dance partner Kristina Rihanoff) Rachel Riley (who orced her husband after appearing on the show in 2013 and is now with her partner Pasha Kovalev) and actor Georgia May Foote (who separated from her boyfriend before going on to date her dance partner Giovanni Pernice).We do not know what went on in Walsh’s relationship with his ex-girlfriend, the actor Rebecca Humphries. She did, however, write an extraordinarily brave and articulate statement that she posted on Twitter (note: she did not sell her story to the press, despite being offered money for doing so). In it, she claimed that during their relationship he had “aggressively and repeatedly” called her “psycho, nuts, mental” about her suspicions over his fidelity. Walsh has not addressed these claims.Yet the current coverage is not centred on this. Instead, it is a show trial for a snog.The dedicated column inches for forensic analysis of yesterday’s TV appearance included a front-page splash in the Sun under the banner “cheats face the music”. Over two further pages inside, the paper ran a full transcript of the interview, next to which a dedicated body-language expert was called in to explain that Walsh was not sincere because he “rubbed his nose” which is a “cut-off gesture”. Elsewhere, unnamed friends of Jones were quoted as saying the “Strictly snogger” keeps her husband “under the thumb”.The Mirror, meanwhile, went with the front-page headline “sorry excuse” and an inside page featuring a paparazzi picture of Jones’s husband Neil out walking his dog. The Daily Mail went with “Cha-cha cheat’s weasel apology”.While the judges have said that the incident will not affect the pair’s scores on Saturday night, and that they will be judged solely on their Charleston, viewers are expected to deliver them a sequinned blow on Saturday night in the public vote.Why do the papers care so much about a kiss? Perhaps it is in part because licence-fee-payers often feel as if they own the BBC.But the reason is also because family show Strictly is the embodiment of the BBC’s commitment to “inform, educate and entertain”. The fact that Jones is a married woman also sparks moral outrage. If the papers see the BBC as gatekeepers of the nation’s moral values, then any transgression by its stars will be seen as public property. Even if, at the moment, all that is in the public domain is a quick snog in the dark."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e6dd78ed27c65dd4092cadff1707a974c8bd942/0_100_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=493b72b486a9e2298278c5545d87656e","title":"hurricane michael trail of devastation florida georgia","story":"Florida and Georgia count cost of one of the strongest hurricanes ever to hit US as downgraded storm dumps rain on CarolinasThe colossal scale of Hurricane Michael’s deadly trail of carnage through Florida’s Panhandle became clear on Thursday as the waning but still powerful storm lashed the Carolinas before heading east towards the Atlantic.Entire waterfront communities were obliterated by one of the most powerful storms ever to strike the United States and authorities confirmed that at least six people had lost their lives. The death toll was expected to rise.Downgraded to a tropical storm, the cyclone that struck Florida’s Panhandle as a category 4 monster on Wednesday, with winds of 155mph, dumped large quantities of rain and caused further flooding in areas of South and North Carolina still recovering from Hurricane Florence last month.But it was Florida, where Governor Rick Scott had predicted “unimaginable devastation”, that clearly fared the worst, with coastal towns inundated by catastrophic wind and a storm surge of up to 14ft from the Gulf of Mexico.Television pictures showed that some residential waterfront communities had been completely destroyed. Street after street of houses and other buildings were ripped apart in Panama City, boats and warehouses in marinas were smashed into pieces, roofs were ripped from multiple structures in several other communities. Fallen trees and downed power lines were everywhere, with more than a million homes and businesses without electricity in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Virginia and North and South Carolina, according to poweroutage.us.“It looks like an atomic bomb had hit our city,” resident David Barnes told the Panama City News Herald. “Damage has been widespread.”Authorities confirmed at least six deaths, four of them in Florida’s Gadsden county near the state capital, Tallahassee. One man was killed when a tree fell on his house. An 11-year-old girl in Seminole county, Georgia, died after a mobile carport was picked up by the wind, crashed through the roof of the home where she was staying, and hit her on the head, the local emergency management agency director, Travis Brooks, told WALB. And a sixth death was confirmed in Iredell county, North Carolina, a male driver whose car was crushed by a tree during the storm.In Mexico Beach, Florida, where Michael roared ashore at lunchtime on Wednesday with winds gusting to 175mph, the small town of barely 1,000 was “wiped out”, according to Brock Long, the administrator of the federal emergency management agency (Fema). A CNN reporter looked down from a helicopter on whole streets flattened in a town Long called the hurricane’s “ground zero”.First responders were only able to reach the community after daylight on Thursday morning, and more helicopter footage showed national guard troops helping a handful of survivors.A Mexico Beach town councillor, Rex Putnal, said he was anxiously awaiting news of residents who had defied evacuation orders and chosen to stay.A Mexico Beach resident, Scott Boutell, was close to tears as he spoke to the same reporter in front of his wrecked house: “Our lives are gone here. All the stores, all the restaurants, everything. There’s nothing left here any more,” he said.At a briefing on Thursday, Governor Scott of Florida spoke of the devastation across the Panhandle. “This hurricane was an absolute monster,” he said. “So many lives have been changed forever. Homes are gone, businesses are gone. Roads and infrastructures along the storm’s path have been destroyed.”Michael had crossed into Georgia late on Wednesday still as a category 3 hurricane with winds of 125mph, spawning tornadoes, one of which damaged five houses in Roberta. By 5pm Thursday, it was still a tropical storm with winds at 50mph as it moved swiftly towards the North Carolina-Virginia coastline and a weekend Atlantic crossing to western Europe, with southern Ireland and Cornwall in its long-range sights.In Panama City, two hospitals that were badly damaged were evacuating patients to hospitals in Pensacola.Federal help was also being sent in. Long, the head of Fema, said it would take some time to establish priority areas of need.“There’s a lot of debris to get through to get the teams in and be able to assess damage,” he said. “Access to all the areas is one thing, search and rescue is where we are hyper-focused,” he said.“This is what a category 4, borderline category 5 storm looks like, the worst of the storm surge, the worst of the wind and because it was strong it created a lot of damage far inland. It’s continuing to rush through South and North Carolina today.”Van Johnson Sr, the mayor of Apalachicola, another waterfront community ravaged by the storm, said he was also trying to assess the extent of the damage. “There are so many downed power lines and trees that it’s almost impossible to get through the town,” he said.Michael was the most powerful storm to hit the US in more than 25 years, and the most powerful on record in the Florida Panhandle. It sprang quickly from a weekend tropical depression, going from a category 2 on Tuesday to a category 4 storm by the time it came ashore.There have been isolated reports of looting. Congressman Neal Dunn said some arrests had been made in Bay county and the authorities had imposed a curfew.Donald Trump has approved a major disaster declaration request for Florida, freeing federal resources for recovery efforts. The US president said at the White House that Michael was “an unbelievably destructive, powerful storm. We’ve not seen destruction like that in a long time.”The cyclone triggered flash floods and mudslides earlier this week in mountain areas of western Cuba. Six people died in Honduras, four in Nicaragua and three in El Salvador."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4fa9c6cbb9d651f07e67c5a469e3114d87e3a9f/0_254_3685_2211/master/3685.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=012997b1901c0b882d7a1b2832f5146c","title":"arizona republicans communists democrats donation attempt","story":"Men visit office of Arizona’s Tom O’Halleran with jar of money in apparent effort to create link to far-leftTwo young Arizona Republicans tried to make a donation to a Democratic congressman as members of the Communist party in an apparent attempt to tie him to the far left.On Friday afternoon, two men who called themselves Jose Rosales and Ahmahd Sadia walked into the campaign office of first-term Democrat Tom O’Halleran with $39.68 and an urgent desire for the Northern Arizona University Communist party to be given a receipt for the donation.The pair initially walked in to sign up to volunteer but had brought along a jar full of money that they wished to donate. After being directed to a finance staffer, they were told to fill out paperwork. In doing so, they identified themselves as members of the Northern Arizona University Communist party. They made clear they were not an official group but were holding meetings. But they also insisted upon a receipt.When told they get only an emailed receipt, Rosales immediately scratched out one email and wrote another. The entire process raised eyebrows among O’Halleran’s staff. Lindsey Coleman, the finance director for the campaign, then drove to the local Republican field office to return the money. Almost immediately, the man who identified himself as Rosales appeared from a room inside the office and was identified as Oscar. He accepted the money from Coleman.Speaking to the , Coleman identified the second man as a field organizer for the Arizona Republican party and said Ahmahd Sadia was not his real name. Neither the Arizona Republican party nor Wendy Rogers, O’Halleran’s Republican opponent for Congress, responded to requests for comment.Making federal campaign contributions under a false identity is a crime. However, as a dirty trick, the attempt to smear opponents by linking them to unsavory political groups has a long history. In 1972, Roger Stone, then a young campaign staffer for Richard Nixon’s re-election campaign, sent a donation to Nixon’s anti-war primary opponent in the name of the Young Socialist Alliance. Stone went on to serve as Donald Trump’s longtime political adviser, a role he left early in Trump’s presidential campaign.The rural Arizona district was narrowly won by both Donald Trump in 2016 and Mitt Romney in 2012.

But the upcoming midterms could, belatedly, see a stirring of a slumbering green giant.“The environmental movement doesn’t have a persuasion problem, it has a turnout problem,” said Nathaniel Stinnett, founder of the Environmental Voter Project, which is aiming to spur people who care about the natural world and climate change to the ballot box. “This group has more power than it realizes. In the midterms we want to flood the zone with environmentalists.”Any such voting surge would go some way to heeding the increasingly urgent warnings from scientists about climate change. A major UN climate report released this week said the world risks worsening floods, droughts, species loss and poverty without “rapid and far-reaching transitions” to energy, transport and land use.“We show it can be done within laws of physics and chemistry,” said Jim Skea, a co-author of the exhaustive report. “The final tick box is political will. We cannot answer that.”In 2018, it is aiming to reach 2.4 million of these voters across six states as part of a turnout effort that could help swing some key races. An army of 1,800 volunteers will knock on doors, fire off text messages, make calls, send mailouts. The “punchline” of the Environmental Voter Project, Stinnett said, is that it doesn’t talk to voters about the environment at all. It simply tries to get them out to vote.“We are already targeting people who care about the environment, all we want to do is get them to vote on election day,” he said. “Peer and social pressure are the best ways – we will send someone a letter saying ‘did you know 93 people in your building turned out to vote last time?’ We play to societal norms and expectations.“Our focus isn’t to change the outcome of particular elections but there’s no doubt the number of non-voting environmentalists in some districts is so large that they will have an impact. We need to hold politicians’ feet to the fire on the environment, but first of all we need some fire.”Americans of voting age who care strongly about the environment have been unusually reticent to make their voice heard, for reasons that are still unclear. Stinnett said demographics are part of it – the young, Latinos and black people are simultaneously most worried about climate change and least likely to vote – but this doesn’t explain the full story.“It’s hard to figure out why,” he said. “Even among young people, for example, environmentalists are less likely to vote. The environmental movement has done a lot of things to change the way we eat, travel and work, but it hasn’t flexed its political muscles yet.Look at the NRA. Their power isn’t in the amount of money they spend – it’s because if you care about gun rights, you vote like it’s your job. Politicians know that and they are in the business of collecting votes. Why would they spend time on an issue that doesn’t appear to energize voters?”Beyond disasters such as hurricanes and wildfires, most politicians and the media, particularly broadcast news, rarely dwell for long on environmental matters. In 2017, the costliest year on record for climate-related disasters, a total of just 260 minutes coverage of climate change was broadcast across the six major TV networks, according to one analysis.A year prior, no questions on climate change were put to Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton during three presidential debates. Trump has subsequently ignored the issue in office, save the odd disparaging tweet, while overseeing an administration that has systematically dismantled climate, air and water pollution regulations.At first glance, the evidence suggests there will be only a mild voter backlash to this agenda. Voters asked recently by Yale University to rank 28 issues placed global warming 15th, behind areas like tax reform, immigration, terrorism, healthcare and the economy.The partisan split is stark, however – while liberal Democrats place global warming fourth out of 28, conservative Republicans rank it dead last. “The issue has become more polarized than abortion in terms of voting priorities,” said Anthony Leiserowitz, director of the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication. “The most important factor in belief in climate science is political ideology.“It is remarkable that the base of one of the two major parties in the US lists climate change as a top four issue. You wouldn’t have seen that five years ago. But those numbers drop among conservative Democrats and so candidates are afraid to touch it when reaching to the middle. And among conservative Republicans, the issue is just toxic.”In a few close midterm races, this split is evident. In Pennsylvania’s redrawn 10th district, for example, Democrat George Scott, a former soldier and pastor, is up against incumbent Scott Perry.While Scott has said there is an “obligation to our children and grandchildren to take immediate action” on climate change, Perry has done little on the issue other than to attempt to prevent the Pentagon from doing anything related to climate change and seemingly blame God for pollution in Chesapeake Bay. The Environmental Voter Project is targeting 31,292 seldom-voting and non-voting environmentalists in Perry’s district ahead of the election.“This is Trump country and the environment and climate change isn’t a top issue here,” said Alex Bishop, a registered Republican who works in marketing for a tech company. Bishop lives in York, a city in southern Pennsylvania that is a key urban hub in the 10th district, and is involved in outreach to fellow conservatives on climate change.“Even saying ‘climate change’ sets off red flags here so it’s better to connect climate change with other issues, such as immigration or the military protecting fossil fuels. I would say it’s gone from ‘it’s all a hoax’ to ‘maybe something is going on.’ It doesn’t sound like much progress, but it’s slowly turning.”The isiveness of climate change can be separated from broader environmental concerns over the health of the air, water and landscapes. In Yale’s poll “environmental protection” ranks as a top 10 issue for Democrats and is number 11 for moderate Republicans, a group Leiserowitz describes as comprising roughly a third of the party that follows in the Teddy Roosevelt tradition of fondness for public lands and wildlife stewardship.But in a new political landscape where energizing a core of voters is edging out the desire to reach a diminishing middle ground, climate change is vigorously debated by both sides only during Democratic primary races.“The link between events like hurricanes and climate change is emerging as an idea in Americans’ minds, even as they are swamped by partisanship,” said Leiserowitz.“It’s conceivable climate change will swing future elections but it’s also conceivable we will continue to ignore the issue. After all, it gets almost no ink in the media, so how can we expect people to think it’s important?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/adad2fd0dcec1d52e9c0e31e75e70919c733ba41/321_0_3560_2136/master/3560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a33228ee579f82b300f3f3856d7752ad","title":"panama city hurricane michael florida in pictures","story":"Hurricane Michael, the fiercest to hit Florida in 80 years, made landfall on Wednesday afternoon hitting Panama City and Mexico Beach in Florida’s Panhandle.

Donald Trump and rapper Kanye West have displayed their celebrity bromance in a very verbally one-sided encounter that contends strongly for the title of strangest thing ever to happen in the Oval Office.“Trump is on his hero’s journey right now and he might not have expected to have a crazy motherfucker like Kanye West run up and support but, best believe, we are going to make America great,” the rapper told the assembled press, seated across from the president.

Lawsuits were launched against the Home Office after BBC Panorama exposed abuses at Brook House immigration removal centre near Gatwick. The Home Office says in a letter seen by the  that if the lawsuits are dropped it will commission an investigation by the prisons and probation ombudsman. An average of two suicide attempts a day have been happening in Britain’s deportation prisons, according to figures obtained under freedom of information. Meanwhile the government is also deporting people to countries that at the same time the Foreign Office deems too dangerous for Britons to visit. Yvette Cooper, the Labour MP who chairs the Commons home affairs committee, said the detention system was “causing huge and often irreparable damage to peoples’ lives” and needed urgent reform.Tailback control – The M26 motorway in Kent is being prepared for use as a lorry park in case Brexit creates huge traffic jams at the ports.

There are fears that more ministers will head for the door if there is no time limit. But at least we’ll still have Irish cheddar at a good price. Britain’s tax chief says he received death threats after disclosing that a customs option preferred by Brexiters would cost the UK up to £20bn. Nicky Morgan, chair of the Treasury committee, told PoliticsHome: “As someone who has also been threatened, it is deeply concerning that this is what Brexit seems to have done to public life.”Soyuz came back – First, there was the hole in a Soyuz module docked at the International Space Station.

Most signatories are British but politicians from Germany, Sweden, Belgium and Poland have also lent support.The letter describes Kyenge’s treatment as symptomatic of a wider problem across Europe, following the rise of “populist, far-right parties in government who are pushing their nationalist agenda and spreading fear and hate against minorities”.It refers to a recent EU foreign ministers’ meeting, where Matteo Salvini, the League leader and Italy’s deputy prime minister, compared African immigrants to slaves.Kyenge, who moved to Italy in 1983 from the Democratic Republic of Congo to study medicine, said she has repeatedly called on the League to condemn racism. In an interview with the  in May, she spoke of her deep concerns when the far-right party was elected. “It is very difficult for me to see that a party that accepts it is racist is going to manage law, which is supposed to protect all the community.”During her time as minister for integration in 2013-14 Kyenge faced an onslaught of racist and misogynist abuse. A local councillor for the League called for her to be raped, while one of the party’s MEPs said she would impose “tribal conditions” on Italy.When the defamation case was announced last month, Kyenge listed on Facebook examples of headlines generated by the League over the years, including one in 2009 when Salvini called for racial segregation on Milan’s public transport system. “Salvini has summoned me to court because I said the League is racist,” she wrote. “Judge for yourself.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45adb3c103cdcc852cca9b5806ab7752ef39942f/0_307_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=616728cbb15acc1217b4707d1df3f663","title":"let the children play man who built playground lesbos salam aldeen","story":"Salam Aldeen has made it his mission to improve the lives of child refugees at the Moria campEyes glued to the screen, mouths wide open, they watch the final scene of the Disney film Aladdin.When the movie ends, the faces of nearly 500 children turn gloomy and tears fall down their cheeks. They come from Afghanistan, Syria and Iraq, and the time has come for them to return to their tents and metal containers in the squalid Moria camp on Lesbos. No one is getting out of here on a magic carpet.Dozens of the 3,000 minors here have attempted suicide because of overcrowding, squalor and their hopeless situation. But one man is trying to make things a little better for the children abandoned on Europe’s doorstep.Moved by the death of Alan Kurdi, the three-year-old Syrian boy who made global headlines when his lifeless body was pictured lying face down on a Turkish beach, Salam Aldeen headed to Lesbos three years ago and dedicated his life to migrants.In a warehouse 200 metres from the camp, the Iraqi-Danish founder of the aid group Team Humanity constructed a playground, with inflatable castles and a small football pitch.Several hundred children arrive at 4pm, holding hands.“It was difficult for the children to leave behind what they were experiencing in the camp,’’ says Aldeen, who has recruited volunteers among the refugees in Moria. “They’d watch their Syrian parents quarrel with their Afghan neighbours, and they’d bring the same tensions into the playground.“We worked hard to try and convince them that in here, just as in the camp, we’re all the same: no colours, no religions, just human beings. And you know what? They understood it better than the adults.”News doesn\u0027t always have to be bad – indeed, the relentless focus on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame risks convincing the public that the world is hopeless and there is nothing we can do.This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theIn the evening, the volunteers set up a large screen where cartoons and films for children are shown in Arabic or Farsi. These are the final moments of peace for the children, who know that soon they will have to return to the camp, where the air is foul because rubbish is scattered everywhere and mothers sleep with knives under their pillows to defend themselves from rape.Ayat Abuznade, a 31-year-old Palestinian doctor who often visits Lesbos to volunteer, says the venture has given the children hope. “I saw hope and happiness begin to light up in these children’s eyes,” she said. “Day to day, I experienced children just being normal children, without any worry or fear showing in their eyes. This centre gives these children suffering hope and somewhat of a temporary normal life.”Aldeen has also devoted himself to saving migrants on the perilous journey to Europe. His name has become known across the Middle East, spoken of by people in destroyed homes in Mosul or at camps in Syria and Jordan.In January 2016, he was arrested in Greece and accused of aiding illegal immigration because, according to the authorities, one day he went too close to the Turkish waters to search for two sinking migrant boats.He spent 48 hours in jail but faced a trial that lasted two years. He was acquitted of all charges in May 2018 and eventually resumed his work.A few weeks later, a Danish businessman asked him what he would do with a sizeable donation. “I’d build a playground,’’ he said. “A place where the children of Lesbos could go back to being kids.”This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

It also said Rosslare services are operating to and from Wicklow only due to a points failure. It said efforts to source buses between Wicklow and the city centre have not been successful.At least 20 Aer Lingus flights in and out of Dublin Airport have been cancelled due to the storm, while a Ryanair flight to Shannon Airport was erted to Dublin on Friday morning. The National Emergency Co-ordination Group has warned the public to stay away from coastal areas until the lifting of a Status Orange weather warning.Met Éireann’s Status Orange weather warning applies to 13 counties - Dublin, Louth, Wexford, Wicklow, Meath, Cork, Waterford, Donegal, Galway, Mayo, Sligo, Clare and Kerry. It said warnings would remain in place from 11pm last night until 5pm in Donegal, Galway, Mayo, Sligo and Clare and until 9am this morning for other counties.“The strongest winds will be all around the coast of Ireland but with a particular emphasis on Atlantic coastal counties and there will be rain accompanying it too,” Met Éireann meteorologist Siobhán Ryan said on Thursday night.The Department of Education said schools should “err on the side of caution” when considering whether to open today.“Schools and all education centres in areas affected by a status orange alert should remain vigilant, and keep themselves appraised of any hourly and other updates from Met Éireann, and from their local authorities, local radio, and an Garda Síochána,” it said.In Galway City a temporary 80m “aquadam” was installed at the Spanish Arch on the river Corrib estuary, while flood gates were installed at Toft carpark in Salthill.

The Coast Guard warned people to stay away from exposed beaches, cliffs and piers, harbour walls and promenades.Met Éireann said the storm conditions should abate fairly quickly on Friday afternoon with drier weather developing for a time.

Photograph: BRENDAN SMIALOWSKIAFPGetty ImagesRescuers are searching ravaged beach communities after one of the most powerful hurricanes in US history hit the Florida Panhandle and killed at least seven people.Hurricane Michael struck Florida’s northwest coast near the small town of Mexico Beach on Wednesday afternoon with top sustained winds of 250 kph (155mph), pushing a wall of seawater inland and causing widespread flooding.At least seven people were killed by falling trees and other hurricane-related incidents in Florida, Georgia and North Carolina, according to state officials.The storm tore entire neighbourhoods apart in the Panhandle, reducing homes and businesses to piles of rubble, damaging roads and leaving scenes of devastation that resembled the aftermath of a carpet-bombing operation.The US army used heavy equipment to push a path through debris in Mexico Beach to allow rescuers through to search for trapped residents, survivors or casualties, as Blackhawk helicopters circled overhead. Rescuers from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) used dogs, drones and GPS in the search.“We prepare for the worst and hope for the best. This is obviously the worst,” said Stephanie Palmer, a Fema firefighter and rescuer from Coral Springs, Florida.Much of downtown Port St. Joe, 19km east of Mexico Beach, was flooded after Michael snapped boats in two and hurled a large ship onto the shore, residents said.“We had houses that were on one side of the street and now they’re on the other,” said Mayor Bo Patterson, who watched trees fly by his window as he rode out the storm in his home seven blocks from the beach.Mr Patterson estimated 1,000 homes were completely or partially destroyed in his town of 3,500 people.Jordon Tood (31), a charter boat captain in Port St. Joe, said: “There were mandatory evacuation orders, but only idiots like us stuck around.”“I’ve never seen anything like this craziness,” said Tamara’s cafe owner Danny Itzkovitz (54). “We’ve had storms before - in ‘05 we had four or five in a row. I didn’t even take the boards off my window. But, holy smokes, this one kicked our butt.”The storm peeled back part of the gym roof and tore off a wall at Jinks Middle School in Panama City. A year ago, the school welcomed students and families displaced by Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico.With a low barometric pressure recorded at 919 millibars, a measure of a hurricane’s force, Michael was the third strongest storm on record to hit the continental United States, behind only Hurricane Camille on the Mississippi Gulf Coast in 1969 and the Labor Day hurricane of 1935 in the Florida Keys.It weakened overnight to a tropical storm.Many of the injured in Florida were taken to hard-hit Panama City, 32km northwest of Mexico Beach.Gulf Coast Regional Medical Center treated some but the hospital evacuated 130 patients as it faced challenges running on generators after the storm knocked out power, ripped off part of its roof and smashed windows.Almost 1.2 million homes and businesses were without power from Florida to Virginia on Thursday because of the storm.The number of people in emergency shelters was expected to swell to 20,000 across five states by Friday, said the American Red Cross. – Reuters"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/10/11/TELEMMGLPICT000177503157_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"ireland joins french speaking club bid wield clout brexit","story":"Ireland has joined the French-speaking community as an observerIreland has been accepted as a member of the international organisation of francophone nations amid concern that Brexit could leave its English-speaking diplomats out in the cold.It may not be the land of “bonjour” but the country was authorised to become an observer member of the Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie — the French equivalent of the Commonwealth — at a summit in Armenia attended by President Emmanuel Macron. Dublin’s application came amid concerns it lacks clout in continents such as Africa, where France retains extensive links in French-speaking countries, notably in the West.Joining the club, even as an observer, was part of an attempt to “double the scope and impact of Ireland’s global footprint in the period to 2025”, Helen McEntee, Ireland’s European affairs minister, told the summit.Brushing off claims that the Irish are no more versed in le français than the British, she insisted her countrymen had a “passion” for French, reminding doubters that Oscar Wilde and Samuel Beckett wrote some of their works in French.Irish Foreign Affairs Minister Helen McEntee said Ireland\u0026#39s entry into the French-speaking community would help it double its global reachOIF figures suggest that 12 per cent of Irish citizens speak the language of Molière, which may not sound a lot but is a good deal higher than the 0.1 per cent of Ukrainians and Uruguayans who speak French and whose countries already enjoy observer status. Ireland hopes that membership will help it court ministers and strengthen economic ties around the world, as well as tightening links with France as Britain leaves the European Union.Paris, which calls most of the shots at the OIF, paying almost half of its annual €80 million (£70m) budget, backed the Irish bid. Founded in 1970 to bring together French-speaking nations in the name of peace, democracy, human rights and sustainable development, the OIF has come under fire for turning into a tool for French soft power around the globe.Those wishing to join only need show a “will to favour the development of the use of French.That explains why at the summit in Yerevan, Gambia, Malta and Louisiana were also made observer members whilst Kosovo, Serbia and the United Arab Emirates became full members.But one hopeful new entrant, Saudi Arabia, pulled out at the last minute after Canada cried foul over its human rights record.The widening of its remit has irked a growing number of francophone purists. The OIF is running a real risk of losing its cohesion, Pierre-Andre Wiltzer, a former French minister responsible for francophonie told AFP.France is accused of using the French-speaking club to wield diplomatic influence abroad over and above concerns about language and democracyMr Macron is facing further controversy at this summit over the choice of a successor to Michaëlle Jean, the Canadian of Haitian origin who has been its general secretary since 2014. The clear favourite is Louise Mushikiwabo, foreign minister of Rwanda, a nation which, in 2009, sparked Gallic criticism for making English an official language alongside Kinyarwanda, Swahili and French.Mr Macron backed her candidacy in an attempt to mend fences with Rwanda after decades of frosty relations over France’s alleged role in the 1994 genocide.That sparked fury among rivals back in France. Marine Le Pen, leader of the far-right National Rally party, said: “I am outraged that France should back a minister of (President Paul) Kagame, who is violently anti-French and from a country that has . . . turned its back on the French language.” Please review our commenting policyCabinet ministers could quit over Theresa May\u0026#39s \u0026#39Brexit betrayal\u0026#39 as PM prepares \u0026#39to pay off DUP\u0026#39Princess Eugenie\u0026#39s royal wedding to Jack Brooksbank: Live updates from the Windsor Castle celebrationsRevealed: world’s largest animal drugs company sells antibiotics to Indian farms to fatten livestock despite superbug risk \u0026#39Shocked\u0026#39 buyer of shredded Banksy painting decides to keep \u0026#39piece of art history\u0026#39Ivy Cottage at Kensington Palace: Inside the royal home where Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank will live as a married coupleMeet the bridesmaids and pageboys in Princess Eugenie\u0026#39s royal wedding today - including Robbie Williams\u0026#39 daughter TheodoraMeet Jack Brooksbank, the wine merchant marrying Princess Eugenie todayRoyal wedding guest list: Who did Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank invite?Princess Eugenie\u0026#39s royal wedding procession route: Where to see the newlyweds todayHow to watch Princess Eugenie\u0026#39s royal wedding on TV todayUK weather: Storm Callum brings rain and 76mph winds to BritainDonald Trump implies Jamal Khashoggi is dead but says he will not cut arms sales to Saudi ArabiaKanye West\u0026#39s unfiltered political ramblings leave even Donald Trump lost for wordsMinisters must be \u0026#39honest\u0026#39 and admit they have quietly shifted burden of basic services onto publicStrictly judges say \u0026#39curse\u0026#39 is a blessing because it helps kill off doomed relationshipsRoyal Wedding: Princess Eugenie says the \u0026#39nerves are creeping up\u0026#39 ahead of marriage to Jack BrookshankCaesareans now used in one in four UK births, major new report revealsHurricane Michael causes \u0026#39unimaginable destruction\u0026#39 in FloridaTwo dead in motorway crash between lorry and minibusWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"kanye wests unfiltered political ramblings leave even donald","story":"It was a bravura performance by a supercharged ego, lecturing America as he banged his fist on the Resolute desk in the Oval Office.No, this wasn\u0027t Donald Trump venting about untrammeled immigration.

Once upon a time, this dramatic 1920s building was the printing works for the Daily Mirror, whose presses belted out millions of copies of the newspaper: at its peak, seven million Mirror copies a day were printed here.Now Herbal House – as its called today –\u0026nbspis the European headquarters of Photobox. It’s still in the print business, but it’s also a digital one which produced more than 22 million personalised books and gift cards for more than 10 million customers in 15 countries last year.Jody Ford, chief executive of Photobox, chose the building as the group’s new £20m HQ because he likes the link to the past but also because Clerkenwell is back buzzing as London’s most creative district.It certainly feels buzzy. The guts of the building have been ripped out to expose huge concrete and steel girders which give the place a raw industrial twist. Yet the atmosphere is warm and teeming with laid-back young techies dressed in jeans and sneakers who look to be more at play than work.Each of the four floors is colour-coded using the CMYK formula at the heart of all print shops. The ground floor is yellow for Moonpig, and one floor below is pink for Photobox. Downstairs in the bowels – where staff meet on Friday afternoons for “soapbox”\u0026nbspstyle chats with colleagues to bash around new ideas and for weekly yoga sessions – is blue.A View from the Top: Ashley Schofield, the new CEO of giffgaffUpstairs on the first floor the colour is black:\u0026nbspthat’s for management style group functions. It’s in one of the blue “breakout”\u0026nbsprooms that Ford meets me for our chat: he doesn’t have his own office as such. Nor do staff: it’s all open-plan. The 400 employees work in teams and “squads”,\u0026nbspin their coloured sections, and are encouraged to think out of the box: welcome to agile working. If all this sounds a little west coast-ish, that’s because much of Ford’s leadership thinking was formed in Silicon Valley. After studying for an MBA at Insead and a few years at McKinsey, Ford cut his teeth at eBay, the tough way. His first job was in eBay’s second-hand car market and then on helping to build eBay’s fashion business with brands like Karen Millen and Superdry.After six years, he was promoted to eBay’s HQ in San Jose, shooting up the ranks to become head of global growth marketing. Californian life was great for him and his young family, he says, but also for hanging out with the valley’s Yahoo to Google crowd.Then came the call. The private equity owners of Photobox wanted him to take over the hot seat with express orders to shake it up. The 18-year-old business, which had expanded rapidly into Europe by buying Moonpig and Hofmann, had been bought by Electra Partners and Exponent\u0026nbspfor around £400m, after plans to float were shelved.“It was an offer I couldn’t refuse. I am the guy who puts together the Photobox photos for the books. I’m the one who puts together the music for parties and makes the playlists.”He lets on that while at Exeter – where he studied economics and politics – \u0026nbsphe was a regular DJ on the university radio, Xpression FM. “I was an indie kid, played Blur, Oasis, Radiohead and dance music.” (He trained with Formula 1 commentator Ted Kravitz).“I still play dance music whenever I can with my kids: they think I’m a pretty cool dad. O god, I’ve said far too much,” he says, with a big laugh.His kids are right. The 43-year-old is cool, and as bright as a button too. Even so he will need some big tunes to meet his ambition to take Photobox from annual sales of £325m last year – and profits of £47m – to sales of £1bn over the next few years.So far, so good. Photobox is the biggest digital personalised printing business in Europe, and is growing internationally too.Demand for digital books created by Photobox, and products from its sister brands including Moonpig, the Spanish Hofmann business and Germany’s posterXXL, is booming despite the squeeze on consumer spending. And in ways that are difficult to predict.Chili plants and craft beers are still favourites to give as gifts for Father’s day. Specialist gins have become the must-have present for Mother’s Day celebrations – although tulips remain the favourite flowers to give.You can also now have your beloved’s face – or whatever – printed on just about everything, from playing cards to mugs to pillows or beach towels.Whatever next ? Well, if you want to know, Photobox reports a rise in cards for “palentines”\u0026nbspand “galentines”: shorthand for friends celebrating each other. Special cards for Nan, Grandma and Grandmother are growing like topsy as generations live longer. There is also a boom in cards for “pre-mother” women and from the “bump”\u0026nbspbeing sent by fathers or partners to expectant mothers. And cards for pets.At the same time, Photobox is launching its own curated products. One of these is a new Artist Collection, “gallery-quality”\u0026nbspart prints selected for you by interior stylist Pippa Jameson.That’s the front end of Ford’s business, the bit we see. The back end is less visible, much of it hidden in the cloud. There are now 7.8 billion photos uploaded onto the Photobox platform which is in the process of migrating a whopping 9 petabytes of data onto Amazon’s web services to keep it secure.A View from the Top with Eugen Miropolski, WeWork’s managing directorWhat it’s like to be the chief executive of two companies at onceA view from the top: Veeam boss Peter McKay on sales and cyclingParis is the hotbed of technical expertise where 60 specialist AI and machine-learning experts work on the photo management. As well as the London HQ, there are another 200 people based in Munich working on the German brands. Another 300 or so people are based across five manufacturing sites where the books and card gifts are made and posted out around the world. These are spread across the UK, Guernsey, Spain, France and Germany.A new tech hub for Moonpig is being set up in Manchester as we speak, and is about to start a big recruitment drive to hire the best engineering talent around.Nurturing talent is top of Ford’s agenda. One of his first moves was to bring in a new top team of managers, updating functions like human resources. Everybody has the chance to be coached, and it’s a move that has already paid off.Moonpig, which made some 65 million personalised cards last year,\u0026nbsphas seen internal targets soar by 300 per cent. Ford has also introduced a Be That Manager programme for all 150 managers.“It’s not a one-off development course. We want to create a culture of lifelong learning.”Finding the best talent is also the scary bit, he says. “I spend a lot of my time worrying about whether we have the best people we can find, the best engineers, the best innovators. And whether they will want to come here to work.”My hunch is they might rather enjoy\u0026nbspthemselves.A View from the TopShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

There is no introductory rate - 1.5 per cent rate applies at all times that the account is open, as long as the holder deposits at least £50 a month.However, the rate only applies to to the first £10,000, which is some way short of Goldman\u0027s account which pays 1.5 per cent up to £250,000.Another new account from RBS, the Premium Saver, pays 0.85 per cent and is designed for customers with a lump sum ready to invest.\u0026nbspAlan Hardie, head of products at RBS said, “Offering an account which encourages saving but also offers flexibility when people need access to their money, enables our customers to have more control over how they manage their money.”RBS still shooting itself in the foot ten years on from its £45bn baiRBS boss Ross McEwan warns no-deal Brexit could push UK into recessionRBS and Natwest online and mobile banking services restored, bank saysRBS boss \u0027withheld information about criminal investigation from MPs\u0027RBS to close 54 more branches and cut hundreds of jobsRBS is the first UK bank to announce new accounts since Goldman entered the UK market.

By Patrick KingsleyClick to followThe IndependentAt the Morecambe Bay Foodbank, the number of children receiving at least one parcel of free food has almost doubled in the last yearIt’s half past eight, and the school day is just starting at Morecambe Bay Primary, a state-run\u0026nbspschool in northwest England. Siobhan Collingwood, the headteacher, points\u0026nbspto a cheerful boy munching his way through two slices of toast – his first meal of the day.Teachers, she says, sometimes find him sifting through trash cans for discarded fruit. “He’d eat his way through whatever we put in front of him.”Some students trickle\u0026nbspthrough without stopping they’ve\u0026nbspalready eaten. But a few dozen head\u0026nbspstraight to the food counter. Of 350 students, roughly one in three would not have breakfast unless the school provided it, Collingwood reckons.Brexit wasn’t caused by austerity, and here’s the proofDuring Collingwood’s 13 years as headteacher at Morecambe Bay Primary, there have\u0026nbspalways been a few hungry children. But two years ago, the staff noticed an increasing number of youngsters returning undernourished after spending school breaks at home.Initially, Collingwood and her staff were puzzled.\u0026nbspMany parents held jobs, even if they struggled to cover the bills. Then it dawned on them that the rising number of hungry children at Morecambe Bay coincided with sharp reductions in welfare benefits associated with the clumsy introduction of a new welfare programme.“As we spoke to parents,” Collingwood says, “it became clear that for many of them, it was caused by changes to the benefit system rolled out in recent years, which were forcing families into crisis.”Across Britain, the number of children living in poverty has jumped sharply in the past six years, a trend that critics blame in part on the\u0026nbspgovernment’s policy of austerity, the budget-slashing response to the 2008 financial crisis\u0026nbspsteadily reshaping British life.And there is no immediate relief on the horizon. The County Councils Network, a group of local governing bodies, warned recently of £1bn\u0026nbspin budget cuts nationwide next year, draining more money from social services, including some for children.To be clear, Britain is not Venezuela. Reports of hungry children showing up in Morecambe doctors’ offices with rickets have proved false. But that is cold comfort in one of the wealthiest countries in the world, one that over the years has made a strong commitment to child welfare.While hunger is not the only social pathology associated with childhood poverty, it is perhaps the hardest to conceal. In that respect, it is a flashing signal of a deepening problem.For children, the consequences of poverty can be severe. In the short term, poverty elevates the risk of illness, hunger and social stigma. In the long term, it can create a vicious cycle from which a child struggles to escape, especially in class-conscious Britain.British teenagers from disadvantaged backgrounds are roughly a third as likely to achieve good GCSE\u0026nbspgrades, according to government statistics.They are then roughly half as likely to go to university, according to a separate set of government data. Those who do make it are less likely to get a better paid job within six months of graduation than those from more privileged backgrounds. And they are less likely to make it into high status professions, such as finance, law or medicine.Even those who do crack the “class ceiling” earn an average of 16 per cent less than more privileged peers, researchers at the London School of Economics found.The government likes to focus attention on workless families, but there’s hardly any left. That’s a problem of the pastAnd those from poorer backgrounds are likely to die around five years earlier than those who are not, government data suggests.Before the financial crisis in 2008 and the subsequent budget squeeze, successive British governments, both Conservative and Labour, achieved progress on childhood poverty. The number of minors living in “relative poverty” – families with an annual household income less than 60 per cent of the national median, after housing costs – fell by roughly 800,000\u0026nbspto 3.5 million\u0026nbspbetween 1998 and 2012, or 27 per cent of all Britons aged 16 or younger.But the same year that parliament passed the Welfare Reform Act, a central plank of the austerity programme, the trend began to reverse.\u0026nbspSince 2012, about 600,000 children have fallen back into “relative poverty”. During the same period, the number of children requiring food handouts from the Trussell Trust, the country’s largest network of food banks, more than tripled, to over 484,000 from nearly 127,000.Overall, since returning to power in 2010, the Conservatives have announced more than £30bn\u0026nbspin benefit cuts and abandoned prior targets to substantially reduce child poverty by 2020.By 2021, roughly 35 per cent of all minors in Britain are predicted to be poor, according to forecasts by the Institute for Fiscal Studies. And the country’s pending departure from the European Union may deepen the problem, because of rising living costs and the sudden loss of funding from Brussels for young people, according to a joint assessment by seven leading children’s charities.In November, the United Nations special rapporteur on extreme poverty\u0026nbspPhilip Alston will make an official visit to Britain to research the connection between the austerity programme and the rise in poverty – the first such visit to Britain by a United Nations special rapporteur on extreme poverty.“It’s increasingly evident, particularly to people working with children, that we’re in a child poverty crisis,” says Alison Garnham, chief executive of the Child Poverty Action Group, a British charity. “And it is primarily to do with the massive cuts to benefits.”The Conservative Party leaders who pushed through the austerity programme\u0026nbspdispute that it is the cause of rising child poverty, or that child poverty is increasing. They argue that universal credit – the\u0026nbspnew system that bundles most payments into one –\u0026nbspis an improvement.The new system is “infinitely better than what it replaced”, says Iain Duncan Smith, the Conservative former cabinet minister who oversaw the changes. “The process of stepping into work is easier.”That rationale is being questioned. Though unemployment has been more than halved under the Conservatives, the overall child poverty rate has risen. And roughly two-thirds of poor children have at least one parent who works, the Institute for Fiscal Studies says.“We tell ourselves completely the wrong story about poverty in the UK,” Garnham says. “The government likes to focus attention on workless families, but there’s hardly any left. That’s a problem of the past.”Created with Sketch.Greeks slide deeper into poverty Show all 12Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Retired teacher and volunteer Eva Agkisalaki clears tables at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church in AthensPeople eat at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church in AthensThe monthly food supplies that were given out in February by an Athens Municipality-run centre are pictured in AthensAn elderly man sells chestnuts in front of the parliament during a demonstration to demand tax reductions and compensation in AthensPeople make their way outside the main fish market of AthensA butcher waits for clients inside the main meat market of AthensAn elderly woman searches through donated clothes at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox churchChildren\u0027s clothes to be donated to impoverished Greeks are arranged in a stock room at an Athens Municipality-run centre A man waits to have his clothes washed by the Ithaca mobile laundry service for the homeless in central Athens, GreecePeople line up to apply for a social benefit from the Directorate of Social Welfare and Health of the Municipality of AthensFood is laid out on a table at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church Poverty stricken area of Perama Retired teacher and volunteer Eva Agkisalaki clears tables at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church in AthensPeople eat at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church in AthensThe monthly food supplies that were given out in February by an Athens Municipality-run centre are pictured in AthensAn elderly man sells chestnuts in front of the parliament during a demonstration to demand tax reductions and compensation in AthensPeople make their way outside the main fish market of AthensA butcher waits for clients inside the main meat market of AthensAn elderly woman searches through donated clothes at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox churchChildren\u0027s clothes to be donated to impoverished Greeks are arranged in a stock room at an Athens Municipality-run centre A man waits to have his clothes washed by the Ithaca mobile laundry service for the homeless in central Athens, GreecePeople line up to apply for a social benefit from the Directorate of Social Welfare and Health of the Municipality of AthensFood is laid out on a table at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church Poverty stricken area of Perama Working, but poorJust outside Morecambe, a tourist town that no longer draws so many tourists, George McCullough, a single parent to a six-year-old son, is\u0026nbspin financial meltdown. His rent has\u0026nbspfallen into arrears, and he can\u0026nbspno longer pay the family’s utility bills. He’s started\u0026nbspto dip into his overdraft, incurring further bank charges.He’s\u0026nbspstopped socialising and sometimes skips\u0026nbspmeals to ensure that his son eats\u0026nbspthree times a day. But he can\u0026nbspno longer afford to give the boy a balanced diet or a new school uniform, or take him to see friends.“He basically can’t go to any of his mates’ parties or houses,” McCullough says. “I literally can’t afford to pay for a gift, or even to take him there.”What\u0026nbspthrew\u0026nbsphis affairs into crisis was the transition to universal credit. Before the welfare changes, McCullough received around £685\u0026nbspevery month to supplement the roughly £500\u0026nbspa month he earns as a bus driver for disabled children.It’s\u0026nbspnot just that he now receives\u0026nbsproughly £40\u0026nbspless a month, though for a family that was already struggling to stay above the poverty line, the cut – the cost of a week’s groceries – was painful. (Others have experienced worse: the average working family has lost more than £75\u0026nbspa month, according to calculations by the Child Poverty Action Group.)What has really hurt McCullough\u0026nbspis\u0026nbsphow that loss is\u0026nbspcompounded, severely, by the problematic rollout of universal credit in 2016.Under the new system, all claimants have to wait at least five weeks for their first payment –\u0026nbspa dangerously long delay for families living hand-to-mouth. In McCullough’s case, the delay was long enough to throw him into a vicious cycle of debt.By this May, the family had almost climbed from the hole when they were hit by a second quirk of the universal credit system. After his employers paid him early, giving him two payments in one month, officials wrongly concluded that his salary had doubled and cut his benefits. For several weeks, they refused to admit their mistake, plunging him back into debt.In Morecambe, the problem is compounded by cuts to local children’s services. Before austerity, schools could quickly refer vulnerable families to a local state-funded children’s centre“If this is going to be a regular occurrence,” McCullough asked, “where is the incentive to work?”McCullough’s experiences are not unique. The government’s own research into the system found that nearly half of claimants needed help to fill out the application form, while four in 10 were still facing financial difficulties eight months into their time on universal credit.Duncan Smith, who was the secretary of state for work and pensions between 2010 and 2015, acknowledges\u0026nbspproblems with the way the system has been put into effect.\u0026nbspHe even resigned in 2015 because the finance minister at the time, George Osborne, cut an additional £4bn\u0026nbspfrom the welfare budget. “I thought that was too much,” Duncan Smith says.But “the system itself is the right system,” he adds. “Though a large number of working families are still in poverty, they were in deeper poverty when they were out of work. As they move into work, they’re better off.”Back at McCullough’s, the father’s eyes well\u0026nbspup as his phone buzzes\u0026nbspwith debt notices from the local water board, and he describes\u0026nbsphow he struggles\u0026nbspto provide his son with some of the basic things in life – like fresh vegetables, new clothes and haircuts.McCullough voted Conservative in past elections and says he would do so again if an election were held tomorrow. Despite his travails, he supports the party’s cautious approach to state spending, and he thinks there are too many people expecting handouts for nothing.But he no longer believes that restructuring benefits will get more people into work, or more children out of poverty.“Until you walk a mile in someone’s shoes, you can’t know,” McCullough says. “Until you’ve seen how it works, you don’t understand.”In Morecambe, the area’s Conservative MP\u0026nbspDavid Morris\u0026nbspsays in an email that child poverty had fallen in his constituency, and blames\u0026nbsp“left-wing political activists” for any suggestion to the contrary. In previous interviews, he has accused headteacher Collingwood of having political motivations for speaking out.But the demand for free breakfasts at Morecambe Bay Primary is not the only warning sign.The relative child poverty rate in Morris’s constituency rose to 25.9 per cent from 2013 to 2017, up from 24.2 per cent, according to research by the Centre\u0026nbspfor Research in Social Policy at Loughborough University. That may not sound like much, but the rise has produced marked changes on the ground.How social supermarkets are filling a gap in austerity BritainAt the Morecambe Bay Foodbank, for instance, the number of children who received at least one parcel of free food has almost doubled to 1,229 in 2017-18, from 656 in 2013-14. At the local branch of Citizens Advice the number of food vouchers distributed to children in the same period increased sixfold, to 1,336 from 222.In Morecambe, the problem is compounded by cuts to local children’s services. Before austerity, schools could quickly refer vulnerable families to a local state-funded children’s centre, where social workers would work with children and parents to solve their problems.Since 2010, however, roughly 1,000 of these centres have been closed across Britain after about £990m\u0026nbspin funding cuts. Those that remain – such as those in the Morecambe area – have substantially reduced their capacity.“The caseload is growing, and the system\u0026nbspby which we would have supported them is diminishing,” Collingwood says. “We feel much more like an island.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

He’s also a tennis coach.Dacre wasn’t always interested in following in his ancestor’s footsteps – his first love was sports (PA)But at some point, Dacre – who’s now 60 and lives in South Carolina – became fascinated with the brother of his great-grandfather George Stoker, so much so that he’s just co-authored his second book adding to Bram’s canon, a prequel to the most famous book about vampirism ever.But Dracul, published this month by Bantam Press, is not just about the early life of Count Dracula himself. It ties Bram Stoker inextricably into the Dracula legend and posits the fascinating question… what if Bram was producing not just a mere entertainment, but writing from experience?Cowriting with horror author JD Barker, Dacre presents Dracul partly in epistolary form, as the original book is laid out, intermingling the story of a terrified 21-year-old Bram locking himself away from a nightmare that haunts him, his only defences a gun, holy water and a crucifix, with fictionalised entries from Bram’s journal.The journal tells the story of Bram as a sickly child in Dublin, who is put in the care of a sinister nanny and ultimately crosses paths with the children of the night, experiences which would later inform his 1897 novel that has, in real life, become one of the most enduring stories of the past century.It’s great fun, told with aplomb by the two authors, and is weighted with an often uneasy sense of credibility, despite the subject matter, which is all thanks to Dacre’s direct connection to Bram, and the meticulous research he’s carried out into his ancestor’s writings.“Bram became quite a sportsman later in life,” says Dacre. “He was a very sickly child. Imagine if this transformation was due to an infusion of vampire’s blood…”Dacre is currently on a tour of the US promoting Dracul, and when we speak he is in New Orleans, itself considered the haunt of vampires and the quiet undead. It is very early in the day for him, before 7am, but he assures me he is an early riser. Across the road from his hotel is, he tells me, the Lafayette Cemetery, lair of the Mayfair vampires and deadly Lestat in Anne Rice’s celebrated novels. Dacre has become quite the expert on the undead. So how did the sports-mad teen gravitate towards less earthly pursuits?“I think it was when I read In Search of Dracula, a book by two Boston scholars, that I first really felt a connection to Bram and the story of Dracula,” he says. The book, by Radu Florescu and Raymond McNally, was published in 1972 and first made the connections between the fictional Count Dracula and the very real and bloody historical figure of Vlad Tepes of Wallachia.His interest piqued, Dacre began to speak to his cousins and other surviving relatives. “There aren’t many of us,” he says. “Although Bram was one of seven children, not many of them had families of their own.” He pauses. “Fortunately, George, my great-grandfather, did.”In 2003, Dacre was contacted by a screenwriter called Ian Holt, who had been trying to get a film made of a direct sequel to Dracula, but without much success. The pair teamed up and wrote the story as a novel, Dracula the Un-Dead, set 25 years after the original novel. As well as having the sway of an actual Stoker family member involved, the book served to help bring Dracula back into Stoker hands since the 1890 novel the character had become a bit of a pop-cultural free-for-all, and prompted the family to set up the Bram Stoker Estate, which Dacre manages.But the story took an unexpected turn in 2011 when Noel Dobbs, Bram’s great-grandson, discovered hidden away in his home on the Isle of Wight a previously unseen journal kept by the great writer.“That was a pivotal moment for me,” says Dacre. “With Dr Elizabeth Miller I set about deciphering the handwritten entries and from that journal I got to know Bram a lot more intimately. That was probably the most significant point in my relationship with Bram.”Dacre and Dr Miller published the contents of the journal in 2012, and as well as offering an insight into the life and thoughts of the author, it also set Dacre on another journey that would lead to the writing of the new book, Dracul.The journal alerted Dacre to the existence of a preface written by Bram to the original edition of Dracula that was never used by his publishers… and one which suggested that the author might have actually believed in vampires.Dacre – becoming, as he says, a “forensic literary detective” – tracked down the original preface to an Icelandic translation of Dracula and eventually finding a copy of that, something became startlingly apparent. “I believe that Bram realised that many people in history truly believed that vampires were real,” he says. “After Dracula was published, he gave just one interview and in that he said his book ‘touches on mystery and fact’.“We know now that long ago people might not have understood things like the plague or communicable diseases, and these unexplained things might have seemed supernatural to them. I believe Bram was very open-minded, and believed that just because we can’t observe something, it doesn’t mean that it can’t exist.”Dacre quotes from the original Dracula to me, from the scene when Van Helsing is trying to convince Dr Seward that there are things out there beyond human ken. “There are mysteries which men can only guess at, which age by age they may solve only in part. Believe me, we are now on the verge of one.”Dacre cowrote ‘Dracul’ with horror author JD Barker (Penguin)From all this, Dacre extrapolated the plot of Dracul, of a young Bram coming into contact with vampirism, and writing Dracula as a result. “Not as a piece of fiction,” says Dacre, “but as a warning to the world.”When the idea was germinating, Dacre met JD Barker, whose debut novel Forsaken was nominated for the Bram Stoker Award for horror fiction. They agreed to collaborate on the idea, with Dacre taking Barker up to his cabin in North Carolina to thrash out the plot. The wisdom of accepting an offer from Bram Stoker’s blood relative to spend time alone in a remote cabin briefly flits across my mind as something to be embarked upon with care, but I don’t voice it, instead asking Dacre what Bram would think of the result.“I really do think he would approve,” he says. “I wanted to show the character of Bram evolve into a hero. He never really liked talking about himself and I think he would like the idea of a relative of his telling the story of his humble beginnings.”As well as managing the Stoker Estate and writing his own books based on Bram’s work, Dacre spends a lot of time attending scholarly conferences and is a regular attendee at the goth weekend in Whitby, where Bram holidayed in 1890 and first got the idea for Dracula. In the book, it is where the vampiric count makes landfall on the ill-fated ship the Demeter. The image of the Demeter crashing into the beach after Dracula has helped himself to most of the crew was based on a true story Bram was told by the fishermen on the harbour, about the Dmitry which beached at Whitby in 1885.Bran Castle: Dracula\u0027s home to be rented out over HalloweenRadu Florescu: Historian who was the first to make the link betweenSherlock\u0027s Mark Gatiss and Steven Moffat announce new projectIf Bram Stoker kept an open mind about the real existence of vampires, what about his great grandnephew? “I keep an open mind about a lot of things, too,” he says. What would he do if he met an actual vampire?“I did!” he declares. “Last night! And not just one. There are now people who practise what they call ‘safe vampirism’. They share blood. I was invited to go along to one of their private clubs last night…”Quite what Bram Stoker would have made of that, we can only guess. But my interview with Dacre is at an end. The sun is just beginning to rise, and I wouldn’t want to keep him any longer.

Today, little has changed on the islandsClick to followThe IndependentIn the 1950s, transportation on the islands was by a pony-drawn cart and even today there are few carsThe last time I saw Bridin Concannon, she was walking towards me along the narrow road on the westernmost edge of the island of Inishmaan, off the west coast of Ireland.“Were you out at Synge’s Chair?” I called out as she approached.The sun behind her hung, unmasked by clouds, low and long in the Irish early summer sky.“I was,” she said. Her voice was strong, clear – the way one’s voice can be when exhilarated. “I’ll start writing a play soon.”Trump cancels trip to Ireland after massive protests plannedWe both laughed loudly, and strode past one another. She was headed back towards the village and I towards the cliffs over the North Atlantic, to a perch of limestone that the author frequented during his time here, a spot known locally as Synge’s Chair.The Irish playwright JM\u0026nbspSynge (1871-1909) first came to the Aran Islands in the summer of 1898 looking for inspiration and to learn the Irish language. Over the next several years he would return again and again, growing more connected to the people and the wind-and-sea-battered land they inhabited.Synge’s most famous work\u0026nbspPlayboy of the Western World\u0026nbspwas inspired by a story he heard while on the islands, and caused riots in Dublin when it was first staged in 1906. The foremost playwright of the Irish Renaissance – a movement inspired by strong political nationalism and a revival of Celtic traditions – Synge was co-founder of The Abbey Theatre, also known as the National Theatre of Ireland. All six of his plays are either set in or heavily influenced by his time in Aran.The three remote Aran Islands of Inishmore, Inishmaan and Inisheer hide in plain sight in the mouth of Galway Bay. They are still predominantly Irish-speaking, insular and, as even in Synge’s era, considered a place lost in time.It was the poet William Butler Yeats who suggested that Synge come to these islands. “Go to Aran,” Yeats told his friend. “Live there as if you were one of the people themselves express a life that has never found expression.”Synge grew more attached to the islands over time, and I had a notion that repeat trips might similarly enhance my appreciation of Aran’s more subtle charms. I decided to visit the islands over a period of several months, from early spring to high summer. I hoped that my repeated act of return and departure would elicit in me the sense of investment, as well as illuminate details and patterns of day-to-day local life that are the deep appeal of such places as Aran, places not needy of a traveller’s attention.Synge took a steamer from Galway that sailed at the mercy of the tides, on the rolling sea, and transferred into a currach, a small canvas-covered fishing boat, to make it to shore. These days things are slightly easier, with a daily ferry schedule as well as light aircraft service.My initial impression of the largest island of Inishmore from the ferry was not dissimilar to Synge’s:.\u0026nbsp“A dreary rock appeared at first sloping up from the sea and into the fog,” the author wrote in The Aran Islands –\u0026nbsphis classic account of his time here, first published in 1907. “The place looked hardly fit for habitation. There was no green to be seen, and no sign of the people.”Part of the considerable allure of Aran lies in what it lacks. There are no cinemas and few cars electricity only arrived in the 1970s. Seventeen-year-old Thomas Kennedy summed it up for me within minutes of my arrival when he said:\u0026nbsp“There’s no facilities here – you rely on the people.” And while much has remained unchanged since Synge’s time, society has reached the islands. Synge wasn’t confronted with the dozen or so glamping structures visible on arrival, for one. And the pierside Atlantic Hotel, where Synge resided while on Inishmore, has been transformed into the Aran Sweater Market.But beside the shop, three pubs, one food shop, a restaurant and a handful of bed and breakfasts, there is little else in the way of commerce. The 12 square mile island is home to roughly 760 people, most clustered around the main settlement of Kilronan, with the vast majority of terrain given over to small parcels of grazing and farmland, delineated by Aran’s most dominant feature, its dry-stone walls.“You have to be OK within yourself to live here,” Melissa Gillian told me as I stood eavesdropping on a wedding reception outside the Aran Island Hotel. A Maine native, she married a local man and has lived on Inishmore for 10 years. Gillian was one of only a handful of outsiders I met over the months – all are married to locals her sentiment was one I heard often, on all three islands.Most visitors stay only a few hours, travel a well-worn circuit and hustle back onto the boats for the comparative metropolis of Galway or the pubs of Doolin. But it is during the early morning hours, and again later in the afternoon once the last ferry of the day has gone, that the island’s deeper appeal emerges.If you’ve seen one image of the Aran Islands, it is likely to be an aerial shot of Inishmore’s Dun Aengus, semicircular stone walls that abut a 300-foot sheer cliff above the Atlantic. The initial walls of this ring fort – one of seven to be found on the islands – date back to 1100BC, and it is next to impossible not to gravitate to the site while on Inishmore. A visit at daybreak was rewarded by absolute solitude, as the wind whistled over the stones. Birds caught thermals below the cliffs. Clouds raced across the sun. Time stretched.As I was leaving, the buses began to arrive. I sat on a wall eating a Nutella crêpe\u0026nbspand watched coach after coach deposit people with fanny packs and (unneeded) sun hats. Though watching the human drama of group tourism from a slight remove has its own rewards, I had a date with a magic well.Early on during Synge’s first visit to Inishmore, he met a man who told him a story. A Sligo woman, it seems, had a dream that her blind son might be made to see if she travelled to a particular well out on the Aran Islands. She did so, and upon touching the well’s water to her sightless child’s eye, he exclaimed, “O mother, look at the pretty flowers!” Synge would use this story and his visit to the site as the inspiration for his play\u0026nbspThe Well of the Saints.My local map indicated the well as a tiny dot not far off the road, yet I’d cycled past it twice without luck. Finally I caught sight of an old sign that directed me over one stone fence and then another, through several fields, until I came upon the ruin of a tiny building:\u0026nbspThe Church of the Four Beautiful Persons\u0026nbsp(no one I met on the island could explain the origins of the name). I stepped over cow pats and entered. The sun emerged and the grey stones brightened. At that moment, a cow poked her head inside to see who was on her turf.Created with Sketch.Pope Francis visits Ireland – in pictures Show all 55Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Pope Francis celebrates the Holy Mass at the Phoenix Park, in Dublin Pope Francis arrives at Phoenix Park for a Papal Mass of the World Meeting of Families in DublinA vigil takes place at the site of the mass grave which contained the remains of 796 named babies from the Bon Secours Mother and Baby home in Tuam.

A tin cup had been left beside it, and someone had tossed in a small crucifix. A small pile of stones, similar to the ones that covered the well’s floor, sat next to it, apparently meant to be thrown in the well. As a long-ago lapsed Catholic, this ritual seemed to me somehow more pagan than Christian. I tossed a few in, thinking of my children.Back in town, the crowds were converging for the afternoon ferry to the mainland. On impulse, I grabbed my bag, deciding again to follow Synge’s lead – this time to another of the islands.After only a brief stay on Inishmore, the playwright headed for Inishmaan, of which he noted:\u0026nbsp“Gaelic is more generally used, and the life is perhaps the most primitive that is left in Europe.”I wondered how much things had changed, and as I headed to the ferry for the short crossing to the middle island, Loraine Conneely, an Inishmore native, read my mind. “You’ll see,” she said. “It’s still the same over there. It hasn’t moved.”If the traveller is greeted with a (relatively) bustling arrival on the big island, no such welcome – in fact, no welcome at all – awaits the visitor in Inishmaan, which is less than four square miles. The ferry dock is a half-hour walk to what passes for a village (there is one shop and one bar). Life, as it did in Synge’s time, revolves around the caprices of weather and the ties of community.Little energy is spent looking outward – exactly how the 160 inhabitants prefer things.Over my months of coming and going, I encountered many of the same people again and again on Inishmaan: Ciaran O’Ceallaigh, who was raising his son on the island because he wanted him “to grow up in a true Irish-speaking environment” Bartley Conneely, who owned 21 acres and six cows, and could easily be persuaded to give a visitor a lift to the ferry and the pair of ladies I often saw when out walking, who cautioned me against staying too late up at the ring fort of Dun Fearbhai, lest the fairies interfere with me.Synge noted many stories of strange happenings on the island. “These people make no distinction between the natural and the supernatural,” he wrote. But he also eloquently described a people living a hard-scrabble life very close to the elements: “Of beings who feel their isolation in the face of a universe that wars on them with winds and sea.” Synge encountered people who carried themselves with workaday dignity and offered a humble, sincere welcome – exactly what I found on Inishmaan 120 years later.“We’re ambivalent about tourists on this island,” the restaurateur Ruairi de Blacam told me. “You’re left to go about your business. Get a map – you’ve got shoes – and off you go.” De Blacam is a local boy who made (extremely) good. In 2007 he and his wife, Marie-Therese, opened Inis Meáin, the singular high-end restaurant and inn on the islands.“It’s unlikely, if not impossible, we could have done this if I wasn’t from the island,” he said as I sipped some of his delicious lobster bisque and watched a setting fireball sun slash light across the limestone just outside the restaurant’s picture window. “You need the people’s support.”He continued: “We’re on a precarious perch out here in the ocean. People lean on each other in all sorts of ways. When I was a kid, I went around with a candle and people still dressed in traditional clothes. Ireland was 20, 30 years behind the rest of the world, and Aran was 20, 30 years behind Ireland.”The sun dropped, as Synge wrote of a similar sunset a century earlier, “like a lozenge of gold flame into the sea” and the ocean was cast in a purple hue.“But things are moving fast we’re catching up a bit,” de Blacam smiled and placed a dish of scallop ceviche with toasted almonds in front of me.“What you have to understand is that the people here live a very simple life. And we’re here by choice. There’s an understated pride, and the legacy of Synge is certainly a part of that.”Very much so: The cottage to which the playwright returned each year – a small, whitewashed, thatch-roof affair – has been preserved as a museum of sorts. Though it’s technically open to the public, hours vary, and it took some doing, to track down Ciaran O’Faherty, whose great-grandparents had offered Synge a bedroom in what was then their home. Once I finally cornered him in the pub, O’Faherty was happy to oblige me with a look. On this island that insists on existing out of time, the cottage’s green front door was a portal through the century things inside remain as Synge had described: “My room is at one end of the cottage … There is a kitchen with earth floor and open rafters … It is full of beauty and distinction.”As much as Synge relished his island home, he spent most of his days out walking the land. Over on the far western side, atop high cliffs, he found a stand of rock looking out over Galway Bay and Inishmore that he would return to again and again. “As I lay here hour after hour, I seem to enter into the wild pastimes of the cliff,” he wrote.This was when I found myself headed out to Synge’s Chair. The semicircle cluster of limestone created a natural barrier against the elements, cradled the visitor and invited lingering. Each of my visits was similar time slipped the way time can when there is nowhere to go: at first excruciatingly slowly, then in a blink, the day would be gone.With just the one pub for action, nights on Inishmaan are quiet and even a loner can yearn for society. As Synge did, I made the short crossing to the smallest island of Inisheer (on two occasions I was the only ferry passenger from Inishmaan). Upon coming ashore, Synge was confronted with a man –\u0026nbsp“a drunkard and shebeener” – who lived “with the restlessness of a man who has no sympathy with his companions.” Upon my arrival I was met with an only slightly less distressing social challenge.As on Inishmore, the day tourist trade had taken hold. There were horse and trap rides, coffee carts and stands selling local fudge. But just beyond the flurry of town, Inisheer, with its 250 residents, is perhaps the most physically picturesque of the three Aran Islands, and its three square miles make it easy to navigate on bicycle. (Bikes were readily available directly off the ferry on both Inishmore and Inisheer. Not surprisingly, there was no bike rental on Inishmaan.)Atop the island’s highest hill, beside the ruin of O’Brien’s Castle, Aine O’Graiofa had put a few tables out in front of her home and called it a restaurant. I took a seat in the driveway and settled in for one of Ireland’s staple country lunches – ham and cheese on toasted white bread – while looking down across Galway Bay to Connemara in the distance.Inisheer boasts three pubs, one shop and a church.“The priest died four years ago and they haven’t sent another,” O’Graiofa told me. “We’re left to our own devices.”We chatted of the decline in the church’s dominance over the people throughout Ireland.“Sure it’s their own fault,” she said. “We have the old schoolteacher who goes up and leads folks in the rosary that’s all we need.”Watching a ferry cross the bay down below, I asked if it was heading for Inishmaan.Businesses call for gay marriage to be legalised in Northern IrelandHIV rates rise in Northern Ireland – despite falling across rest of UKThe motley crew lining up to contest the Irish presidential election“I doubt it. You go over there and you don’t see a soul they’re all hiding behind the stones.”We laughed, but soon enough I made my way down to the dock.Back on Inishmaan I walked past the old graveyard from which Synge took inspiration for his play Riders to the Sea, and continued up the hill, across from Synge’s cottage and up over five stone fences and through five small fields to the ring fort of Dun Chonchuir. Synge would “often stroll up there after a dinner of eggs or salt pork, to smoke drowsily on the stones.”Like Synge, I had sat on these walls and viewed the sea in nearly every direction, but on this evening, a fog rolled in. The air became moist. Summer changed to autumn in a matter of minutes. I could barely make out the far end of the small fort enclosure. With no wind, a heavy silence hung in the mist. The century that separated me from Synge seemed suddenly trivial, and a world beyond these dry stone walls didn’t matter at all.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

There is no introductory rate - 1.5 per cent rate applies at all times that the account is open, as long as the holder deposits at least £50 a month.However, the rate only applies to to the first £10,000, which is some way short of Goldman\u0027s account which pays 1.5 per cent up to £250,000.Another new account from RBS, the Premium Saver, pays 0.85 per cent and is designed for customers with a lump sum ready to invest.\u0026nbspAlan Hardie, head of products at RBS said, “Offering an account which encourages saving but also offers flexibility when people need access to their money, enables our customers to have more control over how they manage their money.”RBS still shooting itself in the foot ten years on from its £45bn baiRBS boss Ross McEwan warns no-deal Brexit could push UK into recessionRBS and Natwest online and mobile banking services restored, bank saysRBS boss \u0027withheld information about criminal investigation from MPs\u0027RBS to close 54 more branches and cut hundreds of jobsRBS is the first UK bank to announce new accounts since Goldman entered the UK market.

their positions handed to European partnersClick to followThe IndependentProfessor Peter Coveney is concerned about the fate of medical research in the country following BrexitA top British scientist has called the government “totally chaotic” as he stands to lose\u0026nbsphis leadership of major European projects after Brexit.\u0026nbspProfessor Peter Coveney heads up three EU projects with a total value of around £15m, and he says work like his will be compromised if a deal is not agreed before March.His research, which aims to create a “forecasting system” that predicts disease, involves scientists working across Europe but is led from University College London.A no-deal Brexit would be a disaster for the UK science communityWhile the government said\u0026nbspit will fund British scientists participating in European projects if they lose out on money post-Brexit, it has not promised to support entire projects with UK scientists at the helm.The EU currently hands British project leaders millions of euros to distribute among their partners, but it will not do this if the UK is relegated to a so-called “third country” after Brexit.“The big thing that is unclear is that there is no agreement from the government here to continue to support projects that are led by the UK,” said Professor Coveney.“So leadership of projects – big ones that are influential – is thrown completely into disarray.”Created with Sketch.People\u0027s Vote march – demanding vote on final Brexit deal Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A young protestor

participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchDescribed by Professor Coveney as the “medical equivalent of weather forecasting”, his work uses supercomputers to simulate human bodies and plan people’s medical treatments and surgeries in advance.Due to limited British capacity to undertake such projects, he said this kind of research is totally dependent on European collaboration.His criticism comes after Royal Society president Venki Ramakrishnan\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspTV particle physicist Professor Brian Cox voiced their concerns about the impact of Brexit – particularly a no-deal outcome – on British science.Many leading scientists, including two Nobel prize winners, have backed The Independent‘s campaign for a Final Say on the Brexit vote.Leading scientists back call for Brexit deal voteThe UK is currently positioned as a European leader, home to many of the EU’s most prestigious research institutions and receiving 15 per cent of the funding from the flagship European funding programme Horizon 2020.However, this status will be threatened if the nation’s top scientists are forced to hand over the reins of their research to partners.Such an outcome now seems likely, as the government expects the UK to become a third country without a deal, and the prospect of a no-deal Brexit now looks more plausible than ever before.He wants reassurances that his projects and the livelihoods of lab members who are paid with this funding are not jeopardised.Professor Coveney contacted Mr Gyimah to voice his concerns, and received an assurance that the government was “seeking discussion” with the European Commission concerning a no-deal scenario.“This would need to include projects where the UK participant is responsible for coordinating funding,” Mr Gyimah wrote.Scientists fear loss of half a billion pounds of funding after no-dealDismissing this response as “merely regurgitating” information from the government’s official no-deal planning documents “that was unhelpful in the first place”, Professor Coveney said he needs the government to guarantee it will replace any lost funding in its entirety. He has laid out his case in a blog post for the campaign group Scientists for EU.“The picture is as follows: if you were to be a third country following midnight on 29\u0026nbspMarch and you wanted to continue to run these big projects, it would be incumbent on you to fund the entire thing,” he said.This would mean committing to funding not only the British scientist in charge of the project, but also the international team working with them.Despite the expense, he said this was a price worth paying to maintain UK leadership in science and protect the health of its citizens by funding medical research.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

And in the very last days of his life he may have made important work towards solving it once and for all.That question revolves around the way that black holes are thought to swallow up and destroy anything that falls into them. If they do entirely destroy them, they would take the information about them behind – but it is thought to be impossible for that information to simply disappear, leading to the paradox.Created with Sketch.The most incredible space images of Earth Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Explore ESA astronaut Tim Peake\u0027s stunning photos of Earth, taken from the International Space Station during his six month mission (captions by Tom Peake)Every day spent living in space is a great day, but today was particularly special.

No prizes for guessing where this is…From one mighty ocean to another – ships passing through the Panama canalBecause Professor Hawking suggested that black holes have a temperature and so would eventually cool down and evaporate, disappearing entirely from existence. With that, they appear to take the information with them, but it cannot simply be lost without breaking the laws of quantum mechanics.But the new paper suggests that can be explained by the phenomenon of soft hair. That is a sort of glossy edge\u0026nbspthat sits at the edge of the black hole and allows for scientists to overcome the paradox.Hawking memorial sees professor\u0027s voice shot into a black holeNow the researchers who worked with Professor Hawking on the paper in his final days will have to explore more of how exactly that works without him. They hope to find out how exactly the soft hair works, and what happens to it when the black hole comes to an end.The study itself – which is attributed to\u0026nbspSasha Haco, Stephen W. Hawking, Malcolm J. Perry and\u0026nbspAndrew Strominger –\u0026nbspdescribes that process in far more technical detail. The summary concludes with a sentence that reads: Assuming the existence of a quantum Hilbert space on which these charges generate the symmetries, as well as the applicability of the Cardy formula, the central charges reproduce the macroscopic area-entropy law for generic Kerr black holes.But at its most simple level it could be part of a solution to a problem that has occupied many of the greatest minds in the world for decades, according to researchers.“Understanding the microscopic origin of this entropy – what are the underlying quantum states that the entropy counts? – has been one of the great challenges of the last 40 years,\u0026nbspMarika Taylor, professor of theoretical physics at Southampton University and a former student of Hawking’s, told , which had first reported the new paper.This paper proposes a way to understand entropy for astrophysical black holes based on symmetries of the event horizon. The authors have to make several non-trivial assumptions so the next steps will be to show that these assumptions are valid.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

have\u0026nbspbeen carried on the wind from Austria or Germany, but no one knows precisely what chemicals caused a stench that was like \u0027chlorine meets TCPDettol\u0026nbspmeets battery acid\u0027\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspClick to followThe IndependentNear Waterloo Bridge the strange smell was likened to \u0027chlorine meets TCPDettol meets battery acid\u0027It began somewhere around Wapping,\u0026nbspslightly to the east of the Tower of London.Accompanied by reports of some sort of fog, the stench – or at least awareness of it – seemed to spread east and west along the river, inviting comparisons with “chlorine meets TCPDettol meets battery acid” near Waterloo Bridge, and prompting Billy Kingsmill in East Ham to demand: “What the eff is it?”As reports of the “burningchemicalmetallic” smell crept past the Houses of Parliament towards Victoria and Paddington stations, comparisons were made with the Great Stink of London of 1858, which forced even MPs to do something about the dreadful state of sanitation in the capital.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspWednesday, then, was the wrong day for Kew Gardens to start boasting about its corpse flower with “one of the foulest odours in the plant kingdom”.By Thursday morning\u0026nbspthe smell had gone and the air quality had returned to good, but the questions remained, along, in some cases, with concerns about sore throats, sore lungs and headaches.What exactly had caused the great(ish) stink of 2018?\u0026nbsp How worried should the citizens of London be?\u0026nbsp And could the politan Police have shown a little more interest when one concerned Twitter user drew their attention to the foul smell enveloping the capital?For answers, The Independent turned to Dr Thomas Smith, assistant professor of environmental geography at the London School of Economics (LSE).\u0026nbspHe, like many others, had noticed the weird smell.Unlike many others, however, Dr Smith had a “laser egg”.Air pollution now ‘biggest environmental risk in Europe’This small device can measure air quality by counting\u0026nbspparticles in the air that are two-and-a-half microns or less in width and therefore small enough to be breathed into the lungs.The laser egg was stationed on the roof of the LSE’s St Clement’s building, near Lincoln’s Inn Fields, and was readable via an app on Dr Smith’s mobile phone.When Dr Smith noticed the stink while working in his fourth floor office, he checked the reading on his phone.\u0026nbspThen he went onto the roof to check that no students were skewing the results by smoking near the laser egg.No one was having a crafty fag near the laser egg.\u0026nbspThe result was real. \u0026nbspAs Dr Smith duly tweeted at 9.48pm, his machine had given an Air Quality Index (AQI) reading of 102, in the “unhealthy” range for people with pre-existing lung conditions and the highest pollution level that particular device had ever recorded.Alas, however, Dr Smith’s relatively inexpensive laser egg could only count the offending particles, not say what they were.He could, though, offer some speculation about where they came from. \u0026nbspAlthough Dr Smith didn’t put it like that.“Whatever it was,” he added, “It probably came from places beyond the remit of the UK Environment Agency.”When we consulted the experts at the London Air Quality Network at King’s College, London, they confirmed that Dr Smith’s hunch was broadly correct.Created with Sketch.The worst countries in the world for air pollution deaths Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.610 Bosnia and Herzegovina610 Bosnia and HerzegovinaTimothy Baker, the principal air quality analyst,\u0026nbspsaid London had received a dose of Austrian and German air, although home-grown emissions, especially from traffic during the evening rush hour, had also been partly to blame for Wednesday’s poor air quality.Mr Baker said: “What our monitoring equipment picked up on was a marked increase in the types of particles that are formed as a result of distant air pollution reacting in the atmosphere as it comes towards us.Mr Baker said that on Wednesday a high nitrate count – produced from particles originating in Austrian and German cars and domestic heating – was largely to blame for producing poor air quality in terms of potential to irritate lungs.But in terms of what so irritated the noses of Londoners, Mr Baker was unable to identify the chemical culprit for that industrial-seeming stench.What causes unhealthy air quality and what causes a nasty smell can sometimes be two completely separate things, Mr Baker explained.\u0026nbspThe irony with air pollution was, he said:\u0026nbsp“The side of it that is causing a lot of damage to people’s health is often undetectable.“The issue tends to attract attention when there is something people can see or smell, but there can be worse particle episodes that most people don’t notice.”Mr Baker was willing to speculate that the Austrian and German urban areas that produced pollution from vehicles and domestic heating may also have contained industrial units pumping out things that ended up stinking like “chlorine meets TCP”.\u0026nbspBut he admitted: “We don’t know what caused the precise nature of the smell.”Back in the LSE with the laser egg, however, Dr Smith did offer some reassuring context – about both the smell and the unhealthy particles.“I wouldn’t want to be too alarmist,” he said.Although that 102 measurement was his laser egg’s highest recording, he has only had it since May.Apart from Wednesday, his laser egg had been recording good air quality of between 10 and 30 on the index all summer, and on Thursday morning it was back down to 25.\u0026nbspAnd, Dr Smith said, the AQI reading of 102 had only just made it into the unhealthy range.\u0026nbsp This categorisation, denoting air quality that may adversely affect people with asthma or other lung conditions, starts at 101.Hundreds of thousands of children dying due to Africa’s poisonous airRestrictions on wood burners planned to improve UK air qualityMan who believes current air quality is ‘too clean’ named to EPA boardAn\u0026nbspindex reading that is unhealthy for the whole population\u0026nbspstarts\u0026nbspat 151, very unhealthy at 201 and “hazardous” is classed as anything from 300 upwards.Dr Smith said: “While researching wildfires in Southeast Asia. I’ve had readings of 2,000 in the smoke.“Cities like Beijing go over 100 frequently.\u0026nbspLondon has had far worse than this over the years, and whatever it was, it’s over now.”“People who live in more industrial parts of the UK, he added, “Are probably accustomed to these kinds of smells all the time, but people in central London are not used to it, because it is a very de-industrialised city.“I think there was probably a little bit of an over-reaction to an industrial smell that might be fairly common elsewhere.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

One photo purported to show a member of the 15-member team hobnobbing with Mohammed bin Salman, the powerful 33-year-old Saudi crown prince who has become the primary target of\u0026nbspMr Khashoggi’s criticisms. Another identified an alleged team member as Salah Mohammed al-Tubaigy, a name and face matching the head of forensic evidence at Saudi’s General Security department.Sabah purports to identify the 15-member Saudi team allegedly involved in the disappearance of journalist Jamal KhashoggiThe details\u0026nbspwere published by Sabah, a mass-circulation daily newspaper close to the government of president Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Friends, family, and officials say Mr Khashoggi was lured to the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on 2 October before disappearing.\u0026nbspTurkish media reported that security camera footage from inside the consulate was removed and that staff were ordered to go home the afternoon Mr Khashoggi arrived.On the same day, two private jets, owned by Riyadh based Sky Prime Aviation,\u0026nbspreportedly arrived from Saudi Arabia to Istanbul’s Ataturk airport, carrying the 15 personnel, landing just hours before Mr Khashoggi’s scheduled appointment at the consulate. Some of the 15 checked in to the five-star\u0026nbspMovenpick\u0026nbsphotel near the Saudi consulate in Istanbul’s Levent district.\u0026nbspBoth private jets and the 15 men departed hours later, according to Turkish officials and local press. Khashoggi: Emergence of Saudi dissident and his potentially tragic endTurkish authorities investigating the disappearance of Mr Khashoggi, a prominent Saudi with Turkish ethnic roots, have been leaking information about the probe to local and international media with what appears to be the tacit approval of government officials.Police in Istanbul have formed a special team to investigate Mr Khashoggi’s disappearance, the newspaper Milliyet reported, tasked specifically to use chemicals, dogs, and infrared light to look for DNA, blood and other traces of the journalist at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.The Post and other media also circulated a photo, likely taken from security camera footage, showing a black Mercedes Vito van that was parked outside the consulate and left shortly after Mr Khashoggi’s arrival, parked in front of the residence of Saudi consul general Mohammad al-Otaibi.The 15-member team identified by Sabah are all Saudi men aged between 30 and 57 years old. Those purportedly tracked down via open source internet tools by Oslo-based researcher Iyad al-Baghdadi and others include: a Saudi special forces member a lieutenant colonel in the Saudi civil defence force a major and lieutenant in the Saudi air force a lieutenant in the service guarding the crown prince’s palace and an intelligence service colonel who had once been attached to the Saudi embassy in the UK.Kalin on the disappearance of a Saudi journalist Jamal KhashoggiMr Khashoggi served for years as the right-hand man of Saudi prince Turki bin Faisal, a former intelligence chief as well as Riyadh’s envoy to the US and UK.\u0026nbspIncreasingly frustrated with Saudi Arabia’s\u0026nbspcourse, he began to bristle at the restrictions placed on media and civil society, eventually moving to the US last year amid fears for his own safety. In recent months he had grown increasingly critical of the crown prince, who has been criticised as authoritarian despite attempts to cast himself as a reformer. Saudi officials have denied that they had anything to do with Mr Khashoggi’s disappearance, insisting he left the consulate, but without providing proof, as demanded by Mr Erdogan.\u0026nbspThe disappearance of Mr Khashoggi, a permanent US resident, has put Washington in a tough spot. The crown prince has forged a strong alliance with the administration\u0026nbspof Donald Trump and a personal bond with the US president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner. US lawmakers have made tough statements about the Khashoggi affair, but the White House and State Department have been tepid. Saudi Arabia has vowed to buy $110bn in American weapons.“We’re not going to make any judgments about what had happened to him,” Heather Nauert, State Department spokeswoman, told reporters on Tuesday. “The United States is certainly concerned about his whereabouts. Senior officials at the State Department have spoken with Saudi officials through diplomatic channels about the matter. We call on the government of Saudi Arabia to conduct a thorough and transparent investigation.” Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

But this is the reality of trying to save up for a house.They work hard each month. They’d love to put something aside to save up for a home.But to live where there are good jobs, they have to spend so much on high rents that there’s nothing left over.So they can never save enough to break out of the cycle. No wonder they are frustrated.New figures show how bad things have got. The Institute for Fiscal Studies says four out of ten people in the  to -year-old age bracket couldn’t afford the mortgage on even the cheapest house in their area, eventhey had a deposit.The gap between prices and normal people’s earnings is just too big, because since  house prices in Britain have gone up more than in any other developed country.Expensive housing has meant that the proportion of young people on middle incomes who own their own home has collapsed: down from nearly two thirds  years ago, to just over a quarter today.We have to turn this round and restore home ownership.Many people feel they can’t get on and start a family until they have a nest of their own. Their lives are on hold.Politically it’s vital too. If young people don’t feel they’ve got a chance to get on in le, they are more likely to gamble and vote for extreme, disastrous politicians like Jeremy Corbyn.Even younger people who are earning decent wages feel squeezed, because they face a combination of high house prices and chunky repayments on their student loans.The Prime Minister is acutely aware of this. That’s why she’s set up a review of student fees, and moved to make housing her Number  priority other than Brexit.Hence her announcement of massive funding to build more affordable housing for people on lower incomes. But there’s much more to do.Building more homes for people to buy is a big part of the answer. Since  we have built only half as many houses as France each year, and so house prices have gone up twice as fast.Some people say building more means we must tear up the planning system and concrete over the countryside.But we know that approach won’t work. When Gordon Brown was PM we tried setting each area massive housing targets. All those targets built was resentment. We need a smarter approach to tackle the reasons people often oppose new housing.We build in the wrong places. Instead of tacking on new estates to existing towns and villages without enough new school places or parking places, let’s get back into the business of building planned new cities and towns.Let’s build upwards in our city centres with taller buildings, rather than just sprawling cities outwards.What drives people mad is seeing developers make massive windfall profits when they get planning permission, but then not sharing those benefits with local residents.Imagine instead,new houses being built next door always paid for people in neighbouring streets to get cheap homes for their children to buy. People would feel much better about development.Restoring the dream of home ownership isn’t just about building more houses though.We need to think about the balance of rented properties and home ownership. Over the last ten years we’ve built many new homes each year, but the number of homeowners fell. How come The reason is that the number of properties being snapped up by buy-to-let landlords has grown faster than we have built new ones.Don’t get me wrong. Landlords, who have themselves worked hard, weren’t doing anything wrong.Butwe want to get home ownership growing again we need to encourage savers to put their money into shares and into growing businesses rather than just bidding up the price of houses. The think tank Onward proposed this week that we should offer a tax break to landlords who sell their homes to their tenants.This “Chance to Buy” would be a bit like the Right to Buy Margaret Thatcher introduced for council tenants. It could be paid for by tax changes which would discourage people from buying up new buy-to-let properties.So fewer landlords, more homeowners.Young people just want the same chances previous generations enjoyed. So let’s build more by building smarter, and give a new generation the chance to buy a home.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sun Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The rest will be Brits who could claim more for child benefit, housing benefit, income support, jobseekers allowance or ESA.Those who are already on Universal Credit at the moment are only new claimants and are unlikely to be affected - but those who are claiming benefits on the old system and who will be rolled over soon could get a welcome boost.Department for Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey told The Sun Online: Universal Credit is a benefit system designed for the st century, replacing the old out-of-date legacy system.UC will provide more support to the most vulnerable, and helps people claim their right entitlement, helping those who may not be getting the right amount.As people move onto Universal Credit from the old system, there are around £.bn of unclaimed benefits that people will be able to access – benefiting around , people.Dave Finch, Senior Fellow at the Resolution Foundation, said: One of the key remaining advantages of Universal Credit is that by simplying the benefit system it should help families to claim all of what they’re entitled to.This would offer a welcome income boost to over half a million families, but it risks being undermined by problems where – such as the large cuts made to support for working families.The government needs to both highlight the remaining benefits of Universal Credit, and do more to deal with the signicant problems it still faces.Youll have to re-apply for your benefits again, and fill out the relevant paperwork.But after giving the DWP all your information, the new system should automatically pick up whether you are entitled to more benefits.This could include jobseekers allowance, ESA, income support, tax credits, housing benefit or child benefits.Universal Credit will roll all of these into one new monthly payment.Its thought that around , Brits will benefit from it.Roll-out of the Governments flagship welfare reform programme is expected to take place in  job centres.By , it is expected there will be a full roll out across the UK.For information about whether you can claim, visit Citizens Advice.The news will be a boost for some of the millions of people who are set to migrate over to the new system, which aims to roll several benefits into one monthly payment.But the flagship programme has been beset with issues so far, even though only a small number of the population are on it.The system has been plagued with delays and problems, and hundreds of complaints that benefits have been slashed by hundreds of pounds a month.Some were missing out on hundreds due to when their pay date fell.And one family of a boy battling cancer were so poor on Universal Credit they were forced to eat his leftover hospital food.The Sun Online revealed earlier this year the case of a disabled man born with  holes in his heart who has been denied benefits on Universal Credit - and told to get a job.Ministers have insisted that no one will be worse off going on to the new systemtheir situation doesnt change.But they will only be able to access transitional protection payments for a certain amount of time under Universal Credit.The former Tory leader attacked the Governments key welfare reforms today, saying it would lead to deep political trouble.Sir John said he was worried about how fast it was being rolled out and the way thousands were set to be worse off.He told the BBC: I am saying thatyou have people who have that degree of loss, that is not something that the majority of the British population would think of as fair.Andpeople think you have to remove yourself from fairness, then you are in deep political trouble.The poll tax - introduced in the s - proved very unpopular and led to riots and rebellions, and the fall of Margaret Thatchers government.IF youre experiencing trouble applying for your Universal Credit, or the payments just dont cover it, here are your options:Apply for an advance - Claimants are able to get some cash within five days rather than waiting weeks for their first payment. But its a loan which means the repayments will be automatically deducted from your future Universal Credit pay out.Alternative Payment Arrangements- If youre falling behind on rent, you or your landlord may be able to apply for an APA which will get your payment sent directly to your landlord. You might also be able to change your payments to get them more frequently , or you can split the paymentsyoure part of a couple.Budgeting Advance - You may be able to get help from the government to help with emergency household costs of up to £youre single, £youre part of a couple or £you have children. These are only in cases like your cooker breaking down or for help getting a job. Youll have to repay the advance through your regular Universal Credit payments. Youll still have to repay the loan, evenyou stop claiming for Universal Credit.Cut your Council Tax - You might be able to get a discount on your Council Tax or be entitled to Discretionary Housing Paymentsyour payments arent enough to cover your rent.Foodbanks - If youre really hard up and struggling to buy food and toiletries, you can find your local foodbank who will provide you with help for free. You can find your nearest one on the Trussel Trust website.Yesterday ex-Prime Minister Gordon Brown made a huge intervention in the debate, calling on ministers to halt the rollout.He said that Universal Credit was forcing more kids into poverty, and demanded they rethink the entire system.Ministers say the new programme will make work pay, and will encourage more Brits into work.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And I still can’t believe it.In March last year, a jihadi went on a rampage in Westminster.Then he smashed into the perimeter fence and entered New Palace Yard, a few dozen feet away from where our politicians were gathered.Armed with a kne, he attacked anyone he saw. He murdered PC Keith Palmer.And now the thing that beggars belief. At that very moment, the acting commissioner of the politan Police, Craig Mackey, was leaving the scene in a car. He was inches away from Masood.He was only a few feet away when the Islamic terrorist was busy stabbing his colleague, PC Palmer.He watched the stabbing take place. And what did he do  He drove off, sharpish, having locked the windows of his car.He told an inquest into the murder: “I was in shirt-sleeves with no radio. We had no protective equipment.“The way the male came in, he was clearly a threat.“The attacker had one of those looks where,they get you in that look, they would be after you.”So he skedaddled as fast as he could, actually driving right past Masood.It has a Monty Python ring to it.“When danger reared its ugly head, Sir Craig bravely turned and fled . . .”How, I wondered, could he possibly do that  I thought one of the requirements for being a copper was a certain bravery and, you know, a vague interest in apprehending criminals Also, Masood seemed a bit nasty. He had “one of those looks”.No s**t, Sherlock. This is cowardice and, to my mind, a gross dereliction of duty.At the very least, he could have opened the car door to distract the attacker.Nope, not Sir Craig. If he’d done something — anything — poor PC Palmer might be alive today. Various senior ex-coppers have called for Mackey to be booted out, right now. and stripped of his knighthood.Incidentally, he was bunged the knighthood in this year’s New Year’s honours, partly for hugely reducing the number of stop-and-searches in London.

They determine our moods, as well as when we should wake up, eat and sleep.However, they arent naturally calibrated to fit the Earths -hour cycle, and only stay properly aligned thanks to the routine periods of sunlight and darkness were exposed to every day. But down in the bunker, this doesnt apply, meaning Aldos body clock will soon slide out of kilter.The abandoned bunker Aldo is staying in is situated on the Devon coast, and was built to shelter the entire regional government in the event of a nuclear attack.Inside the bunker, even the temperature stays exactly the same at night, so there will be no way to track the time. Its the kind of experiment which has been known to drive people crazy.Aldos phone and watch are confiscated.Really, Im spending ten days in complete silence with myself, he says. That is quite alarming.Within four minutes of locking himself in, Aldo has already unpacked the few belongings he was allowed to bring with him.I actually now have nothing to do, he says, ambling between deserted rooms before eating a microwaved ready meal and going to bed bored.When Aldo wakes up, he spends his abundance of spare time exploring the dark lower levels of the bunker.He finds a room with old maps peeling off the walls and a mound of rubbish on the floor. Theres a long-stopped wall clock among the junk.Thats the most ironic thing Ive seen since Ive been in here, Aldo says.Aldo tries to guess at the time, but hes already slipped two hours out. He has resorted to reading the text on the back of his ready meal packets and bouncing a tennis ball off the walls to keep himself entertained.Id love to hear another person speak, he says. Just for a few minutes.The sound of silence is deafening, and my own voice already is starting to annoy me.The researchers turn off almost all the lights in the facility to see how Aldo will react to constant gloom.I already feel tired just because its very dark, he says. It feels like a winters night at home, except its not cosy and warm.As soon as I sit down my eyes feel heavy. I fell asleep on the bed earlier which I never normally do during the day...it is the day. It could be the night.It does give the impression, somehow, that Im more on my own and more isolated from humanity.Without light to stimulate him, Aldos body clock starts to drt like an old watch.He has no idea what time it is, and wakes up disoriented, lethargic and confused. He has also started marking his days on the wall of his room like a prisoner.Aldos sleep cycle has drted a whole three and a quarter hours out of sync, and his energy levels and physical performance have dropped off.He has also been filming a video diary the whole time, and the footage starts to take a disturbing turn.Im bored, he shouts, standing alone in his room after a session of juggling tennis balls.He then sits on the floor and stares at the wall, and when he tries to do some work at his desk, his head just slumps right down onto it.Then, when he goes to yawn, a guttural scream comes out.Its actually a little bit uncomfortable to watch, observes biologist Ella.Misaligned body clocks can also affect our mental health, and in Aldos case, the toll is severe.This is day nine, he says. Otherwise known as the longest day in history.I have a niggling worry that I may not be in day nine. This is doing my head in.You can see how easy it would be to psychologically unwind. And unwind spectacularly.Finally, Aldos time is up, and he can mark a tenth day on to the crude calendar he has scrawled on the white brick wall.He may have ticked off Iraq and Afghanistan, but for Aldo, this has been one of the hardest ordeals yet.The researchers behind the experiment, however, are delighted with how it all turned out.Monitoring Aldo as his body clock spiralled out of kilter allowed them to record exactly how well our bodies can hold it together when we are cut off from the world.The answer  Not very well.As for Aldo, hes just glad to be back on the surface again, where there are people to talk to and sunlight to drink in.Wow. Its super bright, he says. I have no idea in space and time where I am. Body Clock: What Makes Us Tick  airs at pm tonight on BBC Two.You can take advantage of your natural rhythm by adapting your day to better fit your body clock.For example, always avoid exercising just after waking up.This is because our body temperature drops overnight to conserve energy, making us weak and sluggish first thing in the morning.However, early morning is a good time to eat a big meal, as our stomachs and metabolisms are more active after a night’s rest.Brainpower, meanwhile, peaks during the late morning – making this the best time for problem solving or planning.Late in the afternoon is when our energy levels reach their peak, so this is the best time to exercise.Then, in the evenings, our bodies and metabolisms slow down, so this isn’t the best time to eat a large meal.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is also used as a solvent in a number of pharmaceuticals.The findings, published in the American Journal of Physiology-Lung Cellular, show e-cigs and refills are not well regulated - and their long-term effects on health are unknown.Researchers compared several groups of mice that received whole-body exposure to ying chemical combinations four times each day, with every session separated by -minute smoke-free intervals.Dr Glynos from the University of Athens, said: Electronic cigarettes are advertised as a less harmful nicotine delivery system or as a new smoking cessation tool. Our findings suggest that exposure to e-cig vapour can trigger inflammatory responses and adversely affect respiratory system mechanics.Dr Glynos added: We conclude that both e-cig vaping and conventional cigarette smoking negatively impact lung biology.His findings follow a British study earlier this year that also suggested vaping is more harmful than previously thought.University of Birmingham scientists extracted cells from lung samples provided by healthy non-smokers and exposed them to e-cig fluid, condensed vapour or nothing for  hours. Exposure to the vapour increased cell death and the production of inflammatory chemicals.Public Health England says e-cigs are  per cent safer than traditional cigarettes. And they suggest smokers should consider switching to vaping in a bid to help them quit.

Then out of nowhere she called me a gay fairy.”Paul called customer services after leaving the branch but says he was left feeling shocked and embarrassed in his car.Paul said: “I was embarrassed, and I felt a little belittled as I was put in the corner to wait by a teller that didn’t work.“I was a bit shaken but there’s nothing you can about it, other than trying to change the way people treat other people.”After making the initial complaint, he says he then received a call three days later from the customer relations team originally offering him £ before upping it to £.Paul, who now lives with his mum in Romford, said: “What shocked me the most and what hurt the most is that when I’d spoken to customer services on the phone, I didn’t get any apology.“When she said she’d offer me the ‘benefit of the doubt’ and give me £ I couldn’t believe it.“They probably thought the £ would shut down the case, it was insulting.“I’d rather they send her on a training course so she can learn how to behave, than sending me the money.“Then she said that with the information she had £ would be more appropriate, just like that. I hit the roof.“I asked her whether she should have done an investigation before speaking to me instead she offered compensation without having spoken to anyone in the branch.”Paul, who has been banking with Lloyds since he was a teenager, said: “A lot of the staff at Lloyds are very good and I wouldn’t want to tarnish their reputations.“But I was taken back, and it caught me off guard that someone would be homophobic at a national bank in this day and age.A Lloyds spokesman said: “We have taken Mr Whitbread’s claims extremely seriously and have undertaken a full investigation into the allegations that have been made.“While we recognise some of the service we provided Mr Whitbread did not meet the high standards we aim for when he visited our branch, we have not been able to find evidence to support all aspects of his complaint.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NINTCHDBPICT000440914938.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"theresa may hints universal credit u turn","story":"Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey said some of the poorest Brits in the country would be left “worse off” by the new benefits regime when it expands next year.The PMs spokesman conceded she was listening to concerns.And sources last night claimed the Chancellor may now cave in to Tory pressure and cancel a planned increase in the higher rate tax allowance to pump as much as £ billion back into Universal Credit at the Budget.The money was taken out by former Chancellor George Osborne.Earlier yesterday, former PM John Major warned that the nationwide roll-out of Universal Credit– which replaces six existing benefits – could prove to be Mrs May’s “poll tax” unless she spends more money.And last night the Joseph Rowntree Foundation charity piled on the pressure by saying as many as . million ‘strivers’ could be left £ a week worse off under UC than the old tax credits regime.JRF chief Campbell Rob said most of these are families with children.He stormed: “Action in the Budget this month would mean working families keep more of their earnings.”The PM’s official spokesman yesterday insisted as much as £ billion had been set aside to help claimants “transit” to the new benefits system over the coming years.But Iain Duncan Smith, the architect of the scheme, is understood to be leading a campaign backed by as many as  MPs to demand Philip Hammond act at the Budget later this month.Tory backbencher Johnny Mercer yesterday said the current scheme was “politically undeliverable”.The current row was sparked at the weekend by claims Esther McVey had told the Cabinet benefit claimants would be left as much as £, a year worse off when the system is rolled out nationwide.Challenged yesterday she told the BBC: “I have said we made tough decisions and some people will be worse off. I won’t say what I said in Cabinet.“I had a very open conversation with my colleagues about how to support people.”Universal Credit replaces six existing benefits – income support, income-based jobseekers allowance, income related employment and support allowance, housing benefit, working tax credit and child tax credit – with a single payment. Supporters claim it incentivises work.The system was rolled out in pilot schemes in . About  million people already receiving the old benefits will be moved onto UC in a “managed migration” that is not due to complete until .A Government spokesperson last night said: “We are listening to concerns about how Universal Credit supports people and constantly looking to improve the benefit.THERESA May must find the cash to help those losing out in the sht to Universal Credit.The new scheme DOES work well for many. It is far simpler and, crucially, incentivises work. But cuts by former Chancellor George Osborne are now biting too hard. Some claimants face a severe blow to their income.If the PM is genuinely “listening to concerns”, as she says, then good.Voters generally back less generous benefit payments. Especially compared with the absurd levels under the last Labour Government, which fostered idleness and trapped huge numbers permanently on the dole.But Brits are famously keen on fair play too.They won’t support families being stripped of money through no fault of their own.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I’ve looked at them closely for years, inidually, every single one of them.“To come to a place where they are etched in stone is emotional but also very positive.”Rob has hand-stitched shrouds on to in plastic men to mark the unidentied Commonwealth soldiers who fell at the Somme.He hopes to have finished all , by November  — Armistice Day, a century after the end of the war.Each one will then be laid out side by side in the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in Stratford, East London, covering almost an acre of grass.Rob, from Watchet, Somerset, said: “Throughout the summer we have shown some of them in cities from Exeter to Belfast, and everywhere people have been moved to tears. But the emotion they feel, the tears they have already shed and will shed at the Olympic Park, is a positive thing.“The men I have lived with for the last five years will never be forgotten.”With four weeks to go, Rob still has , to complete and is in a race against time to finish what TV historian Dan Snow described as “the most powerful depiction of the losses in World War One that I have ever come across”.Rob said: “It sounds a lot butI have to work all day and all night, I will get them all there for the ­Olympic Park. Emotion takes its toll but it’s very dficult to say I’m ­feeling tired or don’t want to do this any more because, however challenging my task, it’s nothing to what these young men had to go through.”Rob’s tribute, called Shrouds Of The Somme, is raising money for Armed Forces’ charity SSAFA and the Commonwealth War Graves Commission .For the th anniversary of Armistice Day – ­November ,  – we will be ­publishing The Sun First World War Centenary Roll Of Honour.We want you to tell us about ­members of your family who took part.

Rob said: “Some days you have  or so deaths and then, on July , , you see it leap to ,.“Under no circumstances can we forget what those men did. They stepped out, they died. They were that brave. Very few got to fire a shot.”Following a car crash which left him no longer able to work as a carpenter, Rob began his remarkable odyssey by making , shrouds in tribute to those killed in the Somme on that horric first day.Glyn Prysor, chief historian at CWGC, said: “Rob’s work confronts you with the reality of what that war really meant.“Each of the names on this ­memorial is not just a le lost.

I firmly believe they should just not be on their phones in school and so I strongly support schools that ban phones.”But he refused the temptation to implement an official ban like has happened in France.He went on: “When people ask meI am going to follow the French model and impose a national ban I say no.“Headteachers know best how to run their schools and how to achieve the objectives they want without unintended consequences. We have given teachers the power to confiscate phones where necessary and to investigate cyberbullying that goes on beyond the school gates.”Quizzed further on whether children are being “weaned” on mobile devices, he added: “Dferent parents do dferent things.

That could reduce stigma.Wearable hearing devices are coming on stream nowadays which might also be helpful. They not only assist your hearing, but give you access to the internet and other servicesCo-author Dr Asri Maharani, also of Manchester University, said: Age is one of the most important factors implicated in cognitive decline. We find that hearing and vision interventions may slow it down and perhaps prevent some cases of dementia, which is exciting- though we cant say yet that this is a causal relationship.She added: Other studies have attempted to look at rates of cognitive decline, but have not really succeeded as its hard to take into account demographic factors.

Other factors of concern to investors are the risk of a \"no-deal\" Brexit, signs of a possible clash between the EU and Italy over the latters refusal to set a responsible budget, and the US midterm elections.But the relationship between the US and China is the biggest concern.And, overlaying all that, is the inexorable rise of debt.

But the plan was not disclosed to local councillors or MPs until just hours before work began. Tom Tugendhat, whose constituency is affected said: “It’s come to a pretty pass when [an MP] finds out that works have begun on a motorway to turn that motorway into a parking lot without consultation either with the local community or with surrounding [MPs]” According to Politico the fact the works were related to Brexit was not disclosed by either the Department for Transport or Highways England until Wednesday  There is concern there could be delays at the nearby port of Doverthe UK withdraws from the EU without a deal because of the need for customs checks. Under the plan confirmed by the Transport Secretary Chris Grayling, the M motorway will become a holding area for hundreds of lorries to allow traffic to move more freely on other roads. There will be overnight closures on the motorway until Monday and in the run up to Christmas between November  and December  while the work is carried out Diversions will be in place via the M and M.  A plan called Operation Brock will also see traffic able to park on the nearby M. Sections of the M are currently closed under Operation Stack when lorries are forced to queue because of disruption to rail or ferry services, causing chaos for local journeys.  Tom Tugendhat, Tory MP for Tonbridge and Malling, said his community was kept in the dark about the M work after receiving assurances that nothing was planned. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said he did not expect any of the no-deal Brexit contingencies to be required as he believes a deal will be struck with Brussels.  Speaking in the Commons, Mr Tugendhat said: Its come to a pretty pass when a member finds out that works have begun on a motorway to turn that motorway into a parking lot without consultation either with the local community or with surrounding members. The M works started last night. I wrote toin April asking whether or not this would happen. I was assured the works were not planned and only yesterday was it confirmed to me that Highways England had said that is exactly what was planned, despite having told me the reverse a week earlier. He urged Mr Grayling to explain how the planning permission was granted with no consultation.  Mr Grayling said he was happy to meet Mr Tugendhat to discuss the issue, adding: I do not expect any of the contingencies that we have in place for a no-deal Brexit to be needed because Im confident we will reach a sensible agreement. A spokesman for Highways England said: As part of wider resilience planning, Highways England has been asked by the Department for Transport to develop plans to utilise the M to hold heavy goods vehicles, should further capacity be required in the future. We will be undertaking site surveys on the M during October leading to the installation of two gates in the central reservation to support the safe management of freight in the future,needed. Best for Britain supporter and former Transport secretary Andrew Adonis said: Its not April Fools Day, this is actually happening. Local people should have been consulted or even notied but yet the government are just running roughshod over local peoples opinions. All this just puts Britains economy in the slow lane. Our motorway network will grind to a halt as its turned into Britains most expensive Brexit car-park.

The centre is owned by the Catholic Church and houses the North Eastern Refugee Service, other agencies and charities. There’s a chapel and shop with religious cards and other merchandise. It’s a place people drop in either for weekday mass or just some contact and conversation in the coffee house. Between . and . every Saturday in The Upper Room on the top floor, free food is provided for the homeless, the destitute- in fact for all- comers, whatever their need. This Saturday, like all the others before, the customers congregate together in the back alley waiting for the session to begin and when the door opens theyre met by a volunteer on the door and each are given a raffle ticket to exchange for food. Theyd already settled in when I arrived.  I climb the stairs to find a room packed with nearly  people, almost all men, but two or three women, ranging from teenagers to pensioners gathered round the tables. Some have clearly come straight from the streets and havent slept indoors for some time and its self evident that for some its been a long time since theyd had the benefit of a shower or put on clean clothes. None of that bothers the volunteers or anyone . Some of the guests are clearly malnourished and some toothless - old beyond their years. One man presents as quite detached and troubled and shouts out quite randomly. He suddenly calls the room to order to ask for a moment of silence. I suspect like many others in the room, I totally misconstrue what he is trying to say. At the time I think his appeal simply in keeping with the general scene.  Nobody bats an eyelid. Later I learn he was asking us to mark the death of a local woman by the name of Barby Pigg, as he’d seen reported in the local newspaper. He doesnt get many to join in the observance. I should have listened to him more carefully. The volunteers carry on serving the sandwiches, the crisps and bananas. Some were keen for seconds. One of the young lads hasn’t eaten since Thursday and others take a paper bag of extra sandwiches for later. Its plain and obvious that very many of the diners have mental health problems and many have special needs- some severe. My case worker Emma volunteers at The Upper Room and shed arranged for me to go along where I am welcomed to the centre by two of the brilliant volunteers Gamini and Margaret. They speak with such warmth and compassion telling me that they rarely had any trouble. In fact, when someone occasionally forgot themselves and used bad language, more often than not, they corrected themselves and apologised. They tell me the clientele are all iniably very respectful and polite.  I look out on the packed room and its the saddest scene Ive witnessed in many years.Dozens and dozens of people in crisis of one form or another. People who have hit rock bottom. Some quite dishevelled and some dirty -but not all by any means. Many unwell and everyone of them hungry, right in the heart of a town centre busy with shoppers and football fans having a pre-match pint.  As well as our established network of daily food banks, there’s a free food facility run by either churches or charities every day of the week in Middlesbrough, especially for those who simply cant navigate through the foodbank processes. The demand is huge and the volunteers are many, and whilst we are yet to see the full impact of the roll out of Universal Credit that has just started locally, the ious local agencies and voluntary groups know exactly what is coming and they are very very fearful. I stay for much of the hour long session. There is no obvious counselling as such.Just a warm loving welcome and good banter.Nobody is judged.Just a reliable service where people know they can come on a Saturday to get some food. I come home to my uncomfortably comfortable home and weep. Anger, sadness and despair in equal measure.I simply cannot comprehend how in my town, that has contributed so much to our country, such vulnerable people are being treated and expected to survive. How they do survive is beyond me.  Many are on the streets. It is plain and obvious that the state has completely failed them in all of their ious crises and distress, so it falls to the churches, the charities and iniduals to step in and do their best, which they do so devotedly week in week out, but with no sign of the fundamental causes of such poverty misery and isolation being addressed or tackled. They have no voice but they are our brothers and sisters and it has to be our duty as a society to support them and to love them. There is a direct correlation between Government policy and the misery suffered by people down on their luck, or simply not blessed with the attributes needed to survive and thrive.  The absence of the state in responding to such overbearing need is glaring. There is great compassion from great numbers of iniduals, but our local councils and other agencies are without the necessary resources or powers to properly respond. Of course our consciences can be eased by condemning the poor as the authors of their own misfortune. Thats as easy as it is wrong, as well as being grossly unfair and cruel. As with everywhere in our country, here in Middlesbrough there are many people who are doing well, who le has been kind to and they are doing fine and dandy thank you very much. Far too many others are struggling and working as hard as they can to hold it all together but live in fear of it all collapsing around them.  But we all live cheek by jowl with the marginalised and isolated who are, for the main part, shunned and avoided by mainstream society. This is totally unacceptable as well as being completely heart breaking. As Jeremy Corbyn said invoking the Gospel: We will not walk by on the other side. We will treat others as we wish to be treated ourselves Because, but for the grace of God, go I.

His parents have now been told his best chance of survival is revolutionary treatment in Philadelphia, America, costing pound,. So far, they have reached pound,, but need to raise the rest by Christmas to give him the best chance of beating the disease. Dad Mark Garbett, , a heating engineer, from Broseley, Shrops., said: “They have said there is only a  percent chance of treating the condition which Zac has - but we are determined to get him into that bracket.  Only . per cent of children diagnosed with leukemia suffer from near-haploid. Zac has always been a healthy, boisterous boy with an infectious smile and always wants to go out to play. We dont want to sit around and wait for him to die. Zacs health first declined three months ago after suffering a spell of bumps and falls. Mum Hannah Oliver-Willetts, , an occupational therapist, took him to A+E department at Princess Royal Hospital in Telford when he hurt his arm on a slide. Doctors said he had fractured his wrist so they put him in a cast and he was discharged, but with hindsight the accident was a sign that Zac was suffering from leukaemia. Zac then bumped his knee on the coffee table and the injuries left him limping and unable to walk. Hannah took him to the GP where they said that Zac required immediate hospital treatment - and suggested there might be safeguarding concerns.  I was shocked about what the doctors said but I just wanted to get him to Princess Royal. After five independent examinations by five separate doctors, Zac was diagnosed with Perthes disease - a bone growth disorder. Doctors found that the blood supply to the rounded head of the femur in the hip was temporarily disrupted. Without an adequate blood supply, the bone cells die, a process called avascular necrosis. However, Hannah and Mark thought there was something more sinister at work. It was awful to find out that my sons hip was virtually crumbling but we were simply not taking Perthes disease as the answer to Zacs degenerating condition, Hannah said. A child doesnt have that number of accidents for a degenerative hip to be the issue.  Blood tests revealed Zac also had a strain of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and a week later they discovered he had the super rare near-haploid strain of the disease. Hannah said: We are all a really close family but both diagnoses have been devastating, it was very hard to take in. He has since endured a rigorous cycle of chemotherapy and steroids with treatment at Telfords Princess Royal and Birmingham Childrens Hospitals. But the chemo hasnt worked as well as hoped, and it is feared a bone marrow transplant could see him relapse and get worse. “All research states that children with Zacs diagnosis mostly die due to relapse so we searched high and low for something dferent, his mum said.  The family want to try Cart T cell therapy, a controversial stem cell treatment available in America, and being trialled in the UK. Mark said: We approached the UK  of doctors which were part of the trail but shockingly they said he did not meet the criteria. The UK doctors that he must relapse before he is eligible. Thats simply horrible to say. Why would we wait for his little body to become weak from all the toxic chemotherapy before giving our little boy what could be le-saving treatment. So we went to the US trial team at Philadelphia Childrens Hospital and remarkably they said they could take Zac. This was great news but I couldnt believe that the UK doctors were not accepting him. We dont want to sit around and wait for him to die.  The US trial has a  percent chance of survival so it would be a miracleour little boy survived. Hannah added: Its an astronomical cost but we are determined to raise the fortune needed to save our precious little boy. Since starting treatment, Zacs mobility has improved, you wouldnt know you were anything wrong with him. But we are still determined to raise our dream goal to save our precious angel.

The art world was left stunned when Girl With Balloon, one of Banksys most widely recognised works, passed through a shredder built into the frame after the hammer went down at Sothebys in London on October . The  piece was shown dangling in pieces from the bottom of the frame. The new work has been given a new title, Love Is In The Bin, and has been granted a certicate by Pest Control, Banksys authentication body. The buyer, a female European collector and a long-standing client of Sothebys, is proceeding with the pound. million purchase.  She said: When the hammer came down last week and the work was shredded, I was at first shocked, but gradually I began to realise that I would end up with my own piece of art history. Alex Branczik, Sothebys head of contemporary art, Europe, said: Banksy didnt destroy an artwork in the auction, he created one. Following his surprise intervention on the night, we are pleased to confirm the sale of the artists newly-titled Love Is In The Bin, the first artwork in history to have been created live during an auction.  Girl With Balloon appeared on a wall in Great Eastern Street, London. The framed, stencil spray painting shows a girl reaching towards a heart-shaped balloon The gallery version featured spray paint and acrylic on canvas, mounted on a board. Meanwhile, one pound, piece of Banksy artwork is now worth under pound after a collector shredded it in attempt to increase its value.  Banksy rose to prominence through a series of graffiti pieces that appeared on buildings across the country, marked by deeply satirical undertones.

The entertainment features a fire-breathing pyromaniac, alluring hula hoops, sexy strong men, a drunken wh***, nail-biting acrobatics and a fearsome dominatrix flying high in the Big Top, according to organisers. The Cirque du Vulgar is heading to Yeovil, in Somerset, this October after sweeping through Devon and Cornwall with huge success. The over-s showcase is inspired by all things vulgar, Somerset Live reports . One of the biggest acts involves a Wheel of Death rotating high above the ground.  Acrobats jump and skip over it while fellow performers dance and bang metal chains in the time to music. Spokeswoman for Cirque du Vulgar Rosie Clarke said the performers have thought of everything from upside-down hunks in trunks to mind-bending pole dancing. There will also be champagne on ice and plenty of those trousers which rip off at the Velcro seams. Frank, one half of the comedy duo Frank and Beans, said: We’ve promised flesh, we’ve promised filth, we’ve promised stunts. This is one circus show that you can’t take the kids to.  His partner Beans also plays the role of the fire-breathing pyromaniac and has a certain penchant for stuffed rabbits. Ms Clarke said: You’ve never seen anything like Cirque du Vulgar before. This year marks  years since the birth of circus arts in the UK, and we wanted to tear up the rule book and create a show which was refreshing, enticing, and aimed at a whole new audience. Another of the high profile acts includes a giant bath tub and a scantily-clad French maid.  The maid emerges from the bath soaking wet, suspended by elastic wrist cords. The act is tipped as a favourite. Another popular performance includes three Vulgarettes performing a teasing topless feather dance. The circus says: Nudity and naughtiness are the order of the day. But there is no excuses for male members of the cast to stay clothed as they will also be bearing all in the name of risqueacute entertainment. The show will be at the Yeovil Showground on October  at :pm. For more details and to book tickets, visit the Cirque du Vulgar Facebook page by clicking here .

See, the streams of living waters, Springing from eternal love, Well supply thy sons and daughters, And all fear of want remove: Who can faint, while such a river Ever flows their thirst to assuage  Grace, which like the Lord the giver, Never fails from age to age. Saviour,of Sion’s city I through grace a member am, Let the world deride or pity, I will glory in thy name: Fading is the worldlings pleasure, All his boasted pomp and show Solid joys and lasting treasure None but Sion’s children know. John Newton‘Abbot’s Leigh’, Cyril TaylorLast verse arranged by James VivianDeclarations The Dean of Windsor says to the couple: I require and charge you both, as ye will answer at the dreadful day of judgement when the secrets of all hearts shall be disclosed, thateither of you know any impediment, why ye may not be lawfully joined together in Matrimony, ye do now confess it.

Above all, clothe yourselves with love, which binds everything together in perfect harmony. And let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, to which indeed you were called in the one body. And be thankful. Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly teach and admonish one another in all wisdom and with gratitude in your hearts sing psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs to God. The Second Reading The Maid of Honour Her Royal Highness Princess Beatrice of York will read an extract from The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald He smiled understandingly-much more than understandingly. It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four or five times in le. It faced–or seemed to face–the whole eternal world for an instant, and then concentrated on you with an irresistible prejudice in your favour. It understood you just as far as you wanted to be understood, believed in you as you would like to believe in yourself, and assured you that it had precisely the impression of you that, at your best, you hoped to convey. Precisely at that point it vanished — and I was looking at an elegant young rough-neck, a year or two over thirty, whose elaborate formality of speech just missed being absurd. Some time before he introduced himself I’d got a strong impression that he was picking his words with care. All remain seated.

Ahead of the extravagant ceremony at Windsor Castle today, she said it “was love at first sight” when they met at exclusive Swiss ski resort Verbier in . Referring to herself and her other half as “Team Euge and Jack”, the princess added she was “all butterflies and nervous” when he introduced himself. She said: “I think I rang my mum that night and said ‘I’ve met this guy Jack’. “I remember being like ‘I really, really like this guy. I really want him to like me too’, and then you gave me this huge windscreen wiper wave and that was it, ‘right, he likes me’.”  Asked by Holmes to describe each other in three words Jack, , said about his future we: Shes this bright shining light. Eugenie, , was not so succinct and replied: Jacks the kind of guy, you know when youre lost at a party and you cant find anyone to talk to, and you start panicking and you need help  Hell walk in and make everyone feel so special. Drinks brand manager Jack hailed the way Eugenie has organised the wedding, saying: “She’s been incredible. She has the ability to do a million things at once in her brain.” Eugenie then said of Jack: “He’ll make you feel a million dollars and [he’s] so humble and generous.” The princess went on to say her big sissy Princess Beatrice was someone Ive looked up to her whole le and that shes the biggest supporter of team Eug and Jack.

The event is expected to attract thousands to the Berkshire town. The security there was noticeably stepped up yesterday.  Kerry Evans, one of the well-wishers who has travelled to Windsor for the big day, said: “I’m a huge royal fan, but possibly we should make the royals pay for the security. “When we are all tightening our belts and we are all in financial hardship because of the cuts maybe the royals could all club together.” Kerry, , who is from Hull and has been camping by the Thames since Tuesday to get a good spot to celebrate the wedding, added: “Why aren’t [the royals] putting their hands in their pockets for the security  They would have won a lot of support.”  An insider said this week that Eugenie could have saved taxpayers a fortune by getting married at the chapel in the grounds of Royal Lodge where the reception is being held. The source said: “There would be no need for a carriage procession through Windsor, so no police protection headache, and a poundmillion saving.” Royal Lodge in Windsor Great Park is the home of Eugenie’s father Prince Andshyrew. It is just over three miles from the wedding venue, St George’s Chapel at the castle. Eugenie, the ninth in line to the throne, joked she might sprint down the aisle. She said: “It’s a bit scary – but at the end of the day you get to marry the person you love.” Turning to Jack, she added: “And you’re going to be at the end of the aisle, and I’m going to be running towards you.”  Her sister Princess Beatrice, , will be a maid of honour and will perform a reading. Eugenie said: “She’s my big sissy. I’ve looked up to her my whole le. “I’ve wanted to be her at times. We’ve fought over Converse trainers and who gets what… We’re best friends.” Jack and the Queen’s granddaughter Eugenie had a last-minute rehearsal yesterday at the chapel.

A row of  luxury mansions in Sandbanks, Dorset, are worth a staggering poundmillion. The ft stretch in the peninsula in Poole Harbour looks out on to the busiest part of the worlds second biggest natural harbour. There is also almost total privacy from the road out front while back gardens run down to the waters edge. But the plots are relatively narrow, between ft and ft wide, making it the most expensive piece of coastline in the world in terms of price per square foot.  To highlight the buoyant state of the super-prime level of the Sandbanks market, two ultra-modern properties with indoor swimming pools were recently snapped up in quick time for a combined pound.m. One of those that went for just over poundm was a huge state-of-the-art mansion while the other sold for pound.m even before the sales brochure had come out. Last week another luxury house on a plot of land that Beatles star John Lennon bought for his beloved Aunt Mimi, went up for sale for pound.m. Other properties to have changed hands in recent times include a mock-Tudor mansion that was sold by soccer boss Harry Redknapp to the boss of Topps Tiles.  It sold for pound.m in  but is now said to be valued at poundm after undergoing renovation. And a his and her mansion that has been split in to two homes and lived in by a brother and sister are said to be worth pound. each. Sandbanks, also known as Britains version of Miami Beach, remains hugely popular with London-centric buyers. Local property experts believe the uncertainty over the impact Brexit will have on the London property market is tempting rich buyers to look where. Adrian Dunford, of Sandbanks estate agents Tailor Made, said: We now believe this part of Sandbanks is the most expensive stretch of coastline on the planet in terms of price-per-square foot.  The multi-million pound mansions in Miami and Monte Carlo will be on much bigger plots of land than you get on Sandbanks. The thing about Sandbanks is that it is a peninsula and so we are hemmed in. You cant increase the number of properties and so supply and demand dictate the prices. That row of properties is located in the most enviable part of Sandbanks. The houses have direct water access and also overlook the busiest part of the harbour. The south westerly aspect allows for sensational views to Old Harry Rocks, Poole Harbour, Brownsea Island and the Purbeck Hills. Sometimes with the bigger, headline-priced properties you need two summers to sell them.  So to have two at the very top end of the market go as quickly as they have says an awful lot about the state of the local market. The properties were bought by London-based buyers and that maybe a reflection of what is happening with the Brexit. And Keith Fensom, from Savills, said: Generally the market is dficult because of the uncertainty of Brexit, but that doesnt seem to affect buyers at the super-prime level. Sometimes these houses might come on the market once in a generation and buyers knowthey dont seize their chance they could be waiting years. Some are passed through family trusts and will never come on the market because there are too many beneficiaries to get to agree to sell.  I think the appeal of that section of Sandbanks is that its very private. Houses on the beach dont have quite so much privacy because the beach is open to the public, but on the harbour side you dont have anybody in front of you and you can see all the activity in the harbour and you dont get the queue for the ferry outside your house. There is also a huge dference in value on the road. The opposite side is apartments and townhouses without the view. There arent many roads in the country you can have houses worth poundm on one side of the road and just pound, on the other. I dont think there is anywhere  in the country that compares, I would think its the most expensive coastal road in the country by a long way. The key is, unlike Devon and Cornwall, its close enough to London for people to come for a long weekend. In two hours they can have a complete change in lestyle, thats the attraction.

Hundreds of children were sent home from Godwin Junior School in Forest Gate, east London, after dozens of spiders were seen crawling over the school gates. The school said it would be closed due to circumstances beyond its control. Bites from  widow spiders can cause flu-like symptoms, swellings or a nasty infectionleft untreated - and could even kill in rare circumstances. Fumigators are currently on site to try and rid the school of the infestation. The schools site manager said: The first one didnt work. I want them to do every classroom.  We will do an inspection tomorrow morning just checkinganythings there. One mum, , whose son attends the school said the local authoritys response was was a bit over the top. She said: I dont want my son to be scared of spiders. Spiders are in the world - we are humans, we live in a world with animals and insects. We need to learn to live alongside each other.  The mum said she was told the school will reopen on Monday. Yesterday, Eastlea Community School in Canning Town was the seventh school to be closed and will remain shut for at least two-and-a-half weeks while pest control experts rid the buildings of the hidden menace. Parents of the students aged between  and  were informed of the venomous spiders in a letter on Monday. But it was reported pupils were encouraged to go into class on Tuesday so they could collect homework. A letter from headteacher Stephen Gillat confirmed the threat of spiders.  It read: Upon Newham environmental health inspecting Eastlea, an infestation of spiders were discovered in and around the perimeter of our buildings. Therefore, I have had to take the dficult decision to close Eastlea Community School to students and staff. We have engaged a company to deal with and eradicate this pest and they will do this as quickly as possible. However, they have estimated that this will take up to three weeks. Others schools across east London were forced to close after spotting  widow spiders. Monega Primary School in Manor Park had closed on Friday due to the arachnid infestation.  While Ellen Wilkinson, Star Primary, Rokeby, and Lister Community School also announced closures. After its closure, Earlham Primary declared itself spider free and has since reopened. A Newham Council spokeswoman said last week the affected schools were being treated and cleared. She said: We are working with them to ensure children continue to get an education while their schools are closed. We are asking all our schools and nurseries to proactively check their premises carefully for these spiders. If they see any signs, then contact environmental health or pest control as well as notying the council.  David Cross, head of Technical Training Academy at Rentokil Pest Control, said the spiders have been around for some time. He said: False Widow Spiders have brown bulbous abdomens with pale markings, and the females can grow up to mm. The spiders will only bite humansthey become frightened, orthey are accidentally provoked or squeezed. Their venom can make children ill, but bites in adults will usually only cause a temporary pain and swelling. The  widow spider was accidentally imported to the UK about  years ago and they are adapting to our temperate climate, with increased sightings across the country. Headteacher Stephen Gillatt at Eastlea Community School has since told : “After careful deliberation, we have decided to close the school due to a spider infestation discovered on the perimeter of our building.  “We apologise for any inconvenience this may cause our families, but assure them this action was taken in best interests of the safety of students. “We kept the school open yesterday to give our staff time to set students work for the period they will not attend school, and for our families to make childcare arrangements. “The school is closed from today, Wednesday October th, and is likely to reopen after the half term break on Monday October th. “We have taken steps to ensure the disruption to student learning will be minimal. Year  –  students will be set work through our online portal, the Dynamic Progress Report. “We are currently in the process of finalising space for our Year  students to be taught in other local schools and institutions. Further information will be made available shortly. “Families and students will be able to contact teachers via email throughout the time school is closed. Please check our website regularly for contact details and updates.” "},{"url":null,"title":"how you say princess eugenies","story":"NewsHow do you say Princess Eugenies name  Sarah Ferguson says everyone has been pronouncing her name wrongPrincess Eugenie will marry Jack Brooksbank on Friday, but theres one thing we need to clear up firstShareCommentsByZoe ForseyActing Audience Editor:,  JAN Updated:,  OCT Newsthis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror incoming video granny-very-happy-princess-eugenie-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true\"\"Get Royal Family updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailWeve been seeing a lot more of Princess Eugenie in the last few months as she prepared for her wedding day.

Eugenies special day will actually be BIGGER than her more-senior cousins, with a full weekend of fun for guests to look forward to. The men attending the royal wedding will have to wear morning suits, as stated on the invitation dress code, and theres also a strict fashion rule the duchesses Meghan and Kate will have to follow on the big day.  Its protocol for all women to wear hats to a royal wedding. This rule applies to everyone, including the Queen and all the other royal women in the family. Of course Princess Eugenie and her sister Beatrice have always followed the rule in the past, and turned heads with their unusual choice of hats for Prince William and Kate Middletons wedding back in .

The royal family will pay for the three parties out of their personal funds, however taxpayers will foot the bill for security, which is expected to exceed poundmillion. This has been criticised by many who believe Eugenie, who is ninth in line to the throne and doesnt carry out any official duties, should have a lower-key - and cheaper - wedding.

Thomas Markle Sr confessed to snfing the Class A drug during the s and s when he worked as a Grammy-winning lighting director in the television industry. The -year-old also told how he also frequented the now-defunct Playboy Club in the Philippines not far from Manila’s seedy right light district although he denied paying for sex. Speaking to the National Enquirer, Markle said: “In the industry I worked in back in the ‘s and ‘s therecocaine around a lot. “And I’m sure that I had an occasional snf of cocaine.” Sources close to Markle, who knew him well during when he worked in Hollywood, accused him of being “conservative” about his past. One told the Mirror: “Cocaine was re in the industry.  “It was a tough business, very tough. Tom endured long unsociable hours. He was at the very top of his game, and the demands on him were great. “A lot of people on set took coke not just for recreational purposes but to keep them alert and allow them to work long hours. “Tom was no dferent. Him saying he took the occasional snf is conservative at best. “What I will say though is it never affected his care and love of Meghan. “She was the most powerful drug he knew. He was addicted to her. Every hour he could spend with away from work he did.” The bizarre admission brings more shame for the Duchess of Sussex, who tomorrow is due toto Windsor Castle to attend the marriage of Princess Eugenie.  The ceremony comes just five months after she walked down the aisle of St George’s Chapel to wed Prince Harry. In addition to confessing to snorting cocaine, Grammy-winning Mr Markle also discussed his private le. He told how he would “enjoy” himself in Manila’s Playboy Club where hundreds of scantily girls would tend to guests. Mr Markle, who has not spoken to Meghan since she tied the knot, denied paying for sex when asked. “Have I ever paid for a sex worker  Uh, there was a Playboy Club in the top floor of the PhilippinesI never paid for sex,” he said. The club, a franchised operation of the US Playboy Clubs, in its heyday boasted a membership of ,, mostly U.S. Embassy staff, other foreign diplomats, bankers and the sons of Manila’s rich and famous.  Ferdinand ‘Bong Bong’ Marcos, son of the former president, was seen often in the club’s Cabaret Room. Other well-known politicians and businessmen trysted with their mistresses in the notorious Playmate Bar. The club, which closed in , was adjacent to a notorious red light district and situated at the top of Silahis International Hotel. As well as discussing drugs and sex, Mr Markle also spoke about the controversial interviews he has given. As he discussed one he carried with a UK newspaper he threatened to break the reporter’s legs.  “If he ever comes down here, I’ll break his f****** legs.” Thomas blasted, adding, “And you can quote me on that.” Mr Markle has taunted the Royal family saying he will never shut up until they talk to him reneging on recent claims he had given his “last interview”. The Duchess of Sussex has not spoken to her father since May. It comes after Mr Markle failed to attend her wedding due to suffering heart palpitations after he was exposed for staging pictures with a British paparazzi before the ceremony. He had been due to walk Meghan down the aisle at Windsor Castle but was forced to cancel after he said doctors told him he was unfit to travel. Instead, he watched the ceremony on a television in an Air BnB he rented close to his home in Rosarito, Mexico.

Mum-of-two Leanne Short was mortied when she looked in the mirror and realised the epic mistake. She was horried to discover her skin had been dyed scarlet after her little girl Rosie, nine, coated her entire face in the long lasting bright red lip stain from Primark. The -year-old says her bathroom looked like a murder scene and she spent hours trying to scrub the red makeup off her face - leaving handprints all over her bath and shower. Rosie had begged Leanne to allow her to give her a pre-Halloween makeover and the the doting mum couldnt resist her daughters pleas.  Cheeky Rosie first intended to transform her mum into a clown - but was so surprised at how well the red paint was working she changed her mind and coloured in her whole face to make her a lobster instead. Leanne suspected something was wrong when her skin started to tingle and burn - and quickly realised the little girls error. Despite Leanne spending hours failing to scrub away the lip stain with water, makeup remover, baking soda and even vinegar, Rosie thought her mums new look was hilarious. But the mix-up meant red-faced Leanne spent two days having to sport her unfortunate new look in public - leaving her feeling like a social leper. Leanne, from Wakefield, Yorkshire, said: It was a genuine mistake - I think.  The other items she used are just sticks of face paint wax and she just picked up the lip stain.She said to me can I decorate you and see what youd look like for Halloween   Weve got some Halloween makeup pens and ious bits and I said yes.It was actually a lipstick Id got in Primark, a red lip stain, and it was in my makeup bag. I dont knowit fell out of my makeup bag into the other stuff but she picked it up. She said oh Ill make you red. She had said she was giving me clown lips to turn me into a clown but then she said Ill do the whole face. I just sat there and she said do a selfie. Shed done it on my lips and I was thinking it was looking terrible because I was in my pyjamas. She was really proud, which is why in the selfies shes got her thumbs up and things. I was just thinking Im glad youre happy. That Halloween stuff just washes off but when it started tingling and burning and thats when I realised it wasnt right. I was just thinking oh no.  I said show me that Halloween stuff youre using. And thats when I realised it was lip stain. When I couldnt get it off and it was burning she was saying oh mum, Im sorry!, but then when I was scrubbing she was wetting herself. She thought it was so funny. She thought it was hilarious. She just said youre going to have to take me to school looking like that, Im so embarrassed. But she did that to me! She thought it was so funny. It took hours and hours to get off. It was in my eyebrow hair, my hairline. It faded on my face after about two days. When I washed it it smudged, so as I washed it off it was on my face and dripped down the skin onto my neck. As I was trying to scrub it off it just ran down my neck and onto my chests. It ran all down my hands. The more I was scrubbing it the worse I was making it. It looked like a murder scene or something because there were just red handprints everywhere. I had to use bleach [on the tiles] to scrub that off because it had all gone into the grouting.  There were handprints on the white bath and on the shower. It spread everywhere. That would have been good for Halloween because it looked like a crime scene. The family love Halloween and have a big party planned featuring a big dinner of gory food and plenty of costumes. But after her ordeal earlier this year Leanne has sworn not to let Rosie come near her with makeup again. Leanne, a stay-at-home-mum, said: This Halloween I will be making sure shes not doing anything on me at all. Ive got an outfit and a dress and Ill paint my face - yes, I will paint my face, not Rosie - with the correct stuff. I had to take her to school so I had to brush my hair down so you couldnt see how red it was in my hair. That was quite bad. When I covered it up with foundation it wasnt as bad on my face but it looked like I had red lines all through my eyebrows and in my hairline and that took five or six days to go. I had to take her to school and pick her up from school and go shopping and do all the normal things I usually do.

This is why this wedding is so beautul - it’s hope for other children suffering from scoliosis.

The Queens granddaughter spoke of the importance of showing people your scars as she paid tribute to the hospital which performed surgery on her back as a child. Eugenie was diagnosed with scoliosis, a condition in which a persons spine is curved, when she was just  years old.  She underwent surgery at the Royal National Orthopedic Hospitalin , and had two  inch titanium rods placed in her back. The procedure took eight hours, and Eugenie was in intensive care for three days afterwards. She then spent a further week in the hospital before being discharged. She made a full recovery, and is not expected to need any more surgery for the condition. Eugenies mother Sarah Ferguson revealed doctor Jan Lehovsky, who performed the surgery, will attend the royal wedding along with other NHS staff.Ahead of her big day, Eugenie reflected on the surgery and the importance of the charity during an interview with ITVs This Morning.  She told host Eamonn Holmes: Im patron of their appeal and I had an operation when I was  on my back, and youll see on Friday, but its a lovely way to honour the people who looked after me and a way of standing up for young people who also go through this. I think you can change the way beauty is, and you can show people your scars and I think its really special to stand up for that. So thats one really important one. But separate to that, other organisations that are there, its just very important that they get a chance to be honoured for the work that they do constantly, so its lovely that I can share this special day with them.  The princess is also patron of the European School of Osteopathy, a world-renowned provider of undergraduate and postgraduate level osteopathic education. Punters are making a last-minute gamble on Suzannah or Stella McCartney being the designer behind Princess Eugenies gown. Erdem remains the favourite at the bookmakers at  , but Ladbrokes said there has been a flurry of bets for British design brand Suzannah, with odds cut from   to  . Meanwhile, Paddy Power has suspended betting on Eugenie wearing Stella McCartney after a flood of bets.  Suzannah was founded by Suzannah Crabb and is known for creating wedding dresses with vintage charm and a modern edge. McCartney designed the halter neck gown Meghan wore to her evening wedding party. A Paddy Power spokesman said: Weve seen a lot of action on Stella McCartney to be the designer of Princess Eugenies wedding dress this morning, forcing us to stop taking bets. The level of wagers could indicate insider knowledge, and the brand seems a good fit for the day with their positive environmental standpoint. Jenny Packham is at   with Ladbrokes, Preen is   and Suzanne Neville is  . Jessica Bridge of Ladbrokes said: We know Princess Eugenies flying the flag for British designers, and punters are beginning to wonderan upset could be on the cards for the likes of Suzannah or Preen, leaving Erdem to miss out on the big day.  Eugenie has already revealed she has chosen a British-based designer, and that she was set on the style she wanted from the start of her wedding planning.is the one thing that I was really decisive about, the princess told British Vogue magazine. As soon as we announced the wedding, I knew the designer, and the look, straight away. I never thought Id be the one who knew exactly what I like, but Ive been pretty on top of it.

The -year-old skipped university to throw himself into the hospitality industry after leaving Stowe School in Buckinghamshire, where fees are pound, a term. And the risk paid off - he has enjoyed a meteoric rise through the hospitality ranks at London’s swankiest bars and restaurants. After starting out in pubs, he was soon snapped up for roles at Mayfair hotspots Mahiki and Peyote, before landing a job at Cha’s Tonteria with the help of Guy Pelly - businessman and close personal friend of Princes William and Harry.  In a statement, Jack said that “he is in charge of choosing drinks” and that a selection of bespoke Casamigos cocktails have been created for the event and will be served to guests throughout the wedding weekend. His experience and connections will no doubt help him in latest role, as ‘European brand manager’ at George Clooney founded Casamigos Tequila, where he promotes the brand at top hotels and private clubs. Casamigos Tequila was founded by Hollywood actor Clooney, along with supermodel Cindy Crawford’s husband Rande Gerber and actor Mike Meldman. It was sold to drinks giant Diageo for billion in June last year.  Traditionally, a brand ambassador promotes a company with potential customers or clients. This will often involve monitoring the brand’s image and marketing, as well as maintaining relationships with key accounts. In his latest role as a European brand manager, it is likely Jack will be responsible for the overall image of the tequila brand including market analysis, marketing strategies and promotional activities.

Environmental health officers from Leicester City Council shut down Toros Express on Monday after an inspection following anonymous complaints about rodent activity at the store.

He told the citys magistrates court: “Our officers visited the premises at .am on Monday and what they found led them to close the business down immediately.  “They deemed the business posed a serious risk to the health of the public.” Elizabeth Johnson, an environmental health officer at Leicester City Council, said she visited Toros Express and carried out an inspection. She said: “I was quite shocked. Rodent activity was quite extensive. “In the preparation area we found droppings under all the equipment. We found cardboard had been laid on the floor under all this equipment.  “As well as congealed grease it was stained with what appeared to be mice urine as well as mouse droppings, fruit flies and maggot cases. “Under an oven I noted a kne had been dropped. A mouse dropping was stuck on the blade. “There was extensive evidence of mouse activity throughout the premises, as well as very poor standards of cleanliness and actual contaminated food. “Pest control was not effective. The amount of dirt and food debris on the floor meant that mice would have plenty of food to feed on in preference to eating any poisoned bait laid down.  “In my professional opinion, the premises were unsanitary and warranted immediate legal action. We closed it immediately.” Ms Johnson said she spoke to Rafiq Yusuf – the food business operator who had taken over the takeaway in February this year. She said she told Mr Yusuf about the court date and advised him about cleaning that needed to be done at the takeaway. Ms Johnson said she had visited Toros Express at am on Wednesday morning and noted improved cleaning but saw fresh mouse droppings.  The health official handed the magistrates bench an exhibit of a lettuce from the food storage area of the takeaway which had been gnawed by mice. The lettuce, in a clear plastic bag, was passed around the courtroom. Chairwoman of the bench Fiona Tee-Boon granted the Hygiene Emergency Prevention Order.

Dibsy admits it’s a case of “le or death” after a health scare.  Now he’s embarking on a fitness journey with personal trainer Mike, from Mas Body Gym, who’s chosen to train him for free. “The doctors have said keep going like you are going and you won’t be around for very much longer,” Dibsy told Teesside Live. “I just want to be healthy so I can go out on a run and live my le, go to the Boro match, go out with the lads.” One of the places Dibsy has been known to turn to is his local takeaway.

Do not serve this man.” Mike explained that the leaflets aren’t about banning his client from takeaways - he will be allowed treats - but more about breaking him out of an addiction to food. “The next six or seven weeks is going to get dficult for Dibsy,” Mike said.  “What I want Dibsy to do is come to me for support and advice - he’s used to turning to takeaways.” He added that the leaflets are purely for takeaway staff and not the general public.

A conversation with Dibsy and his mum followed. “His mum burst out crying and said no parent would want to bury her child,” Mike said.

She said it was intently staring straight at her from the dressing table. Despite being numb with fear and shock, Ashleigh sprinted to her parents bedroom for help and they then wasted no time calling a local snake catcher to come to the rescue.  Ashleigh said: I was fast asleep in my bed. I had no idea what was going on. I quickly jumped out of bed and turned on the light to see what had happened. I saw that my pot plant had fallen to the floor but couldnt understand why. It made no sense, but then I saw something move. At first, I was overwhelmed with shock and was half-asleep, so didnt really understanding what I was looking at. I thought I must have been dreaming.  But then it hit me. There was this massive python staring right at me from my dressing table. I was totally frozen. I couldnt believe what I was seeing. I quickly ran into my parents room and just yelled out that there was a snake in my room. They jumped out of bed and came to see what I was talking about. They were in total disbelief. We all were. We tried to call some friends of ours to help, but none of them would pick up as it was the middle of the night. So we called a local snake catcher who thankfully, came within  minutes.  We were so happy when he arrived. He was really excited about the whole thing. We didnt know how the snake got in, but we think it may have slithered in during the day and was hiding under my bed. Its so scary to think it could have been in my room for days without me knowing. Snake catcher Tony Morrison, , said he was more than happy to come and help the family and said it was lucky the snake decided not to climb up on Ashleighs bed. While non-venomous, carpet pythons can grow up to four metres in . Tony added that Australia is coming into snake season as the weather heats up and said lately he was getting called out three or four times a day to remove snakes from houses, schools and workplaces.

The Students Union at Cambridge University were approached to do more to promote Remembrance Day this year, which is the centenary anniversary of the end of the First World War in . A motion was put forward which aimed to “ensure that Remembrance Day becomes a well-established and well-marked event across the university”. But the motion, put forward by two members of the university’s Conservative Association , was rejected in favour of plans put forward by a student activist.  Stella Swain said organisations should “reshape remembrance away from glorication and valorisation of war” and campaign “against militarisation”. Cambridgeshire Mayor James Palmer said the decision brought “great shame” to the city and shows “disdain” for the Armed Forces. Miss Swain said “all lives lost and affected by war” should be commemorated, and any mention of British war veterans, Remembrance Day or poppies, was deleted from the motion. Mr Palmer told the Daily : “It is something I find dficult to comprehend – that students can’t be grateful and respectful of previous generations and their sacrices.

Theresa May has to take time out from Brexit concessions and order Chancellor Philip Hammond to use the Budget to scrap universal credit or replace it with a fair system which helps, not harms, working-class people. Former Tory PM John Major was right to echo Gordon Brown’s warning that this attack risks repeating the bitter Poll Tax crisis.

Meg’s burden The admission by Meghan Markle’s father that he snorted cocaine while raising her isn’t exactly what the Royal Family will have wanted on the morning of a wedding. The most traditional of our institutions must be struggling to come to terms with the relatives of Prince Harry’s US bride. However, only the cold hearted would think less of Meghan in light of the revelation. So, hopefully, the couple will take comfort from the enthusiastic crowds greeting them. They perform official duties – unlike Princess Eugenie and her tequila ambassador husband-to-be who will lumber taxpayers with a hefty bill for today’s extravagant wedding.

Data scientists pinpointed the B from Cheddar to Ashwick, which meanders through the rolling Mendip Hills as the most pleasant to cruise along. Second is Forres to Alford, in Scotland, a stunning -mile drive through the Cairngorms National Park with the A, from Moffat towards Edinburgh, Scotland, in third. Experts used key criteria to judge roads including scenery, how close they are to points of interest, and which ones offer optimal driving conditions, before announcing their top . They also looked at how many ‘engaging’ corners would be encountered, levels of traffic and sites with low incident reports to compile the detailed list.  The research was created by Volkswagen in collaboration with traffic and navigation app Waze, to support Volkswagen’s ‘GTI Superdrives’ programme within the app. Taking fourth spot is the A, also known as the Black Mountain Road, which takes in the stunning scenery of the Brecon Beacons in Wales. Making up the top five is the A near Glencoe in the Scottish Highlands.  The Hardknott Pass, a winding single track road in the Lake District which is thought to be the steepest road in England, is number nine on the list. The GTI Superdriveswithin Waze lets drivers know when they’re coming close to one of the roads on the list via a GTI badge popping up when the app is active. If they are within  miles of a GTI Superdrive road, motorists are able to tap on the badge to receive directions to it.  Alison Jones, Director of Volkswagen UK, said: “Our GTI badge quite simply stands for driving joy. “Working with Waze, we wanted to offer more drivers the chance to get off the often congested ‘beaten track’ and instead experience the simple pleasure of driving once more. “The aim, very clearly, is about enjoying time behind the wheel – not speeding or driving in a way that increases risk – and we believe that the intelligence of the Waze app helps drivers do just that.” "},{"url":null,"title":"australian raf plane flew close","story":"NewsAustralian RAF plane flew so close to city skyscrapers terried office workers feared another  The flyby was part of Brisbanes Riverfire event at the citys South Bank, which takes place each year to celebrate the end of Queenslands three-week arts festivalShareCommentsByKelly-Ann Mills:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT Newsthis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news weird-news video near-misses-caused-by-planes-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA terrying display by the Australian air force has been slammed as dangerous and stupid after a war plane flew just feet away from a citys skyscrapers.

so important as part of this process that those women who have been subjected to female genital mutilation have the chance to shape this bill.“There is so much shame and stigma around this topic that many women never speak about it, but it has a horrendous effect on their physical and mental health for the rest of their lives.“The concept has a cloak of secrecy around it and we may never know its

Saturday’s controversial clash with Kilmarnock despite having strong family connections with the Ayrshire club.McLean blundered by awarding the second-half penalty that saw Killie take the three

.To add to the conspiracy theories, for  years he was a team-mate of Paul Clarke – brother of their current boss Steve.The pair even appeared on the same sticker in an edition of the annual Panini

sense behind having McLean taking games involving Kilmarnock.“Several of our members have contacted me to express their concerns over this and we think it’s only right to pass them on to the authorities,” said DSA chairman Kenny Ross.“And I do think there is reason to question the validity of this appointment when the referee so clearly has family connections to Kilmarnock.“If nothing  it puts him in a dficult position when you get a decision like Saturday’s.“I know that Steven McLean’s brother Brian played for Dundee United, Ross County and a few other clubs and he was not allowed to take charge of games involving teams he was at.“You think the same common sense approach could have been applied to his dad’s old team.”The fans also pointed out should the Killie player who ed to win

What’s more, eventhey don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in , a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now,  years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 37","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Sir,It is always a delight when a letter awakens a landowner.James F Lithgow#s insult about ‘blow-ins’ is a typical trait. I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

Torrential rain did not dampen spirits or performances and once again the organisers upheld their reputation as a sporting event that promotes local community participation balanced with fierce and friendly sporting competition to attract some of the best triathletes from across Scotland. Affiliated to Tri-Scotland, the national body for triathlon in Scotland, the event is now a regular fixture on the national event calendar.It was not a day for personal bests being set, but all athletes exceeded their expectations spurred on by tremendous support from friends, families and club mates adding to the atmosphere.The winners of the inidual event were:MMale Senior st male # Craig Ross of the Glasgow Tri Club: ::Female Senior st female –Lucy Fraser ::Female Veteran – Louise Ross of Glasgow Tri Club ::Male Veteran – Mike Donaldson of Glasgow Tri Club :..Male Super Vet – Alasdair Ireland – ::Female Super Vet – Maggie Darroch of Glasgow Tri Club ::Male Vintage – Alan Duff of Glasgow Tri Club – ::Female Vintage– Sue Allen of Mid Argyll Tri Club ::Male Super Vintage– Douglas Wood of Stirling Tri Club ::st Mid Argyll Female Finisher – Kirsty Duff, Bridgend ::st Mid Argyll Male Finisher – John Anderson, Kilmartin ::The winner of the adult team category was Glasgow University Dream Team with a time of  hour  minutes and  seconds and or the junior teams the winner was BFG Lochgilphead made up of Felix Maddox, Gregor McGeachy and Ben Smith.In the inidual race categories there were some great performances. Mid Argyll Triathlon Club’s Sue Allen in the vintage categoryput in superb performances to dominate this category. This was a complete performance by Sue which saw her retain her title for the third year in succession. In second place was Gillian Kennedy of Perth Triathlon Club and in third place was Marjorie Leighton of the Mid Argyll Tri Club.Doug Wood in the super vintage + age group and won by over  minutes from his nearest rival with his cycle over the -mile course being very impressive.In the male vintage raceAlan Duffs performance particularly in the bike and run was very strong rewarding his impressive consistency with the win.The accolade for being the fastest male and female triathlete in the race was also clearly going to be very tightly fought contest.The stand out performance on the day was from Lucy Fraser, the fastest lady and first senior. Lucy had the third fastest swim at  minutes and  seconds, she then pulled away on the bike from Kathryn Grfin in second place by a powerful display of cycling, which gave her a lead of four minutes heading into the run. In fact she only lost one minute to Kathryn on the run to win by nearly three minutes.The fastest male triathlete on the day was Mike Donaldson in the + veteran category, holding off the youngsters to be the overall winner in the male race by  seconds. His faster swim and bike and very solid run over the four-mile distance saw him hold off Craig Ross who recorded the fastest run of the day of  minutes  seconds to take the overall title.The remaining age group category competition between the clubs was spiced up with lots of banter and friendly, fierce rivalry.In the Super Veteran Male Category , Alasdair Ireland had a very impressive performance across all three disciplines of the triathlon, recording the fastest swim, bike and run to win. There was a closer battle for second and third place with John Anderson, Phil Dye and Sandy Ross swapping positions in the swim, bike and run. However, Mid Argyll Tri club John managed to get a lead at the end of the bike and a fast transition saw him record a  minute  second run being  seconds quicker then Phil Dye and  seconds than Sandy to claim second place.The female Super Veteranfemale category was similar to the men with Maggie Darroch from Glasgow Tri Club being fastest in the swim, bike and run to win by an impressive margin of just over nine minutes, improving her position of second place from last year. Melanie Peacock-Chimelewska of Mid Argyll Tri Club was second with her excellent swim proving the dference over Elaine Crichton in third.The female veterancategory saw Sarah Grfin of Mid Argyll Tri and Cycle club fastest in the swim and out on the bike, but a very strong bike and a phenomenal run of Louise Ross of Glasgow Tri meant she took the win for the second year running, pushing Sarah into second place and Jenner Reid of Campbeltown running club to third.The first place local male and female categories is always a bit of fun with local Mid Argyll Tri and Cycle Club members battling for bragging rights.The first local male triathlete home was John Anderson from Kilmartin with a time of ::, with Colin MacFarlane in second place at :: and Iain MacNicol in third place ::. All three are members of the Mid Argyll Triathlon and Cycle club.The first local female triathlete home was Kirsty Duff at ::, in second place was Sarah Grfin at :: and Louise Gibson at :: in third place.Team EventThe team race is always the first heat away and this year there were  teams battling for the podium and hearing the starting air horn and whistles from the pool the excitement soon built for the team cyclists. There was some great rivalry banter between the relay team members as they eagerly looked forward to the relay change.This was the year of the youngsters as Glasgow University Triathlon club came with two teams and had clearly come with intent of winning the race. First out of the water with the fastest swim of the day was Glasgow Uni Dream Team with a blisteringly quick time of  minutes  seconds, followed only  seconds back by Glasgow Uni Freshers Team and only one second behind Team BFG .Well there was certainly nothing separating the top three teams at the end of the bike as they all came in virtually together with only  seconds separating them. It was all down to the run and the Glasgow Uni Dream Team pulled out the second quickest run of the day to win the by three minutes, from the Glasgow Uni Freshers team with the BFG our local junior team in third.The BFG team made up of Felix Maddox, Gregor McGeachy and Ben Smith took the junior trophy and can be rightfully proud of their overall performance in the competition.The team’s competition always provides a great balance between the spice of competition and the balance of having great fun and allowing everyone to participate across the three disciplines. This is best epitomised in the team names, reflecting not only who they were representing but also good humour. Teams included: ‘No Direction ., ‘Splash Flash and Dash’, ‘Ormsary Orbits’, ‘ Years On’, ‘Coia and Associates’, ‘HIE Tri-ers’, ‘Yes Lube’, ‘Team Try-Athletes’ and ‘Sepa Mums’.Thanks, and FeedbackMid Argyll Triathlon club once again appreciated all the many words of thanks and praise from competitors to the organisers, marshals and volunteers for the event, its organisation and smooth running, the great goodie bags, medals and sports performance T-shirt provided by our sponsors, without which the triathlon could not happen.Karen Graham said: ‘Love it!

It means the state-of-the-art school is well on track for opening its doors to pupils and staff in October . Built in the grounds of the existing academy, the new school is keenly anticipated as it’s set to not only transform learning and teaching, but will also signicantly enhance facilities for the local community. The new building will have space for up to  young people, with modern classrooms, massive games hall, two all-weather pitches, games courts and a host of other exciting facilities which are sure to impress pupils, staff and the wider public. Kier Construction is building the school, which is being delivered by South Ayrshire Council in partnership with hub South West. The project is part of a poundmillion programme of works delivered across South Ayrshire with the aim of boosting education standards through targeted investment in schools and communities. Councillor Peter Henderson, the council’s resources and performance portfolio holder, said: “Our new, extended and refurbished schools are completely transforming learning across South Ayrshire and the new Queen Margaret Academy is shaping up to do more of the same. We’re committed to creating modern learning environments that not only inspire children and young people, but provide an important hub and network for the local community. “We want those attending our schools to achieve their full potential when they move on from school and our focus on providing the best education possible, with the best facilities, means we are on our way to achieving this ambition. “Our schools always play a key role in local le so we’re ensuring that their excellent sports facilities can be accessed by the wider public. We also ensure there are areas of our schools that can be used by community groups and the new Queen Margaret Academy will be no dferent.” Michael McBrearty, chief executive of delivery partner, hub South West Scotland, said: “The new school will be a fantastic contemporary and innovative learning environment that will create an abundance of opportunities and benefits to the entire community.” Brian McQuade, managing director of Kier Construction Scotland  north-east England, said: “Up to  people have been on site during peak periods of activity and to date we have created one apprenticeship, seven work placements and three student summer intern placements. This has provided young local talent the opportunity to gain valuable experience working on a state-of-the-art building and a unique insight into the built environment and the erse range of roles available.” Oonagh Browne headteacher at Queen Margaret Academy said: “It’s exciting to see our new school taking shape. Parents, young people and staff were crucial in planning the facilities for our new school, so it’s very much their project and this only increases their anticipation”. The Bishop of Galloway, Right Reverend William Nolan said: “While the ground works were taking place little seemed to be happening on site but in recent months the structure of the building has sprung up, giving a sense of excitement and anticipation as we look forward to the completion next year of a centre of learning that will inspire our young people.” When the new school opens, the old building will be demolished and the site fully landscaped.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilEducationSchoolsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"60k christmas lights up grabs","story":"Alexandra McCready switches on the lights with the help of the cast of the Ayr Gaiety pantomime Cinderella.\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA pound, Christmas lights fund is up for grabs in villages and towns needing an illumination boost. But where the cash goes will be decided by South Ayrshire council officials depending on the needs of dferent areas. The move was approved at the full council meeting last week after a heated clash between rival councillors. Councillor Hugh Hunter put forward a motion for pound, cash to be distributed with a maximum of pound going to each town and pound for villages. He said communities faced a major challenge to raise money for lights. He said the council’s “huge” underspend should be used to pay for the festive displays. But his seasonal gesture was snubbed by ruling councillors who backed an amendment from Councillor Alec Clark to make pound, available instead. Independent Councillor Clark said: “We will try and bring some joy into people’s lives.” His amendment said: “With this fund it is important that the funding does not supplant or compete with the work that has been taking place over a number of years.” Conservative Councillor Hunter questioned how communities were supposed to apply for the cash but was told there wouldn’t be an application process. Labour Councillor Brian McGinley said: “There has been an issue with Christmas lights over a number of years.” He added: “We don’t want to undo the good work already going on in the community.” Responding to probes from the conservative opposition, he said: “We will talk to people about the current arrangements and do what we can.” Councillor Hunter said: “I can’t support the amendment. I ask councillors to support the clear motion.” Speaking after the meeting, Councillor Hunter said: “It wasn’t clear how communities could access it. It is really foggy and disappointing that we couldn’t get to the bottom of it.” Councillor Bob Pollock said he is concerned “some areas may miss out.” He said there was “no coherent explanation” on how the money would be “decided or managed” with only six weeks left until switch on. In a press release Councillor McGinley said: “We obviously have a finite amount of resources, so we know that we won’t be able to do everything that communities want right away, but it’s a terric starting point that will support people and places right across South Ayrshire at this special time of year.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnLabour PartySouth Ayrshire CouncilChristmasAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"ayrshire student launches campaign against","story":"NewsAyrshire student launches campaign against spikingCara’s drive to keep young women safer when they’re out on the town.ShareByPippa Smith:,  OCT NewsCara Taven has launched a Facebook page named Girls Against Spiking. \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA campaign has been set up to raise awareness of people having their drinks spiked.

She said: “I have heard a lot about people getting spiked recently, in my local area and in the Glasgow region, and I know that a lot of people in Ayr do go out in Glasgow. “It tends to be younger girls about my age that get affected by spiking and that was something I have really started to think about. “This is something that could happen to anyone. “I’m a law student and the reason why I wanted to study law was to represent people who maybe don’t have the confidence to represent themselves and to make a dference that way and I think that is where getting the idea to make the page has come from. “I honestly thought it would be a page where the girls at my work could like – I am surprised by the response. “I remember saying to someone at work ‘If you like the page it’ll take me to  likes’ – then when I woke up in the morning and it was . “I haven’t been affected by spiking – it’s not really about me or anyone that I know.

Arnold Clark took the decision to shut the twin showrooms and workshops in the town’s Lochside. The big transporters moved in to clear the stock and the famous yellow signage was quickly taken down. The old premises in Galloway Avenue sold cars for generations and was probably best known as the home of Robert McCall Fiat and Alfa Romeo. But being stuck in the middle of housing, the old showroom has now outlived its time.. Arnold bought the dealership from Robert McCall and latterly operated a Fiat franchise. It also had the Jeep franchise for Ayr before it moved to Border Cars. The McCall family ran it for decades and built a reputation for fine service. Bob McCall began selling cars in  and had a series of franchises including Jaguar. His son Robert then took over the running of the business and was very successful selling Fiats and Alfas. Robert’s cousin Peter McCall was actually born in the house on the site that was converted into part of the garage. Customers in Galloway Avenue have been told all servicing work is going to the Ford workshop in Prestwick Road. Arnold Clark also runs separate Toyota, Vauxhall and Peugeot franchises in the town as well as a car and van hire centre. A long-time customer in Galloway Avenue said: “It is a real shame, but I guess dealerships want to be on busy roads in more modern buildings. Sadly Galloway Avenue would have needed a lot of investment and a member of staff said it simply was not in the right location any more. “Staff think the site could be flattened or put to another vehicle use.” Arnold Clark was unavailable for comment as we reached our deadline.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrAyr NewsMotoring NewsAlfa RomeoFiatJaguarJeepPeugeotFishingPrestwickGalloway"},{"url":null,"title":"gymnastics club tries takeover council","story":"NewsGymnastics club tries to takeover council activity centre in TroonMuirhead Activity Centre is the target of Dundonald Gymnastics ClubShareByStephen Houston:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT News\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA plan by a gymnastics club to take over Muirhead Activity Centre has met hostility. Secret talks have been taking place since the summer but have only just surfaced. Dundonald Gymnastics Club is ready to take control and turn the popular sports hall into a specialist centre. It would mean no more sports lets of the main hall for football, badminton and handball, the squash court would shut and the property would be shted from South Ayrshire Council ownership. Muirhead Residents and Tenants Association fired the first warning shot over the takeover. Chairman Frances Carson said: “The answer is no. If the council have pulled a fly one over this then they will never hear the end of it from this community.” Scott Telford, head coach of the gymnastics club, promised this week he will speak to the community about his ambitious plans. But Tory councillor Peter Convery slammed the secrecy, saying: “This came out of the blue to all the councillors and community and is an utter disgrace. “People at a meeting on Friday night were flabbergasted the hall could be taken out of council ownership. “The acid on the cake is the council has been speaking to the group without anyone knowing. “The council should not be treating its citizens this way.” Scott Telford said he has a full business plan for the centre and believes it can work. The club has  members and a waiting list of  more. He said the club have restricted facilities at their present base Dundonald Activity Centre, where five adults spend hours setting out and dismantling equipment. As a result they cannot develop youngsters to elite performance level and lose talented performers at an early age. Former top gymnast Scott, who lives in Muirhead, said: “The community will still get use of the centre for things like meetings and birthday parties and we would look to develop that. “There will also be the chance for the community to take part in gymnastics. “I appreciate people don’t like change but we can make this work. We could even look at parkour gymnastic sessions with teenagers on Friday night. “There is also a lot of outdoor space which we could change for other activities, depending on what the community want.” The dad first started helping at Dundonald when there were only  kids and ten mats. He added: “At the moment we get about  inquiries a week and just cannot cope. “I want to work with the Muirhead Residents and Tenants Association and want to hear all views. “We will be running a seven-day-a-week facility but it has to be financially sustainable and work with the community.” Councillor Craig Mackay said he wants full transparency when consultation starts. He said: “The onus will be on the gymnastics club to demonstrate the wider support of the community. “I am relaxed about the process and will very much wish to take on board the community’s views on this once we know the details of what is proposed. “I am concerned about how any potential transfer would impact on the use of the centre by the wide range of groups who currently use it. “The centre currently runs at a small but manageable loss and in my view any decision must be made on what is best for the community and not on the very minimal cost savings.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrAyr NewsGymnasticsSouth Ayrshire CouncilBadmintonTroonDundonald"},{"url":null,"title":"shops replace homes new ayr","story":"NewsShops to replace homes in new Ayr town centre regeneration plansPeople to have their say on radical proposalsShareBySarah Hilley:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT News\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailShops are to be replaced with homes in Ayr town centreradical new plans get the go-ahead. Proposals also include the High Street being coated with a new easy clean surface and bins being kept out of site. A great shop clearance has been proposed to regenerate the ailing shopping strip. South Ayrshire Council wants empty retail units to become homes at the bottom of the town. Council leader Douglas Campbell said: “Internet shopping has signicantly altered the landscape in the town. “We need people back staying in the towns.” SNP Councillor Campbell took to his feet at week’s full council meeting to talk through the complete overhaul of the town centre. Conservative Councillor Ian Davis askedshop owners would be consultedthey are forced to move. He said: “This could mean some businesses will have to move. I want reassurances for businesses thatan area is to be reused for a dferent purpose that they are well consulted.” The meeting heard businesses would be consulted. The cleared Riverside block, which included Woolworths, would become a public square. The original proposal for a huge office block has been shelved. Commenting on the cleared site, Councillor Campbell said: “None of us expected the vista.” But he conceded how homes of some description could be erected on the site. He said: “Some sort of building on the site will be necessary.” A report submitted to council said: “There will also be the potential for a small number of residential units on the Riverside sitethis proves desirable through the public consultation exercise.” Council staff from soon-to-be demolished Burns House are likely to move into the Clydesdale Bank Building, the Town Hall and County Buildings instead. The Citadel is to be replaced with a brand new state-of-the art leisure centre on the High Street. A new streetscape surface could also be on the way. Councillor Campbell said: “If we are going to revamp the High Street we need to do it in a signicant way to keep it tidy. “During the main shopping times all the bins should be off the street. We need to present the High Street well. “We need to move the bus stops away from the Clydesdale Bank building.” Conservative opposition councillor Hugh Hunter got to his feet to “welcome” the report. He said: “It would be spectacular for the administrationthey could pull it off.” He called for a park like Belleisle to be built at the Riverside. SNP councillor Siobhian Brown said she welcomed the report but said morale of the community was “on its knees.” All plans will be issued for public consultation.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnClydesdale BankScottish National PartySouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"slow progress new troon mega","story":"NewsSlow progress for new Troon mega surgeryBut work on Templehill expansion should start next yearShareByStephen Houston:,  OCT News\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailNational Health top brass have been summoned to Troon to explain what is happening to expansion plans at the town’s mega surgery. Members of the public spoke at last week’s Troon Community Council –asking why there has been no obvious progress at the Templehill Surgery in nearly six month. The surgery swallowed most of the collapsed  Medical Practice, re-opening with , patients at the end of April. The Community Council has asked an NHS representative to attend their meeting next month. When Templehill took over they were to be handed around pound, by NHS Ayrshire  Arran for an extension. And partner Robbie Cumming said then it was still to be agreed wether to use a ready-made modular building or a traditional build at the back. At the time he said: “We intend to expand and develop our current premises with the addition of two or three consulting rooms, disabled access doors and a larger reception area.” A planning application has been lodged but it has not even been “validated” yet by South Ayrshire Council. Councillor Craig Mckay has quizzed Pamela Milliken, head of primary care, on the extension which had been a central plank of the transfer. Councillor Mckay said: “I welcome the Health Board’s comments which suggest that there have been no major issues following the transfers. “This is consistent with my own experience as I’ve received no recent complaints from patients. “It is also reassuring that both recipient practices have been reviewing patient records and inviting patients to attend for review appointments. “I hope this will ensure that those who were moved will continue to receive the level of care they deserve. “On the extension to the Templehill surgery, the planning application has recently been submitted but not yet validated. ““Clearly it is in the interests of all patients of that practice that the required expansion takes place, and I note that subject to there being no planning issues, work is expected to begin on site in the new year. “The extension was central to the arguments made when  Medical Practice closed, and the ball is now firmly in the Surgery’s court to deliver on this commitment.” Councillor Bob Pollock agreed the actual transition process seemed to have gone well and said: “None of the Troon Councillors have received any complaints following the merger of the surgeries, butthere are any, they should get in touch.” Ms Milliken said: “Planning permission for the work was submitted to South Ayrshire Council on Friday September . The practice is optimistic that works will commence in early Januaryplanning permission is granted.” In other NHS news, it is understood community midwives have had to change their base from the Barassie Street clinic to Prestwick. One source said: “All that is left at Barassie Street seems to be podiatry. “The community nurses have to start their sht in Prestwick before coming to Troon for their first appointment.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnTroonNHS ScotlandAyrAyr News"},{"url":null,"title":"entertainment-in-the-dock-at-scotts-selkirk","story":"SELKIRK is set for a treble turn of tourist delights this weekend.Not only is the hugely popular Scotts Selkirk ing to the Royal Burgh on Saturday, but the town will also host the foot-tapping delights of the Selkirk Sessions as well as the new monthly Farmers Market.The busy weekend comes just as the new-look Market Place refurbishments are completed.Viv Ross from Scotts Selkirk told us: \"A busy weekend is in store ndash with something for everyone.\"We look forward to welcoming everyone to our annual celebrations.\"Dozens of Souters will turn back the clock to relive the days of Scott.As well as re-enactments, period costumes and fayre from centuries gone, there will be plenty of street entertainment throughout Scotts Selkirk.Meg Dodsrsquo ever-popular Kitchen has been relocated to the High Street.The music and puppets of Crafty Beggars will share the town centre with Les Amies drsquoOnos Billy Bowler the Performing Goat.And there will be plenty Victorian childrenrsquos games, including Splat the Rat and a coconut shy, to keep the youngsters entertained.Matthew Burgess has taken over the role of Town Cryer from his late father Bob.And he will be accompanied by young drummer boys Hamish and Cameron throughout his duties.George Renton will ride into town with his penny-farthing.And this year there will also be a Scottrsquos Selkirk shop window treasure hunt ndash with forms available from the Scottrsquos Selkirk Shop.This year Sir Walter Scott will be presiding over The Tall Tale of the Tushielaw Trout, and the Lady Varnishes in his Courtroom.Down below the Courthouse Gael Force, Carlenjig, The Bogie Close Stompers, Highline Fiddlers, Bob Liddle and the Riddell Fiddles will all adorn the stage at some point during the packed programme.Viv added: \"We are really looking forward to the open mic sessions where we will no doubt be treated to some exceptional music.\"There will also be a host of talented buskers in both the Market Place and the High Street to add to the entertainment.\"As well as Scotts Selkirk, the Farmers Market will operate on Saturday and throughout the weekend -

team and heard directly about their concerns.I have also contacted Argyll and Bute Council#s planning department numerous times, and, on September , I spoke with James Macintyre of Macleod Construction and made my views very clear on this matter.The potential new G pitch and footpath are much needed and more than welcome.That said there have clearly been large failings in the consultation process and this must not happen in future.In order to find the best way forward MacLeods will need to move rugby posts to new positions, using new sleeves and with an Islay Rugby presence during the operation.Leveling off of the west side of the pitch must be carried out using good soil with a view to extending the level pitch by several meters.Material for a ryelock fence should be provided by MacLeods and or others, and permissions given for construction of a standard fence.This fence should run between the timber fence at the rear of the housing estate and the timber fence at the car park, in a line running along the pitch side edge of the new path across the rugby pitch.This should make the extended area as near dog-free as possible and solve the serious fouling problem which unfortunately continues to exist.Regardless of how many of my fellow Ileachs feel, about where this pathway has been built and the lack of proper communication, the hard working front line workers, of Macleods are only following orders and any hostility directed towards them is unhelpful and unfair.If these changes and additions to the building works are made all parties will be happy and Islay will have a terric rugby pitch.Bowmore locals will have a new foot path and Islay can hopefully look forward to the prospect of a wonderful new G pitch in the future.Despite the upset

It was a lovely calm and sunny day, perfect for filming,I was halfway through the story when a group of local teenage lads approached. It seemed they were drinking and I anticipated them disrupting the filming.But I continued telling the story as it had been a perfect take up until that moment.The lads paused for a moment then all sat on the concrete walkway watching me and the film makers. They said nothing and seemed to be listening.I was able to complete my story uninterrupted.And as I walked away in the final shot I made eye contact with the lads and they respectfully waited until the filming had stopped before shouting, ldquoJohnny Moat forever! Then they got up and walked away.It was an unexpected and powerful moment for me.My assumptions about the lads had been utterly challenged as well.This was more than six years ago but I was reminded of it when I visited Johnny Moat this week with my wee boy Lewis.We were having our weekly storytelling walk in the Pans, a three-hour period between his nursery pick up and when I have to pick up his sister Skye from the Infant School.We just walk together visiting dferent places, and I tell him stories and he does the same.Most of his stories this day involved a T Rex or Raptor, which in his imagination wander about Prestonpans.So our respective tales were a bit dferent in content and style, but what is vital at this age is that he hears stories and is allowed to tell them freely.I told him the story of Johnny Moat and he said it looks like a whale.As we wandered from Johnny Moat up to Preston Tower, we stopped at what we call the lsquoStory Stonesrsquo.Here a small circle of stones sit underneath a cherry tree, with the tower looming behind. It is a perfect place to tell stories.Lewis gave me a new version of his T Rex tale here. I couldnrsquot understand all his story, but I got most of it.Then he said it was my turn so I told him a child-friendly version of the tale of the Green Lady. It made him want to go and look in the windows of the tower, which we did.The final story began at the old doorsquocot in the gardens by the tower. I explained it was a house for pigeons, but Lewis was having none of that.ldquoNo daddy, he said with a serious face, ldquoa lion lives there.ldquoReally  Can you tell me the story of the lion  I asked. And so he obliged.It was a great story, and we tracked the lion to the ancient Mercat Cross, where the unicorn sits on top of the pole ldquolooking for the lion.Then he spotted the lion on the  bus coming from Tranent.ldquoWill it eat the people  I asked.ldquoNo, he said asIrsquod asked an inappropriate question, ldquoitrsquos a nice lion.And so with the lion having left town, we headed for the Infant School to pick up his sister, but still keeping a look out for the T Rex.On the surface this may all seem a bit unusual, wandering about telling random stories that often didnrsquot make huge sense.But I value this time with my son, and as a storyteller I know the importance of it.Storytelling in this way when our kids are young helps develop what is called oral narrative ability, which gives a child the skills to explain and describe things, and develop their understanding of words and language.It fires their imagination and research shows that this can help with the enjoyment of reading and writing later on, and of telling and hearing stories.That night my son unexpectedly ed to the story of Johnny Moat.I had earlier told him it had fallen down and is lying face down in the sand and itrsquos too heavy to put back, but hopefully one day there will be a way.Like all kids his age, he took a while to process his thoughts on this. And these thoughts came out at bedtime.ldquoThe T Rex can put the big stone back, he said. I admired his total faith in the abilities of the T Rex.ldquoYes, maybe, I said. He fell asleep holding his T Rex which, for him, symbolises so much more than just an extinct dinosaur.As I headed downstairs, I thought about the connection between this day and the day over six years ago when I unexpectedly told the story of Johnny Moat to some teenage lads.Stories weave through us and bind us in a shared identity. But it made me sad that Johnny Moat still lies forgotten with his face in the sand.So Irsquom going to start looking for the T Rex of the Pans, whoever that may be, who can help. He or she must be out there somewhere.

For her part, Ms Sturgeon has repeatedly made clear she will not entertain any illegal referendums, not least because Unionists would boycott them, as in Catalonia in .This is not going to change any time soon. In her ldquonow is not the time interview in March , Mrs May gave three reasons for refusing a Section . First, that voters are confused right now second, that a second independence referendum would interfere with negotiations over Brexit and third, that Scots need to know what the future relationship with the EU is going to be before making up their minds about relations with the UK. Ms Sturgeon agrees that the ldquofog of Brexit as she put it yesterday, has to clear before any sensible choice can be made about Scottish independence. That ldquotriple mandate for independence,she won last year is not enough.But will the fog clear  EvenMrs May s with an acceptable exit deal before Christmas, the confusion over Brexit will be far from over. Any deal with Brussels will be limited to the orce bill, EU citizensrsquo rights and the Irish backstopand this will not be the end of Brexit uncertainly. It wonrsquot even be the end of the beginning.The latest version of the Chequers deal,appears to involve the UK remaining in the Customs Union until a ldquofriction-free solution emerges to trade across the Irish border. This is the so-called ldquoblind Brexit under which Britain leaves the EU in March without any clarity about future trading relations. It suits hard Brexiters because once wersquore out, wersquore out.But this half-in-half-out arrangement is not just confined to the transition period, which is supposed to end in . Indeed, it will almost certainly continue after that. My reading of the negotiations is that Britain is heading towards a ldquoSwitzerland minus outcome. The Swiss are not members of the EU, or the EEA or formally the European Single Market. However, they accept all the rules of the ESM on a ldquobilateral basis, meaning that they accept changes as they come along, not en masse, as it were.Itrsquos a fine distinction, and most people agree that Switzerland is in the single market for all intents and purposes. It accepts the four freedoms, including freedom of movement, and largely rubber-stamps rulings of the European Court of Justice. However, it is not actually in the ESM, which makes it Brexit-compliant. Mrs May will try to get a Switzerland-type deal, minus any formal acceptance of freedom of movement. But this will likely be fudged over a y transition in which the destination will be clear, but neither side will openly admit it.Except for Ms Sturgeon, who will want to call a spade a spade. If there is a transition deal that explicitly confirms regulatory alignment for Northern Ireland with the single market ndash which is what the ldquohybrid backstop also seems to involve ndash she will rightly call for Scotland to get parity. The Northern Ireland back-stop is similar to the hybrid arrangement she proposed for Scotland in the Scottish Government White Paper, Scotlandrsquos Place in Europe, back in . .But the downside is that Brussels and the UK could end up with an open-ended transition period in which Britain is out of the European Union, but remains in an uncertain relationship to its institutions. This means Scottish voters could be no clearer on our long-term relations with Europe than they are now. This purgatory could easily last  years, during which no UK government will agree to an independence referendum for Scotland, on the grounds that nothing is clear until everything is clear.I suspect realisation that the fog of Brexit is going to linger helped persuade the First Minister, belatedly, to support a Peoplersquos Vote on Brexit. On the BBC Andrew Marr show she made clear SNP MPs will vote for a repeat referendum on Brexit, eventhere is no guarantee of indyref. The polls may indicate that support for independence would rise with a hard Brexit, but it is much better for the cause of Scottish independencethe UK doesnrsquot leave the EU at all. It would mean Scotland could seamlessly depart from the UK without there being any hard border with England, and without Scotland having to formally leave the EU.There is now a slim chance that a Peoplersquos Vote might happen. That Britain will wake up from the Brexit nightmare. But that would be a triumph of hope over experience."},{"url":null,"title":"labour-accused-tories-of-austerity-con","story":"The Labour leader pressed the Prime Minister on how she plans to end the funding squeeze on police, the NHS, schools, councils and disabled people following her party conference vow.But Mrs May claimed Labours plans would cost people pound trillion, repeated her pledge on austerity and told MPs: \"What is not being brought to an end is fiscal responsibility.\"The issue dominated the leaders exchanges at Prime Ministers Questions and comes ahead of Chancellor Philip Hammonds latest Budget on October .Speaking in the Commons, Mr Corbyn raised cuts to mental health budgets, the police and other areas as he asked when austerity would be over.He said: \"Today there are , fewer mental health nurses than there were in .

The investigation also found just three companies own more than half of Englandrsquos quota while some fishermen hoard quota on vessels which never cast a net.Nearly half of England and Walesrsquo quota is held by companies based outside the those countries, despite reforms to the EUrsquos fisheries policy which encourage national governments to allocate fishing quota on social and environmental grounds.It is claimed that the ownership of quota by large-scale fishing firms also poses greater risk to the environment and fish stocksmore destructive fishing practices are deployed, an allegation strenuously denied by the families themselves.Scottish Greens environment spokesman Mark Ruskell MSP said: ldquoThis investigation should serve as a reminder that much of Scotlandrsquos fishing industry is in the grip of a handful of very rich people ... , many of them putting profit before science, happy to wipe the seas clean rather than manage stocks sustainably so we have food for the future.ldquoFishing industry voices have actively encouraged the kind of deregulated free-for-all the Toriesrsquo Brexit crisis is dragging us toward, posing massive risks to jobs and public services in our coastal communities.  per cent of whatrsquos caught in Scottish waters is sold to the EU so the isolationism of Brexit will ruin our export economy.ldquoIf we want a future for fisheries we need to distribute quotas to more local and sustainable operators.

The huge sums have been made by large-scale fishermen, with five wealthy families controlling one-third of Scotlandrsquos total quota, despite the entire pelagic fleet consisting of just  vessels.But for those outside the big companies, fishing is becoming a less and less profitable pursuit due to a quota system that favours larger enterprises over small vessels.A study by Greenpeacersquos investigative unit claims to reveal a vastly unequal system where a minority of wealthy families control huge swathes of fishing rights to the detriment of local fishermen.In desperation, many small scale fishermen resort to contacting larger outfits, or those they know have Fixed Quota Allocationsthat they do not fish. Those owners can set their own prices and lease out quota, allowing the fisherman to catch more.The prices set for leasing out FQA can y by hundreds of pounds. To lease a tonne of cod for example, can cost from pound to pound. The resulting catch might bring just pound, at market, meaning a profit margin of pound before staff and equipment costs.According to Greenpeace, the situation has left some fishermen going out on boats alone because they cannot afford to pay a crew, while others have found that, after boat costs, they are still losing money and have stopped fishing altogether.Jerry Percy, founder of the Under Ten Fishermenrsquos Association, which represents small scale fishermen, said: ldquoThe fish in our seas are a public resource, itrsquos yours and mine, managed by Government on our behalf. They should therefore never be treated as just another commodity, to be bought and sold to the highest bidder.ldquoThe hoarding of quota risks creating a distorted market in which the price of fish stocks, and access to them, is controlled by just a few companies.The problem, say critics, dates back to the s when economists argued that the problem of diminishing fish stocks brought about by fleet expansion and mass industrialisation should be solved by the market. They proposed that states create a limited right to catch fish that could be bought and sold.Iceland was one of the first countries to implement this market-based policy in the Eighties. Their fish stocks began to recover and the fishing fleet grew more profitable. But the privatisation of once common fishing-rights led to many fishermen becoming dispossessed as banks started trading in fishing rights and the system eventually crashed.In the UK, the price of large fishing boats and their associated right-to-fish has rocketed, which has led to many young people being priced out. In many cases only large companies with the backing of banks can buy boats.Greenpeace hope the UK can succeed where Iceland failed, and rein in the market to create a fairer system.Will McCallum, head of oceans at Greenpeace UK, said: ldquoHow long before the Government stops blaming other countries, looks at its own broken system, accepts responsibility for fixing it and creates a fairer and more sustainable distribution of fishing quota across the UK  With the Fisheries Bill rumoured to be just weeks away, there has never been a better opportunity to do just this.A spokesman for Lunar Fishing said: ldquoThe quota available to the inshore fleetis more than the under-m fleet can catch, so there is no merit in the suggestion that there is disadvantage to the lsquosmall-scale fishermenrsquo.ldquoIn fact the vast majority of fish caught requires larger vessels to catch because of location, depth and weather challenges. It would be impossible for the inshore fleet to catch a small percentage of the quota.ldquoIn relation to workforce, Lunar uses the quota to employ around  people in the local communities of Peterhead, Fraserburgh and Aberdeen. Many more are employed in providing services to the company.A spokesman for Sir Ian Woodrsquos fishing arm, the Don Fishing Co and JW Holdings, said: ldquoBoth come from strong fish catching backgrounds with Sir Ian Woodrsquos father, grandfather and great grandfather all being fishermen. The Don operates as a management and fish selling company working on behalf of about  vessels in which it has mainly minority shares and another  vessels which it helps manage and sell the fish. The Don Corsquos one and only reason for owning some quota itself and helping a large number of fishing vessels to buy their own quota is to enable the vessels to have sufficient quota to be viable.A spokesman for Andrew Marr International said: ldquoAMI fully supports robust fishery management including full compliance to protect fish stocks and sustainable fishing. AMI has  vessels in the English Fully Documented Fishery Scheme with on board camera monitoring.ldquoThe main stocks that AMI fishes for in the North Sea are cod, haddock, whiting, saithe, monkfish. In these species, the Under  fleet have excess quota that they have not used in the last several years.A spokesman for Interfish said: ldquoAcross our fleet we were the first UK fleet to achieve full certication against the Responsible Fishing Scheme in  and maintained this against the new standard in  ndash no other fleet of skippers have achieved this standard.ldquoInterfish are active within several MSC client groups enabling sustainable certication of offshore and inshore fisheries."},{"url":null,"title":"brian-beacom-can-the-new-bbc-scotland-channel-make-scotland-happy","story":"What you do therefore is grab your audience where you can, when you can.

However, that is not the approach adopted by Highland Council.Mrs Ross said: \"Having raised issues with the council regarding their approach to considering equalities and human rights in their budget process, particularly around the closure of public toilets, it was encouraging to hear that many councils around Scotland have placed such an approach at the heart of their budgeting.

A coach tour firm cancelled a booking over concern for its customers needing comfort breaks.As previously reported, local businessman Andrew Mackay said the threat of toilet closures in Caithness could create \"a negative impression\" of the area and impact on the number of people visiting.Mr Mackay, who has hotels in Wick, Thurso and Castletown and is a board member of the tourism body Venture North, said: \"The perception that there is a shortage of toilets in Caithness ndash and where in the Highlands ndash could impact adversely on the area.\"Any negative publicity could have an effect on the industry. We have a short season and need to capitalise on all markets.\"Green MSP John Finnie recently accused the council of pressing ahead with the closure of toilets in the face of its own evidence that it could have an impact on public health. An equality impact assessment conducted into the proposals identied issues for older people, those with disabilities and pregnant women.Mr Finnie said: \"Despite this, the council leadership are determined to press ahead in their usual incoherent manner, ignoring procedures, policies and good practice.\"Given the clear implications for public health, and potential for increased instances of public nuisance, it is astonishing that the council has not discussed this matter with NHS Highland and Police Scotland.\"Friday  Oct  : AM"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117682.jpg","title":"Repair work set for next month after landslip on lifeline route","story":"CAITHNESS civic leader Willie Mackay has questioned the delay involved in repair work following the landslip at Helmsdale last month.Mr Mackay, who represents the Wick and East Caithness ward on Highland Council, said: \"I am a bit disappointed that it has taken so long ndash the A is a major leline road.\"He was speaking after Bear Scotland confirmed yesterday that repairs to the landslip are due to start at the beginning of October.\"I thought they might have moved a bit quicker.

I am grateful to Andy Moir once again for making himself available and to all those we met in Stronsay, who engaged constructively and put forward a number of issues for further consideration.“The key issue raised at the public meeting was undoubtedly the decision by NHS Orkney not to include a helipad on the site of the new Balfour hospital. Concerns were expressed about apparent delays in transferring Isles patients, brought in by air ambulance, from Kirkwall airport to the current Balfour due to a lack of land ambulance capacity.“While it is unlikely that NHS Orkney will reopen the decision on a helipad, ious suggestions were made about how delays in transfer to the hospital might be avoided in future. Mr Moir agreed to take these up with his colleagues responsible for land ambulance provision.

This includes travel costs to attend training or to compete on the Scottish mainland, which he believes can be prohibitive.#Grants and sponsorship are available and invaluable, but finding ways to reduce costs remains a challenge,# he explained.“I was also told that for some girls and women, the macho image associated with certain sports can be a disincentive to get involved. In that respect, having good female role models is important and in Orkney we are fortunate to have a great many.#The success of Anna Tait and Rachael Sutherland at the last two Orkney Sportsperson of the Year Awards illustrates this perfectly, with Anna winning from an all-female shortlist that also included Sarah MacPhail and Hannah Beavan, and Amy Golder taking the top junior award. Meanwhile, Orkney Dragons go from strength to strength, attracting more girls and women into playing rugby.Increasing participation is something that Mr McArthur feels we should all be able to support.#Role models are part of that, but we need to look at ways of removing obstacles, whether that be to do with funding, facilities or even, as Anna Tait suggested, making the image of a sportswoman more acceptable to young girls.“When you see those inspirational people within your own community, it’s so much easier to say ‘well why not me #copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The new strategy will shape the country’s transport priorities for the next  years.Age Scotland and Transport Scotland have said they have been working closely with older people in communities across island, rural and urban Scotland since spring to understand how transport affects older peoples’ daily lives.Gillian Skuse, Charity Director of Age Scotland Orkney, stressed how important it is that local older people get involved in these discussions.“We’ve heard from older people around the islands that transport can impact their mobility, running their errands, enjoying activities and being part of their local communities. This consultation is a great opportunity for older Orcadians’ comments and experiences to help shape future planning for more inclusive, affordable and accessible transport on our islands.”Speaking about the workshop, Age Scotland’s Policy Engagement  Campaigns Officer Simon Ritchie said: “We know that a lack of transport options can be a huge barrier for many older people in the Highlands and Islands living the le they want to live. Around , older people in Scotland don’t see anyone  for at least half a week so easy access to good transport options is vital to older people allowing them to run errands, meet friends and family, make medical appointments and improve their quality of le.#This is a brilliant opportunity for older people in Orkney to share their views on transport and shape the new National Transport Strategy.  Age Scotland and Transport Scotland want to hear how transport works for older Orcadians so that decision-makers can ensure older Orcadians can access the services they need in order to enjoy later le.#“We invite any and all older people in Orkney to come along and share their views with us.”The transport workshop will take place in Finstown on Thursday October  at the Orkney Men#s Shed.

The other sites being considered for the initial roll-out include Glasgow, Ayr, Dumfries, Dunfermline, Fort William, Milngavie, Oban, Inverness and Aberdeen.The units will be fitted with technology that will enable them to digitally track water usage at each Top-up point, transmitting the data via cloud technology to specialists managing Scotland’s water networks. The resulting data will be used to calculate cost and plastic savings, along with the volume of water being consumed.Douglas Millican, Scottish Water chief executive, said: “Our research shows that people feel very positively towards the quality of Scotland’s tap water — now these state-of-the-art taps can provide access to enable water drinkers to enjoy it while on the go by carrying and using refillable bottles.”The Your Water, Your Le campaign aims to make tap the first choice for water drinkers wherever they are, and encourages businesses to make it readily available for staff and customers. Zero Waste Scotland, Keep Scotland Beautul and Scottish Natural Heritage, have also voiced their support.On average, a litre bottle of water costs about p, so topping up daily from the tap, could save £. a day, nearly £ a year.For further information, visit yourwateryourle vw, px\"  copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We gave support to the centre by attending their annual fete in August where we donated lots of dog food, and also through the Bags Of Help scheme where they benefited from pound which was voted on by our customers.\"I cannot give praise enough to Iona and all of her team at Munlochy Animal Aid for everything they do, it is incredibly humbling and long may our friendship continue.\"The total value of goods and cash donated by the end of August was pound,.Iona Nicol was delighted to show the visitors around and very grateful for the vital donations and support shown by members of the public.The centre, which faces signicant food and vets bills on a regular basis, marked its th anniversary in August.Friday  Oct  : AMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

She called for the creation of prearranged collections for businesses seeking to deposit large amounts of cash, after the review recognised that such arrangements could be improved.The MSP for Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch said: \"As the MSP for Beauly and Kyle, I am of course disappointed that the RBS branches in both towns are to close.\"While I recognise branch use has been declining in both of these areas, there are still well-documented and legitimate questions regarding security and disabled access in the alternative banking provision.\"The review plainly states that the branch closure in Beauly will cause dficulties for vulnerable customers and so as the constituency MSP I am calling on RBS to work with me to put measures in place to provide specic support for them. I hope RBS will work with me to listen to the views of the community council to ensure there are better routes and provision in the Beauly area.\"The union Unite slated the announcement by RBS, arguing that the bank had simply gone through the motions of reviewing the cases before pushing ahead with its original plans.The unionrsquos regional officer, Lyn Turner, said: \"The Johnston Carmichael review was entirely predictable and nothing but a rubber-stamp of RBS management decisions. Sixty communities out of an original  with branches earmarked for closure will now be marginalised by this so-called review. Unite will request to meet RBS urgently to discuss the impact.\"Simon Watson, managing director of personal banking at RBS pledged to provide banking alternatives in Kyle and Beauly. He said: \"We know branches are important to many communities, but equally we know that fewer people are using them as more people bank online. In every case of a branch closing we are committed to providing the best possible range of alternatives.\"Friday  Oct  : AMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The merged group will serve some . million customers.Alistair Phillips-Davies, chief executive of SSE, said: “This is a complex transaction and there is still much work to do in the coming weeks and months.“However, we’ve always believed that the creation of a new, independent energy and services retailer has potential to deliver real benefits for customers and the market as a whole and it is good to see that the CMA has cleared the transaction following what was a comprehensive and rigorous inquiry.”The CMA had launched a full inquiry into the merger after its initial investigation found that the tie-up could reduce competition, potentially leading to higher prices for households.The regulator added that the incoming UK government-enforced price cap would also help protect customers on iable deals.

Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the th anniversary of the Milne Cup.Sadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.Many supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.While it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.But despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The - scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.Molloy’s introduction  minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubtanyone  in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.But the damage had been done in the first half – at - down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.Some have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.I felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.Two years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a - defeat in Kirkwall.There is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s th birthday.It’s just a pity we have to wait a whole  months until a chance of revenge.: : : : : : : :A couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.There are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.A score of - was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.The Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.A few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.I would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.: : : : : : : :Orkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening#s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John CouttsThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over  guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.Unfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.The speeches which followed,anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.It was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.Sinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous  game when he hit the back of the net five times in the - victory.: : : : : : : :And finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.On Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.Helped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.Robert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did -odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.The others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.The final score was a - win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate - football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"big turnout to welcome the eighth serene to whalsay ","story":"The latest Serene arrives at the pier at Symbister.

Given these turbines will be placed on high ground, to suggest they will dominate the landscape is an understatement # just what the tourists come to Shetland to see.As long as they#re not in Bressay or Sandness.Only one and a half times the size of big ben# just little things# pfffffff.Absolutely ridiculous!I’ve seen wind turbines with these extra large blades between Stirling and Edinburgh. They are enormous and look awful.Worth recalling that the perceived size of the blade sweepincreases as the square of the radiuse.g. increasing the bladeby . times doubles the perceived size of the blade sweep, or, increasing bladeby % increases perceived size by %John, the longer blades will increase the electrical power that each turbine can generate, giving VE more revenue.That’s as may be, but revenue does not equal profit, and by the time the unsustainable level of subsidy has been removed, the SCT have been suckered in to paying for the export cable, and SSE have ensured their pound of flesh is as great as they can get away with,Shetland will never see its money back.More of nothing is still only nothing.If they are increasing the height of the turbines,does this mean that they would need to increase the size and depth of the anchor points at what extra cost and who will pay Presumably, these are the latest models with towers and foundations redesigned, accordingly The changes should improve cost-effectiveness and presumably, VE’s intention is to improve competitiveness for the auction, which requires cutting costs to the bone and squeezing every last drop of revenue from the project to keep it viable.Given that the last round of auctions produced winning ‘strike prices’ of £. MWh, exactly half what VE insisted they needed for viability , it makes you wonder, would winning an auction capture their fabled “pot of gold at Rainbow’s End” or would it be merely a poisoned chalice that provides little or no# or worse# William, the size and cost of the foundations must be increased to accommodate more powerful wind turbines.Larger Turbines require loads more concrete poured into the blanket bog all previous calculations EIA are out the window.If turbine technology has #advanced considerably# why can#t they make them smaller, considerably The “technology advance” is to produce turbines with increased electrical capacity, requiring longer blades and larger fondations. The thought is that one MW turbine will cost less to install, own, and maintain than two MW turbines.Mr Innes, Project Director for Viking Energy, is quoted where as saying #Viking is now competing against a new generation of wind farms, including those offshore, where tip heights of m or more are now available.#In that case why doesn#t he just put these turbines offshore as well.Kay. Just a thought.Aircraft technology has advanced too and ‘planes get bigger and bigger. I suspect that miniaturisation , so beloved of the Japanese, whose watches, cameras , radios and a host of other products lead one to believe that for items to improve in performance , they need to get smaller. True in many instances but not all. That said, Japanese wind driven turbines might solve a few problems.A point of interest regarding Japan andCO free energy . Japan is planning on using nuclear, not wind power, as a major source of electricity production. One may understand that Japan has greater first-hand knowledge of nuclear atomic contamination than any other country on Earth having being subjected two atomic bombs and the Fukushima accident. Using that real information on real nuclear contamination, not the Green lunacy crank disinformation, so prevalent in Scotland. Japan has a knowledge-led, intelligent energy policy. As ofMay , there are  operable reactors in Japan. Of these, nine reactors in  power plants Additionally, five reactors have been approved for a start, and further  have start applications under review. It never ceases to amaze me how ignorance and fear shape energy policy. Japan is fully aware of the risks of nuclear I reference “the Liberal Democratic Party cabinet in April , calls nuclear power #the country#s most important power source#.[Japan is now aiming for #a realistic and balanced energy structure#. The Japanese Government targets for wind power deployment are set at only .% of electricity production by  . That is a total figure, onshore and offshore.What a huge shame The Scottish Government is unwilling to do the same, it would save our countryside from so much uglly devastation. Why #..Well you don`t need a rocket scientist to figure that one out.Ifthis horrendous project does go ahead it`ll be past its sell by the time it is finished and will be made obsolete by newer, more efficient and cleaner technology.When is the plug going to be pulled on this nonsense before any more money is lost to it If Viking want to increase the turbine size, it is not unreasonable to anticipate that the other windfarm developers will do the same.The floodgates are being opened and, instead of being a world-class destination for wildle  scenery, Shetland will become a world-class example of crass development without regard to the obvious damage to environment, health and wellbeing, not to mention income from tourism.Renewable energy should be pursued, but in Shetland’s case the cost of the VE project has already been far higher – in every sense – than the imagined benefits.I maybe wrong, but wind farm technology appears to be the cheapest form of producing electricityin regard to other alternative sources of producing electricity.I am pretty sure wave and tidal energy could also be tapped into within Shetland, but economics seem to be based on the cheapest alternative compared to wave or tidal resources being the better, possibly, and signicantly less intrusive than the massive wind turbines scaring the Shetland landscape and more than likely tourists remembering the islands not for its beauty but#.well, it is self explanatory.The potential economic damage caused by the wind turbines I am pretty sure would outweigh any positive contribution the islands may have in regard to tourism or other positive attributes the islands may have.Time, no doubt, will be the final answer#.. watch this space, as they say.David. Just to be a bit more optimistic about wind farms , there is every likelihood that visitors to Shetland will already be familiar with rotating blades .It is a fast growing energy generation procedure so would not come as a shock.The other thing is ,such equipment would almost certainly not be visible from all corners of Shetland.People would get used to them just as they are used to the island hopping planes.It’s a bit unfortunate that severe condemnation is a reactionto newish ideas and inventions.I take onboard your points, Haydn, but I think what is putting people off the VEP, is the shear cost of what it could possibly be. I have heard a figure not far short of kicking on the door of £. Billion, and possibly more, and how many decades would this take to bring VEP into the black in terms of revenue One should also look into the potential running and maintenance costs per year for such a project  Would the revenue created be enough to off-set such costs or would VE require more funding from the SCT, to balance its books It seems very evident, the more information people in Shetland know about VEP, the more people are put off the whole idea in terms of economics and what little benefit the islands may reap from it  I have heard a figure of around £ million a year###.poor investmentthe projected costs are to be believed. Aof around. of % does not bode well.I have to take issue with you here Haydn, The proposed VE turbines will now be meres high and constructed on hills. The high point some meters plus above sea level. That would be the line of sight from sea level of about  miles. Precious little of Shetland would not see the VE turbines!! I note you claim #that severe condemnation is a reactionto newish ideas and inventions#. I would respectfully point out wind turbines are hardly a new idea! Many consider them at the point of being an obsolete technologyNow for cutting-edge ideas, look to tidal generation and modular nuclear reactors. The latter , I believe you are openly condemning, something about us all glowing in the dark was your comment!!! Now that was Scaremongering nonsense. Rosatom,Russias vehicle for nuclear expansion,has about % of new nuclear plant contracts in the bag,mainly in emerging and third world countries .If Chernobyl is anything to go by and what Russia the culprit did in rectyingthe mess,novichok is going to be a piddle in the ocean in comparison.Read an article this morning.Wish I could remember which paper that said Germany#s  year old wind turbines are coming to the end of their usefulness and no longer qualy for subsidies. No recycling as the blades are made from fibre glass.Their plan is to dump them on third world nations so creating more waste rather than cleaning the mess up themselves. Viking energy should sit up and take not it but will have cloth ears when it comes to profit. Remember, as you sow,so shall ye reap.Germany, by nature of its fragmented political system with government by weak coalitions only resulted in the Green Partyexercising much influence beyond their electoral mandate. Nuclear power was cut back as a political gesture to the Greens, that had nothing to do with the science of the matter. The result was a massive increase in coal-fired electrical generation and also the importation of Natural Gas. Germany is now the worlds largest importer of Natural Gas! and the German motor industries disingenuous diesel emission data is almost legendary!!!.Deaths from atmospheric pollution in Germany are massive and this year the EU is taking Germany to court for breaking all EU guidelines. It is indeed very ironic that the Scotish Government does so much to praise the use of Wind power and exploit all its rural communities to that end while it does all in its ability to expandGas Exportation from the North Sea,. It likewise imports Gasto Grangemouth and at all times try and use North Sea oil revenue to promote Nationalist agendas. The logic escapes me, perhaps you could explain Grahm,!!!Billy , I understand where you are coming from when stating that  year old turbines in Germany are coming to the end of their lives , but is this surprising   Since technological advances in vast areas of activity are so rapid it would be most unlikely for things to suddenly stand still.Try selling a  year old car , TV. washing machine ,vacuum cleaner , racing bike etc etc. Virtually worthless . Fighter ‘planes cost £millions EACH so should we have stuck with the Tiger Moth to save money   Times change continuously.No doubt some would like the world to stop to enable them to get off so that they could abandon their mortgage and live in a cave in a cosy corner of the Moon. All very whimsical but I’m sure you get the drt.Interesting comment Haydn. I am unable to find any substantive advance in Wind Turbines as technology over the last  years. They are larger yes, but no less polluting and even more damaging to the environment. The most recent research would indicate that disturbance in airflow patterns and friction around the rotating blades not only creates more noise pollution but results in substantive heat creation. That heat creation in itself would and does contribute to global warming new research has shown. Reference #Hard University’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences# would indicate wind power in theU.S. with wind alone would warm the planet a quarter-degree Celsius! If this research is proved correct, we will be decommissioning and scrapping wind turbines far sooner than the protagonist advocate. There are already far better ways of generating clean electricity than  meter high turbines, sadly too many have staked their reputations on the wind myth and will resist accepting they have been wrongFair enough Ian. I must confess that I was unaware of the likely height of the proposed turbine blades.I’m not so sure about Japan and others having a reducing intention to set up more turbines though. As for the comment I made about nuclear radiation causing people to glow in the dark —— you surely cannot be serious !!!!That was no more than a figure of speech.I hope you are merely poking fun at such a prospect.I know that glow worms emit light as do other creatures in the sea but it’s silly to think that the effects on iniduals who have been subjected to radiation for medical reasons would then walk about looking like Beacons.Give me a break Ian!Ian.—- Your comments on October th at -.Plenty of food for thought in your missive .Thanks.It is a balance between providing energy safely and economically, but our conventional methods of using fossil fuels has brought to the fore due to the impact such energy has had on the environment.However, whilst we are being side-tracked about the impact of fossil fuels, nobody has every mentioned the impact on the planet caused by agriculture. Agriculture, I believe, causes  times more green house gases than all of transportation put together Not only does agriculture produce more green houses gases than transportation, it is the greatest cause of environmental destruction than any other industry. As our population grows, this will become more evident, as we see species upon species being put on the # endangered species list # or # become extinct #. This man-made catastrophe will impact on other species and it will eventually impact the very existence of humans on the planet as nature takes revenge through disease, drought and other natural impacts.Progress in providing alternative energy may be a positive start, but at what price will this be to the planet and le,this progress is purely based on the man-made concept of monetary value and this of profit David Spence, the single most signicant threats to humanity are overpopulation and our leaders, scientic, religious and political leader#s, utter cowardice to dare to mention such an undeniable fact. World population is set to double in  years. Energy needs, food supply, pollution are all driven by human population density. It makes no odds how many windmills we build whatever their size! Atmospheric pollution, global warming or starvation awaits and will kill all our children#s children as long as human overbreeding continues. It is hard to take the Greens cranks, politicians and doom-mongers of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change seriously when their reports fail to state, or take into account the blindingly obvious.David. Your warning shots make me feel that I should grabfew bottles of whisky 🥃 go back to bed and snooze my way through the day even though there’s a hot Indian summer outside.!!Seriously , weare facing a dire situation which will impact on my grandsons far more than on me —— or you. When you say ‘Agriculture’ I’m assuming that you are including livestock.The greenhouse gas emissions from the planet’s animal le must be enormous and that’s whether or not they are raised for their meat .Also, to take your point, such vast amounts of money are tied into food production , it’s hard to seeany measures at all, however well intentioned, , will enable us to eradicate the decline of le in its widest sense.Time to grab that whisky bottle I think 🤔. Cheers.Is there going to be a remake of #Dad#s Army#  Only, a number of contributors seem to be vying for the part of Private Fraser: #Wur do-oO-MM-ED!# LOL 🙂# You stupid Boy, Pike##.sorry, John # lolI take your points Haydn and Ian, but according to predicted human population expansion, it is estimated the global population will be around  billion by the year  Other dynamics affecting population growth, as you know, is requiring more land not only for agriculture but for accommodation and expanded space for for other amenities related.Not doubt, I think, there may come a critical point where demand for the expansion of the population, not including technological advancement, will determine how we live and finding a balance between our own demands to this of the natural world and other le The driving force for this expansion is predominantly based on economics and technological advances, and as long as this is the precedent, this could bring into conflict what we want and what nature will will allow In the food chain, I suspect we will become more use to # processed food # as technological progress will find better ways of growing alternative foods, whether biologically or chemically, as an answer to keep a balance between our demands and this of a coexisting relationship with the natural laws which govern le itself, including humans.You are quite right John, there are people who seem to be dominating these columns and I fear that I am a guilty one —— as well as the others.Perhaps I should take a break and ease off.The trouble is, there are interesting and important problems out there which should be aired rather than be allowed to fester.Maybe a bit more humour would help to make the rough stuff a little more palatable.So, step forward anyone of a Dad’s Army disposition !!

The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League.

Added to this, a further four football pitches worth of the reserve land would be temporarily lost to the construction site to accommodate the construction activities and the associated diggers, cranes and other heavy machinery.\"But the effects of the road scheme on the reserves wildle will extend far beyond the extent of roadworks activities.\"The noise and activity associated with the A construction works, and the increased traffic flows and the imposing road structure once the road is completed, will cause many birds to keep their distance and not attempt to nest or feed within several hundred metres of the road site.\"Transport Scotland has bought land at Dellmore near Insh Marshes and proposes to convert some of this to wet grassland to accommodate the homeless wader bird species from Insh. While RSPB Scotland has welcomed this, the charity said it will be hard to convert this land for the waders, and maintain it as such over the long-term.The spokeswoman said: \"It is far from guaranteed it will provide suitable habitat, and evenit does, the new habitat will not be big enough or suitable to rehome all of the waders that would be made homeless. Neither will it address other harm to wildle.\"Karen Birkby, RSPB Scotlands site manager at Insh Marshes, said several suggestions made to Transport Scotland to minimise impact on the nature reserve have been ignored.Aviemore Community Council made similar claims last week that their concerns had fallen on stoney ground over plans to construction the dual carriageway on the village side of the current A as part of the Dalraddy-Slochd section. They said it will impact on the popular Milton Woods.Ms Birkby said: \"We have continually made the case for protecting the exceptional wildle of Insh Marshes, minimising harmful impacts, and maximising environmental benefits such as enhancing or providing suitable new habitat nearby.\"While we welcome the intention of converting some land at Dellmore to wet grassland, it is far from guaranteed that it will provide suitable habitat for all the wildle affected.\"We understand the need for the A dualling but believe that it can be built in a way which minimises its impact.\"We have suggested several ways in which Transport Scotland could do this but disappointingly, they are not proposing these measures in the latest plans, so there is a real risk that the road scheme will result in long-term harm to a iety of wildle.\"We encourage local people to view the proposals online or attend the public exhibition and raise their concerns before the deadline of October .\"The proposals for Crubenmore to Kincraig went on show yesterday in Newtonmore Village Hall.

Afterward, I travelled back home and got out the car and I don’t remember anything about the three weeks after that – but apparently I ‘died’ a couple of times, according to reports!“I was told that I dropped like a stone on the pavement outside my house, and my neighbour ran across to the community centre to get the defibrillator and used it on me. After that, the doctor and the air ambulance arrived.”Cherill spent three weeks in Raigmore Hospital in Inverness but was then admitted to hospital in Edinburgh where she went through open heart surgery and was fitted with a pacemaker. After three weeks out of the hospital, she was readmitted to Raigmore for a further two weeks but is now back home recovering.Having battled her way back from the brink, Cherill was informed that her husband Russell had died at home in Gairloch two weeks to the day of her suffering cardiac arrest. “It’s heart-breaking,” she said. “I think what happened to me must have been terrying for poor Russell.”Despite enduring such serious illness and personal tragedy, Cherill remains positive about the future and was quick to pay tribute to the role of LuckyBhere. She said: “I am so pleased to see a small organisation like LuckyBhere is doing so well. I wouldn’t be hereit wasn’t for the defibrillator at the community centre and someone being able to use it on me.”Three days after Cherill’s collapse, on Tuesday th June, -year-old father-of-three Ian MacLeod was out at Dores beach when he too suffered a cardiac arrest.“I’m a cub scout leader and was doing the register with another leader when I hit the dirt,” he said.“A couple of Spanish tourists who were on the beach at the time performed CPR on me and got the defib from the Dores Inn and kept on going until the ambulance arrived. It took  to  minutes to get me to Raigmore Hospital.”After being admitted on Tuesday evening, Ian was fitted with a ‘stent’the next day and was out of the hospital on Thursday to pick his children up from school.Having served in the forces and kept himself in good psychical the condition, Ian believed there was no rhyme nor reason for his illness: “I have never been overweight and I’m in decent shape, so it just shows you it could happen to anyone.”During his  years as a security guard in the Eastgate Shopping Centre in Inverness, Ian was on the other end of a defibrillator — having used one at work — and was keen to stress that when it comes to using the device there shouldn’t be anything to fear. “You can’t do any more harm to a person by using a defib, as they are in effect already dead. “I am forever grateful. All things considered, I could have died and there would be three kids left without a dad.”On Wednesday th June, in Port of Ness in Lewis, -year-old John Burgis wasn’t feeling his usual self and his we Carol soon became concerned about his wellbeing.“John hadn’t been  per cent the day before, which rang alarm bells for me,” she said. “He had been a bit breathless, and we went to the surgery. They took his blood pressure and said he was fine but — given he was  — to take it easy, so we came home# We went to bed about  o’clock.”“I don’t remember anything apart from waking up in the hospital,” said John. “Carol apparently found me making funny noises at about one o’clock in the morning and then realised I was unconscious.”Carol quickly called for an ambulance: “I dialled  and when I was on the phone he stopped breathing. Then I did what I was told to do – I got him off the bed and on to the floor and did CPR until the responder arrived.“Fiona, the responder alongside whom I had trained about  years earlier came from Cross with the defibrillator – it was lucky she was the one on call and didn’t live far away. She got the kit out straight away. I put the stickers on his chest, she shocked him, and he started breathing again.”John was admitted to hospital in Stornoway before being transferred by helicopter to Queen Elizabeth ICU in Glasgow. He was then admitted to the Golden Jubilee Hospital in Clydebank where he was fitted with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator . He was back home just over a week later.“One reason for my quick recovery was that I actually went into hospital quite fit,” said John. “Even though I was unconscious, my body itself was in a fit state. We had regularly been going to the gym near our house here which has a scheme free for pensioners that is great – it encourages some of the old folk to go. We regularly go out on our bikes or walk up to the Butt of Lewis, so we do lead quite active lestyles.”Carol added: “It was our wedding anniversary recently which was very poignant as I could have been sitting here by myself – I wasn’t, and it’s all good.“We have a very strong faith and that has helped us accept what has happened and be extremely grateful that John is still here.”Dr. Steve Leslie, consultant cardiologist and clinical lead for heart failure at Raigmore Hospital, believes the work undertaken by LuckyBhere is “truly le-saving”.“Without defibrillation, a cardiac arrest is almost always fatal,” Dr. Leslie said. “For every  seconds in which defibrillation is delayed the chance of success is reduced by  per cent. This means that for defibrillation to be successful it needs to be delivered as soon as possible. CPR prior to defibrillation can buy time.#The approach taken by LuckyBhere to encourage communities not only to provide community-based defibrillators but also to engage with training is lesaving.”Established in , LuckyBhere was set-up by Skye resident Ross Cowie who suffered a cardiac arrest in  but was saved due to the presence nearby of an ambulance which had lesaving equipment.In view of his own experience, Ross decided to raise funds to purchase a defibrillator for the Skye Camanachd shinty clubhouse in Portree which was where he fell ill. What began as a small local gesture has since blossomed into a national charity – LuckyBhere and its team of volunteers have provided training to thousands of people in communities across theand breadth of Scotland, from Cullivoe Hall in Shetland to Burrowhead Holiday Village near the Mull of Galloway.Last year the charity linked up with Comhairle nan Eilean Siar to provide ELS training — including how to operate a defibrillator — as part of the curriculum in all  primary and secondary schools across the Western Isles. In total, there are currently  public access defibrillators in the Western Isles from the Butt of Lewis to Barra, and more than  across Skye.Ross Cowie said: “We always said at LuckyBhere thatwe could help to save one le that would make all efforts worthwhile. Several people have survived but, for three to be saved in five days, is extraordinary.“Much of this success is due to the trainers who give their time freely to train thousands of people across Scotland in lesaving skills. Training takes only two hours and what better skill could be learned than the ability potentially to save someone’s le.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_20180804_190022_01.jpg","title":"mallaig and kyleakin prepare for championship","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineLeague newcomers Mallaig face reigning champions Kyleakin in Broadford on Saturdaywith the  Skye and Lochalsh Football League Championship at stake.This season#s champions will be determined by virtue of a winner-takes-all, title-deciding playoff after both sides finished neck-a-neck on  points in the table # as goal dference isn#t factored in.Mallaig secured their place in tomorrow#s showdown after recording a fantastic - away victory against Sleat and Strath in the final game of the campaign in which their goalkeeper Mark Johnston pulled off a late penalty save to seal the victory.Kyleakin, meanwhile, took the spoils with a well-deserved - home win in their crunch match against fellow title contenders Portree Juniors thanks in part to a splendid showing by goalkeeper Craig Wilson.With the teams having scored  goals between them in the league this season # *including  in their three encounters so far, Saturday#s match-up promises to be a fitting finale to what has been a thrilling and unpredictable campaign.Having gone from - up to - down, the Blues rallied with goals from substitute Brett MacMillan, who drew his side level and then from Andy Cunningham who struck a late winner to seal the points.Mallaig led twice, first through Marc MacLean, and then Angus MacNaughton but were pegged by Graham Campbell#s side.Just as it appeared a vital three points would slip through the net, Jamie MacGregor# side struck a third in injury time as Ryan MacDonald set up Andy Cunningham for the winner.With only a win guaranteed to keep them in the hunt, Mallaig stepped up when the pressure was on to put in an excellent away performance against DL MacKinnon#s men.Ross Douglas scored a brace to help fire his side - ahead but Connaire Yoxon found the back of the net with a fine finish to halve their advantage.With less than ten minutes remaining Sleat were awarded a penalty and the chance to equalise. However, despite having been beaten from the spot earlier in the match, Mark Johnston ed to his left to thwart Ben Yoxon#s effort and with it seal his side#s playoff berth.After succumbing to a - defeat at the hands of their rivals the week before in the Ross Cup, Kyleakin came storming back with a confidence-boosting - win which brought them right back into contention, while also ending the hosts# unbeaten run in the league in the process. Gordy Mccarroll opened the scoring with a well-taken effort from a freekick, with Cameron Thompson scoring the second from close range.In stark contrast to his display in the cup game the week before # which saw him earn a red card # Mccarroll put in a man of the match performance with a tireless showing and a goal to boot.The south Skye side churned out an important win as they overcame a tough nut in Northwest.Kyleakin were far from their best in the first period but a Stewart Johnston goal before the break gave them a  to build on. Clinical second-half strikes from Innis Thompson and Gordy Mccarroll sealed a victory which had looked far from certain for large periods of the game.With Mallaig having finished the season on  points, and Juniors holding a one-point advantage over the Reds going into the match, David Butcher#s side knew it was win or bust in terms of their title defence.What followed was a fine team performance by the  winners with goals from Cameron Thompson, Stuart Gillies, and a brace from Gordy Mccarroll. Their victory was punctuated by some outstanding goalkeeping by Craig Wilson # including an incredible stop to deny Juniors as they threatened to turn the tide early in the second half. #I feel our team have performed very well this year and are still learning in every game we play in this league. I’ve been impressed with the dedication shown by everyone to make sure this season went as smoothly as possible.##The team has certainly had its ups and downs this year, we have been caught napping in a couple of games that most people would expect us to win, but on the flip side we have stepped up in all the big games and have onlyone defeat in the league so far, so I can’t be too critical.# #It was great to see a four-way battle for the title but our lads needed no motivation. To be in that position was fantastic and we knew how hard the task would be against a Sleat team who themselves have had a great season this year. I have to say, it’s the most focused I’ve seen the lads and that’s including the two finals we’ve missed out on this year.#I don’t really think it gave me the extra motivation as I don’t really look at what other teams are doing, I knew after we beat Sleat that we were in pretty good shape to at least get a playoff but I didn’t think it would be against Mallaig # so credit to them for a great run-in. Whoever comes out on top on Saturday will be worthy winners.# #This might sound silly, but no, I was fully confident with the boys at the start of the season. Our aim was the title, although we liked keeping it too ourselves, so we could get our heads down and show what we can do on the pitch. I’ve been surprised by the ersity of the league. Every club has a completely dferent style and it’s not a case of setting up the same each week. We#re still learning and hopefully improving.# #It’s definitely a dferent challenge trying to defend the title as you are the team everyone wants to beat, so teams probably lt their game a wee bit against you and you have the added pressure of people#s expectations of you.# #I have always used the same approach to every game since I’ve started managing Kyleakin and I don’t see why that should change. Doing anything dferent could just add pressure to the boys and you’re disrupting what they are used to.# #No dferent than usual for us, everyone is happy to have had a weekend to prepare for the game. We really need to work out a game plan to unlock the Kyleakin code, they are the only team we haven’t managed to beat this year.#########################################-Article by Adam GordonAll images by Willie Urquhart."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/visitor-web.jpg","title":"council wants scotrail to help ease disruption on stromeferry","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineScotrail are currently considering a proposal to terminate rail journeys at Strathcarron to allow road traffic to flow more freely through the ersion on the Stromeferry bypass.At a meeting in Lochcarron last week, Colin Howell , Highland Council’s head of infrastructure, said that the ‘road to rail’ ersion on the bypass, where important stabilisation work to the rockface is being carried out, could stay open to traffic for an extra  minutes each dayScotrail would agree to do this. It would involved taking passengers by bus from Strathcarron to stations along the line to Kyle of Lochalsh.At the moment, even when a train has gone passed the bypass, that section of line must remain closed until the train reaches either Kyle or Strathcarron. Mr Howell said that Transport Scotland and Transport Minister Michael Matheson are considering this.A spokesman for Transport Scotland said Scotrail are looking at the proposal, which will have to be approved by the Mr Matheson. to facilitate the essential works on the Council’s A road.“We appreciate that, notwithstanding this cooperation, there is disruption for road uses during the passage of the normal train service.

He should not tolerate it in Belfast either.The correct decision by British Secretary of State Karen Bradley to reduce MLA wages cannot be allowed to mask the true nature of the undemocratic and politically damaging measures she announced in recent days.By her own staggering admission, Karen Bradley did not understand the voting motivations of the electorate here when she first took up the post.Clearly that is no longer the case. But unfortunately for anyone in this society who is interested in the rights of citizens, equality or the implementation of previous agreements, there is only one set of votes that Karen Bradley is interested in – and that is the DUP’s.Her government is reliant on the DUP for its own survival and is clearly determined not to upset that applecart, no matter how rotten its contents may be.She had an opportunity this week to take tangible measures that would have helped pave the way for a restoration of the power-sharing institutions by confronting the ongoing denial of rights by the DUP.But despite championing rights and equality in her own constituency and country, she failed to do so on behalf of citizens here.Instead what she announced was a suite of measures which subvert the democratic process and previous agreements.Faced with the prospect of a court-ordered Assembly poll, she moved to suspend her powers to call an election as set out in the legislation. That is a hugely retrograde step and a move away from the Good Friday Agreement.It also begs the question, what kind of self-declared democratic government, suspends the right of the people to have their say at the polls And while we all accept that officials require clarity on their roles in the current climate, any move to replace democratic accountability with greater authority for unelected civil servants or Direct Rule Ministers is entirely unacceptable.The aim of Karen Bradley’s intervention this week, setting aside the convenient timing of distracting from explosive evidence at the RHI Inquiry, was to buy time. To announce a flurry of supposed activity but, in reality, doing nothing but continuing to facilitate the denial of rights which is preventing a restoration of the power-sharing institutions.Her government is prepared to allow the political process to continue to drt with no strategy and no plan for a resolution rather than challenge their confidence and supply partners.This reliance on the DUP remains the central problem andany process around restoring the institutions is to be credible, Karen Bradley must begin prioritising the rights of citizens over Tory party self-interest.The Dublin Government must also assert its full role as a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement.The Taoiseach has pledged not to abandon northern citizens in the context of Brexit. He also has responsibilities to them in terms of rights and his government and must now show leader-ship in securing and defending rights which are routinely delivered everywhere  on this is-land.Leo Varadkar would not tolerate discrimination against the LGBT community, women, victims and Irish speakers in Dublin. He should not tolerate it in Belfast either.There can be no ambivalence or equivocation on rights, equality and integrity in government.These are basic building blocks of any democratic society.

She refused to take her seat and instead sat in the First Dáil.Sinn Féin MPs in the North continue to stand on an abstentionist ticket.Responding to criticism from other Fianna Fáil TDs over their continued policy of abstentionism, Sinn Féin MP Paul Maskey said in March :“We are not British MPs, we are Irish MPs and we believe the interests of the Irish people can only be served by democratic institutions on the island of Ireland. Sinn Féin goes to the electorate seeking a mandate for that position. We are elected as MPs who vote for Sinn Féin not to take seats at Westminster.”Meanwhile, a poll by LucidTalk in June  showed that % of Sinn Féin voters backed their abstentionist stance, with only % opposed.  When supporters were asked how they would reactSinn Féin judged that it strategically suited the party to take seats in Westminster, more than half of their supporterssaid they would oppose such a move.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27475  ","story":" Michael McMonagleWe believe there is now an urgent need for an inclusive, constructive debate on the future, including how a united Ireland might be brought about and what it might look like.- Matt Carthy MEPSinn Féin will host a United Ireland conference in Letterkenny tomorrow featuring a range of speakers discussing what Irish unity would look like and how it can be achieved. The Towards A United Ireland conference will be hosted by Matt Carthy MEP and will be held in the An Grianan Theatre in Letterkenny from am tomorrow. It will feature two  discussions with contributors discussing whether an agreed Ireland is possible anda unity referendum could be won. Panellists will include journalist and unionist commentator, Alex Kane, economist Paul Gosling, founder of Equate, Michael Barron, Jonathan Shafi from the Scottish independence movement, commentator Patricia MacBride and Gillian Hamill, journalist and homelessness campaigner. The  discussions will be chaired by Damien Dowds, editor of the Inishowen Independent. Speakers from Sinn Féin will include Elisha McCallion MP, Martina Anderson MEP, Pearse Doherty TD, Matt Carthy MEP and Senator Padraig MacLochlainn. It is the fth in a series of Towards A United Ireland conferences to be held recently. Speaking ahead of the event, Matt Carthy encouraged as many people as possible to attend. \"We believe there is now an urgent need for an inclusive, constructive debate on the future, including how a united Ireland might be brought about and what it might look like. \"As part of this process Sinn Féin has organised a series of successful conferences on this theme in Dublin, Belfast, Cork and London. \"The event will give a range of perspectives on whether a new Ireland is possible and whether or not we can win a referendum on Irish unity. \"This is an important discussion and there is a place for everyone in it so I would encourage as many people as possible to come along and join us in Letterkenny,\" he said. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27476  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonBrexit means that change in the political relations between Britain and Ireland is now unavoidable, and, while partition never had any democratic legitimacy, its continued imposition is no longer sustainable.- Declan KearneyTheannual British-Irish Associationconference convened last weekend inOxford, England.At thesame time the British government was taking its latest step away from the Good FridayAgreement by changing legislation on calling elections in the north, the DUPleader pulled out from attending the BIA conference at the last minute to hostthe Tory defence minister at another DUP gala dinner in Fermanagh.OnWednesday, speaking after meeting the British Prime Minister in London sheprovided the latest evidence that the DUP has no commitment to restoring thepolitical institutions.  TheBrexit catastrophe is unfolding relentlessly.TheTory party civil war has become even more visceral since the Chequersannouncement.The RHIinquiry continues to reveal a DUP party which was clearly dysal ingovernment, providing insights which make a mockery of that partys purportedadherence to good governance’.IanPaisleys misconduct  discredited behaviour arising from the Sri Lankaepisode is yet another reminder of the recurring financial scandals associatedwith the DUP.The DUPjust does not get it!Thatparty has been in turmoil since it walked away from the draft agreement andaccommodation with Sinn Féin on th February which would have restoreding political institutions by the following week.Yet inall these circumstances the DUP feels no pressure to change its position.Andeventhe British government was so inclined, the Tories have no incentive todo so in the midst of their own governmental and party crises.Inreality some within the DUP have turned away from the political institutions.They have already decided the party should notcontest the  local council elections against the back ground of anagreement on Acht Gaeilge and Irish language rights. Its increasingly obviousthat continued political impasse is a DUP default position in the absence ofgiving political leadership and making political progress.LastMonday in a new destabilising development the Boundary Commission reaffirmedrecommendations which resemble an electoral and political gerrymander of thenorth as a counter to irreversible demographic changes.Thefact is that the Good Friday Agreement and political process are now being heldto ransom by the political self interests and unionist priorities of the DUPand the Tories.TheBritish government and DUP alliance has become a mutually reinforcing wrecker’scharter. Democratic norms are being thrown to the side and violated.In myown speech to the BIA conference I said there is now a real risk that years of progress could be squandered.Irepeated that the absence of ing political institutions is bad forsociety.Thefailure to fully implement and defend the Good Friday Agreement damagesboth the peace and political processes.And thecatastrophe of Brexit has been torpedoed into the midst of these dficulties.Thereis an imperative for us all to look beyond the scale of existing crises and to provide hope and positive vision.Sinn Féin is absolutely dedicated and authenticin our commitment to opening a new phase of the peace process whichsecures a permanent reconciliation and healing process throughout theisland of Ireland.Partitionis the central fault line at the heart of Irish politics and society.It hasbeen an abject failure from its imposition. Thesectarian structure of the northern state post partition ensured thata substantial minority were destined never to be treated asequals.TheCivil Rights Movement  years ago highlighted graphically the inability of theunionist state to treat the minority as equals.This belligerent opposition from powerful sections within politicalunionism against reform of the northern statepersists today in the form of political unionist hostility towards implementation of theGood Friday Agreement since . Therefusal of political unionism to embrace a rights-based society and equalityhas culminated in the collapse of the political institutionsand associated crisis in the north for thelast  months.Thegreater majority of citizens in the north are committed to the Good FridayAgreement.They wantrights to be guaranteed which are already enjoyed by others inDublin, London, Edinburgh and Cardf.The politicalearthquake of Brexit has again exposed the negative rolethat partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentallyanti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.Over  years into the Irish peace process, Irish citizens inthe north now face the very real and frightening potential of partition,as the main source of ision and conflict in Ireland, being reinforced.Verysignicantly, a seismic sht has also occurred in the ambitionand expectation of republicans, nationalists and other citizens inthe north.A newgeneration is questioning partition.Therepublican and nationalist constituency is now looking beyondBrexit and towards the prospect of accelerated Irish reunication.Brexithas become a defining moment for these islands.Ithas introduced a new political discourse about the future ofIreland north and south, and the relationship with Britain and Europe.Thedebate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have now movedcentre stage.Thesenew unprecedented realities in turn present new strategic challenges for all ofus in political leadership.Theydemand that we act as pioneers of the future not prisoners of the past.Thereforeit is time for a paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.Negativemismanagement of the Irish peace process and the Good FridayAgreement by successive British governments, and the particular pro-unionist bias of the Conservative governmentsince , must be replaced with a recognition that the transitiontowards Irish unity should begin.Initially thatshould take the form of preparing for a unity referendumand by engaging in a new political discussion with the Irishgovernment and all political parties on the island of Ireland in relation toreunication.Formany in the British establishment this will be an anathema.Forthose in the Tory party leadership who have tied their electoral survival to analliance with the DUP this prospect will be unthinkable.However, Brexitmeans that change in the political relations between Britain andIreland is now unavoidable, and, while partition never had any democraticlegitimacy, its continued imposition is no longer sustainable.It istime for historic, decisive and brave leadership to be shown by the Britishstate.In parallel, the Irish government needs to begin to prepare for theconstitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish unity. Itshould facilitate an open and inclusive national conversation on Irish unityinvolving all citizens, political parties, social partners and civicsociety.A GreenPaper on Irish unity should be published detailing the constitutional,political, fiscal and economic measures for a successful transition to a unitedIreland.TheIrish government should commence a discussion with the EU commission andinstitutions to explore their practical role and support in facilitating anefficient process of reunication.Politicalunionism must also open itself up to the new reality that Ireland has changeddramatically. Toomany within the leadership of the DUP, and other unionist parties, seek refugein the past, preferring to refight old battles, instead of looking forward tonew opportunities.Societalchange brought about through referenda on marriage equalityand women’s reproductive health rights means that political unionism can nolonger conjure up the spectre of ‘Rome Rule’.Demographicshts in the north are irreversible.It isimportant to note that political unionism and indeed the DUP are notmonolithic.Somevoices within unionism – few in number, but notable – have recognisedthese realities and urge fellow unionists to join the debate and tobecome pioneers of our collective future.However,republicans and nationalists need to recognise the existence of realapprehensions and fears within the unionist constituency.Unionistcitizens need to be convinced that the failures andinjustices of the past will never be repeated and that the newtransformational challenges to be faced will be managed withgenerosity and magnanimity.No onewill have any reason to leave their home in an agreed united Ireland.The %which would make up a new Ireland, who would not identy as Irish, must neverfeel the exclusion from society that was experienced by Irish citizens in thenorth under unionist rule.Aminority should be cherished because it enriches society.Diversityshould be celebrated and respected.Thispresents a strategic challenge for republicans and nationalists.Politicaland civic unionism needs to be persuaded that it can own asignicant stake within a new, pluralist, constitutional, national democracy.Republicanshave a responsibility to develop a sense of belonging for all of thosewho should be welcomed, and cherished equally as childrenof a new Ireland.Thiswill require compromises and accommodation to guarantee religious, politicaland constitutional rights.Theopportunity is emerging to reimagine Ireland to reshaperelationships and create a unity of belonging for those who definethemselves as British as well as Irish and, who share the unionist political identityand orange cultural traditions.Sinn Féin will act as a guarantor for the Britishidentity and the unionist tradition within a new and agreed united Ireland.Butfundamental change can not be left to happenstance. It must be planned andresourced.Whocould have imagined  years ago that Germany would be reunited sosuccessfully, or that the edice of South African apartheid would fallfive years later.Themodern precedents exist for successful political and economictransformation and transition.Mandelawas right: “It only seems impossible until it is done.”Irishunity is both reasonable and achievable.Irelandtoday is a multi-cultural society, north and south.We arestronger as a people for that.Sinn Féin’s vision is of a new inclusive,constitutional, rights-based democracy on the island of Ireland.Thereis so much to be excited about the rainbow ersity of modern Ireland.This isa time for us all to become pioneers for the future to be visionary with ourpolitics and to make the decisions now about planning for a new Ireland.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27477  ","story":" Michael McMonagleUachtarán na hÉireann must be a beacon of hope for all our people – North, South, East, and West.

Published by LilliputPress, Dublin. Price hardback €. Like Fenianism itself, this book hadmodest beginnings but grew to cover all of Ireland, a good part ofthe globe and half a century. Eva Ó Cathaoir began a study ofFenians in Tipperary which has evolved into one of the mostcomprehensive and important scholarly works on the Irish RepublicanBrotherhood yet published. If the film ‘Black ’ is a storyof revenge set during the Great Hunger, the phenomenon of Fenianismarose to a great extent as a political response to that colossalcrime against the Irish people by the landlord system and the Britishregime. But there was far more involved than simple vengeance.Fenianism was a democratic movement, consciously in the tradition ofthe United Irish leaders of the s, and rejecting privilege andclass distinction. In  the IRB staged the funeral of TerenceBellew McManus and brought many thousands of people onto the streets.The working-class character of the movement was clear from thisdemonstration and the author quotes the following from the haughtysnobs of the ‘KilkennyModerator’, lamenting the absence of the‘great and the good’ from the procession:“When we look back to the O’Connellgatherings or even the Young Ireland ‘Confederation’ assemblies,and remember the array of names, of borough magistrates, professionalmen and traders, accustomed to put forward as representing Kilkennyon such occasions, we cannot but view in the most ludicrous light,this miserable farce of an ‘imposing demonstration.’” The recent visit of the Pope reviveddebate among Irish republicans about the role of the Roman CatholicChurch in Irish politics. This book shows again that, with very fewexceptions, the hierarchy abhorred the IRB for its democratic andrepublican principles and the ‘princes of the Church’ fearedFenian inculcation of their ‘flocks’ with a sense ofindependence, no longer reliant on clerical and aristocratic leadersto guide them. Such guidance had led to catastrophe during the GreatHunger as the passivity preached by Daniel O’Connell and thebishops facilitated the peaceful passage of food out of a starvingcountry.Students of Irish history will befamiliar with the story of the Fenian leadership on both sides of theAtlantic, abortive rebellion and invasion, the internecine disputesand personality clashes. This book recounts all that but it goes muchdeeper. For example it tells of the Fenian women, whose storiessurely need to be rediscovered. They were treated as subordinates bymost of their male comrades but many played important roles. It was atime of deep chauvinism with even otherwise progressive Fenians suchas John Boyle O’Reilly opposing votes for women. The book covers all aspects ofFenianism and a great part of its value is in its first Appendix‘Biographies of Munster and Kilkenny Fenians’ which providesbrief profiles of , rank and file Fenians. I have never beforeseen any ‘Roll of Honour’ of the IRB but this is now providedwith a list of ‘Fenian Casualties -’ while the book closes,appropriately, with a list of Fenian monuments in Ireland andManchester. This is a beautully produced book anda credit to the publishers Lilliput Press and of course to theauthor.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27482  ","story":"Pearse Doherty: The Interview  Ruairí Doyle“Society is organised in the wrong way - we should not have a housing crisis - what is happening with our children in emergency accommodation is immoral. It is a scandal that we will look back at in twenty years with shame.” - Pearse Doherty TDSinn Féin TD and Finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty has spoken of his origins, his le and how they influence and inform both his political ideology in an extended online interview. He also outlined his vison for a New Ireland that provides achance for people to live, to work and to raise their families without thechronic levels of deprivation and inequality facing so many today. Speaking ahead of Sinn Féin’s Alternative Budget launch nextweek Deputy Doherty laid out his party’s vision “for a new economy for a NewIreland”.The Donegal TD was born in Glasgow and lived with hisparents and five siblings in a one-bedroom flat in Ibrox before the familyed home to Gweedore in Donegal in the ’s. This informed his belief that no matter when someone leftIreland, evenit were  or  years ago, they still have a great sense ofbelonging, of that tangible bond with home “that’s home - you know - Níl aontinteán mar do thinteán féin - that’s their home”, commented Teachta Doherty.Pearse, who has been a TD since , talked about his drivehome when the Dáil wraps up at the week’s end, crossing the border twice on hisway up the winding road to Donegal to his we and four boys. He also gave aninsight into the dficulty of the balance between work and home le, and theunique challenges of being a public representative. The Gaoth Dobhair resident added that it is not solely challengesthat come with being a Teachta Dala. He said: “It is what shapes you and your values. It’s yourexperience - it’s your past experience - it’s your family experience and it’swhat shapes you in Irish society, the people that are around you. The peoplewho influence you and that help shape you and that’s the values that I bring tomy job today as Finance spokesperson for the lead opposition party. It’s thevalues I will bring to the job as Minister for Finance,I am in thatposition.”Sinn Féin regularly faces accusations of employing “fairy-taleeconomics” or “economic illiteracy”.Pearse dismisses these comments as cheap throw-away remarks,designed to stunt political debate. This is a debate that Pearse opines that the establishmentparties do not want because “any fair minded person would see clearly thatthere is a need to build houses, to bring our children out of emergencyaccommodation instead of cutting taxes for the wealthiest in society.”He continued: “Where despite the fact that the three main banks aremaking €. billion in profits every year, they don’t pay any Corporation Taxand some of them won’t pay for the next twenty years.  That’s the debate they don’t want to have.”As Pearse puts it, the Budget is not just about numbers -it’s about our values and ensuring we create a new economy with strong publicservices and shared prosperity where no one is left behind and no child goeswithout.Deputy Doherty said: “Society is organised in the wrong way. We shouldnot have a housing crisis. What is happening with our children in emergencyaccommodation is immoral and it is a scandal that we will look back at intwenty years with shame.  “What is happening in our hospitals is outrageous, in a country thathas the wealth that it does.  “It is just not shared properly and it is not allocated properly andthat isn’t the fault of citizens. That is fault of politicians that decided onBudget day that the resources created by the Irish people are going to beallocated in this way.”Touching on the spectre of Brexit, as a TD for a borderconstituency, Pearse argues that the North of Ireland remaining in the EU andgiven a Special Designated status is the only way to protect people on bothsides, particularly Donegal which is isolated from the rest of the  Counties.Pearse also remarks that “the debate about Irish Unity needs to go toanother level”. He continued: “We are moving, in my view, to a position where we willhave a border poll. Where a majority of people will vote for Irish unity.  “And that will come about because of demographic changes. It will comeabout because Sinn Féin is agitating for it, and other people are recognisingthat it is in their interests that we have an end to the Irish border.”Sinn Féin is not interested in maintaining the status quoand not content to merely “tinker along the edges - where you might get anincrease in public services, an extra few gardaí, an extra few public sectorworkers, a little tax cut here” Pearse Doherty said. This Budget, and every Sinn Féin Budget, would be about our vision fora new Ireland and that vision of an equal and fair society. We would also focuson the political choices that have always been available to create that society one is prepared to make them. Teachta Doherty states in the conclusion of his interview: “Our job isto provide opportunities so that people can live and work at home. We need togive people the opportunity to raise their families at home, so that they canget through le and reach their opportunities and reach their potential athomethat’s what they wish.” test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27483  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinWe are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.- Mary Lou McDonaldDUP Leader Arlene Foster has called for fundamental changeto the Good Friday Agreement to facilitate Brexit. In other words an agreement endorsed by the majority of people north and south must make way for Brexit, a proposition rejected by a majority in the north. The latest position of the DUP leader lays bare the root of thecrisis in the north. Remember, the DUP opposed the Good Friday Agreement, campaigned for a No vote in that historic referendum and they continue to oppose the Agreement. An Agreement that has underpinned peace for over two decades.They oppose the all Ireland nature of the Agreement, they oppose the rights and safeguards of the agreement and they oppose power-sharing.   to be in them.” The institutions in the north could no-longer bear the weight of this contradiction and collapsed. This was brought to ahead by the continual refusal to implement agreements, opposition to marriage equality, rights to an inquest, an Irish language Act and the financial scandal that is the RHI Cash for Ash scheme.Add to the mix a British Government that has no understanding of Ireland, our economy or our agreements. The Tories are at war with themselves over Brexit and seem intent to bring their own country down with them. This same Tory Government entered into a toxic deal with the DUP to stay in power. That is why there are no institutions in the north, and why the DUP leadership walked away from the deal they had made with Sinn Féin in February this year to get the Assembly up and running.These latest comments by Arlene Foster are a desperate throw of the dice by an increasingly marginalised Unionist leadership. The deal with the Tories will end. Its only legacy will be Brexit. Meanwhile Ireland north and south is changing and a New Ireland is emerging. The joyous revolution of Marriage Equality and Repeal of the Eighth has resonated with a new generation in the north. The largest political demonstration in Belfast is Pride. A magnicent event that celebrates the ersity of identities that make up our communities.Similarly there is a growing demand for access to abortion services. As a placard proudly announced in Dublin Castle when the Repeal result came through, “The North is Next”.Brexit has also unied those who voted to remain within the EU. Brexit will be a disaster for the economy in the north, particularly for agriculture. A community that values prosperity and access to the EU is looking beyond Brexit and Westminster and instead towards Irish Unity. We are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.As for Arlene Foster and the DUP - the game is up. If their leadership want the institutions in the north up and working then they must support real power sharing, respect, equality and the rights of others. When this happens Sinn Féin will be a willing partner. Now is the time for political courage, to look forward in the interests of all communities. Meanwhile the debate on Irish unity and a unity referendum grows. I am confident that we can build a New United Ireland, a home for all that share this island. That is the big challenge for our generation. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27486  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National Chairperson“The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office”Ive been wondering lately whether anyone in Democratic Unionist Partyleadership circles actually try to reflect upon what republicans, nationalists, and other progressive minded citizens think about the current political situation.Do they even care what others think The evidence suggests not.Several days ago the DUP leader pronounced that her party could and would change the Good Friday Agreementat a whim. There was no hint of irony in her claim – the DUP has spent the last  years opposing the GFA, ever since it was signed.In another extraordinary, but not untypical, outburst she declared her blood red line position on Brexit and, that in the same week as the consultation on dealing with the past was concluding!Of course the DUP leader, and other key figures have form in making offensive and provocative political interventions.Her dehumanising description of republicans as \"crocodiles\" in  comes to mind.Notably, she previously called republican and nationalist Ministers in a ing Executive ‘rogues and renegades.Only the DUP knows whether this leader is naturally predisposed to being rhetorically gaffe prone, or is being deliberately offensive.Perhaps some figures in the DUP do think about wider opinion: the DUP is not a monolith after all.But, those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power sharing.  They oppose equality and rights, and reject reconciliation.Instead they have chosen to join forces with the extremists in the British Tory party to help steer the Brexit train wreck.The DUP leadership is living in a delusional bubble.Meanwhile, the party brand has become indistinguishable from the financial scandals of recent years such as Red Sky, NAMA, Brexit dark money, and financial relationships with Sri Lanka.The ongoing RHI inquiry exposé of how the DUP behaved in government makes a complete mockery of its purported adherence to good governance’.The party MPs have become power drunk through their pact with the Tories, and a serious misconception that they are king makers in Westminster.  Edward Carsons cautionary words have clearly been forgotten or disregarded.  He warnedWhat a fool I was.  I was only a puppet, and so was Ulster… in the political game that was to get the Conservative party into power.’ The DUP has a tactical approach towards everything including maintaining the status quo on its own terms, slowing down and frustrating progressive societal change, and maintaining sectarian dominance within the unionist constituency.The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office.  Its inability and refusal to embrace dference or celebrate ersity is reflected in an institutionalised bigotry against, and intolerance towards the Irish national identity and cultural traditions, and LGBT rights.The partys contempt and sharp practice in government has destroyed wider public confidence in the political institutions, and led to the decisive tipping point of RHI and withdrawal of the Líofa grant scheme in the winter of .As a result of its ingrained arrogance and lack of political humility the DUP leadership is constantly in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarianism, homophobia, and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists, and many others, including sections of civic unionism, do not believe the DUP is serious about restoring genuine power sharing. These citizens want the institutions to be restored, but not at the risk of allowing the DUP to continue practicing discrimination, disrespect, intimidation, bigotry, and sharp practice. They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power on that basis.  And, neither will Sinn Féin.The DUPs behaviour, and the onslaught of Brexit have together brought back graphically into focus the denial of rights which resulted in the Civil Rights Movement fty years ago.A generational realignment has occurred within northern nationalism.Acht Gaeilge, marriage equality, womens reproductive health rights, legacy justice rights, and the demand for a Bill of Rights are the modern day acid test equivalents of one person, one vote.  The current crisis in the north of Ireland is the visceral culmination of  years of DUP push back against the GFA.Intoxicated with its imaginary power at Westminster, the DUP leadership has finally over played its hand. The political institutions could have been re-established by the th February last, but the DUP leaders walked out of negotiations.Instead of selling the deal which they negotiated in February with Sinn Féin, the DUP leader, deputy leader, party chief executive, and its senior talks team bottled out.Since then the party has been convulsed with the resultant internal fall out.  There has been no meaningful contact with Sinn Féin, and absolutely no willingness demonstrated to resume negotiations.Any advocacy of blood red lines is a total anathema to democracy.The wider nationalist constituency is fed up to the back teeth with the subversion of the political process by the DUP, the British Tory government and others in political unionism.It is more impatient than ever for equality, rights and parity of esteem.  The history of  is being replayed. Thousands marching from Duke Street in Derry city on Saturday th October to mark the iconic civil rights march  years before is the latest example of that.  An exciting momentum for change is taking place across Ireland, north and south.  Old orthodoxies are being eclipsed by discussions about new, modern, all-Ireland constitutional and political arrangements. The permanent unionist electoral majority is gone and demographic changes are irreversible.All of this puts the onus back upon both governments to act decisively to address the denial of rights.The Irish government needs to take the lead because for now the DUP has this British government over a barrel.  But thats a short-term situation.  A British general election in the immediate to mid term cannot be ruled out.A new political discourse has begun about the future. All sections of society need to be involved in this and the unionist is critical in all of this.Brexit, the GFA, citizens rights, and an Irish unity referendum are central to that. Progressives should explore common ground and alliances for change.Republicans and unionists need to start to face the same way.  We have to begin looking at each other through eyes of the future.The benchmarks of a rights-based society guaranteeing civil and religious liberties and equality for all, are set.  These are not negotiable.So, whoever is actually in charge of the DUP for the time being has a lot of serious thinking to do...Who now leads the DUP  Do they have the authority to negotiate and stick to an agreement Are they committed to a shared future with republicans, nationalists, and others in the north Unless, and until the DUP can clearly answer these questions for the rest of society, it will remain exactly where it is now – out of power, and facing the inevitable fate about which Carson warned: getting dumped by the British Tories.test"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1077173.jpg--.jpg?1539084908000\n","title":"public mystified by disappearing planters","story":"LOCAL people have been mystied as to why the large street planters, bought at considerable cost to ratepayers, have vanished from the Ballymena townscap.Many members of the public have been contacting theto enquire what has happened the planters and whether they willto the streets.The large containers, which were added to the town centre as part of the poundmillion public realm scheme were initially the subject of public scorn but by early June many of them had been filled with blooms, adding some colour and vibrant appearance to the town.So, when the best of the planters with superb floral displays were taken away, virtually overnight, many locals were puzzled.However it must be admitted that some of the planters - originally dubbed ‘skips’ by local people, were in a poor state or repair.When thecontacted the Council to askthey were gone for good, they responded by saying the planters had been taken to a Council yard to be replanted, but will be ed to the town centre when this is complete.Eagle-eyed members of the public have also been asking why the planters had been moved from the original storage area at the site of the old Wellington Street church. Council simply said they are now being stored at a Council yard.Meanwhile people have also been concerned as to the whereabouts of the original town centre bandstand.The plan for this was for it to be re-established in the Peoples Park, however this has not yet happened.When thecontacted Council for a statement, they said: “We are delighted with the success to date of Harmony Hub – our borough’s newest and state-of-the-art outdoor entertainment venue.“Harmony Hub has showcased a wide range of talented local artists since it opened earlier this year and we look forward to welcoming more great performances and attractions.Speaking about the original bandstand, the Council confirmed they have plans for it.“The old bandstand was carefully dismantled so it can be preserved and relocated to the People’s Park.“We are currently working on plans for this installation and more information will be made available in due course.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1065046.jpg--.jpg?1538637007000\n","title":"tension in chamber over gaa dinner","story":"AN INVITE for councillors to a GAA gala dinner stoked up tensions in the Council chamber last week.A request from St Ergnats GAC to invite members of Mid and East Antrim to the Tullyglass on November  was read to members.It followed an item on the agenda with members being invited to a gala dinner in support of NI Childrens Hospice.Members had agreedthey were to attend the hospice dinner that they would purchase their own tickets.When the GAA dinner was raised Councillor Carson proposed to mark it as read as the club was not located in the Mid and East Antrim boundary lines.However Councillor Declan OLoan said the club was located in Moneyglass which fell very close to the border and that a lot of players at the club lived within the Mid and East Antrim Borough.He added: This is an outstanding club like many others in the area who raise a lot of money and doesnt depend on its council for support.I would propose we do the same for this as we are doing for the hospice.Councillor Gaston seconded Councillor Carsons proposal to mark the invitation as read.If anyone wishes to attend this they should go in their own capacity.Councillor Maguire added that the issue of location of the club should not come into the decision.He added: If I remember correctly some members of this Council attended a dinner in Lurgan or Portadown for the British Legion so that set a precedent.I would second what Councillor OLoan has said and treat this invite similar to that of the hospice dinner.Councillor Gaston added that both invitations were completely dferent.The Northern Ireland Hospice does sterling work and is for the benefit of people all over Northern Ireland. It is not just for a section of the community.Councillor Carsons proposal to mark the invite as read was carried with a vote of  in favour.The event is to mark the clubs th anniversary with special guests including champion jockey Tony McCoy.It will be held in the Tullyglass Hotel on November .

EasyJet pilot Alex Hawthorne who is originally from Waringstown Now the proud pilot of an Easyjet airbus , Alex, , graduated from Oxford Aviation Academy earlier this year and is based in Venice.She lives with her Italian boyfriend Edgar, whom she met during her pilot training.It has been  years since Alex left her home in Waringstown at the age of  to start a new le in Canada.The move came about after her mum Alison – a flight attendant for many years – married a Canadian pilot whom she met on her travels.    Alex began to pursue a career as a pilot when she moved to Canada They married in  and the family now live in Kitchener, Ontario, roughly an hour outside Toronto. Inspired by her step-dad Doug Glussich, Alex gained her full private pilot’s licence, her first step towards her dream of becoming a commercial pilot.She said: “Mum was a flight attendant so I was kind of exposed to flying from an early age, but it was when I met my step-dad that I first thought that maybe I could be a pilot.”She admitted that having realised her dream, it was not all plain sailing given that her profession is male-dominated: “I’m based in Venice with EasyJet. I’m the only female first officer and there’s also a female captain.    Alex with her grandparents in the cockpit “There’s just the two females out of -strong flight crew.” She said: “I do think things are going in the right direction, especially with EasyJet. They have a scholarship called the Amy Johnson initiative which offers fully paid flight training to females who they pick. “They are trying to drive more females into it, but it is a slow process.”\"  \"  Northern Irelands best fish and chip shop has been revealed Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"She added: “It can sometimes be challenging. You feel you have to prove your worth.   Alex giving her valedictorian speech at Oxford “A lot of the males, the captains, are very good. They take the sex out of it. If you’re a good pilot, your a good pilot – end of story.“Through training I felt that I had to be a little bit better than the boys because I’m a girl.“I have unfortunately encountered a few negative comments, not from any co-workers, but from passengers. It’s been especially from older male passengers when they see a female pilot sitting in the cockpit they things like, ‘maybe I’d be safer getting a dferent flight’. It’s said in jokey way, they’re from a dferent time, but I don’t like hearing it because to me being a pilot is not a joke.“I’ve only had two or three of those comments, it’s not a regular thing.”Talking about the longevity of a career as a pilot, Alex said: “Pilot retirement age is  simply for medical reasons. You have medicals once a year until you get to over , then your medicals come once every six months.”She said: “I’m very settled where I am for now. EasyJet is a fantactic company, they really look after their employees, the money is good, the benefits are good. “To start your career flying an Airbus  is fabulous – it’s one of the best jets around.“However I’ve always had my sights on going long haul. I’d love to try the Boeing ‘triple sevens’, or the s or even the Airbus s, because the bigger the better, right “Before my career ends I would definitely like to try a bigger jet.”She continued@ “The longest flight I’m doing now is from Venice to Edinburgh. It’s two and half hours but from October we’ll be doing Lanzarote and Tel Aviv – those will be three and half hours each.“The Airbus that I fly now simply wouldn’t have the mileage to do more than seven hours. To do that I’d have to go to a bigger airbus – a , or to the Boeing .”Going back to her first time on board an airplane, Alex said: “The first time I was on a commercial aircraft was when I was four years old. I was going to Lanzarote with my parents and brother. “I was really excited. The noise was a bit frightening, but I loved the speed of the take off. “Back in those days you were still allowed to visit the pilots in the flight deck, so my brother and I went up with a flight attendant and I remember wondering what all the buttons were for.”Alex is now pleased to offer the same opportunities to children: “After we land we’ll have young boys and girls coming in to the cockpit. They give you so much respect, and are so interested. “If I could give any advice to the girls out there thinking of becoming a pilot, I’d say go for it.”The reassuring tone of a pilot is something that goes hand-in-hand with air travel, but are the men and women in the cockpit putting on a special voice to talk to passengers or is it their actual demeanour Alex explained: “They say everybody has a PA voice, they just want to sound as professional as they can. When I speak on board, I don’t want to come on with a really thick Northern Irish accent because nobody will understand me. It’s about clarity and getting the message across.”She added: “Pilots don’t only do medical testing. We do psychoanalysis testing. Pilots are calm. It’s in our nature. If a bad situation occurs we need to be able to handle it quickly and efficiently.“They’re not faking the voice, that’s their personality and how they are. That’s why they’re pilots.”Of her own journey she said: “Training was loads of hard work. My programme with Oxford was  months. It’s non-stop.“You have to say goodbye to your social le, but what’s  months in the grand scheme of things.“As a pilot, I’m quite happy to be a passenger. We work hard so it’s nice for me to let someone  fly. I’m completely as ease because I know the training the pilots have been through.”Talking of the most challenging manoeuvres she has had to carry out, Alex said: “When we went to Oxford we had to do upset recovery training. “We went into an aerobatic aircraft which is designed to be able to do all sorts of manoeuvres. “They put us into barrel rolls, spiral es. “Because we’re flying the big jets it’s very unlikely they will be able to get into a spiral e because computer systems have protection it wouldn’t let you. “However we always have to think of worst case scenariothese protections failed.”She commented: “In high school my strong subjects were maths and physics, when it comes to the theory behind flying I didn’t find it too overwhelming.“To get to spin an aircraft is a lot of fun. I feel like I’m in the red arrows.“I’ve been in planes from a young age. “It’s second nature to me, I don’t even flinch at it.”But what of those people who more than flinch at the prospect of air travel Alex said: “EasyJet actually do have a programme from Luton once a year where they take nervous fliers up on a free flight. “They have two pilots up front and two pilots in the cabin with the passengers explaining to them step-by-step from the take off to the landing what is happening and what are the noises you hear.“I can promise you this,it was completely dangerous I wouldn’t be doing it every day. “I think it’s fear of the unknown that makes people afraid.”Askedthere was training in place to deal with terrorist attacks, Alex said: “We do hijack training. We’re trainedanything were to happen we’re able to send out a squawk code which sends a message directly to Air Traffic Control.“Even everyday stuff – before we push back for the taxi until we get to the gate – the cockpit door is closed and will only be open for examplewe need to go to the bathroom. “We need to call cabin crew and they need to come to guard the doorwe have to leave the cockpit. “We take measures to ensure the cockpit door will not be breached. It’s also bulletproof. They’ve changed everything since  .”She explained how she came to be stationed in Italy: “The reason why I’m in Venice is because I met an Italian called Edgar during the training.”Alex and Edgar, , who is from Milan, soon became an item.She said: “Towards the end of our course we were able to say where we wanted to go. Edgar and I said we don’t mind where we’re placed but we’d like to be together. They put us both in Venice.“I’m still struggling a bit with the language – Italian has a lot of grammar in it. To get by I know the basics. It’s great to have an Italian speaker with me, in Italy a lot of places are remote and they don’t speak English.”Asked how much they see of each other, Alex said: “For the first year with EasyJet you’re on a flexi-roster so you can be working for three days then have two days off. “Sometimes we’re on completely opposite shts. He could be starting at am and I can be on lates working pm to midnight. Sometimes we’ll just see each other in the crew room, say hello and that’s it. “Some weeks you pass each other but others we get time off together when we can do whatever we want. It’s part of the job.”Alex said she also tried to go back to Waringstown as much as possible to visit relatives."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8658944.1538772078!/image/image.jpg","title":"northern

A mother and grandmother, Cindy, who was just , has been described as an ‘inspirational’ figure both to her family, friends and those she mentored.   Cindy Greer Her son Aaron Greersaid: “My mum was the rock of the family. We all depended on her. “I think we all feel a bit lost right now. To have the person you have always depended upon taken away from you so suddenly, it is dficult to deal with. “She was the most amazing, inspirational person in my le. It is so hard to put into words what she meant to us. “This was always a happy house. I have such good memories because of mum. She brought all of us together. She has two grandchildren and loved them to pieces. The family was mum’s big love. Any excuse for a family gathering to bring us all together. Christmas dinner was always here with everyone around the table.”Her mum Joan Newell is simply heartbroken. She said she couldn’t imagine never seeing her eldest daughter Cindy again. “I just love her so much. She was always there for me and did whatever she could to make my le better.“She was such a rock in this family. She phoned me last Wednesday after she had been talking to Alan. I asked herwe would see her that night but she had a client coming and she would see me on Thursday afternoon. That was the last we spoke.“I was at a meeting in church on Wednesday night and a couple of people came in late and said there had been a terrible accident. I said ‘God help whoever it is’. Little did I know it was Cindy. I couldn’t take it in when I heard the news.”Her partner of  years Alan McIvor said she was coming from work last Wednesday and phoned him on her hands-free around pm to say she was leaving. “She asked how my day was and she was her usual cheery self.“She said to put the tea on, and I reckoned she would be home about .pm. Sadly she didn’t make it.”Her red Honda Civic had been involved in a collision with a van at around .pm.“Someone stopped at the scene and started CPR then Cindy was resuscitated by paramedics.

But the worst thing for a child is to lose a mother. There are no words good enough to describe the person my Mummy is or how I feel at this present moment. Even though her fabulous personality shone throughout every part of her and her le, I am going to miss the simple things like goodnight kisses, the constant ‘I love you millions my special girl’ and the hour long chats about our dreams. I am so so privileged to call her my mother and she made sure she gave all of us the most heart-warming special memories that will stay with us a letime.“Her smile, her laugh, her humour, her love will always be with me. I love you millions forever Mum.”Cindy’s sister Julie Newell said she was  years younger than her and for many years took on a motherly role. “That grew into a friendship, sister relationship which was amazing. She was my biggest support. She is the heart of this family. She was the boss as the oldest sister. She took all the decisions for mum and dad as their health isn’t great.”Cindy and her partner Alan had been together for  loving years. Alan firmly believes Cindy made him a better man. “She was a total and utter inspiration and has improved my le. She was just what I needed.“We met when we both worked for the First Trust Bank, although in dferent departments. We enjoyed such brilliant times together - so many things, holidays and weekends away that I have great memories of.“Over the last few days people have said to me that Cindy and I did more in the last  years than a lot of people have done in a letime.“We had outline plans for Cindy’s th birthday in a year and a half and that is something I will have to deal with.“It is absolutely devastating. She was my rock and inspiration to be a better person.” Cindy grew up in Gilford’s Barrack Hill and went to Craigavon Primary School in the town and on to Tandragee Junior High School.

Her other sister Tracy McConnell is involved in with a children’s missionary charity called Abaana based in Bangor. Through that charity, Cindy sponsored a little boy called George in Uganda.Cindy’s partner Alan said some of the family will be taking over this sponsorship and that is why the family feel it is appropriate that donations in lieu of flowers are to the Abaana charity c o Milne Funeral Services.The family have been overwhelmed by the huge support and love since Cindy passed away.Her son Aaron said the kindness of everyone has been ‘unbelievable’ with so many gts of flowers, food and cards.“We always knew mum was popular but didn’t realise just how many lives she had touched.“We now know how much she was loved by everyone around her and how much she loved us... we will always love her.”The family also want to thank the wider family circle and friends for their support and kindness, those who attended the accident scene for their assistance and medical intervention, the PSNI Liaison Officer who has been a tower of strength and support to them the ‘absolutely amazing’ hospital staff and consultants at the Royal Victoria Hospital and the funeral director for his compassion and professionalism.

On the one side are those who think that an orgy of union jack-waving to the strains of Land of Hope and Glory is an excellent idea on the other side are those with a titter of wit.Squinter can recall two similar Ulsterfests in his letime, both of them when he was a youngster. The most recent one was the queen’s  silver jubilee, when Britain vos celebratink der th anniversary von der coronation von Elizabeth Saxe-Coburg und Gotha. Loyal Ulster being loyal Ulster, it ended up cheering loudest and, West Belfast being West Belfast, we decided to celebrate the auspicious occasion with a non-stop summer of rioting as a result of which Squinter’s right arm remains sore to this day.The earlier one was the rather creepy and sinister ‘Ulster ’’ – a celebration of  years of partition that was held on land between Botanic Park and the Stranmillis Embankment. The idea was hatched in December  by Prime Minister Terence O’Neill: “In that yearNorthern Ireland will celebrate its th anniversary –  years of challenge and dficulty and occasional disappointment, but also  years of splendid achievement, of growing prosperity, of expanding opportunity.”By the summer of , though, when the gates opened to the public, Terry was out on his ear, having been done for by a combination of opposition by UUP hardliners to his limited programme of civil rights reforms and a series of UVF bomb attacks on Belfast’s water supply. He jacked it in in April  and in an interview a month later he revealed the depth of his passion for reform: “It is frightfully hard to explain to Protestants thatyou give Roman Catholics a good job and a good house they will live like Protestants because they will see neighbours with cars and television sets they will refuse to have eighteen children. Buta Roman Catholic is jobless and lives in the most ghastly hovel he will rear eighteen children on National Assistance. If you treat Roman Catholics with due consideration and kindness they will live like Protestants in spite of the authoritative nature of their Church.”Ulster ’ cracked on regardless, although the loss of a man so imbued with the spirit of egalitarianism must have been a crushing blow. An expectant public surged through the gates when the exhibition opened in May for a five month .Looking back at the photographic and filmic evidence that survives, it’s clear that the attractions on the site were, ah, modest, to say the least. Let’s see now… there was a big, multi-coloured plastic model of the Giant’s Causeway over the door of the main indoor space there was, um, a model of a Shorts plane hanging overhead there were fairground ridesthere was a disco with go-go girls a £m satellite was launched containing a message of peace from Ulster to any le forms who may happen across it. .By far the most exciting thing to happen during Ulster ’ was the introduction of internment, which wasn’t technically part of the show although doubtless it was wildly popular with a fair percentage of Ulster ’ attendees and organisers.The last bit of air went out of the balloon when it was finally decided that there would be no royal visit because the safety of the afore-mentioned Saxe-Coburg von Gothas could not be guaranteed.As for posterity, the BBC – normally an enthusiastic booster of Our Wee Country – reported in an article in : “The official government report did not describe it as a success and ultimately it is remembered as a bland effort in self-promotion for a state that was teetering on the brink of implosion.”Which brings us back to Gammonfest – sorry, the Festival of GB and THP. What’s that going to look like on this side of the Irish Sea border in four years time  Well, flags, of course – there’ll be plenty of those. But then there always is, so Ulster’s going to have to do a bit of thinking outside the box here. Marches – ditto. Bonfires – ditto. What about a festival, then  One with a funfair and the Giant’s Causeway and.. and.. never mind, you get the idea. We could call it Ulster ’. Or Catch .

Yet, Ciaran Johnston had the final say on proceedings to nail a free under intense pressure and in the face of a strong cross-field wind. As the underdogs, some may feel that St John’s had their chance the first day as favourites have a habit of winning replays. However, St John’s manager Tony McNulty sees it dferently and has urged his side to make to most of Sunday’s second chance to reach the county final. “We just took our foot of the pedal in the last few minutes. I said before the game that we had to play for  or  minutes and we only played for  minutes,” said McNulty. “We were four or five points ahead late on and we just switched off. “We switched off long enough for them to get their goal and it was nervous at the end. While we scored to draw the game, we felt we had done enough to win the game. “We’ll not be going into this match thinking we’ve missed the boat. “When Neil McManus hit that free I though “here we go again” – thankfully Ciaran Johnston stepped up and scored his free. We were disappointed having led not to hold on.“We can’t afford to switch off again – Cushendall are too good. When you have players like Neil McManus, Arron Graffin and Alex Delargy, we can’t afford to. I can’t see there being much in the game again this Sunday.” McNulty also gave his views on the worrying scenes which marred the end of the match when two Cushendall supporters jumped over the wire at Dunloy to confront the St John’s players in the dying minutes of the game. With such incidents in the spotlight in recent weeks, the intruders could have sparked a much more serious flashpoint, but order was soon restored. While McNulty condemned the actions of those involved, he feared the game might have been brought to a premature end with his side one point in arrears at the time. “There was a bit of carryon at the sideline which had nothing to do with us,” reflected McNulty “The ball was in among four or five Cushendall men and one of their players pulled on it.“He hit his own player and one of our players. It resulted in a bit of pushing – nothing serious. “Two of their supporters jumped over the wire. “I don’t know why, but they started throwing punches until the players got them off the pitch. “I was glad the referee continued the game and gave us the chance to equalise and thankfully the people were identied.” It is believed that the Cushendall player who was struck by his own teammate was Antrim ace Eoghan Campbell, who is likely to miss Sunday’s replay as a result of the hand injury sustained late in the drawn encounter. St John’s will also be without one of their leading players for the remainder of the campaign after attacker Donal Carson departed for Australia last week, but Simon McCrory is expected to be fit to play a greater role in the replay having played the second half in the drawn game. “Donalis away to Australia so that’s a big blow for us,” added McNulty. “I don’t know what happened, but there was something about the dates and he couldn’t get them changed. “It is unfortunate because he has been playing well for us. “In nearly every game, he has scored a goal for us. If Campbell is out for them, it evens things up a bit. “Simon McCrory should be good to go. He is a super player for us and he has been outstanding in every game he has played this year. He wasn’t right for the last game. All being well, the two-week break will do him good.” McNulty will also have the task of lting the dual players in the club following their semi-final football defeat at the hands of Creggan last Sunday. Senior finalists in , the Johnnies were edged out - to - by Kevin Madden’s men at Glenavy, but McNulty, whose son Ryan is a key member of both squads, doesn’t think the dual players will suffer any hangover from that defeat. “We are disappointed, but we have to hang in,” stated the Johnnies boss. “We didn’t play as well as we can do on Sunday, so we can have no complaints. “Things conspired against us on the day. Simon McDonagh’s we went into labour on Sunday morning so he was unavailable. Peter McCallin wasn’t back from holiday in time. “We had six or seven dual players in action on Sunday who will feature again this weekend. “They’ll lt themselves up alright. “It would have been great to going into the match trying to reach two senior finals, but we have to focus on Sunday’s game now.” With Division One winners and  champions Dunloy out following their surprise loss to Loughgiel, the remaining sides will all fancy their chances of lting the Volunteer Cup later this month. The Shamrocks will get a chance to view their final opponents over the course of  minutes in Ballycastle on Sunday, but it would come as no great surprisean additional  minutes was required to separate St John’s and Cushendall.Roisin’s relief as decision to deny PIP is overturnedPic of the day, Thursday, October Search The Site \" onblur\"\"  Advertising Belfast Media Group copy .

We also cannot thank Ciaran Cunningham of Michael Brentnall Solicitors enough for his help with getting this disgraceful decision overturned.“Roisin still has a huge battle ahead of her but we believe this new treatment will be successful, her new treatment is very tough on her, Roisin’s cancer is a very fast growing cancer, her new treatment is making her very lethargic and it has nasty side effects but she is prepared, she knows what she is up against and she will continue to fight.”Pic of the Day, Wednesday, October Johnnies haven’t missed the boat insists McNultySearch The Site \" onblur\"\"  Advertising Belfast Media Group copy .

MPs were told the two main areas that need addressed are transformation of the education system and an ongoing funding shortfall.The committee heard that while progress has been made, the education system is still facing considerable financial pressures.The spending power of education budgets has fallen by £m since  , the MPs were informed.Yesterdays committee hearing was told that schools and services have faced unprecedented demands as a result of having to absorb increased costs such as pay and inflationary pressures. These have been impacted by rises in National Insurance and changes to superannuation and the ongoing increasing demands related to children and young people with special and additional needs. The committee heard that principals have reported \"intolerable strain\" caused by the deteriorating financial position placed upon them.Other key pressures raised during yesterdays committee include the increased need for early intervention to meet the growing and increasingly complex needs of children. There is also an increasing need for support to children who have additional and special educational needs.MPs were told of the need to close attainment gaps and improve the skills levels of children and young people. Speaking afterwards, Ms OConnor said there was a clear need to transform the education sector. \"This will require investment galvanising the skills and innovative thinking of the people within the sector,\" she said.\"This transformation will deliver improved value for money in the use of public funds and will enable and support school leaders to deliver improved outcomes.\"Transformation has already begun and improvements and progress has been made with school performance and investment in the schools estate through new buildings. \"To propel this further we support the identication of earmarked resources, for example a transformation investment fund to support the continued modernisation of services, skills and culture, to transform the system and to immediately support schools, children and young people and services during transformation.\""},{"url":null,"title":"photographers booked for christian bakers in gay cake case refuse to hand over images","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsGood Friday AgreementSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupSchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotorcyclingMotor SportOther SportsBelfast GiantsBoxingTennisCricketCyclingHorse RacingHockeyRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitTechJobsAgriBalmoral ShowAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentHoroscopesNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeSeptember June CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoArchiveEventsSpirit of N.

Bredagh had other ideas and points from the towering Niall McFarland and Joe Hanrahan suddenly had their side in front.Gerard Quinn fired over the equalising score in the fth minute, but it was all down hill after this for Ballycran as they were put under the cosh by a blistering Bredagh attack.Unanswered points from Hanrahan, Sean Hughes and the fleet-footed Ronan Costello had Bredagh - to - in front after  minutes. It got an awful lot worse for a wasteful Ballycran when Hughes drilled the sliotar to the back of the net after a defence-splitting run from Matt McAreavey.Costelloand Hughes rubbed salt into Ballycranrsquos wounds as gave Bredagh a commanding - to - lead by the nd minute.Ballycran were then thrown a leline when Stuart Martin ended a piercing run with a clinical finish to leave seven points in it with seven minutes of the half remaining.Alas, Ballycran were unable to push on from here and Bredagh punished them on the break with points from Costelloand Hughes to take a - to - lead as the break approached.Martin and McFarland swapped points before Ballycranrsquos task got even harder when star midfielder Phelim Savage, who was part of the clubrsquos senior team who lted the SHC title in Ballygalet last Sunday, was harshly red-carded leaving his side to play the entire second half with only  men.It all could have been so dferent for Ballycran at the end of the first half. They shot seven wides, had a strong penalty appeal turned down and arasping shot from Gerard Quinn rattled against the crossbar and flew to safety.An early point at the start of the second half from Ballycranrsquos Francis Caldwell was cancelled out by Hughes before Martin and P J Lavery did likewise. Costello edged Bredagh into a - to - lead after  minutes, but a battling Ballycran took the next three points from Francis Caldwelland Liam McCarthy.Bredagh halted Ballycranrsquos momentum with a point from Hughes before McCarthy cancelled his score out with another free.Costello and Joe Blaney extended Bredaghrsquos lead to  points before Caldwell kept Ballycran ticking over with a point from play as his team-mates went for goal.Three Costello points in quick succession had Bredagh in wonderland before Caldwell converted a free in the th minute to make it a - to - game. Naturally, Ballycran continued to go for goals, but Bredagh were not for conceding anything and late points from Costello and Jacob McDonnell gave then a resounding win.Bredagh: Odhran Davies, Aaron Patterson, Tiarnan Sheehan, Evin Maguire, Aodhan OrsquoKeefe, Niall McFarland , Liam Hogan, Matt McAreavey, Joe Hanrahan , Dara Curran, Sean Hughes , Joe Blaney , Ciaran McMullan, Ronan Costello , Enda Gargan.

Last Wednesday nightrsquos attack on St Patrickrsquos Primary School has been equally disturbing to police, who feel that a new wave of criminology seems to be underway.This time they witnessed the destruction of the schoolrsquos tuck shop which had just been stocked up with almost pound worth of stock. Everything was scattered round the hall and even on to the adjoining football field. Fire extinguishers were turned on and directed at tape recorders, which were destroyed.Police are treating the crime seriously and have appealed to for any information to help them in their inquiries. Fingerprints have been taken.This latest wave of school destruction is already being regarded as monstrous in terms of the community. No-one, it seems, saw anything, but this could be indicative of the public turning their back, lest they should suffer recriminations.Brother Otteran, headmaster at St Patrickrsquos, was abhorred at the destruction. He permitted a Down Recorder photographer to visit the scene and had no objections to the crime being publicised.HOLLYWOOD mdash The widely-held belief that Hollywood actress Greer Garson was born and bred in Down District has been scotched.

It is turning into death-trap with dficult turning circles that intrude on pedestrians and oncoming traffic, she explained.ldquoThe meeting with roads officials took place at .am so they were able to see the situation for themselves with everybody having to demonstrate nimble footwork, ing out of the way of oncoming traffic.Cllr Enright said the pavement currently ran only half way up Racecourse Hill and the road was not wide enough for two-way traffic.ldquoRoads officials have agreed to a one-way system which will allow vehicles to drive down the hill when a new pavement is in place. Traffic calming measures will also be provided to ensure vehicles do not race down the hill.

It is for this reason I am delighted with the recent decision of Newry, Mourne and Down Council to endorse and back my call for a peoplersquos vote on Brexit.Across the UK, more and more people are asking for this vote to have the opportunity to pass their final judgement on what will define us for generations to come. Brexit will affect everyone and we should be looking at the detail and allowing everyone the right to have their say.This is not only a moment for those of us who voted to remain, but also the growing number of people who voted to leave and now see the ramications of Brexit will be so widespread.Northern Ireland only works when based on sharing and interdependence, yet Brexit entails new isions, barriers and friction. We can stop those isions by supporting political stability and protecting the Good Friday Agreement, maintaining open borders throughout these islands and protecting our economy and enabling future opportunities.This is not about overturning democracy. Indeed, nothing is more democratic than allowing people to have their say. Democracy cannot be overturned by applying more democracy.Rather than answering a question, more questions can often emerge at the result of an election. This is the case with the EU Referendum of . Since the end of the Second World War, we have had four sets of general elections which have occurred within two years of each other. I doubt anyone would argue these elections occurring in any way subverted the democratic process.We are witnessing almost daily the complexities of interdependence, which we benefit from, that have developed between member nations of the EU. These complexities were brushed aside by many of the leave side as unnecessary and easy to re-establish on better terms. Yet, with six months to go, these same leavers have not managed to propose anything which has come close to a pragmatic workable solution. For these leavers to now claim to speak on behalf of the lsquowill of the peoplersquo is a hood.This leads to bad politics and bad democracy through containing the lsquowill of the peoplersquo to a one-time snapshot within history. This precludes the people from quite simply changing their mind. Just as a healthy democracy requires constant checks and restraints placed upon the government of the day, departure from the EU should require the continuing consent of the people.We are without an Executive, and thus without a voice, in what is the most tumultuous constitutional period in generations. Our preparation for leaving the EU is based upon a two-page letter written over two years ago and being carried out by civil servants.This is a complete abdication of responsibility and the duty of governance by those elected to lead this society. Instead, our politicians have retreated into the safe confines of their own ideology, rather than search for a consensus which is best for the country.It is time for the people to take back control. What we have seen is an abject failure of politicians to lead in the face of this crisis. Instead, they have retreated into the confines of their own ideology rather than search for a consensus within the country. That extends not only from Westminster, but also closer to home.Only a peoplersquos vote can begin the untying of this Gordian knot.bull The South Down Alliance Party is organising a Brexit  discussion in the Newcastle Centre on Thursday, October , between pm and pm..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Response times not what we wish%2C says ambulance chief  ","story":"NORTHERN Irelandrsquos most senior ambulance official has conceded that the local community has not been receiving the emergency response that it deserves.The admission from Ambulance Service chief executive Michael Bloomfield came during a public meeting in Downpatrick on Monday night organised by the Down Community Health Committee.However, Mr Bloomfield hopes the service will improve when proposed changes to how the organisation responds to calls are implemented.A review of current despatch procedures has resulted in the development of proposals mdash currently out to public consultation ndash which aim to provide the most immediate and appropriate clinical response to the most seriously ill or injured.Mr Bloomfield insisted the proposed changes to the way all calls are categorised were not a cost cutting exercise and nothing to do with achieving targets. He said the main thrust was to provide a safer, quality service.The chief executive revealed that implementing the new model will require the recruitment of an additional  frontline ambulance staff over the next three to five years and cost in the region of poundm.ldquoOur firm view is that the proposed changes will provide a better quality and safer service and go a long way to meeting the challenge in providing an effective response times to communities such as the one in this area which has not been getting the sort of response that we would wish, said Mr Bloomfield, who viewed Mondayrsquos meeting as the first in a series as part of the organisationrsquos consultation on how it aims to improve services for patients.He continued: ldquoResponse times in this area are challenging, but not particularly dferent to other areas. I have been so impressed at the commitment, dedication and professionalism of our staff to provide the high quality of response that they do in all communities. Without doubt, we only have the quality service we currently have as a result of the huge efforts staff go to.ldquoI have met staff in Downpatrick and Ballynahinch and the efforts and dedication staff go to to provide the best response they can is humbling and I am proud to lead the organisation, but it is not sustainable. The level of effort that staff are required to put in on a constant basis is not reasonable and not fair to continue to expect it.Mr Bloomfield said that while ambulance staff always put the needs of the public first, that level of effort and commitment on an ongoing basis against a rising demand was ldquosimply not sustainable.He said the organisation received around , calls a year, equating to a  per cent increase on the number since  . Mr Bloomfield said the huge increase was ldquoway above what was typical in any other service and while the number of calls had increased, the organisationrsquos resources had remained relatively static.Turning to ambulance response times, Mr Bloomfield said a government target required the organisation to respond to .% of le threatening calls within eight minutes. He explained that while this was achieved in   when the rate was actually .%, that has reduced over the years.In the last financial year, the Ambulance Service responded to % of le threatening calls within eight minutes, with the figures for East Down just % with patients waiting up to  minutes for an emergency ambulance. Mr Bloomfield conceded this was ldquoclearly much more than the eight minute target.The chief executive said the organisation was proposing a new way of categorising and prioritising calls.Currently, calls that come through are categorised as immediately le threatening that require an eight minute response, based on a model which has been in place since , he excplained.ldquoThere have been no changes since and we are trying to respond to % of all the calls we receive in eight minutes. What staff tell us is that when they go to many of those calls that have been categorised as immediately le threatening, they discover they are not and many may not even be urgent, Mr Bloomfield continued.ldquoResearch also suggests that closer to seven per cent of all calls are truly le threatening where time is so important that we need to get there quickly.The chief executive said the organisation wanted to introduce a more sophisticated way of answering calls by talking a little bit longer to ask more questions about the patientrsquos condition to be able to more accurately determine what is their real need.Mr Bloomfield said this will allow the organisation to make sure people who require a response within eight minutes are dealt with appropriately.He said the proposed changes were about assessing a patientrsquos needs more accurately, based on their clinical indication and despatching the right vehicle.The chief executive also pointed to frustration at turnaround times for ambulance crews when they transfer patients to hospitals outside the district, particularly to the Ulster in Dundonald. He said crews ldquodid not want to be standing around AE departments waiting they want to be out providing care to patients.He added: ldquoI can understand there may be a view that the proposals are about changing the way calls are categorised in order to change targets or, even worse, that this may be seen as some sort of cost cutting measure.

A bomb had damaged Enniskillen Townhall, and for a while the Council moved out to the Ardhowen.Pardon the pun, but there were times when Council meetings were ldquoas good as a play, as my granny used to say. Reporting the meetings for the paper was enjoyable, and I remember on one occasion two Councillors had a, er, lively exchange of views and we all held our breath as John Joe McCusker marched down the chamber to confront Jim Lunny.Of course it all ended amicably. The two men, both Nationalists and both with a mischievous sense of humour, were very dferent characters ndash genuine characters and not the fictional types which would tread the boards later at the same venue. I got to know them both and enjoyed their company.Jim Lunny was a great campaigner for retaining townland names, and John Joe fought his corner for his area. I recall them both having a sense of community, and not only would they do their best for Fermanagh in their day, both were also conscious of the need to pass things on to future generations.So they were very supportive of the then Chief Executive, Gerry Burns, a public servant with real vision, when he was the driving force to transform the Ardhowen into the beautul ldquoTheatre by the Lakes. And the architecture-award winning building became the envy of many places at home and abroad.Pardon the clicheacute, but the ldquojewel in the crown was an apt description, but more than just being a beautul building in a beautul setting, the Ardhowen under the dedicated and expert guidance of people like Eamonn Bradley and others, gave a real boost to the arts and entertainment.Enniskillen, and indeed Fermanagh generally, has a fine tradition in amateur drama and itrsquos gratying to see the likes of Adrian Dunbar and Ciaran McMenamin go on to have distinguished careers. About four years ago, I had the pleasure of chairing the Xchange summer school at the Ardhowen when Adrian spoke of his passion for the arts and as a regular visitor to his home town he still boosts the arts here. As does Ciaran, who engaged locals at such events as the film club. The range of activities at the Ardhowen is ied and we are, indeed, fortunate to have such a venue.Itrsquos starting to show its age, though. Even so, I cannot imagine that the people who got the theatre project up and running  years ago would have expected that already the Council is undertaking an exercise to look at the future of the theatre. Some of the options include an upgrade or extension, but worryingly another option is to build another theatre on another site.All this has been well reported by Colm Bradley in this newspaper.The situation has led to a number of people expressing doubts about the future of the Ardhowen, and Fermanagh Film Clubrsquos Jules Caithness wrote about ldquograve concern at the fog of uncertainty over the theatre which he said had been ldquohorribly neglected.The Council attempted to downplay this by saying they have ldquono plans to sell the Ardhowen site.No plans  Whatthey go for the option of a new theatre on a new site  What happens to the Ardhowen site then  Irsquod have preferred a straightforward, no wersquore not selling it. Itrsquos a uniquely beautul site and wersquod be mad to sell it.Irsquom told a meeting was held in August of ldquostakeholders which unsettled some of those present, and that no Councillors were present.Irsquom wondering how the succeeding Councils over the years allowed the building to get into such a state of repair, to the point where they now need to spend a large sum of money.So much money, in fact, that it exceeds the threshold that an ldquoeconomic appraisal is required.Irsquom sure some bean counter will weigh it all up but how do you place on a balance sheet the richness of cultural experience which the Ardhowen has brought to Fermanagh over three decades, and the reputation our centre of excellence has across Ireland In the current climate, I think the way we are governed isnrsquot as ldquoopen and accountable as it should be. There is certainly a massive disconnect between the people and those in authority at Stormont, though one would expect thatany public body would have the ear of the public it would be the local Council.Some decisions have implications for years to come. I still get annoyed when I walk past the old ldquostreets area opposite the police station in Enniskillen and see a lot of public sector buildingswhere once stood a thriving community of people living in homes on the island.OK, housing conditions were awful, but homes should have been built there instead of what the planners did with the area.So, please members of Fermanagh and Omagh District Council, consider carefully what you do with the Ardhowen. Itrsquos not really yours, and itrsquos not totally a matter of money.Part of the problem, apparently, is a lack of car parking. Aside from the fact that this would suggest itrsquos a popular venue, surely itrsquos not beyond the Council to sort that one out There are other problems, of course, and I fully accept that these are stringent times.Butyoursquore looking for feedback, Councillors, mine is that you should recognise what a magnicent asset you have on your hands. Pluck the jewel out of the crown and abandon it at your peril. In fact, find the money, go the whole hog and turn the ldquotheatre by the lakes into an even greater asset which will build on what has already been achieved and be lauded for years to come.Your predecessors, McCusker, Lunny and Burns among other, had the foresight to do that.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

something which ended the unlimited ‘burn to earn’ situation which existed before then.However, they did not involve a more complex cost control known as degression, which operated in the GB scheme.And alongside the move to tiering Stormont also doubled the size of boiler eligible for the most lucrative tarf.That meant that claimants under the revised scheme installed far bigger boilers so that they were able to produce considerable heat and be paid at the highest subsidy level.Figures provided to the inquiry show that boilers were on average running for % of the time before the changes. But after the change, usage - albeit with boilers able to produce double the heat in the same time - dropped to %, the level at which the most lucrative tarf dropped.However, counsel for the inquiry David Scoffield QC said that payments made per unit of heat had dropped only marginally from .p to .p.Dr McCormick agreed that the changes had proved to be a limited budgetary control, although he said that they had at least “stopped the unlimited use” of boilers.He said that the decision to double the size of boilers for the most lucrative tarf at the same time as attempting to rein in the scheme “was not as clearly analysed and scrutinised as it should have been”.He accepted that the failure to understand that the scheme was still very generous gave a  sense of security that spending on the scheme was under control and “the worst of it is dealt with”, but that now seemed “very questionable indeed”. produced the email to Timothy Johnston \"   produced the email to Timothy Johnston \"  RHI Inquiry: Mystery over DUP Spads’ email Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Dr McCormick also accepted that a power to suspend the scheme should have been included in , something which would have stopped the second spike in applications.Dr Keith MacLean put it to him that although the introduction of tiered tarfs had addressed the issue of wasteful heat, “the heat that is being produced is costing the taxpayer pretty much the same that it did before”.Dr MacLean went on to say that the department’s business case which argued that the scheme was value for money in an attempt to retrospectively get approval for irregular spending on the scheme “seems to have been a work of complete fiction”.try catch     .               ..

location.href,source_website_category: \"Local\", \"text\".done .removeAttr  .html  .html.valMore than a week after a potentially crucial email was given to the RHI Inquiry hours before the appearance of a powerful DUP figure, mystery still surrounds why it arrived more than a year after the inquiry compelled the production of all documentation.The email, which dates to the period in summer  when the RHI scheme was running out of control, undermined the story of the DUP’s powerful chief executive, Timothy Johnston, who has denied that he had any knowledge of RHI in that period.Last Thursday, counsel for the inquiry Donal Lunny told an evidence session at which Mr Johnston was testying that late the previous night the inquiry had been given an email by another former DUP Spad, Timothy Cairns, which showed signicant contact between them on RHI.The email appears to have been supplied because it contained a reference to another green energy scheme, the NIRO, which the inquiry had belatedly requested DUP Spads search their email accounts for references to.However, the email also contained a reference to “renewable heat”, meaning thatit was in the possession of either the DUP, Mr Johnston or Mr Cairns prior to that point it ought to have been disclosed.The inquiry has now published the email, showing that it was sent from Mr Cairns’s DUP.org.uk email address to Mr Johnston – who has told the inquiry that he also used an email address on the DUP server, rather than a departmental email, for government business.If the email remains on the DUP server, that would mean that the party should have disclosed it, evenneither of the two men now have access to it.The News Letter asked the DUP why it had not handed over the email before nowit was in the party’s possession, whether the party had establishedit had other material that may not have been handed over and who within the party had been responsible for giving documents to the inquiry. The party declined to comment, saying that the inquiry was still in process.Mr Cairns, who no longer works for the party, was asked why he was only submitting the email now and whether he was aware of the party having access to his old emails.He said: “I have been advised by my solicitor to respond as follows: The inquiry process is ongoing. Until the inquiry has concluded I do not feel in a position to assist at this stage. This is out of respect for the inquiry process.”\"  \"  Dead man found on NI beach was wearing Ballybunion Golf Club shirt Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch     .               ..

He referred to Stormont as being “a very young set of institutions” with unique challenges and said that the behaviour which became normal, such as failing to keep basic records, was not “a cause for blame” but that “ten years is a very short time in terms of organisational behaviour”.Inquiry chairman Sir Patrick Coghlin said: “Ten years is quite a signicant time, I would have thought.”Dr McCormick referred to a case where someone was tweeting information from within an Executive meeting. Sir Patrick asked why they had not been disciplined, adding that such leaks are “not the media’s fault”.The civil servant said “there are rules – but the nature of our institutions makes them quite dficult to enforce”.Sir Patrick said he could understand why Dr McCormick was giving credit to DUP and Sinn Féin Spads who acted in a pragmatic way to get things done, “but by doing that they are ensuring that the rules and the regulations...are completely ignored. And there cannot be, from a public point of view, a positive perception of the political processthat occurs, I would have thought.”Dr McCormick said he thought the Spads “were trying to work towards adherence, compliance and good behaviour, necessarily at times...with some aspects not recorded” but we “need to be realistic about that”.Sir Patrick interjected to say: “You either have rules, or you don’t have rules.”Dr McCormick faced scrutiny of the failure to minute a key meeting of senior civil servants with minister Jonathan Bell and his Spad Timothy Cairns in August  when it was decided to delay the introduction of cost controls. There is now dispute between those who were present as to who said what.He said it was a failure not to record the meeting, andthey had done so it would have both made it harder for both Mr Cairns to ask for a delay in cost controls and for officials to acquiesce in that delay.Sir Patrick said it was “a matter of concern that there isn’t a note”.Under close questioning about how widely disregarded basic s of public administration had been on his watch, Dr McCormick accepted that it was his responsibility “to have a system in place that works” and that wasn’t the case.He added: “I accept personal responsibility for allowing that system to become what it was”.He said that civil servants and politicians operated on the basis that “ you write something down it will probably appear in the newspapers” but that was “not a healthy way to work”. produced the email to Timothy Johnston \"   produced the email to Timothy Johnston \"  RHI Inquiry: Mystery over DUP Spads’ email Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch     .               ..

Then I made an eagle on number  after I topped it off the tee.\"I stuck my second to about  feet and holed the putt.

Many moons ago I did diddle off and leave a dining room wall a third painted and the job to someone  to finish because I got bored and this has turned in to, ldquoWell, you see, Alison, you donrsquot do DIY. Well, fasten my tool belt and hand me a power drill because I now do do DIY.I unscrewed and moved a shelf just yesterday as it needed doing and no one  was doing it anytime soon. Shelf is now in itsrsquo new position, with books on it and it hasnrsquot gone wonky or fallen off over night, so unless it is the shelf-master of delayed action, I am assuming in situ it will stay and a good DIY job I have done.I was recently approached about a new writing project in a field and a genre I had never thought to write and my initial thought was, ldquoOh, Irsquom not sure I can. I agonised about whether I would do a good job and whether I would do the brilliant project idea, justice. But after urging from close friends and my children, I said yes.It is now well underway and feed-back is great and I love it. I am immeasurably proud and it is turning in to something that I am beyond giddy to be involved with.With lsquoback to schoolrsquo upon us and that feeling in September forever associated with change, next steps and new challenges, it got me thinking about all the children set to start St. Cyres and Stanwell, primary schools, Universities, colleges and the like and how many times we are all guilty of telling ourselves that we canrsquot, we shouldnrsquot andwe do, we wonrsquot be any good.This is my appeal to all students, be they tiny tots taking first steps in to Reception, tweenagers embarking on lsquobig schoolrsquo or those with a bit more experience, but often no fewer anxieties heading to further and higher education - go for it, try it take advantage of the chance to learn and the opportunities it opens up.Le is short and it is certainly too short to listen to voices that limit you or put you down. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Knowing this, John gave up his teaching course and took a full time job at the boatyardhellipand the rest is history.Mr Freemantle moved from Penarth and started his own boat building workshop in South Clive Street in  with British Road Services ndash now National Freight Consortium.In , the business was expanded and relocated to a greenfield site within Cardf Marina, which is now the exact location of Bayscape.The boat yard at the time stored around - boats. Long before the Cardf Bay Barrage was built, the water was tidal and boats moored in the middle of the river.As there was no road to the marina, Mr Freemantlebuilt a track to enable him to get to and from the boat yard. In  he put pontoons for the boats and laid the first cement for the slipway which was all created by Mr Freemantles own hands.In  the Freemantlesset their sights on retiring and sold the boat yard - which had grown to storing more than  boats - to a family friend of their business partner who used to visit the boat yard as a child. And so Bayscape began.One day the couple were walking along the waterrsquos edge and looked across to see the unique development taking shape in the exact spot of Mr Freemantles beloved boat yard, where  years previously they brought in the original electrics, telephone line and water. The couple decided to move back to where they had spent many happy years.Mrs Freemantlesaid: ldquoWe love living here, it feels really safe and therersquos a great sense of community.

Stonegate chief executive, Simon Longbottom, commended the graduates and the Stonegate development team.He said: ldquoPeople are at the heart of what we do. Wersquore delighted to able to recognise the achievements of our incredibly hard-working Accelerators here at the House of Commons. The course is a shining example of how commitment in personal development can change peoplersquos lives, as they fast become the companyrsquos most promising managers and future industry leaders.\"Reaching our th milestone is a really proud moment for Stonegate and the House of Commons is a fitting place to celebrate. As well as being a memorable occasion for the Accelerators, we believe it is important to help MPs understand the vital role that our company and the wider pub and bar industry play in offering, not just jobs, but worthwhile progressive careers, with arguably the best opportunity out of any industry to go from the bottom rung right to the very top. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth.

Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community.

Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This is an unprecedented and overwhelming vote that demonstrates the strength of this workforce’s determination to secure the Living Wage Foundation’s minimal pay baseline for decency.“The workforce ask only that Glen Dimplex pay the living wage which is set at £. and as a minimum keep pace with the rates set going forward. Our members have voted to raise themselves out of poverty pay permanently they are determined that they will not be just another ‘in-work poverty’ statistic. These are hard working production workers who manufacture domestic heating equipment - surely they deserve better than poverty pay Pointing to the company’s profitability, Ms Fitzgerald said that bosses had nowhere to hide when it came to meeting the workers’ legitimate pay demand.“The Glen Dimplex group is a highly successful global business. Their last accounts published showed an annual turnover of just below a billion euro, with profits for the year of € million and accumulated profits of €. While the bosses claim they can’t afford to pay a Living Wage to those who produce that wealth day and daily, they managed to find € million to pay a idend to shareholders for the year.“I will be meeting with union reps in the workplace to agree strike dates as part of a roll-out strategy for the industrial action. I call on the bosses to address our members’ legitimate and very modest pay expectations in order to avoid an unnecessary and disruptive industrial dispute”, Ms Fitzgerald finished.When contacted Glen Dimplex said there was no one available to comment.Tributes paid following death of ‘legend’ Tom ClarkeTV: how many young people were caught without a TV Licence in your area  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"try catch     .               ..

A company linked to Newry man Brian McConville, who runs the successful MJM Group, has submitted plans for the extension and refurbishment of  –  Donegall Square East. The works include a new extension, with plans for commercial use at the basement, ground floor and four floors, and office accommodation on the first to third, fth and sixth. A design statement from architects Hamilton says the design intention is “to remove any unsympathetic additions and alterations within the listed buildings, retain the original plan form of the buildings, and conserve all extant historic features”. That includes ornate cornices, ceiling roses and moulded timbers “all of which survive in relatively good condition throughout the building”. The design document says the “new work within the historic structure will follow conservation principles of maximum retention of historic fabric, minimum intervention, reversibility, honest, clarity and sustainability”. Brian McConville’s MJM Group is one of Northern Ireland’s fastest growing companies. MJM Marine is MJM Group’s main business, based in Newry, and headed by founder Brian McConville. It was set up in  by Mr McConville, and carries out work for many of the world’s top cruise liners, including Star Cruises.

Ulster Business speaks to Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI and some of those burgeoning firms it has developed strong relationships with over the decades Long-term support is very much at the heart of the decades of partnership between Bank of Ireland and its business customers.And whether it’s offering a wide range of financial assistance, growth support or general advice, the bank has formed le-long partnerships with companies from right across the sectors, and from the large to the very small.It’s been there for three of its longest-running customers – with a combined almost -year history – from the start, and played a key role as a partner in each of their own growth stories.Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI at Bank of Ireland UK, told Ulster Business:“We base our business on a relationship management model – we spend a lot of time with the businesses, we know the owners and their management teams, their growth objectives and ambitions and understand the businesses.“That enables us to provide the right suite of products – challenging business plans, providing funding and help. There’s also the chance to introduce them to potential customers, signpost to expert advice, and become a partner to that customer, rather than just be a funder. It’s very much a partnership approach.“We provide lending facilities to business from the very small micro firm, right through their le-cycle, their growth phase, and scaling up to small and medium-sized businesses.”And for Gavin, it’s all about offering a range of services and assistance “under one roof”.“We have the ability to lend up to £m for business customers. There is the consistency to our approach, and that’s really important in the Northern Ireland market.”Partnership is a phrase that continues to raise its head in Bank of Ireland, regarding both its relationships with business customers, and the longevity and generational nature of the companies it’s developed long-term relationships with.“We would have many instances where a mother and father have built a business, and now the second generation is taking on the management,” Gavin said. “We are involved across both generations, and we are very privileged to be part of that family and business development.”“It’s in our interest that the company continues to grow and thrive and we have been very important in that role.”Nowhere is that more evident than with the hugely successful family-owned McKeever Hotel Group.What started out as a family restaurant business in Randalstown, Co Antrim back in , has blossomed into a burgeoning food and hospitality business boasting five hotels across Northern Ireland and Donegal.And the McKeever Hotel Group is still very much a family affair. In the last  years, the breadth of the business has grown to include Corrs Corner in Newtownabbey, the Dunsilly Hotel in Antrim, Ballymena’s the Adair Arms, Dillons in Letterkenny, and its latest hotel, the Dunadry in Antrim.Today, Eugene McKeever, along with his we Catherine, daughter Bridgene and son Eddie, run the thriving hotel empire which employs around  part-time and full-time staff.“The family business started in  when my parents opened the first restaurant in Randalstown – my dad was a chef and mum was teaching,” Bridgene, who is marketing director, said.“They then bought Corrs Corner. That’s when Bank of Ireland really become involved in the company and helped us out.“We have been supported by Bank of Ireland in a number of ways.”That includes the multi-million pound funding for the refurbishment of the Dunadry Hotel, in addition to funding support provided for the acquisition in .“Bank of Ireland has been with the company during its entire history. In , with the Adair Arms, we were one of the few people back then who were buying, due to the recession,” she said.“There has always been trust and the faith with the bank. My dad has always said – speak to your bank manager, and be honest with them.”The McKeever Hotel Group’s single biggest investment has been with the -bedroom Dunadry.Gavin says that one of Bank of Ireland’s core objectives is to help “customers to thrive”.“In doing that, it covers a lot of dferent things, and it’s not just about being profitable,” he said.“We specically tailor our packages to the customer needs. Their success, is our success and we are very privileged to be part of that growth story.”Eamon McCay started his cooking oil business at a small Strabane premises. He’s now grown Frylite from a small family operation to an Ireland-wide firm with more than  staff, boasting a turnover of £m.And he’s been helped along the way by Bank of Ireland amid ongoing expansion and growth. It’s a relationship which has so far lasted more than  years, and shows no signs of slowing down.“I started Frylite in , delivering fresh oil and collecting used oil. I combined all of the areas in one,” Eamon says.And that initial  sq ft building has grown to five depots across Ireland, with a further site on the cards for yet more expansion. “We supply our vegetable oils to hotels, fast food outlets, commercial businesses, bakeries, industrial food service sector… it’s been gradual growth.”A depot in Galway in  was followed by another two years later in Dublin, with Coleraine and Cork following a short time later. And its Strabane base is now a , sq ft building on a four-acre site.Since , Bank of Ireland has provided facilities to the business including invoice discounting, asset finance and term and cash flow ending, and also previously used stockline facility.Speaking about his strong relationship with Bank of Ireland, Eamon says a commercial finance package ensured the businesses growth.“The bank have gotten to know the business. I felt like I have had a partner, which is invested in the business. Building good relationships is one of the values,” he said.But it’s not just about providing help and finance to customers. Bank of Ireland is sponsor of Catalyst Inc’s Invent competition and is also working with organisations such as the NI Chamber and CBI to showcase and help companies improve skills, digital prowess and scale exports.Another business with a more than two-decade relationship with Bank of Ireland is Pinnacle.And just some of the Sage Platinum Reseller’s top customers include everyone from the Irish Football Associationand Ulster Rugby to Titanic Belfast and Mash Direct.The software partner, which was set up in Belfast in , now boasts a team of more than  experienced providers of Sage business management software solutions, IT services and support.“Going from humble beginnings, the company has grown into a £m business,” Fran McKee, Pinnacle’s marketing director said.The firm, which is headed by founder Ken Montgomery, has been supported by Bank of Ireland through its stages of growth, which has included organic expansion and acquisition. “We have a solid partnership with Bank of Ireland, which has nurtured our business since its inception in .”The firm offers businesses solutions from simple to more complex business needs with Sage. It now has  offices across the UK and Ireland, but according to Fran, there is “massive growth on the agenda”.“We want to be a £m business within the next few years and as well as growing our Sage ision we want to also grow our IT services offering and with the bank’s support we’ll achieve our growth ambitions.  You can come to us as a one-stop-shop for IT and software requirements.“Customers today are very focused on providing a good service as well as achieving their growth ambitions, so they want to have the software in place to help them make decisions and run their businesses effectively.”And Gavin says the key message is that Bank of Ireland is a “proven and consistent funding partner for businesses over a long period of time.”“We work hard to build a great rapport and great trust with our clients and these long term relationships are testament to that. It is exciting to share the journey of young and small businesses to growth and expansion and we’re keen to help the next generation seize new opportunities for their businesses.” ■View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Premier.jpg","title":"premier inn looking at two new ni hotels","story":"Posted on Wednesday October  by John Mulgrew Premier Inn is eyeing up opening new hotels in Newry and Enniskillen as it seeks to expand across Northern Ireland, Ulster Business can reveal.The hotel chain, which has seven hotels here, is seeking developer opportunities in the two new locations, alongside growth in Dublin.The company, owned by Whitbread, has said it secured  new hotels in the UK during the last financial year, and has the same aspirations this year.It also says it is looking for “property partners and freehold development sites in Dublin and other major cities” as it seeks to grow Premier Inn across Ireland.Meanwhile, a new report from PwC says hotel prices in Belfast are rising five times faster than the UK average.In June , the average cost of an overnight stay in Belfast was £. but has now grown to £..Belfast is now the fourth most expensive city to stay in the UK, outside London.PwC Northern Ireland partner, Martin Cowie, said: “The influx of high-quality rooms to the market have driven and continue to support improved RevPAR and ADR for the city. “Though the full impact hasn’t been realised with easyHotel and the George Best Hotel yet to open as well as Signature Living’s new hotel at the Crumlin Road courthouse which just received planning permission, demand continues to be driven by inbound tourism, domestic holidays and events.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Pete-2.jpg","title":"in focus peter hannan on beef brexit and business","story":"Posted on Thursday October  by Ulster Business Peter Hannan tells John Mulgrew about turning away the big retailers, growing trade by % and that he doesn’t believe Brexit will happen once people see what’s at the edge of the clf Like many in his industry, Peter Hannan is no fan of Brexit.But the top-end beef and red meat supplier also doesn’t think it’s going to happen, given how disastrous the post-Brexit landscape is painted, now that it’s been starkly laid out in front of everyone.The Kildare-born businessman runs Hannan Meats, based in Moira. He’s become something of a star of the Northern Ireland food scene in the last decade – buoyed on by dry-aged beef and an array of the UK’s best and brightest using his produce.He’s aged beef for , days – yes, more than three years – although purely experimental, boosted turnover by around % in the last two or three years, picked up more three-star awards from the Great Taste Awards than almost any other food firm, and now plans to expand into Dublin as his next venture, by the end of the year. Anyone who’s met the Meat Merchant – the moniker given to his retail business in Moira – will know that the -year-old is a personable, larger-than-le character, whose own personality contributes as much to his business and brand, as does his meat.“Our main areas of growth in the last three years have been into the UK, Republic of Ireland and the continent. We haven’t been looking at doing more at home here, because we have a presence, and we think it’s very adequate. We don’t push that, or cold call. We think the clients that we have in Northern Ireland are the best, and we aren’t looking to expand on that.”France is also becoming a growing market for the company, and Pete says business there is growing “very rapidly”.He’s also recently signed a deal to supply all of the Hastings Hotels’ spots.“We have approaches from all sortsover the years,” Pete says. “We are primarily a food service company, so dealing with any of the multiples – doing it a lot more, or not doing it as well has never been on our radar. We’ve had them drive in to the yard here – four suits getting out of a black-windowed car. You are watching on the camera and say ‘oh, that’s somebody’.“Everyone has dferent ideas. We just don’t believe they are the type of partner that we would want. We don’t want to do  tonnes a week of commercial product.”But a few years ago, he did the highest-profile grocer of its kind in the UK – arguably the world.“Five years ago we started to deal with Fortnum  Mason, and they are truly magnicent to deal with,” he said. “That was a turning point because, regardless of what anybody says, the best front window for food in the world is Fortnum  Mason.”According to Pete, business in the five years since the relationship began has increased by ,% – or around  times.What started as a meat wholesale business, blossomed thanks to the success of Hannan Meats’ Himalayan salt-aged Glenarm beef, and has grown into a business with a wide-iety of products – many of which have been done for the first time in NI.Aside from selling lesser-known cuts of beef, such as hanger and rump cap, Pete’s business has ersied into dry-aging lamb, and curing both pork and beef in a sugar-pit – producing hugely flavoured bacon and cured-beef.It doesn’t take long for Pete to start naming some of the greatest chefs which call Hannan Meats their beef supplier. That includes Angela Harrnett and Mark Hix. He was one of the first UK restaurateurs to exclusively use Peter’s dry-aged beef across all of his restaurants – it all started when Pete met Mark outside one of his eateries and gave him an honest retort to whether he had enjoyed his meal. The beef wasn’t up to scratch.But it’s not all just awards, top chefs, suppliers, restaurants and celebrity-backing. Pete says turnover is up around % in the last two to three years – sitting at around £m.“We have lots of other things going on in the background. Taking our next step forward is something we have been considering. We are at a crossroads as to where we take the business next. We are now at a point, do we go forward with the likes of our Meat Merchant , do we take that to a city  Dublin would be next on the radar.”On Brexit, he doesn’t think it’s going to happen – given a clearer image of what le outside the EU could look like.“No doubt, all of us in business have been reluctant to make decisions because there is no clarity,” he said. “Personally, I don’t think we will Brexit. We need to go and apologise, and say ‘as we were’ and just get on. It was a hell of a bad idea. It was sold based on rubbish information, and that’s why people made a rubbish decision.“Now that we have a bit of clarity – Theresa May is bringing us to the clf edge, and saying ‘that’s how far down it is – have a look,you tell me to jump, I’ll jump… but we don’t have to’.“This whole thing about immigration. The thing about bringing , people into this country every year needed to be explained to take that issue off the table. If you want your fruit picked,you want doctors and nurses in the NHS, for example...you want any of those things, then let’s put up the barriers. Unless we take those people in, we don’t have have those things done.“… we shouldn’t be in this position, and I don’t think we will be for much longer.
