She was in blue jeans and a twin-set with pearls, which she fingered constantly.As I walked into the flat, Diana\u0027s shoulders were bowed as though standing straight would draw too much attention. Her skin was transparent and she blushed continuously, especially when talking about Charles. \u0027It\u0027s absolutely maddening to see things written about me, and him, when I haven\u0027t said anything.\u0027 She paused. \u0027But I don\u0027t know what the future holds.\u0027I asked if anyone was advising her on how to handle the situation. \u0027No!\u0027 she said, shocked. \u0027I don\u0027t think the Royal Family is aware of what is happening here. At least we didn\u0027t talk about it when we were in Norfolk.\u0027Apparently she\u0027d crept away at night the previous weekend to stay at Sandringham, managing to evade reporters. I wondered aloud if she\u0027d wound sheets together to climb out of the window. She laughed. \u0027No, I got a very fast driver and we shot off in a puff of smoke. I had my new car delivered somewhere else where I stayed the night, then shot off to Norfolk.\u0027 It was Prince Charles\u0027s 32nd birthday party. \u0027Unfortunately,\u0027 she added, \u0027somebody found out I had a new car and even though I parked it miles away they found it.\u0027So the siege went on. \u0027I\u0027ve no idea why the whole thing has built up to such a peak,\u0027 she shrugged. \u0027I think it\u0027s because everything happens for the Royal Family in November. Princess Anne married and had a baby in November. It\u0027s the Queen and Prince Philip\u0027s anniversary. And of course it\u0027s Charles\u0027s birthday and everyone is dying for him to get married, and I was the one who was around this time.\u0027A little disingenuous perhaps. Not every pretty young woman is asked to stay at Sandringham for these highly personal events.         Every morning when she tried to jump into her red Mini, photographers would race her to the first set of traffic lights, hoping she would be stopped long enough for them to get a shot or, worse, that they would cause a little accident, which would give a more dramatic shotThen she changed the subject, apologising for what a nuisance all the attention must be for other people in our building. \u0027It must be so bloody for everyone who lives here,\u0027 she said. \u0027I feel so awful about it.\u0027 I assured her we were taking it in our collective stride.I knew she wanted me to write what she said, although she was afraid to say much. She thought she was \u0027suitable\u0027 for a future king, only because she did not \u0027sleep around\u0027. It was clear she thought herself second best to her older sister, who had been Prince Charles\u0027s girlfriend for almost a year but had been crossed off the eligibility list. Not for lack of blue blood – the Spencer blood was probably bluer than the Windsors\u0027 – but for reportedly telling journalists she\u0027d had \u0027thousands of boyfriends\u0027. Diana strongly implied she was a virgin, and she obviously felt that was the only reason \u0027The Family\u0027 had approved her as a future bride, although I did not write that in my interview. \u0027I don\u0027t really know why they like me,\u0027 was what I wrote. \u0027You see my sister Sarah was going out with Charles last year and she talked about it to the Press but she talked too much and they murdered her.\u0027I\u0027m OK because I haven\u0027t got a background.\u0027 I looked surprised. No background? Daughter of the 8th Earl Spencer, distantly related to the Royal Family, directly related to the Churchills? No, it turned out she meant a background of leaping in and out of bed with people. \u0027That\u0027s what everyone else seems to have. I mean I haven\u0027t had a chance to have that kind of background, I\u0027m still only 19!\u0027 She looked shocked and embarrassed. \u0027But people are longing to dig something up about me.\u0027 She looked at me sideways. \u0027It\u0027s like the story about me meeting him on the Royal Train in the middle of the night.\u0027She was referring to reports, denied by the Palace, that she\u0027d had an assignation with the prince when the train was in sidings in Wiltshire. \u0027I simply couldn\u0027t believe it,\u0027 she exploded. \u0027I\u0027ve never been near the train, let alone in the middle of the night!\u0027 I was told later, by a reliable source, that the woman on board was Camilla.I was very sympathetic, but as I turned to go, realising a cup of tea was not on the cards, she apologised again for the disruption she\u0027d caused to others in our building. \u0027I am so, so sorry for interrupting the lives of the people who live here,\u0027 she said.She told me when she was finally allowed a bodyguard, a woman dressed in black who shadowed her like a, well, shadow, a very dark one, but effective. I could see the top of the woman\u0027s head as I slipped down the stairs behind Diana, neither of us waiting for the old Victorian lift. None of the other members of the Press spotted her, that\u0027s for sure. Diana, soon to be HRH Princess of Wales, was learning her lesson.                 "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/06/29/16/15417522-7195757-image-a-43_1561822219895.jpg","title":"Meghan shares hug stars Boston Red Sox Harry meet team ahead Yankees match","story":"Make like Meghan in a dress by Stella McCartneyGet it at NET-A-PORTERThe Duchess of Sussex made a rare appearance during her maternity leave this weekend when she met the Red Sox players with Prince Harry at the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park.We first noticed that Meghan had swapped her beloved Aquazzura stilettos for a pair of the label’s ballet flats before our eyes jumped to her gorgeous Stella McCartney dress.

She said she was married but \u0027amicably separated\u0027 and insisted that, as her \u0027wealthy boyfriend\u0027, Mr Kooter gave her most of the money to support their \u0027expensive, luxurious lifestyle\u0027 together.But Judge Cavanagh told her to pay the money back. He pointed out that a screenshot of her Tinder profile from February 2017 \u0027stated on that profile that she was employed by Citibank\u0027 and she also signed off emails \u0027Manuela Radeva, Capital Investment Manager\u0027.There were numerous emails detailing \u0027the process of making arrangements for Mr Kooter to make investments with Ms Radeva,\u0027 he added.At one point in the emails, Mr Kooter had expressed nervousness at what he was doing, saying: \u0027Just putting a large amount of money into your bank account seems a bit reckless.\u0027Ms Radeva replied: \u0027Don\u0027t worry about this - you can trust me completely.\u0027Judge Victoria McCloud has now ordered Ms Radeva to pay the rest of Mr Kooter\u0027s court costs, a bill which could reach £100,000. The judge said she must pay the first £50,000 by July 31 this year.The judge ordered that Mr Kooter\u0027s outstanding claim against Ms Radeva for 36,000 euros be \u0027discontinued\u0027, after his barrister, Kamen Shoylev, told the judge that he now wants to drop it rather than fighting out another trial.The judge also ordered Ms Radeva\u0027s £9,950 counterclaim against her ex to be stayed and dismissed unless she applies to lift the stay.But the judge said she had received a letter from Ms Radeva \u0027talking about her bankruptcy\u0027 and commented: \u0027This is a bankruptcy which came on after the judgement against her.\u0027Mr Shoylev told the judge: \u0027Mr Kooter is very likely to be applying to set aside the bankruptcy.\u0027He added outside court: \u0027It is a matter of public record that Ms Radeva is now bankrupt. It is possible that if the bankruptcy is not set aside, she may get away without paying anything.\u0027Mr Kooter has an application pending to set aside the bankruptcy in the High Court.\u0027The court heard during the trial in February that the couple enjoyed a \u0027lavish lifestyle\u0027 together, despite their short association, enjoying skiing holidays and stays in expensive hotels.Mr Kooter splashed thousands on gifts, including designer luggage and a Chanel handbag and purse for his new lover, the court heard, as well as paying out for their \u0027hotel and bar expenses\u0027.But after they split up, he demanded back the £182,000, plus another €36,000 he says he lent her.But Michael Collard, for Ms Radeva, claimed the payments were part-and-parcel of their lavish \u0027domestic expenses as a couple\u0027 and that Ms Radeva should not be made to reimburse him.\u0027This was a man on a very high income in what was clearly a serious relationship. They were living together,\u0027 he said.\u0027This was a relationship with lots of kisses. It was not a professional relationship between the two of them.\u0027Of the €36,000, he added: \u0027It\u0027s the sort of payment a wealthy boyfriend could make to his girlfriend...There is no evidence that he would have expected the money back.\u0027Ordering her to pay back the £182,000, Judge Cavanagh said: \u0027There is a great deal of contemporaneous evidence to show Mr Kooter was giving Ms Radeva substantial sums of money so she could invest on his behalf, she having led him to believe she was an expert investor working in the finance industry.\u0027In my judgment, it is highly implausible that he was giving her this money for any other reason than that she should invest it for him.\u0027It might be thought to be strange that an experienced businessman would advance these sums to somebody he had recently met without a written agreement.\u0027He admits he was naive and says he was blinded by attraction\u0027. "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad04740a0e3933b5e51e26255035ab3d93dd20a3/0_335_2025_1214/master/2025.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=46bc16c8e1d888100a434f27bff210cc","title":"the big picture tom wood liverpool mothers go to market","story":"Tom Wood’s 13 years taking photos of shoppers at Great Homer Street Market earned him the nickname Photie ManBetween 1978 and 1991, Tom Wood would take the ferry from his home in New Brighton and spend his Saturday mornings photographing the people toing and froing in Liverpool’s Great Homer Street market. After spending a few hours there, which earned him the local nickname Photie Man, he would head over to watch the football, surrounded by men.But at the market the crowds were mostly made up of women. Wood became fascinated with the family relationships of those around him the features shared across different faces the interactions between the women and girls, now celebrated in his latest show, Mothers, Daughters, Sisters, opening tomorrow at the Arles photography festival.“Liverpool is a really matriarchal city in many ways,” he says. “When all the riots were going on, and unemployment was high, it was women who held everything together.” Wood’s Irish background helped him get to know the market-goers. “Everyone in Liverpool has some kind of Irish relative. A lot of women, I’d look them in the eye and it was like looking at my mother. It’s like a shared understanding.”The market was an ongoing source of inspiration for Wood. “When you see women in town, around Marks \u0026amp Spencer and those shops, people have a kind of a mask on – the face they present is not themselves. But because this was out of town and everybody kind of knew each other, the women were just really natural and open, not dressed up particularly.”Wood now lives in north Wales, but visited the market again a few weeks ago. “It’s smaller, it doesn’t sprawl along the road as it used to. But it was just as exciting and interesting. I don’t think I would have made the pictures I’ve made anywhere else in the UK. There’s an energy in the place and the people are really generous and open. It was a pleasure going there every week – the pictures are made out of absolute affection.”Tom Wood’s exhibition Mothers, Daughters, Sisters will appear at Les Rencontres d’Arles, France, from 1 July to 25 August.

The new book (out next year) will be set 64 years before the originals, on the morning of the reaping of the 10th Hunger Games. Perhaps it takes a decade or so before disillusionment with the system of harvesting your youngsters for a televised death match begins to set in.Prequels can be a very big deal, especially in children’s and young adult fiction where the appetite for more information and stories about beloved characters and worlds can hardly be sated (though adults are not exempt – we fall just as hard for books like The Enemy, in which Lee Child takes us back to a time before the first Jack Reacher book’s setting, or 2006’s Hannibal Rising by Thomas Harris, which fleshes out the cannibal we first met in 1981’s Red Dragon). There are many examples, particularly in the parts of the YA fantasy genre and series fiction where the publishers’ focus is more on quantity than quality, of authors nipping back and forth across the timeline to expand the characters’ universes and – one must assume – sales. But others are more carefully considered and make a true and lasting contribution to the fictional world and the story told. Where would CS Lewis’s Narnia chronicles be, for example, without The Magician’s Nephew and The Horse and His Boy? They are both prequels to Prince Caspian and the former is also a prequel to The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. No nephew (and rings and pools and foundation myths), no Narnia. Joan Aiken’s The Whispering Mountain is a prequel to her glorious Wolves chronicles and every bit as good as the rest of that rollicking Dickensian series. Special mention must go to Peter Dickinson’s The Changes trilogy the internal chronology of The Weathermonger (1968), Heartsease (1969) and The Devil’s Children (1970) is the exact reverse of publication order.Philip Pullman, though he is not a huge fan of the books being characterised this way, has given us what is generally very much considered a prelude to His Dark Materials with the first two books of another trilogy, The Book of Dust, which includes characters and events from the first series. Let’s not get into the vexed question of the precise relationship of The Silmarillion to The Lord of the Rings (begun before Tolkien’s masterwork, published posthumously and containing … multitudes), but those who claim The Hobbit is a prequel to The Lord of the Rings are simply mistaken set before and written before the major events of Middle-earth, it is simply a first instalment (albeit amended in later editions by the author as work progressed on the sequels) that has been dwarfed by the success of the rest. (Irvine Welsh’s Skagboys, the overlooked prequel to the runaway Trainspotting may feel its pain.)Adult fiction prequels abound too, from the likes of Porto Bello Gold by Arthur D Howden Smith (a competent tale of how Captain Flint and Murray gained and buried their loot, written 50 years after Robert Louis Stevenson’s Treasure Island, though whether as a cynical attempt to cash in or as an early piece of fan fiction it is hard to tell) to books such as Wide Sargasso Sea by Jean Rhys, the story of Mr Rochester’s “mad” wife and likely to endure as long as Charlotte Brontë’s Jane Eyre itself.Overall, perhaps because they have a destination point already set, prequels have a better reputation than most sequels. There may be diminishing returns, of course.

Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.Thomas Wolfe told us that you can never go home again. But you can do some re-reading, as Diane Cano explains:Re-reading in my ninth decade a book I first read as an adolescent: Look Homeward, Angel, by Thomas Wolfe. Even as an adolescent I thought of it as a novel especially suited for young teenagers, full of enthusiasm and new pain. It is still racist and misogynist and full of (glorious) lists, but I am no longer the indignant girl I was. Now I just relax into the tolerance of knowing, with Auden, that Time “worships language and forgives everyone by whom it lives”. Oh, how Wolfe throws those words up, around, over and through - everything.“I am not sure why,” says gavernism, “but I am re reading The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde by Stevenson”:Perhaps because I feel that social media today plays the role that chemicals play in that novel: it opens up a dark side of us that can roam around in the dark, anonymously, doing as it pleases. The issue now, as with the novel, is that hidden never really stays hidden, does it?The Silk Roads: A New History of the World by Peter Frankopan is “outstanding” according to darrylxxx:So many interesting stories, connections, insights and so easy to relate to where we are now as a global population. Shows how things ebb and flow over time – our current “reality” isn’t fixed in stone.“I do love Home Front diaries,” says NicolaVintageReads, who has been reading May Smith’s wartime diary These Wonderful Rumours:Ration books, Time and Tide magazine, sitting in a cold cellar waiting for the all-clear siren, tennis parties, wartime wedding cakes with cardboard imitation icing, seeing the newly released Disney films Dumbo and Pinocchio at the cinema, billeting evacuees, fear or Goering’s plans but spirit of the Blitz.WebberExpat is also “loving” Lucia Berlin’s A Manual For Cleaning Women:A bitterly hilarious, brutally truthful, elegantly incisive collection. Wonderful, just a brilliant, up-front, trusthworthy voice. One which does not overstay its welcome, nor get too repetitive meandering between stories.The sense of growing unease is palpable. I like the way Roth explores events – mainly a growing wave of anti-semitism in an isolationist America in WW2 governed by a right wing president – through the experience of a really well-defined young Jewish boy and his family.Becoming by Michelle Obama has impressed nicegirl2:I’m not really one for reading non-fiction but this is brilliant – so well written, smart, funny and humble (so far).Visions of Gerard by Jack Kerouac haunts dylan37:A childhood in the 1920s, a saintly hero brother who disappears too soon, Catholic dreams in a Massachusetts winter, survivor guilt and a family struggling with mourning.There’s a different kind of Kerouac energy here introspective, spiritual, angelic and natural. The ghosts of the great wanderers float through these words – William Blake and Walt Whitman, with the touch and feel of sad autumn leaves. There’s that strange melancholy of a dying season, disappearing like smoke from a slow burn bonfire. A haunting and beautiful small book, about the biggest of subjects.Red Bones by Ann Cleeves has intrigued jimitron5000:There is a certain slow burning intrigue about this book. The location adds an immense amount to the story and covers for the times when not much happens. It develops nicely into a really enjoyable novel. I have read the first two and will endeavour to read the rest of the series. Funnily enough I have never managed to sit through a whole episode of the TV show.Finally, a fascinating literary nugget from Zdzisław Najder’s, Joseph Conrad: A Life, courtesy of interwar:Pursuing Joseph Conrad’s beginnings as a writer, I came across this:In March 1893 the Torrens, “one of the most famous sailing ships of its day”, set sail from Adelaide, Australia on its return voyage to London. On board was a wealthy young English barrister who had been travelling round the Pacific. From shipboard he wrote to his mother about meeting a remarkable man, the ship’s Polish mate:“A capital chap, though queer to look at he is a man of travel and experience in many parts of the world, and has a fund of yarns .... He has been right up the Congo and all around Malacca and Borneo and other out of the way parts…”John Galsworthy had not yet turned to writing and his new friend, Konrad Korzeniowski, though secretly working on a novel, had not yet become Joseph Conrad. Both would remain friends, however, as they gained fame for their fiction.If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

So says Huw van Steenis, the author of Future of Finance, a report commissioned by the Bank’s outgoing governor, Mark Carney.One might argue with the word “equivalent”. Few regulatory submissions rival the bard’s output in their timelessness or vivid use of language: the Bank of England would probably send them winging straight back to their originators if they did. But Van Steenis’s point about the volume of reporting is a valid one. The system of banking supervision has become highly complex, with a risk that the forest is entirely lost from view in the midst of thousands of trees.The team behind the report commissioned McKinsey \u0026amp Company to assess the cost of all this reporting to banks in the UK. Its estimate is £2bn to £4.5bn per year – rather a broad range, but even the lower bound is a big number, with a material impact on profitability.Van Steenis argues that better use of technology – regtech – could make a difference. Regulators should be using artificial intelligence and machine learning to interrogate regulatory returns and identify risks and anomalies. He also points out that much of the complexity has its origin in the overlapping and sometimes conflicting priorities of different regulators. In comparison with the US, the UK system is relatively streamlined, but banks must still satisfy the requirements of the Bank of England, the Financial Conduct Authority, the Competition and Markets Authority, the Payment Systems Regulator, and the Open Banking Implementation Entity. They are not always easy to reconcile.The problem is particularly acute in relation to the payments system, which, owing to new entrants – perhaps soon to include Facebook with its Libra currency – has become far more complex to oversee. As a result, a number of regulators impose their own requirements.Van Steenis argues for “a joined-up strategy to improve our payments infrastructure and regulation”, and an approach which he describes as analogous to air traffic control, to ensure that the demands of different regulators do not land on banks and others in an unmanageable and uncoordinated way. The UK government has responded positively to that idea, but it will not be easy to bring greater coherence to a range of regulators that each has its own legal obligations and political masters. Air traffic controllers can order a plane to enter a holding pattern, as anyone who has flown into Heathrow in recent years knows only too well. Who can tell a statutory regulator to get back in its box and wait for others to finish their work? We must hope that the government can answer that question.He is also a sceptic when it comes to cryptocurrencies: “Crypto assets that are not backed by currency are an unreliable store of value, inefficient medium of exchange and simply won’t cut the mustard.” And he does not see a compelling case for a central bank digital currency, which puts him at odds with some others in the central banking world, who see attractions in the idea, not least greater leeway to impose negative interest rates.But, despite scepticism about the viability of cryptocurrencies, bankers will not find Future of Finance reassuring reading. It points out that Ant Financial, which I visited in Shanghai last week, is now the world’s largest financial services firm, with more than 1 billion customers, and not a single brick-and-mortar branch. There are more mobile and contactless payments in China each year – worth $15.4tn (£12.1tn) – than are managed by Visa and Mastercard combined. And in response to the report, the Bank of England announced that in the future, non-bank payment providers will be allowed to hold interest-bearing accounts at the central bank, a privilege previously available only to commercial banks.Anyone working in finance knows that a revolution is under way, driven by disruptive technology. The full implications, for providers of finance and those who regulate them, are only dimly understood so far. The Bank of England’s report sheds valuable light on aspects of that revolution. It examines the threat to traditional banks’ core income streams in an analog world.It is right to face up to that threat, and to be anxious. As Laertes said to Ophelia as she embarked on her doomed dalliance with Hamlet: “Be wary then best safety lies in fear.” That warning probably does not appear in the Shakespeare-sized weekly reading of the Bank of England supervisors. Perhaps it should.•Howard Davies, the first chairman of the UK’s Financial Services Authority (1997-2003), is chairman of the Royal Bank of Scotland. He was Director of the London School of Economics (2003-2011) and served as deputy governor of the Bank of England and director general of the CBI."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebad7db6689e3607194730ed4fb1a40ff2d523aa/0_102_3072_1843/master/3072.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d252647c293117801019233f505008f1","title":"mobile banking to overtake high street branch visits in two years","story":"Rapid uptake means banking via an app rather than visiting your bank in person will become the mainstream by 2021 Mobile banking is set to be more popular than visiting a high street bank branch within two years, according to new forecasts, highlighting how technology is transforming the way Brits bank.The tipping point will arrive in 2021, according to analysis by the consultancy Caci, when the number of customers regularly using branches will be overtaken by those using apps.The rapid uptake of app banking has forced Britain’s biggest banks to reassess their costly footprint of physical branches.Britain’s banks have closed two-thirds of their branches over the last 30 years, according to Which?. There were more than 20,500 branches in the UK in 1988, but just 7,586 at the end of last year.The decline has been driven by the rise of phone banking, internet banking, and mobile apps, reducing the number of visits people make to a physical branch. Meanwhile, the financial crisis that started in 2008 led to banks losing billions of pounds, further adding pressure to cut costs.More recently a slew of startup banks that do not operate branches, such as Monzo, N26, Revolut and Starling, have gained licences to offer banking services. Their rapidly growing user-numbers have spurred traditional banks to spend billions on technology.Lloyds Banking Group, Britain’s biggest high street lender, is in the middle of a two-year £3bn reorganisation. In November, Lloyds said it was cutting 6,000 jobs, but create a further 8,000 in more tech-focused roles. Royal Bank of Scotland, Santander and the owners of the Clydesdale and Yorkshire banks – now known as Virgin Money – have all closed significant numbers of branches in recent years.Gareth Shaw, head of money at Which?, the consumer group, said: “While digital banking is on the rise, there is still widespread appetite for dedicated bank branches that provide the full-range of financial services and vital access to cash.”The banking industry has formally committed to securing free access to cash across the UK, after the government set up a taskforce in May to look at the issue. Shaw said the government should consider legislation to ensure people can continue using cash.Debit cards overtook cash in 2017 as the most prevalent method of payment in the UK, according to UK Finance figures. However, 1.3m adults – concentrated among younger people and the over-85s – still do not have access to a bank account or an e-money alternative, according to the Financial Conduct Authority.The banks last year agreed a deal with the Post Office which allows users to withdraw cash, deposit cash or check their bank balance to help ensure people in more remote areas can access the banking system.UK Finance said: “This rapid rate of technological change is set to continue over the coming decade as people embrace the ever-widening number of ways to pay and manage their finances, depending on their needs and lifestyle.“But technology is not for everyone and maintaining access to cash is vital to ensure no customer is left behind.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c478f94658e8ef2fe3f947c8ccededb46ed1ac27/0_37_3038_1823/master/3038.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f592edac94d939ce6114ee21e20a35fd","title":"stock markets surge us china trade manufacturing uk eurozone business live","story":"Trade optimism is pushing markets up despite weak factory data in the UK, the eurozone and ChinaThe decline in UK factory output in June has driven the pound down to a 10-day low.Sterling has shed half a cent against the US dollar to $1.2639, its weakest point since 20 June.In another worrying sign, UK consumer credit growth has slowed to a five-year low.Mortgage approvals also fell, from 66,045 to 65,409, suggesting the public are being cautious.That, combined with the decline in factory output, suggests Britain’s economy has weakening in the last few weeks.Rob Dobson, director at IHS Markit, says Brexit is hurting UK factories for two reasons:Dobson says this helped to drag the factory PMI to its lowest in over six years:“The downturn in UK manufacturing deepened during June, as the impact of firms unwinding stockpiles built before the original Brexit date continued to reverberate through the sector and exacerbate weak demand. “The stranglehold of sustained Brexit-related uncertainty and disruption also weighed heavily on business confidence and employment, as optimism ebbed to one of its lowest levels in the survey history and staff headcounts were reduced for the third straight month. Worryingly, UK factories don’t have enough orders to help them quickly plough through their inventory stocks.Newsflash: Britain’s factory sector has suffered its sharpest contraction in six years.Data firm Markit’s UK manufacturing PMI, just released, is much worse than expected. The index has slumped to just 48.0, a 76-month low, showing that the sector shrank at a more rapid pace.Companies reported that output and new orders both slumped in June, hitting business confidence.One problem is that firms are now cutting their stockpiles, having furiously bought raw materials and parts earlier this year in case of a no-deal Brexit.Markit says that Britain’s manufacturing downturn has deepened, as the UK PMI falls to lowest level since February 2013.The UK manufacturing sector continued to feel the reverberations of the unwinding of earlier pre-Brexit stockpiling activity during June. The already high stock levels at both manufacturers and their clients led to a scaling back of output and new order intakes, with demand from both domestic and export markets weakening. Output was lowered in response to reduced intakes of new business, which fell to the greatest extent for almost seven years. There were reports that high stock levels, ongoing Brexit uncertainty, the economic slowdown and rising competition all contributed to the decreases in new orders and production.More to follow.....Some City experts are sceptical about quite how much progress was made between the US and China at the G20 summit.Although Donald Trump talked up his meeting with Xi Jinping as a big success, we still don’t know how Beijing and Washington will resolve their trade conflict. The two sides also haven’t set any public deadlines. Russ Mould, investment director at stockbrokers AJ Bell, says:The fact that China and the US are restarting trade talks gives some reassurance to investors and triggers a small rally in stocks around the world. However, there are plenty of other negative factors to consider which explains why equity markets aren’t experiencing massive surges.“The trade war is far from over, which means a continuation of uncertainties hanging over the market.Andrew Milligan, head of global strategy at Aberdeen Standard Investments, is also cautious about the G20 summit, saying: “In the big picture, it doesn’t change anything. It was never likely to solve the whole problem, but it’s a useful stepping stone.” Ditto Chris Bailey, analyst at investment bank Raymond James: Economics professor Nouriel Roubini is concerned by the eurozone factory downturn:Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, sounds just as downbeat: “Eurozone manufacturing remained stuck firmly in a steep downturn in June, continuing to contract at one of the steepest rates seen for over six years.....The downturn is also showing no signs of any imminent end. The survey’s forward-looking indicators remained worryingly subdued in June, adding to concerns about the economy in the second half of the year.” Newsflash: Europe’s factory sector continued to contract last month, taking the shine off today’s market rally.Data firm Markir reports that its Eurozone manufacturing PMI report, which tracks thousands of firms, fell to a three-month low of 47.6 in June, from 47.7 in May.That shows that the sector kept shrinking, at a slightly faster rate. It’s the fifth month in a row in which the manufacturing PMI has failed to hit the 50-point mark (which split expansion from contraction).Companies reported that output and new orders continued to shrink last month - a sign of weak economic demand. That could be partly due to the US-China trade tensions.Markit reports that Germany suffered the worst slowdown while France’s economy picked up:Ouch! Spain’s factory sector suffered a sharp contraction last month, with orders and output dropping.Data firm Markit blames “deteriorating market conditions, both at home and abroad” -- a sign that the eurozone slowdown, and months of trade tensions, are hurting. Every European stock index has surged higher this morning, following the rally in Asia overnight.July is off to a “flying start”, says Connor Campbell of Spreadex.Though they have been here before, the global markets proved ready and willing to swallow the latest trade war retreat from the USA and China.The much-anticipated G20-sidebar between Donald Trump and Xi Jinping didn’t disappoint. According to the US President trade negotiations are now ‘right back on track’, Trump then pledging that he won’t be adding additional tariffs onto Chinese goods – ‘for the time being’.Xi, meanwhile, called for ‘cooperation and dialogue’, the Beijing leader no doubt keen to get talks up and running given Monday’s Caixin manufacturing PMI unexpectedly contracted."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e5404ce2816c10d358c75e427ad4563eff8c43e/0_225_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=01aaea6084e656253dc83193610845a1","title":"san francisco big tech workers industry","story":"San Franciscans have long complained that tech workers ruined their city, driving up rents and homelessness and eliminating ersity. Now even the tech workers agreePhotographs by Jason HenryIt was a beautiful winter day in San Francisco, and Zoe was grooving to the soundtrack of the roller-skating musical Xanadu as she rode an e-scooter to work. The 29-year-old tech worker had just passed the Uber building when, without warning, a homeless man jumped into the bike lane with his dog, blocking her path.She slammed on the brakes, flew four feet into the air and landed on the pavement, bleeding. “It was one of those hardening moments where I was like, ‘Even I am being affected,’” she recalled.It should be noted that Zoe, who asked not to be identified by her real name because she was not authorized by her employer to speak to the press, is not the stereotypical tech bro who moves to San Francisco for a job and immediately starts complaining about the city’s dire homelessness crisis. She arrived in 2007 to study at San Francisco State University and had a career in musical theater before attending a coding bootcamp and landing a job as a developer advocate at a major tech company.But the fall and other incidents, including getting mugged and having her phone stolen, have all contributed to her growing sense of insecurity in the area. She told the  the tale of her scoot, interrupted, because she said it was a perfect example of her own – and perhaps the broader community of tech workers’ – increasingly hate-hate relationship with San Francisco. “This guy needed services to help him,” she said of the man who caused her to fall, “and we all suffer because of the issues that are not being addressed.”A quarter of a century after the first dot-com boom, the battle for San Francisco’s soul is over and the tech industry has won. But what happens when the victors realize they don’t particularly like the spoils?For Zoe, the newfound financial security from working in tech does not counterbalance a constant sense of being unsafe in the city. She now earns three to four times more than when she was a “starving artist”, but she says she is terrified to walk at night. She no longer rides scooters and says she feels “triggered” when she sees them around the city. She takes Ubers everywhere after dark and asks drivers to watch to make sure she gets inside her apartment building.“Mark Zuckerberg lives nearby, but our corner is the main prostitution corner in the city,” she said of the Mission District apartment she shares with her boyfriend. “There’s condoms and syringes. It’s absolutely crazy with how much we pay for rent … It’s tough, because we work in tech, but we ask ourselves every day if we should move.”It’s a striking contrast from just five years ago, when tech workers showed up in force at San Francisco City Hall to declare their love and respect for a city that was not exactly loving them back. “I am so proud to live in San Francisco and be a part of this community,” Google employees were instructed to say, as a preface to their remarks at a January 2014 hearing before the local transportation authority, according to a leaked company memo.That hearing was one of several pivotal moments in recent San Francisco history when public officials could have used the city’s legislative or regulatory powers to force the tech industry to contribute more to public services, but chose not to. Such inflection points (which also include a controversial 2011 tax break for Twitter and a failed attempt at a “tech tax” in 2016) highlight the complicated relationship between the city government and an industry that has brought untold wealth and jobs, but has arguably failed to pay its fair share – while treating the city as a petri dish for disruptive innovations (think Uber, Airbnb and self-driving cars) by ignoring regulations.The nominal issue in 2014 was the use of public bus stops by private charter shuttles (AKA “Google buses”) hired by tech companies to ferry employees the 45 miles south to their Silicon Valley headquarters. Activists wanted the double-decker buses banned from the streets and the companies fined for the illegal use of bus stops the city chose to legalize the buses.The Google Bus controversy was particularly charged because it tapped into local residents’ deep concern that San Francisco – a city with the population of Jacksonville, Florida, and the self-importance of New York – would be reduced to a bedroom community for Silicon Valley. But while the buses continue to ply their routes north and south, that particular nightmare scenario hasn’t come to pass. Instead, San Francisco has become more of a satellite campus, with South Bay stalwarts including Apple, Facebook, Google and LinkedIn competing for office space in the city proper. They’ve joined the San Francisco-native companies Twitter, Uber, and Airbnb in the cramped confines of a city of just 49 square miles, surrounded by water on three sides.The consequences of that squeeze are well documented: the outrageous housing costs, the displacement of black and Latino families, evictions, homelessness, the loss of beloved businesses and cultural institutions. The tale of how tech destroyed the city that gave us the Summer of Love has been told so many times that in 2014, the San Francisco Chronicle produced a satirical cheat sheet for out-of-town reporters parachuting in for taste of avocado toast and class warfare. (Amid a bumper crop of new elegies to San Francisco in recent months, web publication HmmDaily updated the form with an “AI Algorithm-generated” version.)But what’s striking about the current winter of our discontent (yes, it’s July consider this your obligatory Mark Twain reference) is that it’s not just the archetypal “evicted Mission District visual artist” complaining that techies ruined San Francisco: it’s the techies themselves, too.The arguments against San Francisco are manifold: it’s too expensive even for people making six-figure salaries, it’s dangerous and depressingly unequal, and, increasingly, it’s kind of boring. A frequent refrain among the more than a dozen tech workers who spoke to the  for this article was that it is not so much the presence of have-nots that is ruining their experience of San Francisco, but an overabundance of haves. “The housing crisis has a huge negative impact on quality of life because of who it excludes from living near you,” said Simon Willison, a software developer who moved to San Francisco from London five years ago. “When I visit other cities I’m always jealous of their income ersity: that people who have jobs that don’t provide a six-digit salary can afford to live and work and be happy.”“Even though people think there is ersity in the city, there isn’t really,” said Adrianna Tan, a senior product manager at a tech startup who moved to San Francisco from Singapore. “Sure, you get people from all over the world, but the only ones who can move here now come from the same socio-economic class.”“I feel like San Francisco is between Seattle and New York, but rather than the best of both, it’s the worst of both,” said Beth, a 24-year-old product manager who asked not to be identified by her real name. Beth moved to the city directly after graduating from Stanford to work at a major tech company, but recently transferred to Seattle. “Everyone I met was only interested in their jobs, and their jobs weren’t very interesting,” she said of her time in San Francisco. “I get it, you’re a developer for Uber, I’ve met a million of you.”One aspect of that homogeneity is that when everyone around you is either rich or destitute, being rich doesn’t feel that rich.“Unless you’re here to hit the IPO jackpot, you’ll always be middle-class,” said Chris, a former Apple manager who recently decided to leave San Francisco for Texas and spoke on condition of anonymity. “Tech salaries allow you to get by for now, but there’s no future for anyone under 40 in this city who’s not rich.”“It’s just not sustainable for a couple to live here,” he said. “A million-plus for a home with $300,000 down? Then when we have kids, $30,000 a year for private school? Who can afford that even making $300,000 a year? … There’s hundreds of other places in the country with the same restaurant culture or at least on par that cost half as much.”Chris also complained about the “property crime, unchecked homeless and drug issues” plaguing the city, noting that he had recently witnessed a man smoking crack cocaine in broad daylight in the middle of the famously twisty Lombard street. “You don’t see people smoking crack brazenly in public on Melrose in LA or in Times Square, NYC, but here the cops just shrug.”Figuring out how to exist in a city with so much human misery clearly on display is another challenge for affluent tech workers, many of whom express compassion for the poor and homeless, as well as frustration with the city’s decades of failure in providing adequate shelter and services to the homeless and mentally ill. “It was really hard to stomach the indifference that I witnessed from folks who’d been living in San Francisco for a while, simply stepping over the slumped bodies of people who lived outside or just cold ignoring people asking for money,” said Jessica Jin, who moved to San Francisco from Austin, Texas, to work for a tech startup, of her first impressions of the city. “I wondered how long it would take me to also become numb to it all.”Badrul Farooqi, a startup worker, said that he had been surprised to experience echoes of the constant fear of crime and violence he was exposed to growing up in Detroit while living in San Francisco. “The entire purpose of going to school and working hard was to escape this kind of environment,” he said. And while Farooqi acknowledged that San Francisco was much better off than the Detroit of his childhood, he argued that in some ways it was worse because the misery seems so unnecessary. “San Francisco is not Detroit,” he said. “Detroit was always poor … San Francisco has money! There’s so much money in this city.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0dac89af8c7b5cb1241be0028d84b84a724e15c/0_163_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9555ec4c59a45a54d03d2814f4857ed5","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of radiant","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘radiant’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘radiant’.Share your photos of what radiant means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 3 July at 10am.

Chas Newkey-Burden meets the children getting involvedOn a five-a-side football pitch, a short stroll from the Arsenal stadium, local kids are falling in love with sport. But it’s cricket, not football, that has them buzzing.For the past four years, thanks to the Islington Chance to Shine Street Youth project, Mikey Thompson has run weekly sessions at this north London leisure centre for the Eritrean Youth Club.Holding classes all year round, whatever the weather – including snow – the Islington setup is a far cry from the sleepy sun-kissed village greens often associated with the game.Thompson, 55, is known as the godfather of inner-city cricket. He says his mission is simple: “to put a bit of joy back on to kids’ faces”.It’s working. The children are enraptured by his down-to-earth approach, which relies on simple drills to teach them the basic disciplines of cricket. As the sun shines, the kids support one another, screams of joy keep going up, and the smiles are everywhere.Eight-year-old Sesen says her favourite part of cricket is the batting. “It feels so nice when I hit the ball because the bat really vibrates in my hands!”But there is another reason why she enjoys picking up the bat. “It makes my hands more steady,” says Sesen. “This is important, because when I grow up I want to be an artist and then my hands will have to be still, so my art doesn’t go all wiggly.”Winta, also eight, says that the sessions have helped her emotionally. “It helps me feel more confident in life,” she says. “If I’m a bit upset in the middle of the week, I just think about cricket and it immediately makes me feel better.”The project has the “open to all” ethos of its backer, Chance to Shine, a charity that aims to give all children the opportunity to play, learn and develop through the game of cricket. Chance to Shine’s main partner, NatWest, also has a long history of supporting grassroots cricket, facilitating schemes to assist communities and to show iniduals that anyone can play, no matter their level of experience.Hiyab, 12, personifies this. He says that when he first came to the sessions, he knew nothing about cricket and wasn’t even sure whether he would be able to play it. “But now I’ve got really confident because I did better than I expected,” he says, with a big grin.Hanan, 10, is also “surprised” by how well he did when he started going along. Before he knew it he was being picked for his school cricket team he now dreams of playing in the Olympics one day.Nine-year-old Selina thinks more children should get involved in cricket, whatever their circumstances or knowledge of the game. “They can still try it,” she says. “It’s so much fun once you start.”Thompson believes the key to the fun of the sessions is for him to channel his inner child. “If you don’t go into their world, you’ve lost them,” he says.He sweeps aside cricketing jargon to produce an experience that captivates children, drawing on decades of coaching and playing involvement, as well as his experiences coaching the blind and those with other disabilities.Thompson fine-tuned his approach when he ran a project in Hackney. “We went into some serious estates where it was all concrete,” he remembers. “I knew that old-fashioned cricket coaching simply wouldn’t work there – the children would have just walked away.”So he introduced tape-ball cricket and speedy, 20-ball games. Nodding at the nearby football stadium, he says that he injected some of football’s speed and excitement to lure inner-city children away from that game and towards cricket.He is full of praise for the support of his charity backer. “Chance to Shine is one of the most wonderful, wonderful things that has ever happened to cricket,” he says. “If it wasn’t for Chance to Shine, state school cricket would be dying.”It is people like Thompson who keep it alive. He believes that, taught correctly, cricket can be “a vehicle to steer children away from crime and antisocial behaviour and towards the right paths”.A passionate, tireless worker, he now hopes to get government backing to take his work into young offenders’ institutions – something Chance to Shine is also looking in to. “I think I could really help,” he says. “I’d like to use cricket to steer young offenders away from crime and get them off welfare.”For almost four decades, NatWest has supported cricket, with a mission to make the game easier for everyone to play and enjoy. A proud partner of the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) and the charity Chance to Shine, NatWest champions cricket at all levels - from grassroots support for local clubs and getting more people involved in the game to supporting current and future England stars and helping fans cheer on their teams, however and wherever they choose.With NatWest, cricket is a game that has #NoBoundaries.

Despite this lack of access to the formal game, she taught her brothers to play on an informal basis, then began running sessions for women and girls who had never before held a bat, supported by Warwickshire CC.“People think cricket is all upper middle-class men,” says Ajaz-Ali, who joined the ECB’s ambitious South Asian Action Plan, supported by NatWest, that aims to transform community engagement by recruiting 2,000 female mentors. “I go to mosques, temples, community centres, and get children and women from everywhere involved. Children see their mothers coaching and feel pride. It tells them they can do that too. These initiatives change opportunities and cultural attitudes for generations.”Ajaz-Ali prefers to focus on the future than lamenting her own lack of opportunity growing up. “I can’t bring back that time for me, but I can offer something to these girls,” she says. She sees change happening in the sport and aspires to generate more: “I have women playing in shalwar kameez, I coach asylum seekers. The point is to break down barriers and build inclusivity. Cricket is such a cool sport. It’s vibrant, it’s dynamic, and we have to try harder to make more people, particularly girls of all backgrounds, understand that.”Much like Ajaz-Ali, Laura Caughey found it hard to get a game of cricket. Growing up in Northern Ireland, she attempted to join a team as a child, only to be told she could practise with the boys but, lacking female peers, could not play in matches. “That stuck with me through adulthood and it’s not something I want more girls to experience.”Caughey decided to focus on a different aspect of the sport – umpiring. “I’d watch Simon Taufel and study what he did … he was my cricket idol growing up.” She became Ireland’s second female umpire this year when she was appointed to the representative panel of match officials.Through umpiring, Caughey has met like-minded people and helped to shape the conversation through administrative panels, eventually helping to set up and develop a women’s side at her local Carrickfergus CC. Reflecting on the enduring dismissive attitudes towards women in the sport, she says: “I just want to enjoy my season and let my on-field speak for me.”Ellie Threlkeld has been playing cricket for 10 years. She credits her experiences in mixed-gender cricket for developing skills which saw her move from the age-group county setup to playing for Lancashire Thunder in the semi-professional Kia Super League.Recognising the limited prospects for women cricketers, she opted to study psychology at Loughborough. The university’s enviable facilities and MCCU membership enable her to simultaneously develop her game and prepare for another option if cricket doesn’t work out.Threlkeld – who has ambitions to replace her England wicketkeeping heroes Sarah Taylor and Amy Jones one day – volunteers, coaches, and does ambassador work to grow interest and participation. “Assemblies get a great turnout, and girls can see how good it is to be a cricketer, but kids don’t just need role models – they need more thrown into the game so it’s an actual career.“A lot of women don’t have the option to train full-time – they need to work to earn a living. If there was money involved in the game, everything would improve faster.”With women all over the country dedicating their time and energy to the sport, barriers are shifting – new generations of girls are becoming women under the tutelage of these inspirational characters, and it’s hard to imagine anything but a positive future for British women’s cricket.For almost four decades, NatWest has supported cricket, with a mission to make the game easier for everyone to play and enjoy.

We remember Beryl the Peril but what about the even more troublesome Jonah?“Jonah was on the back page of the Beano for seven or eight years,” said comic expert Steve Marchant. “He was an ugly sailor. Every week he would rock up on to somebody’s boat and the boat would sink, that was the gag. The humour was in how the inevitable happens … terrific stuff.”Visitors to the recently relocated Cartoon Museum in London will from Monday be able to see examples of Jonah, a strip drawn by Ken Reid, at a new temporary exhibition: Comic Creators: The famous and the forgotten.The show explores comic creations which have become imbued in the national consciousness, and others who arguably deserve to be.Marchant, who has curated the show, fully expects people to go: “I know Desperate Dan, I know Dennis the Menace, I know Judge Dredd … but what the hell is this?“I’m putting stuff up which I think is equally as good. There are people who were doing brilliant work throughout the 20th century but have just slipped through the cracks of history and it has been part of my jolly job to take the ones, in my view, who are worth rediscovering.”A case in point might be Bunter, the fabulously famous and stout comic star who first appeared in 1908. Bunter strips are displayed next to Hungry Horace, a little-remembered character in Sparky whose love of cakes, sausage rolls, milkshakes and biscuits regularly got him in trouble.They are not comic strips likely to be seen today. “Nowadays the idea of having kids’ comic characters who were morbidly obese probably wouldn’t go down too well,” said Marchant. “Back in the day it was funny.”Other strips on display will include Tinker, a girl’s comic character based on Tinkerbell and Marvelman from the 1950s, perhaps the first successful British superhero.There is also an unpublished cover from Battle Picture Weekly, with a cartoon of a soldier on the ground about to be bayoneted – “Death Lunge! Is D-Day Dawson Finished!” It was considered too strong even for the certain type of boy growing up in the 1970s who made up the comic’s core readership.The exhibition is the first of what will be three temporary shows a year at the museum, which opens at its new home near Oxford Circus on Monday, a year after it was forced to leave its previous premises near the British Museum.Museum director Becky Jephcoat said they had to leave because of an unexpected rent increase.The move to Wells Street has worked out well because the museum has found a new, bigger space which comes with a peppercorn rent and space for a learning studio and “destination” shop.A £1m redevelopment has resulted in a brilliant blank canvas for the museum. Jephcoat said: “We want to make the museum much more immersive and relevant and attract new audiences.”The main exhibition gallery, curated by the ’s Steve Bell, tells the story of the history of cartoon and comic art with examples from the museum’s collection of 6,000 pieces.The museum first opened in 2006, attracting 26,000 visitors a year. Jephcoat said they expected that number to reach 55,000 within three years."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9eb83898f3cc6e037e199fd97736025961b9d8ee/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8dedeb84bc9ee4fbca8aa0a9d1cbe993","title":"green your routine hour by hour guide making climate difference","story":"From borrowing clothes to switching search engines, there are ways to boost your environmental credentials throughout the dayMicrobeads were banned in the UK last year, but most soaps are still wrapped in plastic.

Except it’s not a horror: this is Toy Story 4, and the sinister hench-dummies of a manipulative antique doll named Gabby Gabby. This is supposed to be a children’s movie, for God’s sake!An army of scary dolls really is descending upon us. Back from the dead last week was Chucky, the sadistic antihero of the Child’s Play films, in a gleefully gory new reboot. In July we’ve got Annabelle Comes Home, the third solo outing for another doll (“based on a true story”) who just refuses to die. Rather than destroying her, Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga think: “We’ll just put Annabelle in this cabinet in the home we share with our curious teenage daughter. It will be fine.” Later this autumn, we have a sequel to The Boy, the 2016 horror about a woman hired by a weird family to nanny a doll as if he were their living son.That is one advantage of doll horrors: these possessed playthings can be endlessly patched up and passed on, which explains why we are somehow on the eighth Child’s Play movie. But dolls have other factors in their favour: their not-quite-human status their familiarity their association with childhood their amenability to animation in every sense. Toy Story’s Gabby Gabby references the 1929 movie The Great Gabbo, in which a ventriloquist played by Erich von Stroheim develops a love-hate relationship with his dummy, not to mention the “Talky Tina” doll in a memorable 1963 episode of The Twilight Zone.Dolls have been a permanent horror fixture ever since, from the classic Dead of Night to Poltergeist, Magic, Dolls and Puppet Master, down to lo-fi trash such as Black Devil Doll from Hell. Do we really need more of them? Do today’s dolls have anything new to bring to the party? Maybe. The new Child’s Play is actually a parable about smart tech and consumerism. Chucky is possessed not by an evil spirit but an AI system set to “malevolent” by a disgruntled sweatshop worker. It is basically your worst Amazon Echo nightmare. The recent Miley Cyrus-led episode of Black Mirror also centred on an AI-enhanced doll becoming a surrogate friend, although it left the juicier horror implications unexplored. But if these examples are removing the supernatural ghosts from the dolls, movies such as Toy Story are putting them right back in again. It’s not just Gabby Gabby and her hench-dummies Woody, Buzz and Bo Peep are all haunted dolls. So Toy Story is effectively closing the loop and creating new generations of kids creeped out by dolls. Let’s hope Annabelle and Gabby Gabby never join forces we might never recover.

These included Lochwinnoch in Renfrewshire, Fauldhouse in West Lothian, Foxbar in Renfreshire and Marnoch in North Lanarkshire.The University of Liverpool found that six unhealthy neighbourhoods in the top 10 were in inner London. Also in the top ranks were Shotley Gate near Ipswich and areas north of Immingham in Humberside.Researchers analysed a range of lifestyle and environmental measures including levels of air pollution, access to amenities such as fast food outlets or pubs, and proximity to health services including GPs in addition to parks and recreational spaces.Dr Mark Green, a senior lecturer in health geography who undertook the study, said: “Our research, in conjunction with the Consumer Data Research Centre (CDRC) and Public Health England, has allowed us to pull together freely available information from sources such as GP surgeries, health centres, fast food outlets, air pollution statistics published by the Environment Agency.The findings will be presented at the International Medical Geography Symposium on Monday.The data resource used is part of the CDRC which aims to analyse information collected by business, local and national government organisations.Green added: “We anticipate that this resource will be an important tool for citizens and policymakers alike interested in how their neighbourhoods may be associated to their health.”Prof Alex Singleton, deputy director of the CDRC, said: “Our study found that access was not evenly spread across Great Britain – rural areas have poorer access to many health services, and those services which are seen as damaging to health are often concentrated in poorer areas."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6632ddd5458131bf85c7f043bea88212e95a25ba/0_302_4962_2977/master/4962.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=88195391ca8cbf4f9c00b66ee1b77b51","title":"from first period to menopause share physical experiences of life as a woman","story":"Be it a first orgasm, experiences with contraception and menopause or something else, we would like to hear your storiesThe experience of life in a woman’s body can be challenging, embarrassing, funny and even joyful.Is there a physical experience you’ve had as a woman that has had a significant effect on your life – good or bad – and that you consider to be underreported?

How famous London pubs are adapting to a changing worldMilky tea, fish and chips, the local pub: these were once the enticing mainstays of British life. They’re all still there, of course, but outside the home we drink far more coffee than tea, and on the high street the curry house and chicken takeaway long ago supplanted the deep-fried attractions of the fish and chip shop. Of the traditional triumvirate only the public house remains in a primary position, but that too is under threat.Is this a loss to the British way of life? Has some vital part of the social fabric been neglected and left to slowly fall apart? Listen to the doomsayers, like the Campaign for Real Ale (Camra), and that’s certainly the impression. Last year it described the situation as “dismal”. Almost on cue, Soho’s celebrated Coach \u0026amp Horses closed its doors last week after its freeholder, Fuller’s Brewery, took back possession from the leaseholder, Alastair Choat. The pub has been a Soho institution for many decades, with the previous landlord, Norman Balon, famed for his rudeness and, paradoxically, the permissive atmosphere he fostered.It was the scene of Private Eye lunches and the base, as it were, of the notoriously unsober Spectator columnist Jeffrey Bernard. Choat tried to maintain its idiosyncratic spirit, by turning it into what he called London’s first vegetarian and vegan pub and getting a licence to serve naked guests.He made a desperate campaign to keep hold of the pub, even staging a shortened version of the play Jeffrey Bernard is Unwell with Cold Feet’s Robert Bathurst in the lead role, and organising a 12,000-signature petition to halt Fuller’s. But all to no avail. Fuller’s moved back with a promise to restore the pub to its “former glory”.Given that its former glory was all about its inimitable ambience, it is not clear how that restoration is going to be achieved. What is significant, though, is that Fuller’s is appealing to a vanished heyday as the vision of its future. But heydays are accidental or inspired and certainly can’t be recaptured through corporate planning.In truth the Soho that the Coach and Horses epitomised – bohemian, transgressive, hopelessly drunk – no longer exists, and any attempt to return to the “features that have made it such a famous pub”, as Fuller’s pledges to do, are doomed to be an exercise in museum curation. What we most love about the past is that is no longer here.Yearning for the idealised pub of yore is not, however, a new pastime. It’s probably almost as old as pubs themselves. Indeed, reminiscing about how a given pub used to be is a staple of pub conversation. The nostalgic lament is, after all, practically a symptom of inebriation.Seventy-three years ago George Orwell wrote his famous essay about his favourite public house, the Moon Under Water. He listed 10 qualities possessed by this pub, only to reveal at the end that no such pub existed. It was an ideal he’d wished into being.Of the pubs that have closed, the majority have been small, and therefore perhaps the kind that struggled to attract women. At the same time, micropubs that, with a nod to Orwell, prioritise authenticity, good beer, and abjure games and machines, have flourished in recent years. Turnover across the pub business has actually remained the same, which suggests that things are not as bad as the closures suggest. Other elements of Orwell’s checklist – that the pub be tobacco-smoke stained and that motherly barmaids should address customers as “dear” (“pubs where the barmaids call you ‘ducky’ always have a disagreeable raffish atmosphere”) – have not aged so well.For pubs are seldom just pubs. They are not just somewhere you buy alcoholic drinks. They reflect the tastes, interests and prejudices of their owners and customers. You don’t like that place with nonstop Sky Sports, St George’s flags and a carpet that makes you want to throw up the bland lager you’ve had little choice but to drink? Well, perhaps not everyone’s a great fan of that precious polished wood, real ale and toasted-ciabatta haven that you like to frequent.Viewed from abroad, of course, these differences dissolve into a wholesome image. It’s notable that the only British selection in TripAdvisor’s annual Travellers’ Choice awards list of the top 25 travel experiences was, at number 18, Liquid History Tours’ guided tour of historic London pubs. Not Shakespeare or the royal palaces or the Lake District, but a pub crawl. In the words of the late Derek Jameson, do they mean us?Last Thursday evening in Southwark, I joined John Warland, who set up Liquid History Tours eight years ago, and a Californian couple, John Rae and his wife Colleen, who had arranged their own private pub tour. Rae has already twice been on the main tour that made the Travellers’ Choice awards list, which he describes as the best he has ever experienced.“I like learning about history while getting a little bit drunk,” he explains, not unreasonably. We started at the George, off Borough High Street, the last surviving galleried coaching inn. It dates to at least 1543, and quite possibly back to Chaucer’s days – The Canterbury Tales (written in the late 14th century) begins at a similar nearby inn, the Tabard, which has not survived.As Warland reminded us, Dickens mentions the George in Little Dorrit, and was a frequent visitor to the pub himself. But then he was a frequent visitor to many pubs around London and Kent. Any serious study of the subject will sooner or later come back to literature, which has enjoyed a long and fruitfully symbiotic relationship with pubs.If you want to know about the London demi-monde in the 1930s and 1940s, for instance, then there is no more vividly informative place to turn than the novels of Patrick Hamilton. His prose hits you with the smell of beer and cigarettes as if you’d opened a saloon bar door from that the period. Hamilton, it should be noted, died of cirrhosis of the liver.Warland is a font of major and minor cultural knowledge, as he leads us through Borough Market, with two brief pale ale pit-stops, and past the Globe theatre, with full Shakespeare digression, over the Millennium bridge, where he points out the artist Ben Wilson’s micro-works on flattened chewing gum, to two pubs, the Cockpit and the art nouveau wonder the Black Friar, that, coincidentally, were past watering holes for the Observer’s ever-thirsty staff.The ever-welcoming Cockpit abuts a building on St Andrew’s Hill that used to be one of of the Observer’s many previous homes. As Peter Corrigan, a former sports editor of this newspaper, once put it: “If you had taken away the Cockpit, the Observer would have collapsed in more ways than one.”We move on to Fleet Street, where the word and the wine once lived in productive if unruly unison. Nowadays newspapers, following Rupert Murdoch’s lead, have long since departed the area, journalism runs on sparkling water, and newspaper offices are about as wild and hectic as those of your average accountancy firm.At the Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese, dating from 1538, I leave the tour, and in a parting comment Warland observes that, in his experience, good pubs tend to survive. No doubt he’s right, although it does raise the question again of what makes a good pub.Seeking more objective criteria, I went in search of Britain’s oldest pub. It turns out that this is a fool’s errand, so rich in complexity that it could turn you to drink. Oldest can refer to the actual building, the site, or the longest continuing licence, and each of those categories is fiercely disputed, with competing claims coming from as far a field as the Clachan near Loch Lomond, the Adam and Eve in Norwich, Ye Olde Trip to Jerusalem in Nottingham and the Skirrid Inn in Abergavenny.According to Guinness World Records, the oldest pub in the UK is Ye Olde Fighting Cocks in St Albans. It was apparently first established in 793AD (although its licence only goes back to the 17th century). What’s the secret of its success? Location, location, location.It sits a short walk from St Albans cathedral, handy for pilgrims and tourists alike. At its lovely oak bar I find Tony Breeze, nursing a non-alcoholic lager. Now retired, he comes here most lunchtimes from Hemel Hempstead because he enjoys the “friendly atmosphere”.It is certainly cosy, with the wooden-beamed ceiling just a couple of inches above my head and a sturdy carpet beneath my feet, all within a hexagonal-shaped building that has several discrete bars.Breeze used to run a pub in the 1970s, which he describes as “a bit stressful”. It used to serve food – far from standard in those days. He recommends the lunch at the Ye Olde Fighting Cocks, and says there are completely different gastronomic demands these days compared with when he was a landlord. “Now people have travelled some distance,” he says, “and they expect the food to be very good.”Yes, we have come a long way from the terror of the steak and kidney pie. Across the bar Lawrence and Grace Mungai are enjoying a refreshing pint with a visiting friend from Kenya. The Mungais are big fans of the pub.“I love the way it has conserved its heritage, the way it’s kept its original structure,” says Grace. ”You walk in here and the history comes back.”The couple live in Dunstable, where they frequent a friendly local. “When we lived in London,” says her husband, “some pubs we could not go in. We knew we were not welcome. They wouldn’t tell you to leave, they just wouldn’t serve you.”But he says one of his favourite experiences of recent years was meeting his cousin in a pub in Elephant and Castle that was full of people from all over the world. “There were all these different cultures, all getting along. It was such a beautiful evening.”In the end, that’s what all of us long for in a pub: somewhere to go in which we can have a relaxing drink in a convivial atmosphere and perhaps meet others with a similar aim. When it’s done well then it can feel like you’re in the only place you want to be in the world at that moment. And the very best pubs are timeless places in which that moment seems like it could last forever.No pub visit is complete without a visit to the toilet – a neglected but essential part of any pub. On the door of the gents is a sign, “By the gracious ordinance of the Honourable lords of the royal courts of justice” states in large lettering “No cock fighting”.Despite all the commercial pressures and competing attractions, the changing population and social habits, it’s a sign that the British pub, like its humour, is in rude health.Largely, and surprisingly, tourist-free, the pub is the local of Ian Rankin’s fictional detective Inspector Rebus. The Ox retains the authenticity of an old-school hostelry. Dating back to 1730, the former brothel appears in George Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four where it was the model for the “Proles” pub, the down-at-heel drinking den of the mistreated underclasses in his dystopian work. Famous for its appearance in James Joyce’s 1922 novel Ulysses. The pub is an essential stop for fans of the book whose main character drops into the pub for a lunchtime gorgonzola cheese sandwich and a glass of burgundy while wandering through Dublin.Originally The Bunch of Grapes, a pub has stood on pebbled Limehouse beach in east London for nearly 500 years. Charles Dickens described the pub in the opening chapter of Our Mutual Friend after first visiting it as a child in 1820. Actor Sir Ian McKellen is one of the current co-owners.Built as a coaching inn in 1750 and atmospherically sited on Cornwall’s Bodmin Moor it’s the setting for Daphne du Maurier’s 1936 novel. It is believed the inn takes its name from the smugglers bringing rum from Jamaica.This atmospheric inn in Hampstead, north London, first opened in 1545. Dick Turpin is thought to have been a regular – the pub lies on the route plundered by the highwayman. The inn has some significant literary connections, appearing in Dickens’sThe Pickwick Papers and then, above all else, Bram Stoker’s Dracula."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e3046b5ec9f1d4d0498de5ee368a6782c271e5eb/0_200_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7d0fe41413cae3c2c64313bdf745398a","title":"bookingcom cashback offer redeem","story":"Readers were promised rewards as an incentive to book hotels, but haven’t received themLate last year Booking advertised a promotion of £80 cashback on future hotel reservations costing £350 or more.

Almost half of those who chose not to switch said the process was too time-consuming, while a slightly lower number were put off by having to contact multiple providers.Under the new “text-to-switch” process, consumers text PAC to a number, after which the code is sent back. The code is valid for 30 days. The response from the provider will also need to include details of early termination charges or pay-as-you-go credit balances. The consumer can them pass the number on to their new provider. The service is switched within one working day.“The new process is designed to be quick and easy, so customers could request their code while looking for a new deal – for example, while on the phone to a new provider, or in store,” says Ofcom.Consumers have also sometimes encountered difficulties in paying both their old and their new provider at the same time when switching.Ofcom has now banned mobile providers from charging for notice periods running after the switch date. Ofcom estimates this will result in savings to the consumer of £10m a year.The move comes as part of a push by the regulator to make life easier for people dealing with their communications. Under the new rules, providers will have to publish clear guidance to help customers follow the new process, as a result making better switching decisions."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/063e118f573284c6714c6ff156417915f3ce9477/0_490_7244_4345/master/7244.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fc47785e5f4ae5fe8363f01405a739b4","title":"from kylie to miley sunday at glastonbury","story":"The world’s greatest music festival closed out with a hits-packed Cure set – plus choirs, cones and cutesy metalby  Ben Beaumont-Thomas and  Karin AndreassonHangovers, fatigue and accumulated sweat were put aside for one more day in the sun, with the Cure delivering an epic final headlining set.Miley Cyrus proved her rockstar worth, with a set that featured everything from Old Town Road to Nine Inch Nails, via a lot of swearing.Opening the day were the Langa Methodist Church Choir, a Cape Town choir whose grace and beauty soothed many a sore head first thing in the morning.It was a moving performance for Kylie Minogue, who was forced to cancel in 2005 due to a breast cancer diagnosis, and had never returned until now. “Never mind the legends slot next stop, headliner,” said the ’s deputy music editor Laura Snapes.Janelle Monáe and Billie Eilish tore up the West Holts and Other stages respectively.Looking down over the Shangri-La area: Glastonbury’s far eastern corner where activists, ravers and the very, very lost congregate for mind-spinning happenings.Cutesy-slash-terrifying Japanese band Babymetal astonished on the Other stage, with their high-intensity, high-glucose take on metal.Dave, who made one audience member’s dreams come true with a chance to guest on the mic and Years \u0026amp Years, who brought pure pop and queer energy to the Pyramid stage.In the early hours of Sunday morning, Mark Ronson brought his Club Heartbreak concept to the Stonebridge Bar: melancholy yet uplifting dancefloor bangers to – paradoxically? – cure you of a broken heart.Come the morning, Glastonbury was back to its usual self: sitting thoroughly outside of mainstream life, and always for the better.As everyone was contemplating their first cider of the day, the ’s very own Kate Hutchinson played an early set at the Beat Hotel.As you read this, the tent city is being dismantled for another year – but ready to rise again for Glastonbury’s 50th anniversary.

But very soon it will all be gone.En route to Japan, her aides briefed reporters that she was not yet ready to answer backward-looking questions about her turbulent three-year premiership – let alone anoint a successor, as Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt vie to succeed her.Instead, asked about how she was feeling, she slipped into pure Maybot, saying: “My mood is one of determination to carry on doing the job that I’m doing and to ensure that I get some very strong messages across to those I’m meeting.”One recipient of such a message was Vladimir Putin. She took the opportunity to rebuke him, face-to-face and at length, over the Skripal poisonings – the pair first posing sternly alongside each other for a photo, May wearing a glower one unkind colleague said looked as though she had practised it in the mirror.Seasoned observers of May’s approach say she is often at her best when under attack – and the aftermath of the Salisbury attack, when she rallied international support for reprisals against Russia, was one of her few moments of genuine diplomatic influence.But Putin warmed up for his encounter by trolling May, with an outspoken Financial Times interview trashing liberal democracy. As the prime minister exits the global stage, she leaves it dominated by a motley cast of populist strongmen – Putin, Donald Trump, Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro.The vicar’s daughter who let off steam by running through wheat fields could not be a more different character. Yet in the optimism of her early days, when she was so confident of her public appeal she posed for a photo shoot in a £995 pair of brown leather trousers, May and her team hoped they could influence Trump and even ride the wave of brash optimism that swept him into the White House.She was the first world leader to visit him there, just a week after his inauguration, in January 2017.In Philadelphia en route, May dropped in on the Republican convention and gave a speech suggesting the US and post-Brexit Britain could “rediscover our confidence together”.It was intended as a clever bit of political framing by May’s team, then still led by the mercurial Nick Timothy and Fiona Hill. She name-dropped Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan, whose relationship as cold war warriors was known to be warm.But she also praised the multinational institutions of which Trump is instinctively suspicious, pointing out that Britain and the US worked together to build them in the aftermath of the second world war – the United Nations, Nato, the World Bank.“It is through our actions over many years, working together to defeat evil or to open up the world, that we have been able to fulfil the promise of those who first spoke of the special nature of the relationship between us,” she said. “The promise of freedom, liberty and the rights of man.”It was a signal that while May hoped she and Trump would get on – coyly telling journalists “sometimes opposites attract” – she also hoped to remind him of the US’s critical role in the world. Yet the abiding image of that trip became the awkward moment, caught by the cameras, when Trump reached out and held the prime minister’s hand.By the time May’s plane landed in Ankara for a meeting with Erdoğan at his gaudy palace outside the city, Trump had signed what became known as the Muslim travel ban, stopping the citizens of seven countries entering the US – hardly embodying the “values of democracy and liberty” she had lauded in Philadelphia.Even then, May’s exhortations to the erratic Trump fell largely on deaf ears. But during the next two years, as her premiership advanced into ever more troubled waters, her ability to influence friend and foe alike drained away.Japanese TV viewers wanting to catch up on who was in town for the G20 were treated to a memory-jogging montage, showing the coughing fit that seized May during her 2017 party conference speech – and Philip Hammond leaping up to hand her a throat sweet.At the conference centre, during a photocall for EU leaders, who had been locking horns over who should fill the institution’s top jobs, May shuffled awkwardly to find a place to stand, in an excruciating visual metaphor for Britain’s half-in, half-out status.Her unashamed lack of clubbability has frequently made her appear somewhat isolated at EU gatherings – though she shared a hearty laugh with Angela Merkel earlier this year, when they were both wearing suits in the same shade of bright blue.In another life, in which it wasn’t May’s allotted task to take Britain out of the EU, these two no-nonsense women of the centre-right might have become political friends.Instead, at summit after summit as the Brexit talks twisted and turned, May was sentenced to be the lonely human face of British exceptionalism, dispatched to dine with her aides at the British residence, while the EU27 carried on their discussions without her.Even if Brexit had gone smoothly, the task of recalibrating Britain’s place in the world as an ex-member of the EU would have been a challenging one for any prime minister. But hemmed in by a rebellious cabinet and a ided party, in a hung parliament, May has had little time to practise geopolitics, aside from shuttling back and forwards to Brussels.When she does make it on to the summit circuit, her moderate message of international cooperation and respect for the “rules-based global order” has often appeared out of step with the moment – and with Britain’s own political direction.She has been defined in the world’s eyes by the hashed project of withdrawing from the EU – but on Saturday, alone on stage in the bright white press room in Osaka, she said: “We have always understood that our success as a nation is tied to our collaboration with other countries and the relationships we build.”Her loyal husband, Philip – an integral part of May’s political project from the first moment to the last – looked on from the front row."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef13c545f6e57c19d1e9e1124ef855e135fef30b/0_385_2732_1639/master/2732.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7248d3017320dac32f8a83e9cfd214f5","title":"jeremy hunt i would tell bust businesses no deal brexit was worth it","story":"Tory leadership hopeful says he would tell bankrupt firms their sacrifice was worth itBusiness groups have expressed anger after Jeremy Hunt said he would willingly tell people whose companies went bust after a no-deal Brexit that their sacrifice had been necessary.In a notable escalation of his rhetoric on Brexit, the foreign secretary, who is trailing Boris Johnson in the Conservative leadership election, also said he would actively pursue no deal if a new departure plan looked impossible by the start of October – less than 10 weeks after the new prime minister takes office.Hunt’s shift towards the harder language associated with Johnson, who has promised to deliver Brexit by 31 October “do or die”, has alarmed some fellow Conservatives. A senior party source said it was “shocking to hear an allegedly sensible politician talk so frivolously about the livelihoods of millions of people”.Throughout the leadership campaign Hunt has stressed the potential damage from a no-deal departure, saying he would only pursue it if there was no other way to deliver Brexit.But interviewed on BBC One’s the Andrew Marr Show, Hunt said it could become a policy goal if his plan to renegotiate a departure deal with the EU – dismissed by Brussels as unrealistic – proved impossible.“At the beginning of October, if there is no prospect of a deal that can get through parliament, then I will leave at the end of October because that is our democratic promise to the British people,” Hunt said.Asked whether, under such a policy, he would be willing to look the owners of family businesses in the eye and say they should be prepared to see their companies go bust to ensure a no-deal Brexit, Hunt said: “I would do so but I’d do it with a heavy heart precisely because of the risks.”In a speech on Monday, Hunt will try to allay worries about the potential impact of no deal with a self-styled 10-point plan for preparations, including £6bn to protect fishing and agriculture. It would also include a new, dedicated committee with special powers to boost no-deal planning and a logistics committee to assist with imports and exports.“If you’re a sheep farmer in Shropshire or a fishermen in Peterhead I have a simple message for you: I know you face uncertainty if we have to leave the EU without a deal,” Hunt is to say at the speech in London.“I will mitigate the impact of no-deal Brexit on you and step in to help smooth those short-term difficulties. If we could do it for the bankers in the financial crisis, we can do it for our fisherman, farmers and small businesses now.”Earlier on Marr, Hunt said he would tell business owners that a no-deal Brexit was necessary to maintain the UK’s image abroad as “a country where politicians do what the people tell them to do”.He added: “So if, in order to do what the people tell us to do, we have to leave without a deal, I would do that. But I would find support for those companies to help them weather the storms.”His style is notably technocratic, with few rhetorical flourishes and an emphasis on his consensual approach and long record as a minister, notably during more than five years as health secretary, a traditional graveyard of ministerial careers. Hunt’s attempts to talk up a backstory as an \u0027underestimated\u0027 entrepreneur can fall flat given he is also the son of an admiral and was head boy at Charterhouse. Overall, Hunt’s approach can seem uninspiring and hard to pin down in terms of core beliefs, hence the \u0027Theresa in trousers\u0027 nickname among some Tory MPs.His campaign team have decided to take the fight directly to rival Boris Johnson though, with Hunt taking part in a Twitter Q\u0026ampA session as a direct response to Johnson\u0027s refusal to appear on a Sky TV head-to-head debate. The hashtag: #BoJoNoShow.He says a new deal with the EU is possible by 31 October and he would send a cross-party negotiating team to Brussels, including members of the DUP. He would countenance leaving the EU without a deal but is notably more wary than rival Boris Johnson.Before the campaign began he called for a doubling of defence spending, but he has since pulled back slightly, saying only that it should increase. He has argued that cuts to social care budgets had gone too far.Hunt backs the 2050 target for zero net carbon emissions and has called for \u0027sensible tax incentives\u0027 to encourage green initiatives, but very little beyond this.A likely strength for him, as he has been seen as a solid foreign secretary, an impression burnished by taking over from the chaotic Johnson. This has been a key part of his pitch.Leading business groups have been careful to not criticise either Hunt or Johnson directly during the leadership campaign, but the comments prompted strong warnings against such policies.Make UK, which represents manufacturing and engineering firms, said these companies were “the backbone of British industry, and the suggestion that losing them is a price worth paying leaves many speechless”.Leaving without a deal would be “an act of economic vandalism”, a spokesman said. “We call on any and every politician advocating no deal to think carefully about the enormous harm it would do to businesses and the millions of families who rely on them.”Claire Walker, the co-executive director of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: “Politicians must remember that it is businesses that create jobs and opportunities across our communities, and it is the role of government to create the conditions necessary for these firms to survive and grow, now and in the future. A focus on ideology rather than practicalities does not serve the interests of the UK, or its people, well.”A CBI spokesman said: “The case for any new prime minister to secure a good deal with the EU is clearcut. Jobs and livelihoods will depend on it.”The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said the comments showed that to win votes from Tory members Hunt was “willing to sacrifice the jobs and living standards of millions”, calling this “the height of irresponsibility”.The senior Conservative source said there was intense worry within the party that Hunt’s comments showed both candidates were trying to “pander to the hardcore right of the party”.The source said: “It’ll be the poorest who will be hit the hardest by no deal. People who use a wage to keep a roof over their heads and food in their stomach – not Jeremy or Boris or any other taxpayer-subsidised MP.“Those in ivory towers need to realise that this is real people’s lives we’re dealing with, not just party politics. The leadership candidates need to get over themselves and do what’s best for the country and deliver a deal.”One leading centrist Tory MP said should be appealing to “the mainstream moderate business wing of Conservatism”.They said: “He will never win by aping Boris as the toughest Brexiter. Theresa May tried that and ended up tying herself in knots.”Hunt has faced criticism from Johnson over his insistence that if a deal was very close by 31 October he might briefly extend the deadline to finalise it. He told Marr that this was actually more likely to make Brexit happen.“If we got to the end of October and we’ve got a deal and we’re trying to get it through parliament but we need a few more parliamentary days, I’m not going to rip up that deal. Boris is,” he said.In his own TV interview, Johnson insisted he was happy to take responsibility for the consequences of Brexit.In sometimes tricky exchanges on Sky’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday, during which he appeared to not know the current hourly rate for the national living wage, Johnson denied that he tried to avoid accountability for his words and actions, saying he accepted liability for Brexit.“I played a part in that campaign and I’m very proud of what we did but I take personal responsibility now for what is happening to our country, for the drift and the dither, and the indecision, and the failure to be sufficiently robust in the negotiations which we’ve seen so far,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/164d109bbb1e5726f3aa12f250a6c8e4b069d340/0_137_5976_3586/master/5976.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dad59c0d0ec73bca5bb628c92d78bfe9","title":"labour calls for inquiry into civil service claim that corbyn is too frail","story":"Shadow minister says the comments leaked to the media have ‘disturbing implications’Labour has written to the head of the civil service to request an independent investigation into anonymous warnings leaked to a newspaper that claimed Jeremy Corbyn could be too frail to function as prime minister.Jon Trickett, the shadow minister for the Cabinet Office, told the cabinet secretary, Mark Sedwill, that the comments amounted to a “totally unwarranted and indeed unconstitutional political intervention, with disturbing implications for our democratic system”.Corbyn and his party have rejected the claims made in the Times on Saturday, which said that, at a recent event, senior civil servants had discussed their worries about what might happen if the Labour leader became prime minister.The report cited anonymous senior civil servants who warned that they were concerned about Corbyn being put into Downing Street after an election as he seemed to lack a firm grasp of issues and was being “propped up” by his advisers.One was quoted as saying: “There is a real worry that the Labour leader isn’t up to the job physically or mentally but is being propped up by those around him. There’s growing concern that he’s too frail and is losing his memory. He’s not in charge of his own party.”Corbyn has called for an investigation, saying it was “very concerning” for officials to brief against an elected politician.In his letter to Sedwill, Trickett wrote: “Discussion of these matters, based on false assumptions, should not be taking place. Worse, it is without precedent in my experience that any high-level discussion about senior politicians, let alone the leader of the opposition, should be shared with a newspaper.“I must now formally say to you that it is hard to avoid the conclusion that this has been a totally unwarranted and indeed unconstitutional political intervention with disturbing implications for our democratic system.“There clearly needs to be an investigation into what appears to have been a breach of civil service neutrality, independent of the Cabinet Office, in order to avoid any real or apparent conflicts of interest.”Trickett also said he wanted a meeting with Sedwill to discuss the matter, and to get “clear assurances that the basic principles of British public life will not be undermined”.Earlier on Sunday Len McCluskey, the leader of the Unite union and a close associate of Corbyn, told BBC One’s Andrew Marr show that he believed the comments could have been entirely made up by the journalists concerned.“They ought to be ashamed of themselves,” he said. “It was fake news. It was lies. It was distortion.“Jeremy Corbyn is fit as a fiddle. He is one of the strongest people I have ever met – people 20 years younger struggle to keep up with him. I don’t believe them at all. It’s the Murdoch press. Of course they are going to attack and try to undermine Jeremy.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6209b0dac03dc07ae87c3946a6b7b61e70505c86/0_20_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a9084d58c453e4af4f55584c52f91c69","title":"we need to move now john mcdonnell voices labour brexit policy frustration","story":"Shadow chancellor wants more openly pro-referendum and pro-remain approachJohn McDonnell has expressed renewed frustration at the slow pace of change on Labour’s Brexit policy, praising Jeremy Corbyn for seeking a consensus view, but warning: “We need to move now.”In a sign of the continued splits within the party over whether and how to seek a second referendum, and what side to campaign for if one happened, a key Corbyn ally, Unite’s Len McCluskey, said the Labour leader should not be “bullied” into action by his frontbench.A shadow cabinet meeting last week, billed as key in deciding Labour’s position, failed to reach an agreement after Corbyn said he wanted to consult unions and others further before making a decision, going against the view of several shadow ministers.Speaking to Sky’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday, McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said he was among those who wanted a more openly pro-referendum and pro-remain approach.“I’ve said publicly I would vote remain, I’d campaign for remain. Jeremy then said we need to consult our executive committee members,” McDonnell said.Before the shadow cabinet meeting, McDonnell said, he thought “we were going to move further”.He continued: “The unions asked for a bit more time – fair enough, I don’t mind that. The type of leader that Jeremy is is a consensus-builder, and that’s what he’s trying to do: bring people together, have those consultations, those discussions, and bring people together.”Asked whether he had privately described Labour’s Brexit policy as a “slow-motion car crash”, McDonnell declined to comment, but also did not reject the idea that this was his view.He said: “What I’ve been trying to say is we need to move now, and Jeremy said a month ago, we’re going to put this issue back to the people – I fully agree.”Some Labour sources have said the delays were in part prompted by pressure from McCluskey’s union, Unite, and people in Corbyn’s office such as his chief of staff, Karie Murphy, a close friend of McCluskey.But speaking later on Sunday to BBC One’s The Andrew Marr Show, McCluskey argued that there was no need to rush, and that Corbyn would not be pushed into a decision even if shadow ministers wanted the party to seek a second referendum, in which it would back remain.“That’s perfectly legitimate for them to express that view,” McCluskey said. “What Jeremy Corbyn is doing – and that’s why Jeremy Corbyn is such a strong leader – he’s not being bulled into any position by anybody.”McCluskey said that while he vehemently opposed a no-deal Brexit, he believed the most nationally unifying policy could be for Labour to win a general election and negotiate an economically robust form of Brexit.He criticised what he said was unnecessary pressure to make a decision: “There seems to be a panic to rush in order to establish a different position from one the Labour party has had for a couple of years now, which is respecting the result of the 2016 referendum and trying to negotiate a deal which would unite the nation.“Unfortunately we have had a prime minister who has made huge mistakes and a government which has been incapable of delivering Brexit. And we have had a well-funded remain lobby that has turned the nation into a toxic situation.”He said: “The reality is there is no panic to do anything. We’ve got a policy conference coming up in less than 12 weeks. Let Jeremy Corbyn consult.“My message to Labour MPs and to our Labour members is: Jeremy’s done OK so far, so let’s trust him to consult and see what emerges.”Elsewhere in his Sky interview, McDonnell, who was wearing a badge with the logo of the green direct action protest group Extinction Rebellion, defended Labour’s plan to consider delisting from the stock exchange companies who cause excess environmental damage.Extinction Rebellion had “put climate change at the top of our agenda, so it’s the priority for the next Labour government, basically”, he said.“We’ve got to ensure that there’s proper regulation of activity. We’ve got to have a just transition from a fossil fuel economy to a net zero economy as soon as we can,” McDonnell said.“But also, if there are companies that aren’t fulfilling their environmental responsibilities, undermining everything that we do, putting our planet at risk, there has to be some sanctions as well, and that’s regulation.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/328f487a99fe7368a52e379726f743c43ae5b1af/0_328_1592_955/master/1592.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3d2b1b225136eef6613f36166a62577f","title":"do you think that there is alien life beyond earth first contact","story":"Scientists searching the universe for aliens to conduct survey of the public for views on first contactScientists wrestling with the delicate issue of how to respond should humanity ever be contacted by an alien civilisation have hit on a radical idea: a survey that asks what the public would do.Members of the UK Seti Research Network (UKSRN) are to launch what they believe will be the largest ever survey of public attitudes towards alien contact on Monday at the Royal Society’s summer science exhibition.The views they gather will help them shape plans for an international protocol that sets the ground rules on how organisations should share news of any signals that are detected what sense can be made of them and how, if at all, humans might reply.“There is absolutely no procedure enshrined in international law on how to respond to a signal from an alien civilisation,” said Martin Dominik, an astronomer at the University of St Andrews. “We want to hear people’s views.

Last month, astronomers on the Breakthrough Listen project announced they had heard nothing after eavesdropping on more than 1,000 star systems within 160 light years of Earth.But Dominik points out that with 300bn stars in the Milky Way alone, Breakthrough Listen has barely begun the mammoth task of scanning the cosmos for life elsewhere. “If there were tens of quintillions of other civilisations like ours evenly distributed in the Milky Way, the Breakthrough Listen project would not have heard a thing,” he said.Dr John Elliott, a reader in intelligence engineering at Leeds Beckett University, said the global Seti community would announce any bona fide alien signal immediately. But in an era of social media that would spark a flood of fake news and conspiracy theories that leave people utterly confused about the truth, he said.The problem is that while scientists might quickly realise that an intercepted signal was complex enough to be broadcast from an advanced civilisation, it might take weeks or months to understand, if it can be deciphered at all. Any signal could easily be electromagnetic noise from equipment or a snippet of a terrestrial broadcast that leaked into space, unintended for such distant ears.The survey will help scientists work out how best to provide reliable information but also what should be done if it seems only polite to respond to an interstellar missive. The late Stephen Hawking warned that humans would do well not to alert alien civilisations to life on Earth, but other researchers disagree.Later this year, an organisation called Messaging Extraterrestrial Intelligence (Meti) International plans to beam signals into space containing references to the periodic table of elements. They will not be the first attempts to contact ET. In 1974, scientists at the Arecibo telescope in Puerto Rico sent a radio message about life on Earth to a group of stars 25,000 light years away. Given how baffling the message will be to many humans in the 21st century, it is unclear what any recipient will infer from it.“It makes sense to create a legally binding framework that is properly rooted in international law,” Dominik said. “I’m completely comfortable with taking the whole thing above the level of scientists. If there are public consequences of replying and sending out messages that is a political decision and not one to be taken by scientists.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed3ce8d4f807adfa89e513e36b2b19bb3ac24b13/0_194_5000_2999/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a9abd5464afd410e46f81adf1c4a0db0","title":"child cant breathe parents hang up job 999 call taker","story":"Talking to suicidal people, care workers trying CPR and patients who want ambulances for back pain is all in a week’s workToday’s eight-hour shift starts in style. A colleague takes a call from someone who will only swear at her, refusing to answer any questions. Two minutes later I get the same caller, who says I’m a useless pain in the arse. I persist, coolly asking for his address eventually he gives it to me. He claims to have been poisoned, only to decline treatment when the ambulance arrives.A lot of mental health calls come in today. If someone is suicidal, I remain on the line with them and listen, giving them a chance to talk.Today starts horribly, with a toddler who isn’t breathing. As I am trying to persuade the panicked parents to confirm their address, they hang up. I frantically try to call them back but there’s no answer.People see characters on TV shout “Ambulance, NOW!” down the phone and think that’s it. But call-takers have to be absolutely certain we are sending help to the right place, so we ask you to repeat your location and phone number twice. We also have to go through a process to assess how urgently you need help: this consists of some simple questions like “Is the patient breathing?” and “Is the patient conscious?”. We can’t skip these questions – we have to ask.I find out later that the parents of the poorly child legged it to the nearby doctor’s surgery, who also called for an ambulance.I stay on the line with the mother of a baby with breathing difficulties. I try to keep her calm while we wait for the ambulance to arrive.Demand is so high today that crews aren’t waiting for jobs to come in they are running from one job to another without returning to station.A colleague takes seven calls from people with chronic back pain in one hour. If you’ve had pain for a fortnight, do you really need half a million quid’s worth of ambulance speeding to you right now?I take a call where a man has collapsed in his care home, and CPR is already in progress. The staff are efficient and urgent – someone runs for a defibrillator, while two others continue CPR. I check back later: the patient died, but I hope his family can take solace in knowing that the people looking after him did their best for him.A man in his 70s is taken ill while at the home of his girlfriend. She tells me that they only recently got together and are preparing to set up home. After a while, I realise he’s had a stroke. We run through the stroke diagnostic test – face, arms, speech, time – and I hear her voice crack as she realises what’s happened. She knows this will be life-changing for both of them. As the crew arrive, I wish her well, and hang up to dry my eyes. I’m consistently amazed by the people I work with. Call-taking is an entry level job, so most of my co-workers are in their early 20s. Many of them want to train to be paramedics. Some have suffered post-traumatic stress disorder from handling calls, not to mention the exhaustion of shift work and the stress of being complained at on a daily basis. Incoming: an accident on a treacherous stretch of fast A-road. In grim weather, a car has rolled multiple times, and one patient is trapped. A helicopter is sent in addition to two ambulances. The caller is a passing driver and he’s terrific, managing a chaotic scene with multiple casualties. He keeps his cool throughout, giving me observations on all the patients, helping me pin down the exact location, and comforting and calming the people involved.

The report found that children in public-sector young offender institutions (YOIs) were only receiving 15 hours of education a week on average, compared with an expected level of 30 hours.The facilities allow for any boy or girl aged 12 to 17 who is remanded or sentenced into youth detention accommodation to be placed into secure schools.The justice minister Edward Argar said: “Secure schools are critical to our vision for youth custody – placing education, healthcare and purposeful activity at the heart of rehabilitation.“I have been impressed by Oasis’s dedication to improving the lives of young people and its track record across education, health and youth work. We will now work closely with them on detailed proposals to ensure high standards from day one.”Three-quarters of Oasis’s academies operate in the UK’s most deprived areas and most were rated by Ofsted as failing at the time they were taken over.The £5m investment will include refurbishment of classrooms and residential areas.The site of the new secure school, Medway, has been dogged by allegations of mistreatment of the young inmates by staff for years.It was previously operated by the private company G4S, which was stripped of its contract after a  exposé revealed a history of abuse allegations at the centre near Rochester, Kent. It also revealed that a letter sent by two whistleblowers 12 years earlier to the Youth Justice Board, G4S, the Social Services Inspectorate and a Home Office minister had been ignored."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d99f3ac2ad8582496868956552bd5467fb8116f3/0_243_4804_2882/master/4804.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=01949aa5d0a5c0fea96c908c235b200e","title":"tour de france 2019 stage by stage guide","story":"This year’s race begins in Brussels before quickly heading to the mountains and building towards an Alpine climaxThe Tour starts with a loop southwards through Flanders into Wallonia and back, with two cobbled climbs celebrated as part of the Ronde van Vlaanderen, the Muur van Geraardsbergen and the Bosberg, and one stretch of pavé near Charleroi. These all come too early to have any serious impact so the peloton will be jostling for a bunch sprint as they tackle a finale that includes the towns of Waterloo – a gift for the headline writers – and Woluwe-Saint-Pierre, childhood home of Eddy Merckx. Sprint favourites will include Caleb Ewan and André Greipel.Underlining Eddy Merckx’s special status he has two stages coming through his manor in two days, so there is a second flying visit to Woluwe-Saint-Pierre during a team time trial entirely within Brussels and its suburbs. All the favourites will want to lay down a marker if history is anything to go by, the smart money will be on Adam Yates’s Mitchelton-Scott, winners (as Orica-Greenedge) in 2013 on current form Jumbo-Visma have been strong all year. The big pressure will be on Geraint Thomas’s Ineos, who never landed a Tour team time trial during their years as Team Sky.A second long day in a row, but this one will end in a bunch sprint unless it rains and there is some action over the final climb, 15km from the finish. It’s a typical first-week stage, largely main roads and the scenario should be classic: early break, late catch, scary sprint. There aren’t that many opportunities for the flat-road sprinters in this Tour, so again it will be Caleb Ewan, and André Greipel in the mix, although the hill close to the finish will favour all-rounders such as Elia Viviani.Best described as Vosges-lite, skirting three sides of the massif with two second and two third category climbs to shake up the pack. There is a good chance that an early escape will stay away today as keeping a team chasing will be hard in the tough finale – two climbs in the final 35km – while behind the move the peloton will be whittled down to 30 or 40. A good day for a strong breakaway rider such as Thomas De Gendt or Matej Mohoric, one where the favourites will want to avoid losing time or expending too much energy, with day six in mind.The longest stage of the Tour follows one of the toughest, but will give the flat-road sprinters another chance. It’s a hilly start, but a very flat run over the final 80km, plus there is a good chance that one of the favourites will have taken yellow the previous day which will lend some structure to the race. The pressure will be felt the most by the older sprinters, led by André Greipel, who moved to the small French team Arkéa-Samsic over the winter but hasn’t produced much, and Cofidis’s Nacer Bouhanni, who has never shone in the Tour.Nowhere near as hard as La Planche des Belles Filles, but still one that will set alarm bells ringing. A string of small, technical climbs initially through the Beaujolais vineyards and later through the Monts du Lyonnais. This will be tricky to control, and the run-in to the final climb is technical. Again, a stage where the Tour could be lost and a definite chance for an escape to stay away with the win going to a punchy rider such as Tony Gallopin, unless one of the outsiders for the overall win decides to stir up some trouble.A Bastille Day stage ending with a 30km loop through Romain Bardet country: no pressure for France’s favourite then. There’s a tough, steep first category climb early on, where the day’s break should form, but even with a third category ascent during that final circuit around Brioude you should expect a bunch sprint, albeit probably for a group that’s been reduced over the final climb and the windy roads around it. Perfect for a sprinter who can climb, such as the 2017 points winner Michael Matthews or Peter Sagan the former world champion hasn’t had a memorable year but this looks made for him.Long and hot, a scenic beginning before a 30km descent off the Cantal plateau for the 10th day of racing in a row, with the first rest day 24 hours later than usual. The script of early breakaway, late catch, scary sprint should be followed, but most of the riders will be just making sure they drink enough. All eyes will be on whichever sprinter has hit form early on, as Marcel Kittel did in 2017 and Mark Cavendish did the year before. The hilly route of this year’s first half of the Tour favours a lighter rider such as Elia Viviani who has a point to prove after a disappointing Giro.An amuse-bouche before the serious general classification racing begins, this is a short and probably rapid sprint stage across the south of France with only an early third-category climb to trouble the sprinters. There will be a break, but there are only two more sprint stages after this, so the fastmen will want their teams to control the race. Mark Cavendish won here in 2008, but 11 years on his form this season has been dubious, so perhaps one of the new generation such as Sam Bennett or Pascal Ackermann?A relatively gentle introduction to the Pyrenees: two first category climbs with long run-in to the opener, the Col de Peyresourde. There is 130km for the break to build a lead so expect someone from the early move to win the overall contenders may well end up watching each other for signs of weakness over the Peyresourde and Hourquette d’Ancizan while saving strength for the coming days. Not the toughest mountain climbing, so the stage winner could be a breakaway specialist who isn’t one of the very best climbers, someone such as Alessandro De Marchi or Britain’s Steve Cummings if he is selected.At least one or two of the favourites who are weaker time triallists should be effectively put out of the reckoning.Short and very sharp, with the Col du Soulor halfway through to sort the wheat from the chaff, and the finish atop one of the longest and hardest climbs in the Pyrenees. The Tourmalet is not l’Alpe d’Huez, however, being wider, straighter and more reasonably graded. There will be time gaps, but perhaps not as cataclysmic as might be seen at a steeper finish. A favourite should win this, and it suits a climber who can use race skills to win rather than simply burning off the opposition - someone with the profile of Adam Yates, Thibaut Pinot or Geraint Thomas.A second summit finish in a row, and a different proposition with two first category mountain passes beforehand, both short and brutally steep, as is the ascent to the chequered flag. A pure climber’s stage, a target for a rider who is going for the mountains jersey, with lots of points available on the three first cat climbs in quick succession: Julian Alaphilippe springs to mind. There should be a straightforward selection among the yellow jersey contenders who should be down to a handful by now. It’s the kind of stage that screams Egan Bernal or Nairo Quintana.It’s six days since the last sprint stage and much will depend on how the heavier brethren have survived the Pyrenees, which sprinters are still there and which of their lead-out men. Following the rest day, a second day’s respite for the overall contenders, as long as the weather plays ball and there is no wind or rain. This stage is out and home rather than the usual place to place so the changes of direction could make for an gruesome day if there is a strong northerly, as we saw in this area in 2016. In such conditions one favourite thrives: Geraint Thomas.A horrible stage for anyone who is merely trying to survive to Paris, as it’s going to be long, hot, largely uphill, and probably with cross-winds in the opening kilometres where the break will form. This is the last stage where a breakaway specialist who isn’t a pure climber can win usually about half the teams still need a stage win by this point so the first hour could be very hectic. The finish could go to a rider from the break or a sprinter who can climb such Peter Sagan.Northwards through the Alps for six hours over three of the Tour’s greatest climbs, the Cols de Vars, Izoard and Galibier, all over 2,000m high, with the Galibier topping out on a moonscape at 2,675m. The descent to Valloire is short and initially technical, so there is little hope of regaining much time lost on the climb. The race for the overall will be down to three or four at most by now, and for a stage winner you are looking at a climber who can descend. Uphill for the first (gulp) 89km, this stage is about one climb, the Col de l’Iséran, the “roof of the Tour” at 2,770m above sea level. It’s rarely used in the race, and still less frequently at the key point in a stage. It will make be hard for a break to stay away, but teams will fire any domestiques with any strength left up the road to support their leaders later – Movistar particularly like this tactic – and the finish will be about who of a very select group has anything left on the short climb to Tignes. Egan Bernal might be the best candidate depending on Ineos’s tactics.The demands of television are making it harder and harder for “away fans” to watch the final stage of the Tour in Paris and then get home on the same day. Time was, the Tour finished about 5pm, but this year the race will break ground by closing at 9.30pm, with the start at roughly the time most Parisians are contemplating their dinner. “Demi-nocturne” racing like this is dependent on dry weather: any rain could make the laps of the Champs a dangerous washout. As for a winner, it will be a sprinter, and it’s time a Frenchman won here again."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/22ccd3852e00d908fb1b41a065df3311c5ba6856/0_0_4853_2912/master/4853.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9da27f349ab43b1a4bdf6ad6beed5a51","title":"county cricket yorkshire v surrey somerset v hampshire and more live","story":"Before we get into the thick of this week’s action, this look back on last week around the counties from Gary Naylor is worth a read …How nice it is to be writing that as I think the last two or three times I’ve been with you on the blog it’s been a story of will it, won’t it rain. Yesterday seemed to largely be a batting day around the country, with the odd exception. A host of high scores, centuries for players young and old and some interesting games developing – none more so than here on the East Coast at North Marine Road, where Surrey are 48-0 replying to Yorkshire’s 327, which included opener Will Fraine’s 106, a maiden first-class century. Yorkshire may have a decent score on the board, one they would have probably taken before play yesterday on a pitch which is usually fruity. But they let the champions off the hook. They were 187-1 after all. Instead Jordan Clark, he of last season’s remarkable Roses hat-trick fame, charged in and claimed 5-77, continuing a love affair of playing against Yorkshire, no matter whether is wearing the colours of Lancashire or Surrey. Seam did the trick for title-chasing Essex against hapless Notts (213 all out at Trent Bridge), with Messrs Porter, Beard and Siddle all taking three wickets apiece. Sir Alastair fell for two in reply to an old mate, Stuart Broad, but Essex still replied with 72-1. How frustrated must Joe Denly feel? Kent are 338-2 at home to Warwickshire and he only gets 22 when in need of big runs to press his Ashes case. Instead, Zak Crawley made 77, opening partner Sean Dickson 146 not out and Daniel Bell-Drummond 68 unbeaten. Warwickshire’s attack is threadbare to be fair to them. Ravaged by injuries, they are playing three seamers who didn’t start the season with the Bears in on loan duo Toby Lester and Ben Mike and James Wainman, released by Yorkshire over the winter.James Hildreth’s 105 underpinned Somerset’s 408 all out against Hampshire (15-1 in reply) at Taunton. I see Dom Bess is playing there. That is a fascinating situation. Somerset refused Yorkshire permission to extend his loan as they wanted him for their clash with Essex at Chelmsford last week and then didn’t pick him. I do wonder whether he will be at Taunton come 1 April next year, despite having another year left on his contract there. My guess would be no. Into Division Two, and Billy Godleman scored another century for Derbyshire – 372-4 against Middlesex. What a season he’s having.Marnus Labuschagne the same for Glamorgan, who are in a commanding position at 354-6 at home to Worcestershire. The Aussie is also having an excellent summer, his first in county cricket. I was amazed to see play halted for bad light early on at Sedbergh School yesterday, but they still got the full day in, with Lancashire closing on a competitive 275-5 against Durham – a host of solid contributions highlighted by fifties for middle-order pair Dane Villas and Rob Jones. Keaton Jennings made 11 against his former county before being bowled by Chris Rushworth. Sussex, for whom Ollie Robinson took six-for – including his 200th first-class wicket, are under pressure against Northants at Hove as their mixed season hit another speed bump, with the visitors making 273. Sussex then slipped to 7-2 before close, losing loan signing Varun Chopra for five."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d5c06d25b9dc253e1b3a00ede16ec785b35cc3e/1226_756_3086_1852/master/3086.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f4f46b8049de39c6dc271bb0aa2fbee6","title":"jack thorne and john tiffany interview end of history","story":"After a string of hits, the writer and director are collaborating again but The End of History, a drama based on Thorne’s parents, is filling him with anxietyWhen Jack Thorne’s wife read the first draft she told him: don’t do this. Sounds harsh, but it wasn’t so much a literary judgment as a private one. The End of History, his bruising family drama, is “the most personal thing I’ve ever written”, Thorne admits.No wonder he looks tense during the rehearsal lunch break. He and his frequent collaborator, the director John Tiffany, sit in school-style plastic chairs, and Thorne – too tall for usual purposes – is awkwardly folded up, feet on the seat, in an orthopaedic nightmare. By contrast, Tiffany brings the jolly – tucking into lunch, lobbing in jokes. The air between them is all warmth and care.Thorne speaks like someone who fears he’ll never work again. You should check out your CV, I joke – it’s really impressive. It gleams with hits in TV (Skins, The Virtues), theatre (Let the Right One In) and the Potterverse (Harry Potter and the Cursed Child). But he always frets that he’s starting from scratch, while feeling the reproachful burden of past success.We plunge into The End of History. A grand title wrongfoots you into an acutely intimate play. It was, Thorne discloses, originally called The Healthy and the Strong (a quote from the text), but “it didn’t feel like it quite fitted”. A title needs to “zoom out”, Tiffany explains. “I always see things in terms of those series of photos that start off at a cellular level and zoom out to the Milky Way.” Francis Fukuyama, the political theorist who coined the title phrase in 1989, has since edged back from the idea that, with the cold war over, western liberalism had triumphed and ideological struggles were done with. The play begins in 1997, “the moment before populism completely took over … when people believed in things as opposed to what would get them votes,” as Tiffany describes it.The play centres on a left-leaning family. Lesley Sharp and David Morrissey play Sal and David, who after a lifetime devoted to equality and principled dissent imagine that their own ideological battles are over, that their work is done – at least when it comes to passing those values on to their kids. But three compulsive acts, set at 10-year intervals, ask what happens to conviction, how belief shapes a family.For a guarded man, Thorne can tread boldly. “Sal and David are pretty tight versions of Maggie and Mike, my mum and dad,” he declares. Tiffany gasps: “I wondered if you were going to say that so explicitly!” Although awesome role models, Sal and David seem daunting parents. They radiate commitment, with great gusts of passion, humour and no-filter opinion. “My mum and dad really are those people – they are amazing and brilliant. They are tricky parents. I want to shake them sometimes. But I love them very much, and this is a love note.”Thorne, who grew up in Bristol, began work on this play almost immediately after becoming a father. He ruefully quotes a line about suspecting that “you’re shitter than your parents at being a parent”. Can he ever transmit as clean a set of values as they did? “I am a lot more compromised as a person than either of them. I’ve made a lot of decisions about my work and life that aren’t as pure.”The play begins in 1997, Thorne’s own coming of age: “My first vote was for Tony Blair.” As New Labour’s shiny liberal democracy has receded into history, Thorne says: “I look at my peers and don’t see the same need and passion to set the world right, being prepared to stand in the cold to protest, to do the hard miles that I see still in my parents’ generation.”Do the play’s dogged conversations over burnt cheese on toast reflect life with the Thornes? “Yes, though my mum was a better cook,” Thorne says, “and she talked about anal sex slightly less.” He knows his parents will not pretend to like the play – they never do. “You haven’t written it for them to like, though, have you?” Tiffany reminds him. “My little sister went they’ll be cool with it, they’ll like it.” He describes his sister – a former political adviser who is retraining as a maths teacher – as “the true child of my parents, so her reading was very important. She is pure of heart, my sister.”Even the Thornes feel the strain of these trying political times. “For the first time we haven’t discussed how we all voted in the European elections. I think we’re all exhausted by it.” Despite a final act set in 2017, “the B-word is mentioned only once. Brexit is a symptom of a country that’s got itself into a malaise and this play is about that malaise.”Thorne and Tiffany first met more than 20 years ago, and have since collaborated on wizards and vampires – but Thorne submitted this script to the Royal Court rather than direct to Tiffany. “I don’t want to put our friendship under that test. I wouldn’t have been able to cope with the rejection.” If he couldn’t work on it, Tiffany interrupts, there would be pragmatic reasons. “I know,” Thorne answers, nine times in rapid succession. “But this one’s very personal to me – so the fact that it’s being directed by him is really important to me.”Tiffany’s productions (Black Watch, The Glass Menagerie) are notably dynamic, and here, too, he drafted in Steven Hoggett, his long-term movement collaborator. “All the frou-frou – we always call it frou-frou – goes into the decade jumps. There isn’t one moment where all the characters sit round the table – the second it’s about to happen, someone moves.”Their last Royal Court collaboration was Hope – but wasn’t there some little project after that? Oh yes, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, still storming London and Broadway. Thorne’s rollicking text, astonishingly for a play script, teleported to the top of the bestseller charts. So, did the show change their lives? Tiffany considers. “It marked the climax of something we’d been working towards as a group of people for 20-odd years,” he says. “The amount of people that see it is gorgeous, and of course it gives a bit of freedom, financially. And creatively, just because it worked.”In retrospect, that success seems inevitable – but Tiffany recalls widespread public doubts that it could satisfy fervid fan expectation. “I never allowed us to think about it.” That, Thorne explains, is the director’s characteristic response. “I would have let it overwhelm me. But we were all on the John train and the John train was just going.” Is the John train always positive? “Always,” Thorne says several times. He laughs, then asks: “When have I ever been the positive force in our relationship? You’re the warrior and I’m the worrier.”Meanwhile, back to this play, and its two most crucial audience members. “I’m very nervous about what my parents will think,” Thorne says. “They haven’t read it, but they know it’s about them – they’re coming with all their mates. I feel their impending arrival now.” I dread to think what this will do to him. “I’m literally not in the country! So that’s good.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9826fe13a8b8d0b310ace54cff3f53bb8284e03/0_439_6588_3953/master/6588.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0fe07f65482e456ff2189c088c4ba1e3","title":"loco2 rail booking website split one way journeys into smaller legs reduce fares","story":"Pricehack works by splitting journeys into smaller legs and working out the cheapest price for each leg.

It currently applies to one-way routes only, including first class fares, but it will launch on return journeys over the summer. A £1.50 fee is charged on journeys that cost less than £100 and £6 on journeys over £100. The website covers continental Europe, too, but split-ticketing does not apply to those journeys.Rail travel expert Mark Smith, who runs The Man in Seat 61 website, says “Pricehack has several advantages over other systems, including allowing split-ticketing on advance journeys, and it can ensure one seat reservation across multiple split tickets.”Loco2 was created in 2012 by a sister and brother hoping to encourage more people to choose rail travel over flying. The company was acquired by French rail network SNCF in 2017."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/94df921cfef22c8907d8a13404f04876ada0c2ac/197_410_5071_3043/master/5071.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dfd58a6f8e21b8546b0ca1719c4b78ed","title":"star gazing astonomy elqui valley atacama desert chile solar eclipse","story":"The wine region in the Atacama desert is fast becoming the world’s leading astronomy and astro-tourism destination – and its pure skies are perfect for viewing Tuesday’s total solar eclipseThe Atacama desert may be the driest non-polar place on Earth but on its southern fringe is a stretch of vineyard-lined hills – the Elqui valley. This streak of green in arid northern Chile wiggles inland from the Pacific near the nation’s second-oldest city, La Serena. Historically the domain of agriculturists, it’s now increasingly visited by people with a different profession: astronomy.The International Dark-Sky Association declared Elqui valley the world’s first International Dark Sky Sanctuary in 2015 due to the unrivalled purity of its skies. On 2 July 2019, the same cloudless sky that makes Elqui ideal for stargazing will be all but guaranteed when the moon blocks out the sun to create a total solar eclipse.To tour the Elqui valley ahead of its moment in a dark spotlight I travelled from the Chilean capital Santiago to La Serena (it’s possible to take a train or drive). In La Serena, the city’s pastel-coloured centre hints of earlier, colonial times, when this was one of the most important ports on South America’s Pacific coast.Of course this area’s history predates the arrival of Spaniards in the 1540s. On the way out of town, my guide, Cristóbal Vergara of Turismo Tembeta, pointed to the ruins of a small Inca citadel sitting atop a peanut-coloured hill.Just after the town of El Molle, we passed the teal blue Puclaro reservoir, an artificial lake created in 2000 by damming the Elqui river. Soon after we spotted a series of alien-looking objects on the hilltops of the pre-Andes range. These shiny metallic orbs – observatories for visiting scientists – glistened like 21st-century remakes of that earlier Inca relic.We saw the Gemini South and Cerro Tololo Inter-American observatories, both operated in partnership with American organisations. Cristóbal pointed to another, the Large Synoptic Survey telescope, and told me the future of astronomy is on the horizon: “It’s like we’re moving from the bronze age into the iron age.” This wide-field survey reflecting telescope has an 8.40-metre primary mirror (the world’s largest digital camera) and will photograph all the available area of sky every few nights when it opens in 2022.The Elqui valley opens up near its largest city, Vicuña, where we stopped for lunch at Delicias del Sol Villaseca. This restaurant, run by an association of 25 local women, specialises in cooking in what are described as solar ovens (glass-topped boxes with reflecting flaps). I ordered the house speciality: stewed goat, slow-cooked under the morning sun.Over beers on the shady terrace, Cristóbal told me how this valley became famous for the valour of its soldiers during the War of the Pacific in the late 19th century, in which Chile gained much of the Atacama desert (and its vast mineral wealth) from Peru and Bolivia. These men had one big advantage over their compatriots: an endless supply of the locally brewed grape brandy, pisco. Cristóbal suggested we head deeper into the valley to taste test the drink that fuelled these legendary soldiers.We saw sun-bleached hills and a startlingly green valley floor lined with the vineyards of Chile’s top pisco distillers as we moved inland towards the town of Pisco Elqui. Just off its main plaza is Destilería Pisco Mistral, which takes its name from the valley’s most famous resident, Gabriela Mistral, who was raised in the nearby village of Montegrande and in 1945 was the first Latin American author to receive a Nobel Prize in Literature.Pisco is most often used to make the frothy national cocktail, pisco sour, a mix of lime juice, sugar, egg white and ice. I had my first sour of the day in the distillery’s succulent-filled gardens and downed my second nearby at Elqui Domos, a glamping retreat whose geodesic domes (from £75) have retractable roofs for stargazing.After a long night in search of globular clusters and planetary nebulae – both with a guide at the onsite observatory and on my own from the comfort of my desert dome – I met up with Cristóbal the next morning to continue our journey. The valley forks near Pisco Elqui and we had two options: continue straight toward the high-Andean community of Alcohuaz or turn east toward for the new-age draw of Cochiguaz.Cristóbal said the latter was a place associated with cults and UFO sightings. I opted for Alcohuaz, though it seems both places share an affinity for mysticism – there were dusty gem shops, meditation centres and self-proclaimed healers hawking dubious bee-venom therapies. But the star attraction at the end of the Elqui valley has to be the avant-garde wine project Viñedos de Alcohuaz.Wine-maker Marcelo Retamal’s experimental vineyard, which opened to tourists this year, plants rare-in-Chile varietals, such as garnacha and petite sirah, at 1,650 to 2,200 metres above sea level, making these some of the highest-grown grapes in the world. The initial pressing of the fruit is done by the ancient grape-treading technique, before the wine is aged in oval casks, mostly for high-end blends.The soil in Alcohuaz is riddled with so much quartz that it shimmers by day and shines under the moonlight. Project manager Juan Luis Huerta, a former pisco producer, told me the quartz has mystical powers.“Do you believe in the energy of the Earth?” he asked, leading me to a large circular symbol made of quartz in the middle of the vines. He found it here before planting began in 2005, and said strange things happen in its presence. His phone loses signal, his skin tingles, the closest vines don’t change colour in autumn …It was yet another reminder that there’s something incomprehensible about this otherworldly valley.We capped off our trip back in Vicuña with a drive up the barren valley to the tourist-friendly Observatorio del Pangue, whose telescope with 25 inches of aperture is the best a layman can lay their eyes on. The observatory (tours from £30) is in a Martian-like landscape at an altitude of 1,500 metres. Up here, halfway to the heavens, the stars feel incredibly close.Two hours went by as we twisted the massive instrument across the sky in search of foreign objects, including the red-glowing Betelgeuse star and wispy Tarantula Nebula. Each pinhole view was more kaleidoscopic than the previous one.Maybe it’s the unfathomable mysteries of Elqui’s night sky that make energy vortexes and UFOs seem more fact than fiction here. Perhaps it’s the blinding sunshine and ample libations that cause people to dream big and fight hard. There’s certainly a tangible connection between earth and sky, which is why an event such as this week’s eclipse has the Elqui valley pulsating.Observatorio MamallucaThe most popular tourist-oriented observatory in the valley with bilingual tours where you can view the stars through a 12-inch telescope.• Tours from £8, mamallucavicuna.clAlfa AldeaTucked into the vineyards on the edge of Vicuña, astronomers lead small-group stargazing tours using scientific-grade telescopes at this open-air amphitheatre.

She missed her mother’s smoky jollof rice.Adebajo lived in San Francisco, where dozens of stylish fast-casual restaurants churn out every kind of rice bowl and ethnically inspired sandwich you can imagine but there’s not a single jollof joint to speak of. So Adebajo had little choice but to follow in the footsteps of so many homesick expats before her: She opened a restaurant of her own.Well, not right away, of course. When Adebajo first launched Eko Kitchen last summer, she still worked full-time as a financial analyst and spent her weekends hustling orders of suya chicken and fried plantains to customers via Postmates and Uber Eats. Before long, she was hosting pop-ups at a restaurant space in San Francisco’s SoMa neighborhood, a few blocks away from Twitter’s headquarters and city hall. And two months ago, when she was presented with the opportunity to take over the space on a permanent basis – splitting the lease with a Mexican restaurant that serves lunch there on weekdays – Adebajo quit her day job and went all in.Starting in May, Eko Kitchen became San Francisco’s first Nigerian restaurant. There isn’t any place quite like it in the city. It’s the kind of stylish spot where, on a recent Sunday afternoon, Afrobeats played infectiously over the speakers a couple of twentysomethings flirted over a pot of jollof rice and a family with two young children dressed in their Sunday finest, made short work of an order of puff-puffs, or fried dough dusted in cinnamon-sugar.In some ways, Adebajo picked the perfect time to open the city’s first Nigerian restaurant. West African cuisine has probably never had more mainstream visibility in America than it does at this very moment. Millions of viewers have watched Eric Adjepong, a Ghanian-American chef, cook Ghanian plantain-and-cassava fufu and other West African dishes during the most recent season of Top Chef. Meanwhile, Kwame Onwuachi, another former Top Chef contestant who is of part-Nigerian descent, recently won a James Beard Award as the country’s Rising Star Chef of the Year. The menu at Kith and Kin, Onwuachi’s Afro-Caribbean restaurant in Washington DC, includes riffs on classic Nigerian dishes like egusi stew, suya, and jollof rice.But Korsha Wilson, a New York City-based food writer who has covered the foods of the African diaspora for national publications such as Food \u0026amp Wine, cautions against framing a culture’s traditional cuisine as the latest hot food trend. In that sense, it’s besides the point – if not downright unhelpful – to assert, in the parlance of glossy food magazines, that West African cuisine is “having a moment”.That’s not to discount the trickle-down effect that the success of high-profile chefs such as Adjepong and Onwuachi might have on smaller businesses like Eko Kitchen – the extent to which someone might see egusi stew on television or read a list of ten essential Nigerian recipes in the New York Times and then decide to seek it out at a local restaurant.It’s also not to dismiss the very real challenges that newly opened West African restaurants such as Eko Kitchen face – especially, Adebajo says, in a city like San Francisco that, quite frankly, “is just not as culturally erse as you would think it is”.That’s reflected in the fact that when she first moved to the city in 2016, as a 20-year-old graduate student, she could only find a single store, in the Fillmore district, that sold black hair products. And it’s reflected, of course, in the city’s dearth of West African and Afro-Caribbean restaurants. Little Baobab, which specializes in Senegalese peanut stew, is San Francisco’s only other West African dining establishment. In May, Isla Vida, one of the city’s only Afro-Caribbean restaurants, had to launch a crowdfunding campaign in a last-ditch effort to stay in business.When Adebajo first announced her plans for Eko Kitchen on Twitter, the broader Nigerian and Nigerian American community were so excited about the news, the tweet quickly accumulated upwards of 55,000 likes. But social media virality doesn’t necessarily translate into a steady customer base, Adebajo says. For now, she says the restaurant is busy enough that it’s difficult for customers to just drop in for dinner on a Friday or Saturday night without a reservation—though not quite so busy that she’s ready to open on weeknights, too. (Right now, she spends weekdays doing corporate catering gigs.)The reasons Adebajo has to try to overcome these obstacles are deeply personal. “I think we romanticize the places that we grow up in,” she says. A Bronx native, she moved back to Lagos with her Nigerian-born parents when she was 7. The fiery, intricately spiced local cuisine was at first too hot for her American palate to handle, but she grew to love it. And when she returned to the US to attend grad school in San Francisco, the food was what she missed the most about Nigeria: the weekend jaunts she and her father would make to Ghana High, a boka, or quick-service restaurant, that was legendary for its jollof rice, and her family’s occasional trips to nearby Ikenne Remo to eat a local specialty called ayamase – a green-pepper stew they all loved so much they’d buy 30 orders of it at a time.Eko Kitchen prominently features versions of both dishes. Each night, the restaurant has a different theme, with its own distinct menu. On Fridays, Adebajo wanted to recreate the feeling of going out on the town in Lagos on a Friday night, so she cranks up Burna Boy on the speakers and serves bowls of fiery goat meat pepper soup and big platters of grilled meats rubbed with a suya spice mix. Saturdays are reserved for foods your mom might cook for you on a lazy weekend afternoon, with homey dishes like her mother’s recipe for fish stew. And on Sundays, the main attraction is what Adebajo calls her “rice spectacular”: three different rice dishes on a combo plate, highlighted by a version of Nigerian native rice that’s infused with a deep umami kick reminiscent of a dried-porcini risotto – a flavor the chef attributes to the use of fermented locust beans and unrefined palm oil.These are staple ingredients in any Nigerian kitchen, and they’re part of what makes it difficult to describe the cuisine, with its bold seasoning and distinctive textures, to someone who doesn’t have the reference points. Sure, you can liken the custardy, leaf-wrapped blackeyed-pea cake known as moin moin to a tamale, or you can say that the pounded yams, made with extra-starchy Nigerian tubers, are like sticky mashed potatoes you pick up with your hands. But ultimately, these kinds of comparisons don’t do justice to the cuisine. Moin moin is moin moin. Pounded yam is pounded yam.Whatever else you might want to say about Eko Kitchen, the food is wildly delicious. There’s the intense spicy-savory quality of the efo riro, a thick spinach stew that you scoop up with hunks of pounded yam. There’s the smoky, tomatoey tinge of the jollof rice the in-your-face heat blast of the pepper soup. There’s the ayamase, in which beef skin and tripe are slow-cooked to obscene tenderness in a rich, creamy, palm-oil-based sauce.Foluso Alofe, a civil engineer by trade who makes the trek out from Union City on the weekends to moonlight as Eko Kitchen’s sous chef, says the ayamase is his favorite item on the menu – a dish he associates with parties back in Nigeria: “Every time I taste it, it’s new to me as well.”In the end, Eko Kitchen’s launch, and its bid to achieve long-term success in San Francisco, is part of a larger conversation about which cuisines get a seat at the table when it comes to mainstream recognition and critical acclaim.But there is a sense that perhaps now, finally, the American dining public is ready to pay proper respect to jollof rice and goat-meat pepper soup. And why shouldn’t it be? Adebajo argues that Ghana High, her old favorite back in Lagos, is a restaurant that ought to have Michelin stars because of the way it has perfected the two dishes that it serves: “So why is Africa left out of that conversation?”Adebajo says she doesn’t have any desire to chase after Michelin stars herself. Instead, she says, “My ultimate aspiration is that I want to take Nigerian food everywhere in the world.” Someday she’d like to host a Nigerian-centric food travel show. In each episode, she would visit a different country and cook a Nigerian meal using the local produce. “What I want to help people to understand, Anthony Bourdain style, is that we’re all the same.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/561365d4780eb3bff13607687ffee798a7acff33/0_43_4033_2420/master/4033.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c919c81ce4970976d9f11cd10a32e2a4","title":"freak summer hailstorm buries cars in mexicos guadalajara","story":"At least six neighbourhoods woke to find their streets covered in ice pellets up to two metres deepA freak hail storm has struck Guadalajara, one of Mexico’s most populous cities, burying vehicles in a deluge of ice pellets up to two metres deep.“I’ve never seen such scenes in Guadalajara,” said the state governor, Enrique Alfaro.“Then we ask ourselves if climate change is real. These are never-before-seen natural phenomenons,” he said. “It’s incredible.”Guadalajara, located north of Mexico City and with a population of around five million, has been experiencing summer temperature of around 31C (88F) in recent days.While seasonal hail storms do occur, there is no record of anything so heavy.At least six neighbourhoods in the city outskirts woke up to ice pellets up to two metres deep.While children scampered around and hurled iceballs at each other, civil protection personnel and soldiers brought out heavy machinery to clear the roads.Nearly 200 homes and businesses reported hail damage, and at least 50 vehicles were swept away by the deluge of ice in hilly areas, some buried under piles of pellets.While no casualties were reported, two people showed “early signs of hypothermia,” the state civil protection office said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d21e0c44629d7305070b0969e9aa69936e994bbc/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=90b05bacebfdb3221b47b340e20992dd","title":"japan resumes commercial whaling for first time in 30 years","story":"Fishermen set sail to hunt whales on Monday after country’s withdrawal from International Whaling CommissionJapanese fishermen have set sail to hunt whales commercially for the first time in more than three decades, following Tokyo’s controversial decision to withdraw from the International Whaling Commission.Five vessels, their harpoons concealed beneath tarpaulin, left Kushiro in northern Japan on Monday morning. At around the same time, three whaling boats left Shimonoseki in southwestern Japan.Together they will kill 227 whales through to late December, according to the fisheries agency, which had delayed announcing the quota until the conclusion of the G20 summit in Osaka on Saturday. The quota includes 52 minke, 150 Bryde’s and 25 sei whales, the agency said.The hunts are likely to spark criticism from environmentalists and anti-whaling countries, but whaling officials were in celebratory mood.“My heart is overflowing with happiness, and I’m deeply moved,” Yoshifumi Kai, head of the Japan Small-Type Whaling Association, said at a ceremony attended by politicians, local officials and whalers.Kai, a senior fisheries official in Taiji – whose annual dolphin hunts have caused an international outcry – added: “This is a small industry, but I am proud of hunting whales. People have hunted whales for more than 400 years in my home town.”Japan was the target of international criticism for using a clause in the IWC’s 1986 moratorium on commercial whaling to conduct “research” whale hunts in the Antarctic.Meat from the hunts was sold on the open market, prompting claims that they were a cover for commercial whaling.Late last year Japan announced it would leave the IWC, frustrated by its failure to convince other members to support a return to “sustainable” commercial whaling.Japan’s whalers killed 333 minke whales during their final “research” expedition to the Antarctic, which ended in March. In previous years, however, it slaughtered almost 1,000 whales a year, amid confrontations on the high seas with the marine conservation group Sea Shepherd.Fishermen from Abashiri, Taiji , Ishinomaki and Minamiboso – all towns with a whaling tradition – will take part in the commercial hunt in Japan’s exclusive economic zone. Japan will no longer send fleets to the Antarctic every winter following its official withdrawal from the IWC on Sunday.“I’m a bit nervous but happy that we can start whaling,” Hideki Abe, a 23-year-old whaler from Ishinomaki, told Agence France-Presse just before the fleet departed.“I don’t think young people know how to cook and eat whale meat any more. I want more people try to taste it at least once.”Fisheries officials are hoping that the resumption of commercial whaling will spark renewed interest in whale meat among Japanese consumers.“From today, I’d like the whalers to catch whales by observing the quota and aim for revival of the whaling industry,” the fisheries minister, Takamori Yoshikawa, said at a ceremony in Shimonoseki, according to the Kyodo news agency.While a return to whaling for profit has long been a cause celebre for conservative politicians, Japanese consumers have lost their appetite for whale meat, which can be served deep-friend or raw as sashimi.Domestic consumption of whale meat was around 200,000 tons a year in the 1960s, when it was an important source of protein in he postwar years, but has slumped to less than 5,000 tons annually in recent years, according to government data.Tokyo’s withdrawal from IWC ended its most provocative expeditions, in protected Antarctic waters, and while it sparked a firestorm of criticism, some campaigners say it is the first step towards the end of Japanese whaling.Patrick Ramage, director of marine conservation at the International Fund for Animal Welfare, said the resumption of commercial whaling “will not magically increase market demand”.“The palates of the Japanese people have moved on,” Ramage told the . “They have lost their yen for whale meat, even as their government has spent billions in taxpayer yen trying to prop up this economic loser. What we are seeing is the beginning of the end of Japanese whaling.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d582b04d2b1d359165c51e48b52ed5e33efbc300/0_159_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=21b5608ac62bd9c150e51a48c785e19c","title":"missile from syria israel clash lands on cyprus","story":"Missile believed to be made in Russia crashes into mountain overnight, setting hills ablazeA missile has landed on the side of a mountain in Cyprus in what officials say could be a spillover of an Israeli strike on Syria and a counter response.The impact occurred at about 1am (10pm GMT) in the area of Taşkent, also known as Vouno, 12 miles (20km) north-east of Nicosia, with the explosion setting hills ablaze and being heard for miles around. There were no casualties.An Israeli airstrike was under way against Syria at the time. Syrian state media said the country’s air defences had fired in response to the attack.Kudret Özersay, the Turkish Cypriot foreign minister, wrote on Facebook: “The first assessment is that a Russian-made missile … which was part of the air defence system that took place last night in the face of an airstrike against Syria, completed its range and fell into our country after it missed.”He said the explosion was thought to have occurred before impact because there were no craters. “The pieces that fell to several different points prove that the missile exploded in the air before it crashed,” he said.Cyprus is west of Syria. Israeli warplanes fired missiles targeting Syrian military positions in Homs – about 193 miles from Nicosia – and the Damascus outskirts overnight in an attack that killed at least four civilians and wounded another 21.The incident would be the first time Cyprus has been caught in the crosshairs of military operations in the Middle East.A Greek Cypriot military analyst, Andreas Pentaras, said the debris suggested it was a Russian-made S-200 missile, which can have a range of up to 250 miles.Jamming technology could have erted the missile, he said. Another analyst said if the missile hypothesis proves to be correct, it could have been faulty.“Right now, we can’t be absolute, but from the pictures and the inscriptions it appears to be an S-200,” said Zenonas Tziarras of the Geopolitical Cyprus thinktank.Those missiles were designed to explode in midair if they do not hit a target, he said.Residents told Cypriot media they saw a light in the sky then heard three loud explosions.Authorities evacuated some homes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6097ccde855f0e6905b530823a81a4175d581976/0_81_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7f5bbb8b410eb51f2731e1732f21caf7","title":"monday briefing hunt ramps up no deal rhetoric","story":"Tory outsider tries to close gap with Boris Johnson … crowds gather for more Hong Kong protests … FA cries foul in spying row with USAGood morning briefers.

Organizers expected 150,000 people to parade and hundreds of thousands more to line the streets to watch.It was not the only show in town. A smaller Queer Liberation March started at 9.30am at the Stonewall, where patrons resisted a police raid in 1969, sparking the modern gay rights movement. They headed to Central Park for a rally.“The annual Pride parade has become a bloated, over-policed circuit party, stuffed with 150 corporate floats,” the Reclaim Pride Coalition said in a statement. “This does not represent the ‘spirit of Stonewall’ in this 50th anniversary year.”The second march was one visible sign of tensions within the LGBTQ community – as, later in the day, was a protest which briefly blocked the route of the parade in San Francisco.Brendan Fay, a civil rights activist who successfully fought a long battle for LGBTQ inclusion in the New York St Patrick’s Day Parade, said he would participate in both events.The founder of the Lavender \u0026amp Green Alliance, which celebrates Irish LGBTQ culture, Fay told the  corporate participation in Pride reflected progress but Reclaim emphasized community elders’ grassroots efforts to effect change.“The legacy of Stonewall is about people,” Fay said, “not about corporate participation.”Charles Kaiser, author of The Gay polis, acting director of the LGBTQ Public Policy Center at Hunter College and a  contributor, also participated in both events. He said they showed that positive change is possible – and that participants must keep working to achieve it.“The most important thing is that the mass of humanity in the streets today proves that it is possible to imagine a different world and create it within your own lifetime,” Kaiser said.“I hope everyone will remember that it’s never been more important to imagine a different world than it is right now and that it is the duty of everyone celebrating today to dedicate themselves to getting rid of the most loathsome president of my lifetime and … put the American government back into the hands of decent, honorable, loving people.”Kaiser said the two New York marches spoke to “tension which has existed in the movement from the very beginning … between a desire to be as fully integrated into the majority of society as possible, and the desire to see the movement as a way to celebrate how different we are.“I think the tension is healthy. I think both things are important.”Jessie Page, an 18-year-old parade participant who identifies as gender queer non-binary, said Pride offered “an open and accepting place where nobody judges you. You get to express yourself freely. Now that it’s 2019 and the world is changing, we get a big celebration to honor us – regardless of the presidency.”“It feels really great to not feel like you have to pretend anymore.”On Saturday, the New York City Pride Run reportedly set a world record with 10,000 finishers in Central Park. On Sunday Flemington, New Jersey mayor Betsy Driver, considered the first openly intersex person voted into public office in the US, was a grand marshal of the main parade.The New York police department, which earlier this month apologized for Stonewall, said that there had not been any “credible threats” against the main march.The marches concluded a month of Stonewall commemorations in New York, coinciding with the city hosting WorldPride, an event that started in Rome in 2000. Elsewhere in the US on Sunday, Lori Lightfoot, the first openly gay mayor of Chicago, was named grand marshal.In San Francisco, Google employees had petitioned Pride directors to revoke their company’s sponsorship over what they called harassment and hate speech on its platforms. Officials declined to act but said critics could protest as part of a “resistance contingent”.When the march began, protesters opposed to corporations at Pride and to police brutality across the US blocked the route for more than half an hour. According to the San Francisco Chronicle, demonstrators who had apparently chained their arms together with “rainbow tubes” sat across a road, chanting “Stonewall was a riot”.“The system of policing upholds white supremacy, heteropatriarchy, gender binaries and capitalist rule,” one protester reportedly said over a megaphone. Two people were arrested, police said. Back in New York, Governor Andrew Cuomo marked the day by outlawing the “gay and trans panic legal defense”.Previously, Cuomo’s office said, those accused of violent crimes against LGBTQ people could seek a less severe sentence or even avoid conviction “by placing the blame on a victim’s sexual orientation or gender identity”.“The gay and trans panic defense is essentially a codification of homophobia and transphobia and it is repugnant to our values of equality and inclusion,” Cuomo said in the statement. “This defense strategy isn’t just offensive – it also sends a dangerous message that violence toward LGBTQ people is somehow OK.“It’s not, and today we’re sending this noxious legal tool to the dustbin of history where it belongs.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebc4c93855dddd434a4eb19b0e206dee9d7c916c/833_756_4920_2952/master/4920.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=612cc87fddf76f589b40a26fb997fe78","title":"shanghai etiquette classes in pictures","story":"Against a soundtrack of classical music, children learn social skills, dining manners and deportment – hence the books on their heads to teach them how to walk gracefully.

Photograph: iStockAs pollution released by vehicles and industry continues to have severe consequences for our health and the environment, sustainable transport has never been more relevant.Yet if judged solely by social media, Ireland’s public transport is terrible: expensive, overcrowded, slow, lacking reach, and outmoded when it comes to wifi.But just how true is this? And are things better in other countries in the EU? For comparison, we chose Germany, the UK, and France – the big three in other words – and Denmark, Finland and Portugal – smaller EU countries of either similar geographic size or with similar-sized populations and economies.Wifi Data on wifi availability or speeds on EU public transport is not available, although it is interesting to note that internet access is only beginning to be phased into some trains in France, Portugal and Germany. The latter is only scheduled to have free wifi on all inter-city trains by 2021, while regional trains are hit and miss.Even in Denmark and Finland, rail wifi availability is mixed, even if, as in Portugal, you’re generally guaranteed connectivity on inter-city trains.Britain is also a mixed bag. Although there is free wifi on some services such as Great Northern, it’s unreliable. More often than not, it’s unavailable. On Virgin services from London to Edinburgh or Manchester, you’re asked to pay €5 per journey.Price Price is the biggest factor for travellers. According to Eurostat, Ireland is the ninth most expensive of the EU 28 member states when it comes to overall transport prices, including private passenger services such as taxis and planes.Placed 115 on the index, we’re considered more expensive than France (105) and Portugal (89.7), but cheaper than Germany (117.5), Finland (119.4), the UK (124.9) and Denmark (128.9).But when it comes to train and coach travel, our research shows Ireland is holding its own.Trains Ireland: A ticket on our busiest inter-city route, Dublin Heuston to Cork Kent, is €19.99 if booked a few days in advance. A next-day single, however, is about €33. How does this compare with our EU neighbours?UK: A next-day single from London to Manchester is at least €46 for a morning ticket, jumping to €196 on most later trains. Even accounting for the longer distance (330km v 260km), it’s more expensive than Dublin to Cork.Trains from London to similar distances – say, Newtown in Wales – start at €80 for next-day travel. Cork-Belfast is €52, meanwhile, but a similar journey in England, London-Newcastle, is more than €25 dearer.There are also some bargains in the UK if booking 12 weeks in advance, and selected trains from London Liverpool Street to Cambridge cost about €14, the same as a next-day train to Kilkenny from Dublin. Overall we come out pretty well in any price comparison with Britain’s private rail operators.Denmark: Faster but more expensive than Ireland. A next-day train from Copenhagen to Odense (about 260km away) takes one hour and 44 minutes, and costs €41 one-way.France: Geographically eight times larger than Ireland, France has an enviable transport network. A trip of 260km from Paris to Bayeaux – the ancient Norman city of tapestry fame – is a third cheaper than Dublin-Cork, costing as little as €22, changing at Caen. The journey to Lyon, 2.8 times longer than Dublin-Cork, cost €65 for a next-day single.Yet although French trains are often quicker thanks to the TGV, they are not always cheaper. Metz is 330km from Paris, a longer journey than Dublin to Cork. Although the train takes half the time, it’s €50 for a next-day single – more expensive per kilometre.Germany: Berlin to Dresden, about the same distance as Dublin to Cork (260km), takes about the same time and is cheaper for a next-day single, at €27.Portugal: A single from Lisbon to Coimbra, a journey of about 200km, costs €21 for the following day’s travel online at cp.pt. Adjusting for distance, this is still about €5 cheaper than Cork-Dublin. A three-hour schlep to Porto can be had for as little as €26, also cheaper than Dublin-Cork.Buses Just 2.9 per cent of journeys in Ireland are made by rail but 17.2 per cent are made by bus, where the exponential growth of Irish motorways has led to an explosion of non-stop inter-city services.Ireland: A next-day single express bus from Dublin to Cork costs €11.50 with UK-owned transport company Aircoach if booked online, and €14 with GoBe, the tie-up between Bus Éireann and GoBus.If travelling today, however, GoBe is cheaper – still €14 if booked online – than Aircoach, which does not allow online booking on the day of travel, and costs €17. A next-day single from Dublin Limerick (177km) is €12 online with Dublin Coach.Finland: Booking a next-day single from Helsinki to Jyväskylä is €19, which is more expensive than Dublin-Cork. But a next-day single from Helsinki to Turku with matkahuolto.fi is €8, much cheaper than the €12 Irish equivalent of Dublin- Limerick.France: It’s €15 for a three-hour, next-day trip from Paris to Caen, and €13.90 for the 330km to Metz. Adjusting for distance and the price index, this is slightly more expensive than the Cork-Dublin Aircoach price.Portugal: Lisbon to Porto costs €10 by bus for a next-day ticket with Flixbus. Coaches for Lisbon-Coimbra, however, generally start at €14.60, which is more expensive than Dublin-Cork.Denmark: It’s €11 for a next-day single from Copenhagen to Odense, which would be cheap in any country.UK: When it comes to buses, Britain comes into its own. You can pay as little as €12 for a next-day single bus from Manchester to London, while London to Plymouth (the equivalent of Cork to Belfast) costs less than €17 by bus for next-day travel.Germany: It’s just €9 for a next-day single from Berlin to Dresden with Flixbus.Dublin transport: How does it compare with other European cities?Despite costing well over €1.5 billion, the Luas carries roughly the same number of commuters into the city centre as cycling, with the number using bicycles stalling as decent infrastructure is awaited.The NTA says the proposed Bus Connects route through Fairview will bring segregated lanes from Sutton to Connolly and could be a game-changer.In the meantime, Dublin Bus remains the workhorse of the transport network in Dublin . But how does the price compare?Dublin\u0026nbspIf you have a Leap card, the most you can spend in on Dublin transport– Dublin Bus, Luas and commuter rail services – is €40 per week. Once this limit is reached, you travel for free.London\u0026nbspCommuters’ fares are also capped at €40 a week, albeit only for the city centre. The cap reaches €70 if Heathrow is included.

Verdict: Irish win.Berlin\u0026nbspIt costs about €4 from Berlin Schonfield to the main station (Hauptbanhof). Verdict: Irish defeat.Lisbon\u0026nbspThe airport is connected to the main city by a metro line, with tickets costing about €1.50. Verdict: Irish defeat.The numbers: Where your transport tax goesThis year, just €3 out of every €100 you pay in tax will be spent on transport. The biggest portion of this – over €1 billion a year, or €1.43 of your €3 – goes on roads.Just 20 per cent of our transport budget goes into actual public transport – trains, buses, trams, metros, cycling infrastructure.Out of your €100 in tax, this accounts for just €0.62. And out of that, just €0.06 goes on cycling or walking infrastructure, which is virtually non-existent in Ireland compared to the inter-city cycle paths of our UK and EU neighbours.Cycling and green campaigners have called for this curious ision of funds to be rectified in order to offer alternatives to driving.While Irish Rail passenger traffic has returned to Celtic Tiger levels (45-48 million), it’s still a fraction of the passenger journeys in similar-sized countries such as Denmark or Finland (73 million and 85 million in 2017).In terms of distance travelled, passengers in Ireland accounted for 2 million passenger-kilometres in 2017, versus 6.2 million for Denmark and 4.27 million for Finland. And yet despite just 10 per cent of Irish railway journeys being inter-city, Irish travellers still experience overcrowding.Irish Rail’s Barry Kenny says the company is due to dramatically increase rail capacity (through investment in signalling, level crossings, electrification and so on) with a view to increase journeys to 75 million by 2025, and says the National Development Plan also foresees electrification of lines allowing Maynooth, Drogheda, the M3 Parkway and Hazelhatch to be serviced by the Dart.He also says prices are “very competitive by western European standards”, pointing at the full tax relief earned on season tickets. Yet why is there such low take-up?One reason is our vast motorway network which is, per capita, three times as long as the UK’s, and also longer than those in Germany, Denmark, Finland and France.Some of our rural counties – such as Tipperary and Meath – are blessed by no fewer than three motorways.The opposite is true of railways. Per capita, we have a shorter railway network than the likes of Finland, Portugal, France and Germany.Dart Underground, long identified as the number one infrastructural transport priority by planners, has been mothballed, while new motorways and dual carriageways are planned for Cork and Galway. No new rail lines are planned."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3942305.1561922694!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"campaign to attract irish nurses home has been stood down","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tRosarii Mannion, HSE national director of human resources. Photograph: Dara Mac Donaill  The A campaign to attract hundreds of Irish nurses back home from overseas has been quietly “stood down” after a lack of interest, the Health Service Executive (HSE) has admitted. The HSE said the Bring Them Home campaign brought back 120 nurses since July 2015, when it was launched with the promise of recruiting 500 nurses from Britain alone. HSE records released under Freedom of Information last year said three nurses had returned under the scheme between January and July 2018. The figures also stated 15 nurses were recruited under the relocation package in 2017, down from 82 in 2016 and 20 in 2015. All of the nurses who returned under the scheme came from the UK. Minister for Health Simon Harris said in 2017 that the scheme was being extended beyond nurses working in the UK to those anywhere in the world. During 2015 and 2016, the HSE’s national recruitment service paid “approximately €250,000” for the campaign, including on removal and relocation expenses, as well as the costs of flights. From June 2016, costs were paid directly by the hospitals. Last week, the HSE said it had “now concluded” and that it was “stood down”, with hospital groups taking on the responsibility of directly recruiting nurses. Asked when the scheme officially concluded, HSE national director of human resources, Rosarii Mannion said could not recall any formal decision having been taken to end it. “I don’t think there was anything ceremonial about standing it up or standing it down... it just moved on and evolved,” she added. However, Ms Mannion later said financial incentives, worth up to €3,000, remain available to any nurse wishing to return to Ireland from abroad. “But I am not running a Bring Them Home campaign,” she said. “What I am trying to do is keep the nurses (already) at home.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3942307.1561959825!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eir broadband plan looks set to be rejected by state","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEir chief executive Carolan Lennon is critical of the specifications of the National Broadband Plan. Photograph: Marc O’SullivanAn alternative plan for delivering rural broadband for €1 billion “has not met” the State’s criteria for the roll-out of high-speed connections, the Department of Communications has said.It is the clearest indication to date that the Government will formally reject the €1 billion proposal by telecoms company Eir, which was posited as an alternative to the €5 billion National Broadband Plan.The proposal was submitted by Eir in a letter to the department last Friday. A spokeswoman for the department said it did not satisfy key criteria relating to State aid, transparency, access to the network for commercial providers, State clawbacks for profit and risk sharing.‘Unnecessary costs’It comes as Eir chief executive Carolan Lennon writes in today’s  that the company warned the Government about “unnecessary costs and complexity for almost two years” while bidding for the National Broadband Plan.Outlining her company’s approach to delivering country-wide broadband for €1 billion, she writes that the plan “leads to substantial and excessive cost to the State”.Ms Lennon criticises the specifications of the National Broadband Plan, writing that “while we fully believe everyone in rural Ireland should have access to high-speed broadband, we don’t believe it needs to be better than that available in our towns, cities and the rest of rural Ireland”.Ms Lennon writes that Eir could deliver the plan by “reusing existing infrastructure rather than building new connections.“The vast majority of homes in rural Ireland already have an Eir connection, and we would reuse the existing overhead or underground plant where available ... For €1 billion we could build a network which would pass all the rural premises in the NBP with high-speed broadband and connect all those who want it to their broadband provider of choice.”Wednesday hearingThe Oireachtas committee will on Wednesday hear from officials at the department, who are expected to address the Eir plan in detail.On the impact of abandoning the NBP process on time frames, a department spokeswoman said that “Eir has explicitly stated that its letter is not a formal offer seeking to replace the current NBP process. Eir had previously withdrawn from that procurement process. Any new procurement process would delay the project by between three and five years.”A Government source said that its aim was to “make sure the necessary protections for the State are included. Otherwise, we are using State money to help the dominant player in the market make more money for their shareholders.”The source continued. “Eir have said themselves that they don’t actually want the contract. It’s easy to pull out figures when you’re talking about hypotheticals.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3942266.1561918914!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eir s cost claims strike at fg s reputation as custodian of finances","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWhy is Eir undertaking this full frontal assault on a broadband process  it has not been engaged in for 18 months? Photograph:  Michael SmithGetty ImagesSince its explosive claim that it could deliver the objectives of the National Broadband Plan for €1 billion, Eir has shown little sign of resiling from the firestorm of controversy it has created. Writing in Monday’s , the company’s chief executive, Carolan Lennon, shows that Eir is minded to dig its heels in on the issue, even as the Government signals its commitment to the plan. Her words will do little to smooth relations with the department she argues that delivering rural broadband under the NBP will lead to “substantial and excessive cost to the State”, and that Eir warned the Government “about unnecessary costs and complexity for almost two years” while it remained in the bidding process for the plan. For civil servants who are already battling their own paymasters in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on the issue, this is decidedly unwelcome rhetoric. It’s the same story for a Government that has provided political cover for the controversial plan, amid growing public unease about its cost. This has played no small part in undermining Fine Gael’s self-appointed role as the most prudent custodian of the public finances.Constrained by governanceLennon’s article is thought to reflect the broad substance of the company’s letter to the department, sent last week in reply to a request for more detail on how it would hit the €1 billion target. It effectively says the NBP is overengineered and constrained by governance and oversight obligations. It hardly stretches belief that Government bureaucracy could create such a situation. However, the question must be asked: why is Eir undertaking this full frontal assault on a process which it has not been engaged in for 18 months?The enthusiasm with which it has unburdened itself of its criticisms has led some in the corridors of power to suggest it is motivated more by its own commercial interest than out of concern for the public purse. Some have also pointed to Eir’s reputation for poor customer service, while others suggest the intervention area within the NBP is currently an Eir cash cow, and that the NBP presents a threat to that income stream. There are also legitimate points to be made about how much the company could earn in connection fees as consumers switch providers over the long term, and the competition and legal implications of parts of its alternate plan.Value for moneyIn fairness to the company, it was explicitly asked before last week’s Oireachtas Communications Committee meeting to provide its views on value for money in the NBP and now has done so. Even its critics must acknowledge that Eir is doing currently what the NBP aims to do eventually – it is delivering broadband to rural Ireland. And then there are the well-founded concerns around NBP. Even if you don’t like Eir, its criticisms of the plan should not be summarily discounted, coming as they do after the trenchant critique of the plan by department secretary-general Robert Watt, and the controversy which led to Denis Naughten’s resignation as minister for communications. The Government will not, at this stage, have its head turned by Eir, no matter how attractive the offer may be. The political commitment to the plan is too strong to abandon it, and the State apparatus is too committed to the process and structure it has created, which it says is key to ensuring a well-functioning market and a transparent outcome. Nonetheless, Eir will feel its point has been made loudly, and will ring out for some time amid a process that is likely to court controversy again.

Mr Ronan’s former business partner in Treasury Holdings also holds a one-third share of the holding company which controls half the project. Former secretary general at the Department of the Taoiseach, Paddy Teahon, is a director of the holding company. ESB will face significant competition for the 1,100MW project, which has not yet been constructed, from overseas players. Sources with knowledge of the project said that French multinational utility Engie has also advanced to the next round of bidding, alongside British company EDF Energy and German utility E.on.Bids are understood to be currently around the €100 million mark, but any successful bidder will have to spend many multiples of that figure to bring the project to completion. They may also face renewed interest from parties that had earlier dropped out of the race and are now understood to be looking to get back in. The renewed interest in the project, a source said, is driven by the central place afforded to offshore wind farms in the State’s climate action plan.According to the plan, “the inclusion of specific support for offshore wind in the Renewable Electricity Support Scheme design will be transformative, and in the long run will deliver the scale of renewables required to decarbonise our electricity system’’. Starting gunThis language has been interpreted by many in the industry as firing the starting gun on an offshore sector which has been neglected for years, with the State targeting subsidies at the less expensive onshore wind sector. Amid the policy vacuum, the Codling Bank project was effectively shelved.However, in recent years onshore wind projects have found it harder to get planning permission as objections become more frequent, leaving the pace of development in the future in question. Simultaneously the Government has been under pressure to show its commitment to hitting future renewable energy targets, which may be key in mitigating fines that are expected to come from the European Commission for falling short of binding renewable targets set for next year.ESB had no comment when contacted.

He told RTÉ there were at least 11 EU countries opposed to the beef aspect of the deal and the Government should be seeking to form alliances with these countries.“We in the IFA will fight tooth and nail against this – we don’t accept it is a done deal... the Minister needs to get to Brussels, meet his counterparts and with his fellow agriculture ministers across Europe, and push back against this deal.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3942310.1561921816!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ireland may vote against eu and south american trade deal","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar said it was “evident” the deal would be bad for the beef sector. Photograph: Getty Images Ireland may vote against a landmark trade deal between the EU and a number of South American countries after a strong backlash from Irish farmers.Last week the EU and Mercosur – a regional alliance of Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay – announced the trade breakthrough following two decades of negotiations.The deal drew furious reaction from Irish farmers concerned about a potential surge of beef imports into Europe, with the Irish Farmers Association warning the consequences of the deal could be worse than a no-deal Brexit.Ireland does not have a veto on the deal when it comes to a vote at the European Council in about two years’ time. The vote will be by qualified majority, so Ireland would have to assemble support from close to a third of member states if it wants to defeat the measure.One senior Government source said it plans to carry out a full assessment of the plan, looking at what the overall impact will be on the Irish economy and jobs. If the results of the assessment are not positive, voting against the deal cannot be ruled out, the source said.Speaking in Brussels on Sunday, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said it was “evident” the deal would be bad for the beef sector.“We need to get an economic assessment of the deal to see what impact it will have on the Irish economy, and if it’s a negative impact on the Irish economy and jobs then obviously we’ll vote against it,” he told journalists on his way into the European Council. “If it has a positive impact well then we’ll be minded to vote for it.”The economic assessment, he said, would show the deal “good for the dairy and the drinks industry, SMEs and the services sector”.Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed described the deal as “very disappointing for the Irish beef sector”. He said that notwithstanding the fact it does not allow for the Mercosur countries to start selling the 99,000 tonnes of South American beef into the EU for another 10 years, it was a source of great concern to the Government.“We already have a European beef market that’s in marginal oversupply and given all the uncertainty about Brexit and the UK, where we sell 300,000 tonnes of Irish beef annually, this deal is very disappointing for us.”Mr Creed said it appeared the deal on beef was “the sweetener” to get agreement on the entire trade deal which also involves goods such as cars, car parts, pharma and farm products, as well as services and public procurement.Asked if the deal would affect his intention to nominate agriculture commissioner Phil Hogan for reappointment, the Taoiseach repeated his previous statement that the nomination would only be considered by the Cabinet when the new European Commission president is appointed."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3942227.1561916141!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"boris doubles down on hardline brexit stance and soaks supporters adulation","story":"UK prime ministerial candidate Boris Johnson says that he is proud to take personal responsibility for the Brexit referendum passing, adding that as PM he would leave the EU without a deal on October 31st if necessary. Video: Sky NewsReuters\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBoris Johnson speaks during a hustings event at Manchester Central. Photograph: Matthew LloydBloombergFrom the moment Boris Johnson marched onstage, hair mussed up and head pushing forward, it was clear he had the audience at Manchester Central convention centre on his side.“Great to be here in Manchester, home of free trade. And of course Britain is once again going to be the great champion of global free trade – once we get something done,” he said to cheers and applause.Inside the icy, air-conditioned auditorium, the mostly middle-aged and elderly Conservatives were still dressed for the muggy heat outside, the men in short-sleeved shirts and the women in light cotton frocks. They were here for the fifth hustings of the Conservative leadership contest, a week before 160,000 party members receive their ballot papers to choose between Johnson and his successor as foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt.A week earlier, in Birmingham, Johnson had refused to answer questions about the police calling to his partner Carrie Symonds’s flat after a noisy row between them. For a few days, Johnson’s campaign appeared to be wobbling but after doubling down on his hardline approach to Brexit and soaking up the adulation of supporters, the candidate has returned to form.After a blurry sketch of his strategy for persuading the EU to change the withdrawal agreement (“the money – we should suspend that in a state of creative ambiguity over the talks”) he took a bash at Project Fear.“They said there won’t be any whey or glucose or milk solids for the Mars bars on which our children depend,” he said, meandering into a joke with the punchline “where there’s a will, there’s a whey”.Unknown knownsJohnson’s pitch is that he will deliver Brexit with or without a deal and return the Conservatives to electoral success by governing the country in the consensual way he ran London. A cabinet minister for two years, Johnson was nonetheless shocked to discover during the current campaign that education is underfunded and broadband coverage patchy.He handled questions from the audience deftly, pushing the audience’s buttons with attacks on the nanny state, liberal policies on crime and above all, Jeremy Corbyn.“This is a guy whose economic policies would be absolutely catastrophic for this country. He would put up inheritance tax, pension tax, income tax, corporation tax ... tax on gardens, my friends. If that doesn’t make your blood run cold, I don’t know what will,” he said.For a few days, Hunt looked as if he might be a more formidable opponent for Johnson than anyone had expected. His performance at the first hustings in Birmingham was sharper than Johnson’s, with a refreshingly thoughtful approach and a command of detail.He followed it up with attacks on Johnson’s failure to take part in debates and on the frontrunner’s implausible promises on Brexit. In Manchester, however, much of the fight appeared to have gone out of Hunt as he sought to play down the two candidates’ differences over Brexit.“If we get to the beginning of October and we don’t have a deal we can get through parliament, then I will leave without a deal on October 31st. Because I think any day beyond March 29th this year is a day too long. I don’t think that my position and the position of Boris are particularly different,” he said.Faint applauseThe applause Hunt received was a faint echo of Johnson’s, even when he told the audience what they wanted to hear. The biggest cheer of the night came when moderator Iain Dale read out a Twitter post announcing that Olly Robbins was standing down as chief Brexit negotiator.Hunt said he would not “say something bad” about a civil servant who had worked hard but he was unable to call up a word of praise for Robbins, who secured a withdrawal agreement from the EU that respected Theresa May’s almost impossible red lines.Hunt’s craven diffidence gained him nothing, however. The room was now too cold for the audience’s thin cotton clothing, the evening was getting late and two by two, they started to drift away."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/06/11/TELEMMGLPICT000197062411_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqWZZ9520Qrn8RyVs0byqFfxdYxsWUQUCtgJX18DpO5X4.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"making final call publish mps expenses","story":"Former editor of The Daily , William LewisIts publication led to the biggest parliamentary scandal in a generation, but two national newspapers had already turned the story down.The decision to pay for the full expense claims of every MP in Westminster was laced with risk: the leaked information could have been deemed stolen, or worse - it could have been a hoax.

A report by the London School of Economics (LSE) into children’s attitudes towards the internet found they overwhelmingly wanted a ‘grand erasure’ of their online footprint to stop childhood mistakes affecting their future.The research, which was funded by the Information Commissioner\u0027s Office, also found that children were generally trusting of tech companies in the same way they are of their schools.LSE researchers reviewed more than a decade’s worth of studies into children’s understanding of their online data and also conducted focus groups with more than 160 secondary school-age children.Professor Sonia Livingstone, who led the research, said children were generally “outraged” when they learned how much of their personal information is being hoarded online and wanted “a fresh start” when they turned 18.She said: “They say ‘whatever I do before I am 18 should be wiped off’ as it shouldn’t have any effect on them as an adult. They want a kind of grand erasure because they talk about the importance of making mistakes and just being kids trying things out.”The Government is currently looking at a range of new measures to better protect children online including imposing a legal duty of care on tech giants and introducing an Age Appropriate Design Code, which will mean social media giants will have to assume users are children if they can\u0027t age verify them.Duty of Care white paperMost social media companies have a minimum age of 13, but due to the lack of proper age checks the study found children as young as nine said they had profiles.The study found that children generally took instructions they received online on “face value” and often didn’t understand how tech companies were commercially benefiting from the information they handed over. As a result, they found it “puzzling” that internet companies often asked them to give out details they did not see as relevant to the service.The children interviewed were also shocked to learn that material they thought they had deleted could still exist online and wanted “delete to mean delete” when it came to social media.Other features children wanted from tech companies were a way to see which other companies their details had been shared with and “child-friendly mechanisms” to edit their information.Prof Livingstone said the children were generally mystified as to why tech companies were interested in personal information they saw as quickly going out of date as they grew up.She added: “Creepy is a really common word that they use. It’s creepy and sinister that all that data is being kept.”Duty of Care CampaignWimbledon AI tech will examine players\u0026#39 reactions to instantly decide best bits of every tennis matchTory leadership race: Matt Hancock warns Jeremy Hunt\u0026#39s refusal to commit to Brexit deadline increases risk of second referendum Pakistan calls for police investigation into World Cup fan clashes with AfghanistanJapanese whalers head out on first commercial hunt for three decadesOutrage as Venezuelan navy captain dies under \u0026#39torture\u0026#39 after arrest over alleged coup plotJuly 4th 2019: How a tax on playing cards and a thwarted tea shipment led to American Independence DayPaul Gambaccini warns of \u0026#39false allegation crisis\u0026#39 as he calls on anonymity for sexual offences suspectsFreak hailstorm dumps two-metre layer of ice on Mexican city - amid temperatures over 30CTaylor Swift \u0026#39sad and grossed out\u0026#39 after Scooter Braun acquires back catalogueBritain\u0026#39s potholes are \u0026#39national scandal\u0026#39 that would take a decade to fix  Comment: Scrapping HS2 would be a national embarrassment.

The next stage is turning our attention to what we call ‘one and done’ firms, where they appointed one woman several years ago and are not for changing.  The Hampton-Alexander review encourages all FTSE 350 companies to have women make up at least a third of their board and leadership roles by the end of 2020.Along with the Investment Association - which represents investors responsible for funds totalling £7.7trillion – the review wrote to 69 firms companies which had one or less women on their board.Since mid-March when the letters were sent, 20 have now appointed women but 14 failed to reply to the letter at all, according to figures published on Monday as part of the review’s mid-year update.  Ms Wilson said the lack of response from 14 companies left her feeling “frustrated”.“There are a small number of companies that are holding things back – and the question is what do we do about them?” she said.A voluntary regime can be “persuasive”, she said, adding: But we are powerless in terms of giving any sanction or doing anything about these companies that choose not to address the shortfall of women in their leadership team. And I think that is where going forward, is the next stage.”Ms Wilson said that while she would not advocate quotas and legislation per se, ministers must consider how to bring these reluctant companies to the table.“What are the tools, what is the wherewithal they have to encourage - force if you like to use that word -  these companies to use their entire talent pipeline and not just half of it?” she said.“If they choose to ignore that I do think there needs to be some way of addressing that actually.”The review, which will report to the Government at the end of next year, is to publish figures on Monday showing that 32.1 per cent of FTSE 100 board positions are held by women, up from 12.5 per cent in 2011. Over the same period, the FTSE 250\u0027s figures have increased from 24.9 per cent to 27.5 per cent.Kelly Tolhurst, the business minister, said: These latest figures show there are now more women than ever before at the top of UK business, and I want to see companies do all they can to increase the numbers further.  Diversity makes good business sense and those who fail to see this as a priority are missing out on the benefits that erse leadership brings.”The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

By Monday afternoon, a first whale had been caught and was being transported back to shore.The hunts come after Japan decided to withdraw from the International Whaling Commission, a move slammed by activists and anti-whaling countries but welcomed by Japanese whaling communities.My heart is overflowing with happiness, and I\u0027m deeply moved, said Yoshifumi Kai, head of the Japan Small-Type Whaling Association, addressing a crowd of several dozen politicians, local officials and whalers in Kushiro before the boats left.This is a small industry, but I am proud of hunting whales. People have hunted whales for more than 400 years in my home town.Whaling vessels were also leaving Monday morning from other ports including in Shimonoseki in western Japan.The country\u0027s Fisheries Agency said Monday it had set a cap for a total catch of 227 whales through the season until late December - 52 minke, 150 Bryde\u0027s and 25 sei whales.I\u0027m a bit nervous but happy that we can start whaling, 23-year-old Hideki Abe, a whaler from the Miyagi region in northern Japan, told AFP before leaving.I don\u0027t think young people know how to cook and eat whale meat any more. I want more people try to taste it at least once.Whaling has long proved a rare diplomatic flashpoint for Tokyo, which says the practice is a Japanese tradition that should not be subject to international interference.As an IWC member, Japan was banned from commercial hunts of large whales, though it could catch small varieties in waters near its coastline.But it also exploited a loophole in the body\u0027s rules to carry out highly controversial hunts of whales in protected Antarctic waters under the banner of scientific research.Activists said the hunts had no scientific value, and Japan made no secret of the fact that meat from whales caught on those hunts ended up sold for consumption.Humane Society International slammed the resumption of commercial hunts.This is a sad day for whale protection globally, said the group\u0027s head of campaigns Nicola Beynon, accusing Japan of beginning a new and shocking era of pirate whaling.With its withdrawal from the IWC, Tokyo will carry out whale hunting off Japan, but will end the most controversial hunts in the Antarctic.The resumption of commercial whaling has been an ardent wish for whalers across the country, Shigeto Hase, the head of Japan\u0027s fisheries agency, said at the departure ceremony in Kushiro.He said the resumption of commercial whaling would ensure the culture and way of life will be passed on to the next generation.Whale meat was a key source of protein in the immediate post-World War II years in Japan, when the country was desperately poor.Most reports suggest consumption has declined significantly in recent decades - with much of the population saying they rarely or never eat whale meat - and activists have pressed Japan to ditch the practice.It is totally false that commercial whaling will not be viable as demand is declining, he said.Some believe that Japan\u0027s return to commercial whale hunting will effectively sound the death knell for the industry.Japan is quitting high-seas whaling... that is a huge step towards the end of killing whales for their meat and other products, said Patrick Ramage, director of marine conservation at the International Fund for Animal Welfare.He said commercial whaling in Japanese waters was unlikely to have much of a future given dwindling subsidies and the shrinking market for whale meat.What we are seeing is the beginning of the end of Japanese whaling.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

In the last five years in the UK over  teachers have been struck off as a result of sexual misconduct with students.Groomed and sexually abused, married mum-of-one Rachel, now , kept her personal ordeal secret for  years.Ahead of a new Channel  documentary which airs on Monday called Teacher’s Pet, Rachel, from Wiltshire, has bravely spoken out about the abuse she suffered at the hands of her school’s deputy headteacher...The abuse began when -year-old Rachel was grieving the sudden loss of her -year-old father after an epileptic seizure.Graham Wilcock, then , invited year seven student Rachel into his office, offering her a shoulder to cry on.But rather than supporting her in her grief in a professional manner, Rachel says things quickly turned sexual.He kissed me and said ‘You don’t know how to kiss, do you ’, let me teach you and kissed me in a mouth open, adult way,” she says.Initially, Rachel was flattered by the attention, and began going to his classroom after school and spending hours in his company.“I felt special… but part of me knew it was wrong even then and I didn’t tell anyone. I wanted to almost show off to a friend but I kept it a secret,” she says.When Rachel was , Wilcock lured her to his home for sex while his we was out at work.“He totally took away my innocence,” Rachel says. “The notion of a male teacher inviting a pupil to his house sounds incredibly suspicious in today’s society, but during the Eighties no one gave much thought to predatory paedophiles.The abuse - which lasted for three years - was also emotional.Wilcock began to berate Rachel’s weight – and she developed an eating disorder.She says: “While privately he would tell me that he loved me, in public he’d bully me - calling me fat and ugly in front of other pupils.By the time she was , Rachel had been sleeping with Graham for three years.Rachel says: I really began to see what was happening between me and Graham was not normal. I just wanted to get away.Finally, when Rachel left school she was finally able to escape his clutches, and went on to lead a normal le, working as a broadcaster.However, a few years later, Rachel saw a post on Facebook that said Graham was now working in a Romanian orphanage.She says: “Someone posted something like: ‘It’s like putting a kid in a candy store’, and it’s only then I realised I wasn’t the only one hed abused.”Battling with the strong emotions that the shock news threw up, Rachel attempted to overdose and take her own le.However, she instantly regretted her decision and was rushed to hospital, spending four days in intensive care.She says: I just thought, Im not going to let him take me down. Hed already screwed up enough of my le, I wasnt going to let [him] ruin the rest of it.Shortly after, Rachel summoned up the courage and reported Wilcock to the police.He came back to the UK and was arrested, before being charged and pleading guilty to six counts of indecent assault.Seeing him in court for the first time in years, Rachel says: “I didn’t recognise the man standing in front of me in court.“I was actually looking at someone  and then my mum pointed at him. I saw he was biting his nails. I was shocked. I remember him having blonde hair, he was good looking, charismatic. It jolted me.He had aged and looked like just the saddest middle-aged man.”Wilcock was sentenced to four years in prison - the maximum allowed under the law at the time the abuse took place - and put on the sex offenders register for le.The judge called the case, deeply distressing.While Rachels case seemingly ended with justice being served, the same cannot be said for all victims of childhood abuse.Writer Graham Cavey, now , who also features on the show, was  when his priest took him under his wing, taking him on special school trips to the local cinema and theatres.Graham says the priest plied Graham with alcohol.He says: “He got me a job working behind a bar illegally when I was . I got drunk and the details become blurry – but he took me back to his home he shared with other priests and that was where he sexually abused me.Afterwards he said one word, ‘Sorry’ before throwing a towel, telling me to clean up before he drove me home.“I felt sick, confused, disembodied – strangely disassociated with what was going on, but I knew something fundamental had shted and things would never be the same again.”Graham feared telling his parents, especially knowing what high esteem they held the priest in.The abuse came to an end when Graham was  and taken on a school trip to Greece where he confronted his abuser.He says: “I repeatedly told him I hated him and that was the end of the sexual abuse. He told me I was evil.”However, the abuse had left its mark and for a period of time he suffered with alcohol addiction and ended up in rehab.He reported the abuse to the church but no legal action was taken.Graham says: He admitted it but responded with it takes two to tango. I was . There was never any acknowledgement from the church or the school. Justice was not served.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Shame on Labourit backs them, and on any Tories who join them.MPs have repeatedly promised to honour Brexit. Yet they reject the only deal on offer and the EU refuses to improve it. No Deal isn’t The Sun’s favoured option, but it IS the logical and inevitable consequence of their game-playing.Grieve hopes instead to stop Brexit . . . by blackmailing his own Government and, sickeningly, holding a gun to the heads of the poor both here and abroad.But No Deal would still be the default. And funding would have to be immediately restored. Grieve is madhe thinks anyone but him and his Remainer friends will be blamed for targeting benefit claimants, OAPs and schools.Their conceit is repugnant. Even Theresa May, normally one to mince her words, calls them “grossly irresponsible”.This Cabinet lacks resolve, but our new one must unite to face down the wreckers. Boris Johnson is right to say there would be no place in his for those unwilling to back No Deal as a last resort.If it means exile for Amber Rudd and her allies, so be it. Voters have had enough of MPs and ministers issuing threatsthey don’t get their way.WE are sick of Theresa May trying to inflict damaging policies on her successor to establish a “legacy” in her last days.Her new milkshake tax must be thrown out. There is no credible case for it.The Government says the fizzy drinks levy “succeeded” because makers cut sugar in their recipes. Rubbish. The sole point was to make people less fat, and it hasn’t. If it’s failed on that, it’s failed.Spreading this folly to milkshakes compounds the stupidity.Voters will flock to a new Tory PM who champions consumer choice and puts nanny state zealots back in their box.It’s a sweet prospect.ONLY leftie class warriors could fail to admire a graduate who sets up a viable company and creates jobs.Entrepreneurs are our economy’s leblood, providing work for millions and putting food on families’ tables.So we welcome Jeremy Hunt’s pledge to wipe out their student debtthey launch a start-up hiring more than ten people for five years.Too few graduates do so.

Are you just putting the case for Remain ”After the interview in March, viewers complained that Miss Bundock was “rude and biased” but the BBC responded: “We’re satisfied that by the end of the interview Mr Martin was able to put across his argument in full.”Now however the objections have been upheld by the corporation’s more senior Executive Complaints Unit.It ruled: “It would have been easy for viewers to form the impression that the presenter held a distinct view of her own on Mr Martin’s support for leaving the EU without a deal, and the interview fell short of the BBC’s standards of due impartiality in that respect.”The statement added: “It has been stressed to the presenter that the way questions are framed should make it clear to the audience that this is for the proper purpose of impartial challenge and that a personal view is not being expressed.”Meanwhile the fallout from BBC One’s disastrous Tory leadership debate continues.New figures show a massive , viewers complained about last week’s show, with most alleging “bias against Boris Johnson” as well as favouring “contributions from the south of England”.Earlier this week The Sun revealed that the BBC had admitted presenter Emily Maitlis’s style “may not be to everyone’s taste” – then hastily deleted the jibe.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

From Pakistan to Poland, Israel to Ireland and South Africa to Switzerland, people enjoy the best of British.But there is undoubtedly more to do to turbocharge trade. That’s why we are guaranteeing that under our leadership, Britain will never join a permanent customs union and instead seek to negotiate a comprehensive Canada-style free trade deal.This means Britain will enjoy a fully independent trade policy to compete with the world’s biggest players.It is simply not good enough for a country as productive as ours to hand over its trade policy to the European Union.We intend to leave the EU with optimism and confidence. Britain can walk tall in the world with the lowest corporation taxes to attract business, a £billion boost for our armed forces and a competitive free trade policy.We will have political leadership at the heart of our team from the start of the negotiation with the EU.This will include the best and brightest, like world class negotiator Crawford Falconer. And there will be no need for a Department for Exiting the European Union.So we will fold these resources into a beefed-up Department for International Trade and Digital Enterprise.We want to be a truly Global Britain and this cannot be done on the cheap. We need to be competitive so we will increase our trade footprint overseas by doubling the International Trade department budget.So we must wrap up Brexit as quickly as possible. It’s an urgent priority and that will be our unrelenting focus until it is done.We both voted three times to leave the EU andothers had done the same we would have left by now. We don’t see Brexit as a problem to be solved but as the most amazing opportunity for our country.It is a task which will require confidence, craft, vision and attention to detail. It will require the promotion of some relationships and the resetting of others.And let us make one other thing clear: that team will never include the Labour front bench, which is hell bent on blocking Brexit.There are a few other things about our Brexit plan that readers should know. If we leave without a deal – not an ideal outcome but one that must remain an option – the full £billion orce payment will not be handed over.We will not pay a penny more than is legally required. Anyone who thinks we are going to write a blank cheque to the EU is sorely mistaken. To leave we need an experienced deal maker.Perhaps one who delivered a smooth Olympic Games in . Perhaps a deal maker who delivered £million a week for the NHS after winning a battle with the Treasury. Perhaps a deal maker who is already around the table with European leaders as Foreign Secretary.So today our solemn promise is this: We must be able to demonstrate real progress with the EU by the middle of October. If no agreement is in sight by then we will press ahead with No Deal.No one sensible wants this outcome, butit’s a choice between no Brexit or No Deal then we will never betray the democratic mandate that Brexit won in .Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Imagine that!Why the sudden interest in women’s football  I’ve heard more than one person ask.Well, it doesn’t take a genius to spot the cause and effect — put women’s football on to BBC TV and people will not only watch it, they will bloody love watching it, and realise the level of talent possessed by the likes of Ellen White, Lucy Bronze and the rest of the team.It strikes me that exposure and access is the only reason that we as a nation have cared so much less about women’s football than men’s in recent years. In fact, I know this to be true. You know how Maybe you already know this too but just to recap, this isn’t the first time that our nation has fallen in love with women’s football.Cast your minds back a hundred years or so to World War One when any man fit enough to play football had been sent to fight on the front line.Back at home, it turned out that women were completely able to do so much more than stay at home looking after children.In fact they were able to not only take on the men’s jobs — they also took their places on the football field. And people loved watching them.Women’s football was absolutely huge during World War One, drawing crowds of up to , even after the war had ended.These pioneering women managed to achieve phenomenal success and recognition, and they did it at a time when such a thing would have seemed nigh on impossible. They defied society, challenged convention, cocked a snook at tradition and expectation — and changed the mindset of a nation by taking women’s football to unprecedented  heights, all within a couple of years.And they did it because the men were away fighting — and so they were allowed to.And then women’s football here disappeared completely.Why The men came back from the frontline — and they wanted their jobs and their football back.And the women  They were expected to go back to the domestic realm. And, just like that, it turned out  women were no longer considered suitable to be footballers.Apparently, the sport was condemned as “inappropriate for their bodies”. And so began a campaign against women’s football, the sport that had been appreciated by the nation. That culminated on  December , when the FA called on clubs belonging to the association “to refuse the use of their grounds for [women’s] matches”.It would be easy to conclude that they were scared of the competition.With women safely out of the way men could take their rightful place back on the pitch. Incredibly, it was not until after England’s World Cup win in  that women’s football began to be revived.In  the Women’s Football Association was formed, and in  — a full half-century after the ban — the FA allowed its members to host women’s games again.Still, though, until now the attention paid to women’s football has been pretty desultory.But that’s changed, thanks to the Lionesses and to the exposure that women’s football has rightfully  been given. And now finally, after  years, football may be coming home.England’s Lionesses are two games away from winning the World Cup, having shown skill, determination and hard work in the tournament.The way they play out from the back, the way they keep possession, the way they handle themselves under pressure is a real credit to football. The men should take note.I couldn’t be more proud and how fabulous that more than .million tuned in to watch them.To say that I’m excited for the USA game on Tuesday is an understatement.When you’re at boarding school you wear what you’re told, eat what you’re told, go to bed when you’re told. In fact, you spend your le doing what you are told.Yes, sure there is an upside to that – the one thing I craved when I came out of boarding school was independence, and it gave me a survival instinct.But there are lots of downsides, too, which is why I didn’t send my kids to boarding school.Although, on reflection, maybe I should have . . .BREAKING news – the Miss England competition has launched a  make-up free round for the first time.The idea is to support body positivity and natural beauty.For ’s contest,  entrants – including  Bethany Cammack, trolled as a teenage beauty queen –  have been challenged to submit snaps of themselves with no make-up.It is a far cry from traditional Miss England competitions, where most wannabes have been plastered with more make-up than the average Love Island girl. So I suppose, in a way, it is progress.But here’s a more radical thing. Should we  have a Miss England competition at all It’s outdated, old-fashioned and sexist.We should not rate people on their looks but on their character, what they stand for and what they do.No matter how you dress it up, the prize for Miss England goes to the best-looking entrant. With competitions like this still going on, is it any wonder young women are tortured by self-esteem and confidence issues Make-up or no make-up, it is still judging women on how they look  – and pitting them against each other.I didn’t know until now there is  a Mr England competition too, but that is just as bad.Talk about a bitter-sweet level playing field – where men are as obsessed as women about their abs  and whether or not they should be hair-free.WHAT does it say about society when men who beat up women are not jailed  It says that violence against women is often tolerated.Attacks on woman are the most socially tolerated form of violent behaviour.This week a steroid-using, drug abusing body-builder beat up his girlfriend so badly she thought she would die.She was the FIFTH partner this man has assaulted.He was not jailed as the judge  thinks imprisoning a serial domestic abuser would do “no good”.  No good  It would send a signal that it is not OK to beat up women.As this was his fth victim on record, I am sure there will be more, as he has escaped suitable punishment.He should be in jail and the judge removed from office, at the VERY least.IT’S hard not to feel  sickened by the fact Faryal Makhdoom and her boxer husband Amir Khan spent  £, on their daughter’s first birthday party.Faryal, , and Amir, , held the Amazonian-inspired bash earlier this month at the University Of Bolton Stadium – the same place where the couple held their £, engagement party and eldest daughter’s £, second birthday celebration.I’m sorry, but £, for a first birthday party  Where has  their perspective gone Of course everyone wants to throw their child a great birthday party, but a one-year-old won’t even remember the event.Wouldn’t it have been better for Faryal and Amir to have held just a small celebration and put all that money they spent – on something that lasted for just  a day – into a bank account  so that their daughter could eventually put it toward her own flat, or setting up a business when older Sleeping under canvas, even   it is dressed up as a “bell tent”, “eco-pod” or a “VIP yurt”, is my idea of a nightmare.Add to that probably more than , people, a woeful lack of loos, nowhere to hide from the beating sun and nowhere to wash – and it becomes a vision of hell.Yuck.ANYONE  do a massive eye-roll watching footage of Aaliyah, the -year-old Londoner appearing on Channel ’s  Hours In AE Not only was she there because she had just a broken fingernail, she was complaining at having to wait to see a doctor – I guess because the doctors were busy attending to real emergencies.Aaliyah, broken nails were why plasters were invented.You – and your mother, who took you to AE in the first place – need to get real.So do we.

We could end up with a version of Mrs May’s hideous Chequers stitch-up, with a few extra bells and whistles on the Northern Ireland backstop.That won’t wash, Boris. Voters have been conned twice already. They won’t fall for another blatant fudge.Worryingly, Boris has surrounded himself with Mrs May’s most loyal Cabinet supporters — ministers who connived, and failed, three times to get her botched deal through Parliament.He is listening to staunch Remainers like Health Secretary Matt Hancock.He is taking advice from Attorney General Geoffrey Cox and Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay who, for all their Brexit credentials, willingly dipped their hands in the Chequers blood. They each have a CV to protect.Bearing in mind Boris’s pathological craving for popularity, allies are also alarmed by the sudden support of old cronies and arch-Remainers David Cameron and George Osborne.None of them will tell him what he needs to hear: To save the Tories from the Farage sword, Britain must leave the EU as free traders.We cannot sign up to any iety of customs union, single market or EU court.Boris famously loves to be loved. He likes to have his cake and eat it. He hates making hard choices.But this is the biggest decision of his le and he cannot fudge it.Brussels’ greatest fear is Britain, the world’s fth-largest economy, as a free-wheeling tax haven on its western shore.It is, therefore, our deadliest negotiating weapon, and Boris needs to show his readiness to use it.He has frequently hailed Singapore’s transformation from a small, poor nation to a small, low-tax, well-educated, rich one.Against howls of protest, he backed Brexiteer tycoon Sir James Dyson’s decision to move his HQ there.Boris likes to remind us he won Mayor of London against the odds. But it is worth remembering he only did so after almost running out of steam.He needed to have his feet held to the fire with a blunt warning: “Let us down and we’ll cut your f***ing knees off.”Someone should sit down and give him exactly the same message today.THE most striking aspect of the Tory leadership contest has been the articulate energy of all the candidates – including the no-hopers.All are professional politicians whose job is to argue their case, sometimes without notes, and win over the hearts and minds of voters.It is only striking because Theresa May ­possessed none of those skills.Now we discover her Madame Tussauds waxwork has been given the heave-ho.

He replied the best way of guaranteeing Britain leaves is to pick a PM who can “actually get us a deal that can get through Parliament.”Boris supporters leapt on the comments – accusing Mr Hunt of “kicking the can down the road”. “Only Boris is committing to delivering Brexit on October ,” one aide said.Mr Hunt will dramatically step up his bid to close the gap on Boris by trying to prove how serious he is about delivering a No Dealthere is no “prospect” of an agreement with the EU.He will vow to slash corporation tax to . per cent from  per cent overnight in a No Deal Budget – costing £ billion. And he will pledge to spend £ billion reimbursing tarfs faced by farmers and fishermen. Dairy products could face a  per cent duty in a No Deal.Mr Hunt said: “If we could do it for the bankers in the financial crisis, we can do it for our fisherman, farmers and small businesses now.”He also pledged to set up a COBRA-style emergency committee to prepare for a clf edge exit. The former Remain voter insisted that he would be prepared to see Brits lose their job in a No Dealit meant delivering on the result of the  Referendum.Challenged by the BBC’s Andrew Marr he said: “I would do it with a heavy heart. We are a country where politicians do what the people tell them to do.“Soin order to do what the people tell us to do, we have to leave without a deal, I would do that. But I would find support for those companies to help them weather the storms.”He separately confirmed moves to hire former Canadian PM Stephen Harper as part of his negotiating team to thrash out a trade deal with the EU.Boris Johnson stuck to his end of October deadline.And Jeremy Hunt rightly promises extra cash for farmers, fishermen and the small firms which could take a hitwe end up in a No Deal scenario.But his problem is that no one really believes he would deliver No Deal. Mr Hunt won’t even commit to taking us out by the end of the YEAR, let alone honouring the October  deadline.And while it’s good to see more No Deal funding on offer, both candidates should be wary of rash spending promises they might not be able to pay for.Until Brexit’s sorted out once and for all, the new PM must keep the safety-first approach which has brought our debt under control in recent years.With Labour gagging to turn on the spending taps, evenit bankrupts Britain, the Tories need to show they’re still the party of financial prudence.That’s the best way to keep the UK fighting fit for our future outside the EU.And he said he felt a “personal responsibility” for delivering Brexit after his high profile campaign to Leave. “I played a part in that campaign. I take personal responsibility now for what is happening to our country, for the drt and the dither and the indecision, and the failure to be sufficiently robust in the negotiations which we’ve seen so far.“I want to lead us out of this mess.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Put kids first The soaring numbers of children who need treatment for mental illnesses is a health crisis when local social services are chronically underfunded after Tory austerity hammered council budgets. The % rise in cases coupled with a % financial axe means too many are being denied or forced to wait for treatment. Conditions once ignored and undetected that are now diagnosed, combined with ­intensying pressures on youngsters in the social media age, require investment.

He was overweight, stuck in a rut and was sick of being a slob. So he and partner Louise decided to join a gym and ditch their unhealthy lestyle for good. Just  weeks later Paul had lost a staggering lb, dropping from st b to st lb. And the whole family have benefited from his health kick now that he insists that they all go out on healthy walks together before the kids are allowed to play on their Xbox.  Floor layer Paul, , from Astley near Wigan explains: “I was sick of being a slob. “I just used to live on fast food. I was always eating on the go -I was hungry I would pull in at a petrol station and grab a chocolate bar and a bag of crisps to keep me going till I got home. “I was just snacking all the time, drinking too much, going out a lot.If the football was on I would get six cans of lager, for no reason other than the football was on telly. I realised that I had to change.”    Paul and Louise, , joined the Ultimate Performance gym in Manchester, where they were given a nutrition plan as well as knuckling down to three tough training sessions each week. Soon they found that their mindset changed - as well as their diet. Out went the fast food, chocolate bars and beers, and instead they were filling up on lean meat, fish and loads of veg. Paul started to see results after just two weeks, which gave him the incentive to keep going.  Paul says: “Being at UP made me realise the type of things I was doing that were making me put on weight.Why get six cans of lager just because the football was on  It massively changed my mindset.” Instead of petrol station fast food and snacks, Paul’s new diet would be steak and veg for breakfast, lean red meat or chicken and veg for lunch, and a prawn stir fry for dinner. And instead of lounging about on the sofa in the evenings and at weekends, Paul, Louise and the kids have become the family fit, going on long walks whenever they can.  Dad of four Paul explains: “We do a lot of walking now as a family.At UP they really make a point of telling you to get your step count up each day - its not just about the exercise you do in the gym. “I try to aim for , steps a day. You don’t realise thatyou lounge round the house at the weekend it can get to pm and you will only have done , steps. “So now I make sure we get out on lots of walks. The kids always say they want to play on the Xbox but they aren’t allowed to go on it unless they’ve been on the walk. “We’ve also bought a dog as well, so that gets us out even more.  Paul says joining the gym has given the whole family a fresh outlook on le - and unless something benefits their health or is making a memory they don’t do it any more. “We’ve got a new house and before we might’ve gone into a furniture shop and bought a £ coffee table.Now we think about what we really need in our lives - we don’t need a £ coffee table, butwe saw a weekend away that cost £ we would go for it as it is making a memory. “The more you think about it that way, it becomes natural to you. We have spent money on doing our garden up so we don’t need to do out as much to socialise - instead we sit in the garden and have our friends round while the kids play.We don’t need to go to the pub any more to socialise and it has saved us money. “It has completely changed our lives.” "},{"url":null,"title":"boys can wear skirts toilet","story":"NewsBoys can wear skirts and toilet signs taken down as primary adopts gender-neutral policySt Brigids National School, in Wicklow, south of Dublin, will also take down toilet signs to help children feel more comfortableShareCommentsByGavin OCallaghan:,  JUL NewsBoys will be allowed to wear the schools tartan skirt from September \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA primary school will let boys wear skirts after switching to a gender-neutral unorm policy following requests from pupils.

Laura, , was thrown behind bars after she was caught with  Tramadol painkillers at Hurghada Airport. But five months after she was released from the Egyptian jail, Laura has grounded herself. She has refused a luxury trip abroad with her dad and now only travels a few miles on the bus as far as Hull city centre for work. The jailed Brit has been given her job back, working at a clothes shop. But most nights the Brit has been living like a hermit, staying home and spending two hours chatting to her Egyptian lover, Omar Caboo, over the internet.    Laura, who is still madly in love with Omar, had claimed she had taken the banned painkillers to help her lover who had suffered a bad back since a car crash. But after arriving in Egypt the pills were discovered lying at the top of her suitcase and she was thrown behind bars. She was quizzed for days before being jailed on Boxing Day . She was released -months later after a presidential pardon. Retired haulage company boss Neville Plummer, , said: ”She now finds airports terrying places. I doubt she’ll ever set foot in one again.”    From his smart detached Hull home, just a mile from where Laura lives with his ex-we Roberta, Neville added: “I wanted to take her on holiday to Majorca to help her get over her terrible ordeal. “She would have liked to come but said she couldn’t because she couldn’t face setting foot in an airport ever again and would run awayshe ever found herself near one. “She is going to have her first holiday since her release in a few weeks’ time, but she’s only going a few miles up the road to Scarborough with her sister Rachel. “This airport phobia is going to be with her for le, so I can’t see her ever going too far away again. “Shame really, because she was such an independent, adventurous girl before all this happened.” Laura was arrested in October  after arriving for a two week holiday with prescription pills she said here supplied by a work colleague. She was jailed for three years on Boxing Day after a court rejected her claim that the opioid painkillers - illegal in Egypt - were for her Egyptian lover, Omar, . After her release, she told of suffering “horrendous prison conditions.”    She said she was locked up  hours a day in a tiny cockroach-infested cell with  other women prisoners and only a thin blanket to keep her warm. She described it as a “living nightmare” and claims she didn’t deserve to be behind bars because she was just “ignorant” about the law. Neville, who spent £, on legal fees and family travelling expenses to help secure Laura’s release, said his daughter had ed to her old clothes assistant job and was gradually getting her le back on track. He added she was still “very much in love” with Omar and spoke to him for two hours every night on her computer. But he doubted her relationship with resort entertainment manager Omar, who has a we and children in Egypt, would ever be anything more than a long-distance one. “How could it be  She’ll never get on an aeroplane again, and he can’t afford to come over here. I think in time it will just fizzle out.”    The devoted dad had campaigned for her release and taped  episodes of her favourite soap, Emmerdale, for her to watch on her . Laura, arriving back at her mum’s house after work last Friday, said: “I am trying very hard to get on with my le. I don’t want to say much more than that at the moment.” After her release Laura was grilled by Piers Morgan about insisting she was just “ignorant” and hadn’t checked the travel guidance. During the Good Morning Britain appearance she was asked how she got so many tablets from her work colleague. Laura said she “couldn’t wait to see the woman” who gave her the tablets. It is not knownthe pair are back at work together. Piers Morgan asked her: “Where did you get itfrom ” She replied: “I got it from someone I know. She’s just somebody I know from work.” Laura claimed: “I can’t talk about that too much for legal reasons. I can’t wait to see her and ask her where she got them all from. “I am so embarrassed. I didn’t think I had done anything wrong. Omar had a bad back for a while and had been to the doctors. “I wasn’t the most sympathetic person in the world and I thought he had pulled a muscle. I thought I was doing a good deed. “I never asked my friend for Tramadol. She told me she would get me some strong pain relief.” Describing the conditions she was held in, she said: “The prison was horrendous. “Everyone wore white and there were  women to  beds. “There were five toilets in Cairo, for  women. I had to get a shower with a jug over a hole in the floor. “I have witnessed the most horrendous things I’ve ever seen in my le. There were so many low moments. “On my second day I saw two girls get tortured with sticks and I couldn’t understand why I was in a room with these people.” She said that during her time in jail she was taken under the wing of a ft con called Mama Amy. Speaking about why she took the drugs, Laura said: “I knew I had more than one tablet with me, but I had no idea I had . I just didn’t think. “I was so happy walking into the airport, I go to Egypt three times a year. I saw the guy who checks your suitcase, put it on the conveyor and he askedI had medication. “I opened the suitcase and he pulled them out and he said ‘What’s this ’ I thought he was joking when he said I couldn’t have them.” Piers told Laura that some people were not “buying” her story, but she told him: “Don’t ever call me a drug dealer.

The trips will allow passengers to experience weightlessness and view the curvature of the planet. The move could mean flight times between the UK to Australia being slashed from at least  hours to  minutes. British astronaut Tim Peake, , said it is “incredibly important” for us to lead the way in space tourism.    He said: “For Britain to be the first spaceport in Europe to be able to offer that service because we have the legislation in place, because we’ve sorted out our infrastructure, that will be huge.” The move comes after the Government agreed to launch satellites from our soil and a deal was signed with Virgin Orbit to start building horizontal launch sites.

Mark Thompson, , from New Quay in Ceredigion, Wales, is battling a deadly brain tumour and undergoing pioneering treatment hundreds of miles away in Germany. The treatment, not offered by the NHS, uses his own body to fight off the cancer and in total the  rounds cost £, - £, a month. The -year-old has been crowdfunding to raise the cash so he can travel the  hours by plane, train and bus to Duderstadt in a bid to prolong his le. But is now desperate for more donations as he and his family put their faith in the treatment. Mark told Wales Online: “I would say I have changed. Things I do with the kids, I try and do a lot more than before and I’d say try and treasure every moment but I don’t want to speak like that because I think, I hope, I can beat this and that’s how I have to think - think positively.His symptoms began at the start of , when he started to have a tingling sensation and weakness in his right arm.Over six months, he was having problems with his balance, his vision as well as headaches .At some points he couldnapost even speak. He knew what he wanted to say, but physically couldnapost. It took numerous visits to ious - at times dismissive - doctors and even trips to accident and emergency before he was finally, devastatingly diagnosed with an incurable stage three brain tumour. He was given between three and five years to live. Less than a year and a half after his diagnosis, Mark is still battling the cancer that doctors told him they couldnapost remove.    Speaking at the farm in Llandysul where he spent a large part of his childhood, he said: I was back and forward to the hospital and the doctors, I went to see six people in total. Three times to AE. And every time it was just ‘no it’s nothing’, and then the last one then, basically I told him about the speech and he said I needed another scan and he gave me a leaflet about brain tumours. That was a bit scary in itself. Unbeknown to Mark, his symptoms were being caused by a series of mini-seizures being caused by the tumour. At one point all he could say was the word yes. He continued: On the worst day I couldnapost speak whatsoever. It got to the point where I called  and she [the call handler] asked me where I was and I couldn’t reply. “I knew what I wanted to say but I just couldn’t get it out. It was a little bit terryfying. My only answer to her was ‘yes’ and that was it. On August  last year, Mark underwent the scan - and it became immediately clear what he was facing.    After the scan they basically closed the door behind me and the nurse just threw it straight at me, he said. “The kids and the we, that was what was going through my head.” Just weeks later Mark underwent an operation to remove the tumour. During the intensive operation lasting several hours, surgeons worked to remove the cm by cm growth from the side of his head. For a few hours during the operation, he was awake so doctors could test his speech and recognition to ensure they werenapost removing or damaging areas he needed to keep living a normal le. Tests were carried out on the mass and Mark was diagnosed with a rare anaplastic astrocytoma tumour. Doctors told Mark it was incurable but treatable. He said: I wasn’t very worried about the operation itself, because of how advanced things are now - I was more worried about the samples they had taken to see what we were dealing with. I didn’t imagine, not even close, that this was what I had. But I suppose since they did diagnose me I’ve just got to get on with it, I haven’t got much of a choice. It’s a case of fight it as well as you can.    Although optimistic now, Mark admits that at some points he has felt down. But it was a chance encounter with an elderly man at a treatment centre in Brighton that led to the dadaposs more positive outlook. Mark said: I sort of changed my whole perspective on it when I was in the chemo unit in Brighton and this gentleman came in and he was   and he came in to get his shot of chemo and he was telling his whole story to this woman next to him and I was just overhearing. “He was saying he’d had it in his stomach, hands, skin, everywhere, and he came in really happy, did his shot of chemo and got up and left. “I though wow. He’s not upset or whining about it. He came in, got it done and got up and carried on. “I thought that’s the way I’ve got to be about it - what will be will be. After the operation which removed the tumour, Mark went through  days of radiotherapy and chemotherapy and a four-month course of chemotherapy tablets. Now he is going through a pioneering treatment in Germany which uses his own immune system to treat cancer. Mark said: They sort of multiply the white blood cells to make your immune system a lot stonger.    He is hooked up to two machines, with blood taken out of one arm that has the white blood cells taken from it, with the blood ing through the other arm. It was £, a month to start with because I was going every month, he added. Thankfully because of the most recent scans the doctor felt it would be fine to go every three months. All of the money for the treatment has been raised through crowdfunding and holding events, raising so far around £,. In one event with six-a-side football and live music organised by friend Charles Harvey they raised a staggering £,. Later they raised around £, through a  mile sponsored walk over four days from Aberaeron to Snowdon. Mark said: “It’s been a very tough time, but knowing I’ve got all this support behind me is brilliant, it makes a massive dference and it gives me a lot more strength. “Not just family but friends, in England and in Wales. A week and a half ago he had his latest scan - the shadows once clearly visible in his brain are now seemingly gone. It doesnapost mean he is cured but it does suggest the treatment is working.    Although they always planned to get married, Mark said the diagnosis brought forward his marriage to we Sofia. The pair, who have been together for  years, married in April with several of their friends pitching in to provide the cake, make-up and photography. Mark, who has two children with Sofia, said: “We were planning on getting married at some point, but probably not that quick. The diagnosis did spur it on.“It was brilliant, we actually had good weather in Wales.”Now Mark wants more people to be aware of the symptoms, and encouraged anyone worried to be persistent with their doctors. He said: “The whole tingling on one side of your body is an important symptom to look out for. “Eventually I did have a headache, a but later on about a week before [the diagnosis]. “A lot of people think that’s the first thing but that was right at the end.” “To anyone with these symptoms, I’d say get it checked out as soon as you can. You’ve just got to keep going to the doctors, even every dayyou have to.” Donations to Markaposs crowdfunder can be made  here .

Melanie Forrest, , was stunned when her Personal Independence Paymentwas suspended for two months, branding it appalling. DWP bosses have apologised for the mix-up, which happened because of confusion over dates. Melanie spent four days in hospital for a hip replacement. A stay of more than  days halts Pip payments, but DWP officials jumped the gun. Her Employment and Support Allowance was still paid throughout. They have admitted a mistake with the dates and that they owe me about £ or £, which is probably £ now, she said. Itaposs just appalling.    Melanie went into hospital for a hip replacement at the end of April and was discharged after four days. She claims there was a mix-up about the amount of time she spent in hospital. Because the payment had not gone into her account, she said she was not able to pay bills on time. Apparently they thought I was in for  days, said Melanie. The payment just suddenly stopped. They donapost realise that people rely on that money. She added: I used to work for the NHS before I got osteoarthritis. I would love to go back to work in the hospital but I physically canapost do it. The money should have been through on Monday andI hadnapost rung the bank I wouldnapost have known. Now, Iaposm going to have to pay bank charges.    She also claims she spent many hours on the phone trying to sort out her payment. There was a lack of communication, she said. You canapost speak to the same person, they wonapost transfer you to a supervisor or a manager and theyaposre not noting things down. A DWP spokesman said: Ms Forrest has continued to receive her ESA benefit, which is designed to offer a regular income, without interruption. Unfortunately there has been an error with her Pip claim covering additional costs, and we apologise to her for that and will be making a full payment of all arrears due to her. In April , the UK Government introduced Pip as a replacement for disability living allowance.

She would have been surrounded by the people she loved most, and would probably have been inundated with kind wishes from fans and admirers around the world - just as she was on her final birthday. The mum-of-two turned  two months before her tragic death, and in a true testament to how much the British public cared about her, she was sent more than  bouquets of flowers and countless cards and messages.But perhaps the most special birthday message came from her son Prince Harry , who was away at school on the day.Even though he wasnapost there to celebrate with his mum, he called her up and made all his friends sing Happy Birthday down the phone to her. As well as her private family celebrations, Diana marked the occasion with a very glitzy public event - the Tate Galleryaposs th anniversary celebration in London.    She wore a stunning black beaded dress that would become one of her most iconic looks, which Moroccan designer Jacques Azagury gave her as a birthday present earlier that day. She had planned to wear another dress to the event, but when the surprise package arrived at Kensington Palace that morning she changed her plans.Speaking to Hello! , Jacques said: Diana loved it. I believe she had another dress to wear but ended up wearing mine.   She teamed it with a stunning emerald and diamond chocker from the Royal Familyaposs collection. It was originally gted to Queen Mary by the Ladies of India in , and the Queen gave it to Diana on a letime loan shortly after her wedding to Charles. The event, which was sponsored by Chanel, was a very glamorous event with an impressive guest list.  Diana was the guest of honour and took her brother Charles Spencer along with her. It was the last time he saw her. Speaking at her funeral just a few weeks later, he said: The last time I saw Diana was on July , her birthday in London, when typically she was not taking time to celebrate her special day with friends but was guest of honour at a special charity fundraising evening.  She sparkled, of course. In the months before her birthday Diana really focused on her humanitarian work, working tirelessly on her charity projects including assisting Mother Teresa in New York and visiting Lahore to raise money for a cancer charity. Jacques said: She was happier than I had ever seen her. There was something about the way she carried herself a certain new-found confidence.

Frazer Spiers, , is concerned his age is preventing him from finding work. He began applying for jobs when he ed from a -year stint living and teaching English in Europe last July. He says he has completed and submitted more than  job applications since November, but has only been invited for four or five interviews. He told Leicestershire Live : As a -year-old man it seems I am not as employable as others but I am determined. I could sit for the rest of my working days on Universal Credit but that is not what I want to do. I want to work but it has been very dficult for me to find employment. The odds are stacked against me. When Iaposm applying for jobs with big national companies there are pictures of staff smiling on their websites, they are never people my age. They are youngsters and people no older than . A lot of the big firms also have rules which meanyou apply and donapost get the job you canapost then apply again for at least  months. Even my work coach said I am flogging a dead horse, so to speak.  Frazer currently works part time for a charity in Melton, Leicestershire. As a result of the hours he works, the amount of Universal Credit he receives alters. He said: Once I started working the amount I received reduced, so while I am better off by a few pounds per month, I am working for that. If you work out what I received without work to what I receive working, it would be pushing to say work pays. Each £ I earn means by Universal Credit reduces by p. While it might add up and be worth it when you work full time, working the hours I do means it reduces my hourly rate signficantly. If Frazer earned the national living wage of £ per hour, he would only receive £. per hour. He added: For a benefit that is meant to encourage work it doesnapost do an awful lot to do that.If it werenapost for my desire to work I could cruise the rest of my working days on Universal Credit but that is not what I am going to nor what I want to do. I might be better off as they put it but with working so few hours it doesnapost amount to a lot. It is a flaw in the system, because I am trying to find work but canapost. A lesser motivated person might be tempted not to work so few hours. I love the work I do at the moment but I really need more hours. Iaposm doing extra whenever Iaposm offered and I can. “I just want to contribute to others and society. I’m not ready to stop working yet. In my mind, I’d be happy to work until I’m . It helps keep me motivated, challenged and stimulated and gives my days structure.”  Frazer spent the last  years teaching English in Europe, including Turkey, Ukraine and most recently Poland. When I came back, I was homeless, jobless and was very fortunate that a friend of mine offered to put me up, he said. I left Poland financially crippled. Education has improved there and there isnapost much need for private English tuition now. I was struggling so made the decision to come home. I wanted to get back to Leicestershire and particularly Melton Mowbray as thataposs where my last UK address was and I have family links to the area. “The crazy thing is that in theory a Polish family who arrived on the exact same flight as me could have walked into a job centre or local council office and been offered help and assistance there and then. “And I’m not saying that that’s wrong, I’m just saying that the same opportunity and support should have been afforded to me too. “Instead I had to live on scraps for three months and rely on the support of a friend who let me stay and literally wait until I could access the system after three months when I was then classed as a habitual resident.” Frazer was supported by the Exaireo Trust in Loughborough to find a flat.  I’ve had some furniture donated from me and support from friends. I have my flat now but it is dficult surviving from month to month he said. “I hoped to be better supported here and find more stable employment.” He also complained about the charges he incurred when enquiring with the HMRC about his tax code, after a mix up when he started work. He said: “It is wicked that a government department can operate a premium rate phone line. “There was no warning when the call was answered and I ended up with a £ phone bill. “Receiving so little in the first place it was a shock to learn I owed so much.” Frazer has since been made aware of an  number.  A DWP spokesman said: “There is no issue at all with Mr Speirs’ benefit claim. Since starting work, he has been better off each month because on top of his wages, he continues to receive Universal Credit, amounting to more money than he would havehe was not working.” She added: “Earnings from work will affect the amount of support people receive, for every pound earned above the threshold payments reduce by only p ensuring it always pays to be in work.” What is Universal Credit  Universal credit is a benefits system that will eventually replace six separate benefits: income support, income-based jobseekeraposs allowance, income-related employment and support allowance, housing benefit, child tax credit, working tax credit. Claimants will get one single payment to cover any and all of these benefits they are entitled to. From this payment they will have to cover their own costs directly, like rent, rather than it being a deducted payment. The system is intended to make claiming benefits easier but has experienced many problems, and been blamed for pushing many people into hardship and poverty.

Amazingly the -year-old passed both exams with flying colours despite being in agaony. It first happened in  as Khiara, then , sat her Geography GCSE.She gave birth to lb oz baby Hugo a week later after her labour stalled.The same thing happened again in April when she was sitting her theatrical and media make-up exam at Greater Brighton politan College.    Khiara, of Worthing, West Sussex, said: “I was shocked that I took my GCSE geography while in labour and I still managed to pass, but I didn’t expect it to happen again. “I was in pain both times but the second time the contractions were coming very regularly and lasting up to a minute each time. “I’ve never written so fast though - I was the first to finish and couldn’t wait to get to the hospital.” Khiara fell pregnant at  and her due date was right in the middle of her GCSE exams.    She initially dismissed her pains as ‘practice contractions’ – known as Braxton Hicks – but she was, in fact, in early labour with baby Hugo, who is now four.

However, the day before she sat the paper to become a film make-up artist she went into labour after being induced because she couldn’t feel her baby moving.

She finished the -minute exam in just over an hour, then asked: “Is it okayI go now to have my baby ”   Her daughter Poppy was born a few hours later at Worthing Hospital weighing lbs oz.And all her hard work paid off as she passed, gaining a merit and coming top of her class. The delighted mum-of-two was back at college just two weeks after giving birth to do the first of six practical exams which she needed to become a qualied make up artist.    She said: “I bought the TENS machine on the way to the exam to block out the pain because I was determined to take the paper. “I’d worked too hard to miss it and just hoped that I’d be OK. I thought it would be better to sit it while in labour than take it later with a screaming baby. “Luckily the exam was easy as I’d revised so much and so I was able to breathe slowly and turn up the TENS machine to take the edge of each contraction. “I caught a taxi straight to the hospital from college and the driver had to go slowly over all the speed bumps.”    Khiara’s partner Sam Tarrant, , raced to be at her side when she gave birth. And after graduating, Khiara picked up a Commitment to Learning award from her college to congratulate her. Now the couple want a third baby - but say they will time it better next time. She said: “I want another baby in the future, but I can’t risk this happening again. I will have to time everything to perfection or make sure I don’t take any other courses. “I’m going to frame both Hugo and Poppy’s birth certicates and hang them next to my exam results to show what I went through having them.” Julie Nerney, chairwoman of the Met’s board of governors, said: “This is the highlight of my year. “It puts everything working at the college does into perspective.” "},{"url":null,"title":"teenage girls swaggering around streets","story":"NewsTeenage girls swaggering around the streets thinking they can do what they wantThe two girls, both from Hull, launched their assault on the young woman in a petty row over tobaccoShareCommentsByTom KershawNeil Murphy:,  JUN Updated:,  JUN NewsOlly Sargesonappeared in Hull Crown Court\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA pair of thuggish teenagers who thought they could swagger around doing what they wanted punched a -year-old girl in the head after a petty row over tobacco. Brittany Hayward, , and Olly Sargeson, , approached the teenage girl near shops in Hull on December  while shouting about owing money for tobacco. The pair approached the teen and rled through her pockets, Hull Crown Court heard. As the victim resisted she was punched in the head by her attackers. The court was told that the pair thought they could do what they wantedBut their behaviour was labelled thuggish by a judge, HullLive reported.Recorder Ian Harris, QC, told the pair at the crown court on Friday: What you did was bullying, thuggish and insulting. This is an increase in violence and which could have resulted in serious injury.  You have reason to believe you can do what you want and swagger around the streets. But that is not the case.    Prosecutor Neil Coxon said Sargeson had emptied the pockets of the teenage victim and then became aggressive as a -year-old friend of the victim tried to intervene. He said: The best evidence comes from the -year-old friend who saw the event and said that the defendant Sargeson had called the other girls names, like aposs**gapos. She emptied the pockets of the -year-old female victim while saying she had an issue with tobacco. She had been encouraged, according to this witness, by Brittany [Hayward] to do what she did. Recorder Harris said he did not need to hear defence barristers Nigel Clive and Richard Thompson give any mitigation due to the facts being detailed in a pre-sentence report. Hayward, of east Hull, and Sargeson, also of east Hull, both pleaded guilty to using threatening words or behaviour to cause fear or violence. The pair were sentenced to a community order to complete  hours of unpaid work over the next  months and also partake in a ten-day rehabilitation requirement. They were also slapped with a five-year restraining order banning them from contacting the victim.

Parents-to-be Mark, , and Lauren McKay, , booked a -day trip of a letime with Thomas Cook before settling down to save for their baby. They flew from their home Glasgow to Philadelphia and on to Vegas on June  last year and checked in at the Circus Circus Hotel. But pals later told them about the horrying double killings that had just taken place, the Sunday Mail reported. Even more horrying was the revelation that murderer was still on the loose. The couple are expecting a new arrival in December and say they were paralysed with fear for the rest of their trip.    Mark, , said: “We were on edge for the whole time. But the most galling thing was that Thomas Cook knew about all of this before we left Scotland but chose not to tell us. They put us in a room two floors above the murder scene.” “This was our fourth time in Vegas. We love it. There’s always something to do and I like a gamble.” The van driver, added: “The humour was not lost on us. We’re from Greenock, the murder capital of the UK, but you go on holiday to escape. “We’d gone to the room for a shower, then ventured out to meet pals. It was only then that they told us what had happened. “The murders were on the th floor and we were on the th. It was horrying.”    Mark complained at reception and demanded a move but was advised to contact Thomas Cook. He said: “We sought out the Thomas Cook rep at another hotel, explaining that we couldn’t stay where we were. “The murderer had apparently been trying room doors until he found one he could open. It was horrendous. Lauren was distressed and on edge all the time.” But the holiday giant just told them to put their complaint in writing. As a result, the pair spent most of their time as far away from the hotel as possible. Mark said: “I’d been laid off at work and we couldn’t afford to pay for new accommodation.    “We put a chair against the room door at night time. There was one guard on for the whole place.It was only after the murderer was caught that security appeared to be stepped up.” Mark wrote to Thomas Cook when he got home but it insisted it was within its rights not to tell him. He added: “Thomas Cook claimed there was no active threat to guests.” The Sunday Mail got on to Thomas Cook, who said: “We did not receive any notication or report from the hotel regarding the incident.We are sorry we didn’t respond to Mr McKay on hisand have contacted him to apologise for this and make things right.” The firm has offered a £ voucher as a goodwill gesture.

They arenapost poisoning me any more. She added: I feel like the plastic surgeons sold me a dream and I bought it. The price I paid was my health.    I was hospitalised when the whole left side of my face and body went numb and practically lost capacity to use this side of my body. I saw every expert under the sun - doctors, naturopaths, specialists, therapists and so many more. I had blood drawn, a spinal tap, tests ran, countless dollars spent, all to be told I was perfectly healthy but I knew something was not right. Every-day I woke up feeling like I had a bad hangover, with extreme fatigue, brain fog, dficulty concentrating and severe anxiety that left me housebound, which then led to panic attacks. The list of what I was feeling was endless - I began to have burning and tingling sensations in my extremities, acid reflux, muscle weaknesses, alongside chronic headaches and constant joint pain. I constantly experienced nausea, insomnia, memory loss, food intolerances, inflammation and the list goes on.    I was neither too emotional, nor too dramatic, I was sick and I knew it. I felt like I was in constant flight or fight mode and as the years went on, the symptoms got worse and things were becoming unbearable to the point that I was contemplating suicide. If this was the quality of le I was going to have for the rest of my le then I didnapost want it. Natalie refused to believe doctors who had dismissed her concerns, and began to research into what could be causing her illness. As she began to reach out to other girls who also had similar symptoms, she became sure that her breast implants were to blame. Natalie said, I was linked to a Facebook group with over , girls all going through the same thing, they were suffering from the same symptoms, having the same issues and concerns. The more I researched and uncovered, the more angry, disappointed and concerned I became. I could not believe that my breast implants could cause me to be so sick neurologically, optically, and compromise my entire immune system from my muscles, nerves to my joints.  I asked my breast surgeonhe believed in breast implant illness, as many doctors are sceptical. Yet he told me he had heard of so many cases, he couldnapost deny it. On the sixth of February, the FDA announced that all implants, saline or silicone can cause a form of Non-Hodgkinaposs Lymphoma called BIA - ALCL, which is a form of cancer of the immune system. I donapost believe this isnapost rare, itaposs just going undiagnosed.

A deadly blunder saw the huge animal let back into its cage while two people were cleaning it. CCTV from the zoo in Russia shows how one of the women leaves and the bear suddenly appears and approaches the other, who was alone in the cage. Calmly, the woman brandishes her broom and eyeballs the bear, not turning her back, nor making sudden panicky movements, even as it prowled around her. The beast retreats and the second cleaner s through a doorway trying to distract the wild animal.    The bear tried again to get close several times more but evidently fears the broom. The first woman managed to edge her way towards the door - walking backwards so she kept facing the bear, all the time clutching her brush and dustpan as her only sword and shield. “The woman starts walking backwards towards the exit, keeping her eye on the bearaposs behaviour,” reported TV Zvezda. “The incident finishes well, with the polar bear staying inside the cage and both women escaping.”    The women are seen exiting the cage safely. Russian newspapers praised especially the first woman for the “fearless” way she handled an incident that could easily have resulted in serious injury or death. The media said the incident was at Moscow Zoo. Zoo officials have not commented nor identied the brave women cleaners.  The name and age of the polar bear are not known.

Especially here, where they have an extensive menu dedicated to them categorised by flavour and even offer “cocktail experiences” for those looking to learn from their mixologists. Our waiter recommended a real fruit mocktail with lots of real crushed fruit and berries and juices to provide a thirst quenching mix without the alcohol .We relaxed into the quiet and sipped our drinks in the sun as we pondered over the vast menu options.The venue’s interior is a mix of classic wooden floors with soft leathers and muted tartans in greys and brown, combining traditional charm with modern comfort. vw, px\"  The menus are bound in heavy leather books, and there was plenty of choice.My other half ordered bruschetta to startwhich, of course, we ended up sharing. Well, I am eating for two!Who knew that three simple slices of toasted bread with oils and tomato could be so delicious  Also, both of us were pretty in awe of the little yellow tomatoes – spot the uncultured pair.I toyed with the idea of my usual steak pie-pick and even deliberated a fish dish, but in the end we both went for the same main course of chicken tikka curryand it was presented beautully.The plate held rice and naan with a small dish of mango chutney and a large dish of gorgeously bright-coloured chicken tikka.The chicken was wonderfully soft and the tikka sauce was full of flavour, not too salty with just a bit of zing. vw, px\"  I’m notoriously soft when it comes to anything spicy, but this was just enough for me and I only needed water for my tingly lips towards the end of finishing the plateful.We were both equally surprised at the portion size from the Caird. Although it felt upmarket, there was no scrimping on the food.I chose the brownie for dessert and my partner the sticky toffee pudding . Again, both platefuls looked almost too good to eat.My dark chocolate brownie was topped with drizzled caramel sauce next to a scoop of vanilla ice cream with sprinkles of crushed chocolate and chocolate sauce. Strawberries and homemade fudge was presented to the side in a design with shards of wafer and small dollops of salted caramel and strawberry mousse. It sounds like a lot of flavours and it was, but in a good way.My partner’s slab of sticky toffee pudding was also teamed with a large scoop of ice cream, crushed chocolate, a large wafer and a couple of raspberries, sprinkled with icing sugar.We both finished the lot.The whole evening was lovely and relaxing. We could hear the live musicians in the bar from where we were seating which provided great listening. The staff were also fantastic, extremely helpful, attentive and polite."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/06/5d16268aea12d3.34652119.jpg ","title":"almost 1000 people gearing up to take part in dundee marathon","story":"Almost , people pounded the city streets on Sunday when the starting gun fired on the annual Dundee Running Adventure Marathon .The event took place on Sunday and saw runners set off from the mansion house in Camperdown Park before making their way around the “green circular” route that surrounds the city.The course – a mixture of path, trail and pavement – travelled north out of Camperdown and then clockwise towards Downfield, heading east towards Trottick, Caird Park and on to Douglas.Half marathon runners finished at Barnhill Rock Garden in Broughty Ferry, while those completing the full course headed into the city centre.For the first time, marathon runners passed through the arch of the new VA museum before turning back at the Tay Bridge towards the Barnhill finish line.Despite taking place during the school holidays, marathon organiser Nicholas Kydd said the event had drawn an impressive number of participants.“At this stage, were are getting about  people a day signing up for it and we are expecting to have more than  people taking part,” he said.“This time of year can be tricky with people being away for the school holidays and also there being so many other running events happening across the country.“We have people coming from outside the UK to compete.“There are runners from Holland, Germany and even the USA signed up and afterwards they tend to stay in the city for a few days so that is a boost for the local area.”Nicholas is also on the lookout for paid stewards to help out on the day, directing runners and offering encouragement.“It’s more than just volunteering,” he said. “Stewards on the half-marathon will receive £ and those helping out with the full one will get £.“We would also really like to see people from local running clubs getting involved in a big way.“They could help as stewards as they know what it’s like to take part in these events. They can give good encouragement to those running.”Preparations for the run have been going smoothly, with the only concern being what the weather may be like on the day.Nicholas said: “It was extremely warm for running last year, but we’re not sure what to expect this year. We had runners feeling faint, so it is important they drink plenty of water to keep hydrated on the day.”The first Dundee Marathon took place in  and Wednesday’s Dundonian supplement features pictures from it. But unlike similar events that started around the same time in Glasgow and Edinburgh, Dundee’s annual marathon has remained relatively low-key.However, with the arrival of the VA and the renewed interest in people visiting the city, now could be a good time for the annual Dram to go mainstream.Nicholas said he was hoping to see the event grow. He said: “It will continue to be held so it would be good to see more people get involved.”For more information visit eventfull.biz or contact Nicholas on  ."},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-the-old-firm-menzies-and-easterhouse-gangs-feature-in-our-look-back","story":"Another selection of photographs from the Herald and Times archive, today spanning the  years between  and ."},{"url":null,"title":"memories-pictures-from-across-glasgow-throughout-the-years","story":"Images from the archives of the Herald and Evening Times."},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-old-photographs-of-glasgow-through-the-years","story":"Images from the archives of the Herald and Evening Times."},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-do-you-recognise-any-of-these-old-photographs-of-glasgow","story":"Images from the archives of the Herald and Evening Times."},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-do-you-recognise-any-of-these-old-photographs-of-glasgow","story":"Images from the archives of the Herald and Evening Times."},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-how-many-of-these-old-photos-of-glasgow-do-you-remember","story":"Images from the archives of the Herald and Evening Times."},{"url":null,"title":"watch-moment-angus-woman-zoe-archibald-gets-stuck-in-toy-car","story":"THIS is the hilarious moment a Scotswoman got stuck in a childrens toy car - and had to be cut out using a bread kne."},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-memories-of-happy-days-gone-by-in-glasgow","story":"Images from the archives of the Herald and Evening Times."},{"url":null,"title":"the-rocket-man-elton-john-tribute-night-heading-to-kilmarnock","story":"A TRIBUTE night to Sir Elton John is set to hit Kilmarnock."},{"url":null,"title":"sgn-works-in-george-square-cause-traffic-diversions","story":"SGN works will cause a monthof ersions and delays in Glasgows iconic George Square."},{"url":null,"title":"frankie-boyle-to-tour-scottish-theatres","story":"CONTROVERSIAL comedian Frankie Boyle has promised Scottish dates in the autumn - and it will be filmed."},{"url":null,"title":"residents-frustration-over-missed-bin-uplifts","story":"RESIDENTS living in the West End of Glasgow have voiced frustration overdelays to recycling uplts, which they say haveleft tenement back courts strewn with rubbish."},{"url":null,"title":"gerry-cinnamon-shares-liam-gallagher-picture-after-cork","story":"GERRY CINNAMON got a wee bit emotional after the support slot of a letime - opening up for former Oasis frontman Liam Gallagher."},{"url":null,"title":"a-world-of-flavour-on-your-doorstep","story":"STICKING to the same old grub can become monotonous after a while.

This new parliament will be pivotal in determining the nature of our future regulatory environment and we are keen and ready to meet with them.Our industry faces a number of challenges over the coming years, not just in relation to Brexit but on issues such as climate change, environmental policy, plant protection and animal health and welfare. There will also be opportunities for farming and we must ensure that we make the most of these opportunities to build a forward-looking, progressive and resilient sector that benefits farmers and consumers throughout the UK.We would like to invite all UK MEPs on to farms in their local areas to discuss a range of priority issues and to answer any questions that they might have.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"monsters and magic come to lochgilphead booksigning","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead#s Argyll Book Centre is holding a book signing with Lari Don.The Secret of the Kelpie author will be in the indie book shop on Saturday June  to read her new book to eager ears and talk to readers about their favourite folk tales and inventing monsters.After a quick break, Lari willto read excerpts from her spellbinding Spellchasers trilogy to inspire you to imagine magical adventures of your own and tell one of your favourite myths.Born in Chile, Lari Don was brought up in Scotland where she has worked in politics and for the BBC.

Working with the Kilmartin Museum Education Officers, Field Archaeologist Roddy Regan and the Tarbert Community Castle project team led by Robert McPhail, pupils either spent a half day or full day on the castle site.Each day the children had a guided tour of the castle site and of the ious open ‘dig’ trenches, followed by a viewing of some of the objects found on the site in previous weeks. The highlight of their day was to excavate the soil in their trench and the children enjoyed ‘trowelling’ the soil, then sieving their excavated soil checking for any objects that may have escaped their eye.Finally, at the end of the dig sessions, the pupils gathered round to examine the objects no matter how big or small, they had each found on the day. Over the two weeks, the children found a iety of broken pottery pieces ranging in age and style that included medieval and Victorian pottery, clay pipes, broken Victorian slate pencils, ious colours and style of glass and one silver D coin dating to early s.On behalf of the Kilmartin Education team and the schools that took part in the community dig, we would like to express our sincere thanks to the Tarbert Community Trust for allowing the schools such a wonderful opportunity, to dig on a site that is steeped in history, and is of such historical signicance for the West coast of Scotland but in particular for the Mid Argyll and Kintyre area."},{"url":null,"title":"night-time-closures-planned-for-melrose-bypass","story":"MOTORISTS are being warned of night-time closures to the Melrose bypass at the start of next month.From Monday, July  the A close to Borders General Hospital will be completely closed between pm and am for six days.The essential maintenance to the carriageway is costing around pound,.Diversions will be in place - with eastbound traffic will be erted via Kingsknowes Roundabout onto the A towards St Boswells before joining the northbound A towards Ravenswood Roundabout.Westbound traffic will follow the same ersion in the opposite direction.Access to Melrose will be maintained from the east via the A to B Main Street.And a separate ersion will be in place for westbound traffic to access the hospital by taking the B , then using the B and B.Access to the Borders General Hospital will be maintained from Melrose Roundabout.Access for emergency service vehicles along the A will be maintained throughout the works.A spokesman for contractors Amey said: \"This scheme has been planned in consultation with Transport Scotland, Traffic Scotland, the emergency services, Borders Buses, Borders General Hospital and Scottish Borders Council.\"The road will fully re-open from Saturday, July ."},{"url":null,"title":"festival-chairmans-sunshine-promises-for-abbey-ceremonies","story":"ITS never advisable to promise sunshine and a guaranteed historic Abbey setting for the memorable Crowning ceremony.But the words of Melrose Festival chairman Douglas Hardie did come true on Thursday as his towns Principals basked beneath glorious blue skies for the magical Installation and Crowning Ceremonies.Melrose, like all of the other Borders Festivals so far this summer, has been dodging the showers and storms.Several of the young Queens Court had expressed concerns in the run-up that the historic ceremony may be forced indoors.But they were comforted by the promises of Mr Hardie.Chairman Douglas said: \"Guaranteeing good weather and the ceremony being held here in the Abbey was maybe not my wisest move.\"But thankfully the sun has shone and weve experienced yet another glorious ceremony here in our beautul Abbey.\"The th century Abbey yet again provided the epic setting for Melrose Festivals crowning moments.Dozens of Ex-Melrosians took their place within the North Aisle for the emotional Installation and Crowning Ceremonies.And hundreds of well-wishers packed into the cloisters area to witness customs and traditions being continued.Ben Magowan had looked a picture of calm throughout his early Festival week at Melrosian Elect.And it was with an appreciative smile he took his place on the stage to be Installed as the latest in a long line of Melrosians.The occasion wasnt lost on the London-based nurse.He said: \"I will be forever grateful for this opportunity to be Melrosian.\"This is an honour that has made me and my family extremely proud.\"Undoubtedly all of the Ex-Melrosians sat to Bens left were casting their minds back to their own Installation.And, with what has become a customary tradition, two of them who were marking their Jubilees, were honoured further.Graham Wilson led his town in .

road layout and visual impact.\"I am very excited about the economic impact this development could have on the wider Borders economy.ldquoSecuring a Premier Inn for the Scottish Borders will help put our region firmly on the tourism map and the economic impact of Premier Inn and the potential for other investors to follow them, is something which must be grasped.ldquoThe revised Borders Gateway proposals will complement the work taking place to develop the Tweedbank Innovation Park and will sit comfortably alongside the public and private sector projects which are underway at Tweedbank at present.\"The pound million Borders Gateway development also includes a BP filling station, a Costa drive-thru coffee shop, and a MS kiosk.And it is expected that the new outlets will create up to  jobs.Although the wider vision of the development had been welcomed, the supermarket part of the plans had come in for criticism.And Newland Assets revised their plans to omit the supermarket earlier this year.Councillor Parker added: ldquoBorders Gateway has the overwhelming support of the public and many businesses in the area and now that the food retail plans have been dropped there is no reason why these proposals should not be fully endorsed by the planners and backed by Scottish Borders Council.\"The economic advantages of this proposal signicantly outweigh the very small number of policy considerations which are left.ldquoAlthough it was right for the planners to raise concerns about the previous proposal, now that the developer has listened carefully to all the objections and amended the plans accordingly to deal with them, the Borders public simply wonrsquot understand why the council isnrsquot backing this ambitious inward investment opportunity.\"It will help bring new

An interim evaluation took place in December  with minor changes being implemented in January  to address some minor issues.ldquoA more detailed evaluation was conducted in April  which provided useful feedback from students, staff and parents from all nine high schools.ldquoThe vast majority of respondents highlighted the importance of having access to a library for reading, digital, research and study.ldquoThe feedback has been analysed and options for realising the decision of previous council to identy savings is ongoing.ldquoIt will also be critical to ensure that future library provision needs to be equitable across the authority.To which councillor Anderson: ldquoFor Galashiels Academy this has not been a good experience. The school has reported to the parent council that the noise levels in the library has at times been disruptive to other library users and to nearby classes, and excessive litter has been left in the library.ldquoDespite a self-service system that is aimed to be straightforward to operate, books are not finding their way to their correct place in the library once they have been ed.ldquoS pupils have been tasked throughout the year to keep the library running, but they also have their own studies and other activities that they volunteer for.ldquoThe former library service provision has in effect been replaced with a service run by pupils with little or no training, who should not be left to police their peers.ldquoThe perception is that this is merely another cost-cutting exercise by Scottish Borders council with little or no obvious benefit to the pupils.ldquoThis experience has been similar in Eyemouth, in the memberrsquos own ward, and has been backed up by a detailed letter from the chair of Eyemouth Parent Council sent to her and other councillors.ldquoThis backs up the experiences at Galashiels Academy.

The day after the crash, Superintendent Jim Guy of Strathclyde Police said there had been no evidence from the crew of any problems before the tragedy.He said the evidence available suggested an accident rather than terrorist attack. The scene of the crash was sealed off almost immediately and an air exclusion zone was imposed.Although most of the wreckage was left for accident investigators to examine, it is understood Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch officers removed boxes and cases containing secret papers on Friday morning.On Saturday,  personnel from RAF Machrihanish were drafted in to help find and catalogue debris from the crash.FIFTY YEARS AGOKintyre could be surfers# MeccaKintyre could become the major centre in Britain for surfingthe enthusiasm of two young men gets the encouragement it deserves.One of them, George Raynes, of Bishopbriggs in Lanarkshire, is secretary of the Scottish Surf Club, and with his treasurer, James Short of Glasgow, has just completed a preliminary survey of several of the Kintyre beaches with a view to exploiting them for the sport of surfing.George has surfed on beaches all over Britain and also in the Channel Isles and in Europe and he thinks that the beaches at Machrihanish and Southend could become the Mecca for British surfers and the venue for the British Championships.He was particularly impressed with the waves at Machrihanish but thinks Southend has great potential as well.He told the Courier: #The possibilities here are tremendous. These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area. In the winter one would have to wear a wetsuit, of course, but the conditions are ideal and the wave forms have great potential # after all, they are coming straight in from the Atlantic over the north of Ireland.#What I#d like to see is a surf club established in Campbeltown. It could become a great asset from a tourist and amenity point of view.#And any Kintyre people who really took up the sport would have a great advantage over other surfers when it comes to competition because they have the benefit of readily available beaches all year round.#If this club gets going, the chances are that the British surf champions in the years to come will be Kintyre people.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOOrr Ewing CupFootballers were favoured with beautul weather last Saturday and the games played on Kinloch Park in the Orr Ewing Cup competition brought together very large gatherings of spectators.The match in the afternoon was brought to a sudden termination by an unfortunate dispute over the award of a goal. The opposing teams were Kintyre and HMS Thames.Kintyre opened strongly and after  minutes# play had scored twice. The dispute arose over the award of the second goal, which Thames claimed to be offside.The referee, Mr Duncan McCallum, an old Hearts player, was of a dferent opinion, and on his allowing Kintyre the goal, the naval team without more do walked off the field.It is understood that the Thames team intimated to the league at the weekly meeting on Monday night their withdrawal from the competition.The teams were: Kintyre # Jas McKinlay: James Black and Archd Sharp: M Muir, A McCrank and T Cameron: R McGeachy and D Brown: Dan McNaughton: N Scally and J Donaldson.HMS Thames # Meese: Jesseman and Love: McCloud, Hirst and Fernie: Dunnell and Weekes: McGeachy: Slynn and Segrott.Referee # Mr D McCallum.In the evening, the opposing teams were Campbeltown and Kilbrannan. A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game. He is a fearless player with a rare turn of speed and a most deadly shot.At least three of six goals came from his foot, and were beautully taken, while he was the means of a fourth which he gave the right wing the honour of finishing.Kilbrannan#s solitary goal was well taken by Brown after a clever break through and an inidual run.Kilbrannan has material for the making of a team that should get much better results than they have so far achieved.The players are keen and inidually have a lot of football in them, but an almost entire absence of method both in attack and defence spoils their chances.The teams were: Campbeltown # A McCallum: G Quigley and Chas McKinven: D Kelly, J McDonald and John Martin: Chas Black and Arch Black: Arch O#May: W McKillop and James Martin.Kilbrannan # John McIntyre: D Bannatyne and Wm Gilchrist: J Short, N McKenzie and James Boyce: D Gilchrist and M Brodie: C Kelly: D Mathieson and J Brown.Referee # Mr W Mustarde."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week june 7 2019","story":"As I retreat into the comfort of a warm house and an even warmer coffee, I wonder what it must have been like for Columba and his fellow monks as they made their way from the shores of Ireland to the wilds of Argyll.The fragile shell of a coracle was not the most effective shelter against the wildness of our coastline.Yet they came.

There are several factors influencing this, but the major factor which has tipped the balance is the extended funding hours and the negative impact this is having both financially on small businesses, like Mary Poppins, and to the quality of early learning and childcare.New Scottish Government policy instructs councils to increase their funded childcare hours from  to , by . This move also includes longer opening hours and a move from term time to year-round opening hours to attempt to make childcare more nationally accessible.Ms Dewar said: ldquoThe money received for funded places does not cover the costs of providing the quality of early learning and childcare which we want and are required to provide, especially with regards to staff costs.ldquoThe timescales and measures that the Scottish Government has put in place to educate a workforce to meet the increased requirements are insufficient, and there is a serious shortfall to meet the requirements of the extended funding.ldquoEast Lothian Council indicated it estimated it would require approximately  staff to facilitate the increase in funded hours in East Lothian. The majority of these posts are early learning and childcare practitioners.ldquoThe local authority advertises early learning practitioner posts at between pound. and pound. per hour. Private nurseries are unable to compete with these rates of pay due to the funding rates we are allocated.A group of parents and staff, including Ms Dewar, are visiting county MSP Iain Gray to discuss the problems, but Ms Dewar added that unless he can ldquowork a miracle and change the policy, then it is unlikely the decision to close the nursery will be reversed.When asked about the nursery, Mr Gray said: ldquoThe loss of any nursery provision is disappointing, particularly with the Governmentrsquos , funded hours policy set to be implemented next year.ldquoIn the case of the Mary Poppins Nursery, the owner has highlighted a number of factors that have contributed to their decision to close.ldquoI have written to East Lothian Council about some of these issues.ldquoHowever, there are also wider issues at play here. The nursery sector has been warning the Scottish Government that private nurseries are struggling in the run-up to the roll-out of its flagship , policy from August .ldquoMinisters must act quickly to address the sectorrsquos concerns and ensure that the capacity exists to deliver the funded hours next year.A Scottish Government spokesperson said: ldquoIt is, of course, concerning to hear of any nursery considering closure, and the obvious effects this might have on staff, parents and children.ldquoEast Lothian Council has provided assurance that they will support families to find alternative early learning and childcare places for children who had been expecting to use the Mary Poppins Nursery from this August.Ms Dewar added: ldquoI am distraught that circumstances have forced me to this decision and that such a wonderful place for children to experience their early years is to close.The decision was met with an outpouring of grief on social media.The nurseryrsquos recent th birthday was marked with a garden party.The nursery was founded by Sue Armstrong, affectionately still called lsquoMiss Suersquo, after she had written to Mary Poppins author P L Travers to askshe could use the name.Miss Sue said: ldquoI received many letters from P L Travers about the nursery.ldquoAt the beginning, she wanted to know what the nursery was going to be like. She had no objection to me using the name, she just wanted to find out more. I ended up meeting her as well.ldquoWe were hoping to get her to come and open the nursery  years ago, but her arthritis was bad. We stayed in touch, however. I would send her letters about how the nursery was getting on along with photos, and she would write back saying how she liked it, and ideas of what to do.ldquoShe said that the children should be encouraged to make up their own stories. lsquoChildren like doing that,rsquo she said.Miss Sue sold the nursery to Ms Dewar in  as she was ldquosick of all the paperwork.She said. ldquoWhen I heard it was to close down, well, itrsquos just all so sad really. Itrsquos such a terrible shame.ldquoIt is such a nice and happy place for the children, homely and warm.

Written on the back of his bucket are lists of the types of seabirds and marine le which can be spotted locally.The  Oor Wullie BIG Bucket Trail builds on the success of a similar trail in Dundee three years ago which raised nearly pound,.This time round, sculptures of the national treasure will be seen on the streets of Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen, Dundee, Inverness and surrounding communities.DC Thomson, which has published Oor Wullie cartoon strips and Christmas annuals featuring the character and his family since the late s, has teamed up with three childrenrsquos hospital charities to share funds raised by the latest trail: Edinburgh Childrenrsquos Hospital Charity, ARCHIE Foundation and Glasgow Childrenrsquos Hospital Charity.Primary schools have also been able to get involved, with a number receiving miniature sculptures of their own to decorate. The results are being put on display around Edinburgh at locations including the National Portrait Gallery, Museum of Childhood and Ocean Terminal.Charlotte Bray, fundraising manager at the Seabird Centre, said: ldquoAs a marine conservation charity the design was spot on and is a fun representation of the local wildle.ldquoThe Jess Mackie Memorial Fund have sponsored the sculpture, which gives it a special relevance for the local community.ldquoJess was a pupil at North Berwick High School and her family have done an incredible job of fundraising for ECHC in her memory.ldquoWe are very happy to be involved in such an exciting nationwide art trail.The trail has been organised in association with Wild in Art and supported by DC Thomson Media.The sculptures were officially unveiled on Monday and will remain until the end of August.A mobile app can be downloaded, with people encouraged to take on each or all of the trails recording each sculpture as they come across it. It also shows a map of each trail and where the sculptures can be found.

Five minutes in a car can cover a distance which would represent a fairly long walk.Itrsquos kind of a simple principle, I know, but one I sometimes forget, as I did a couple of weekends ago. We set off from an event at Amisfield Walled Garden for a walk. My idea was to walk along the River Tyne to Hailes Castle and thenndash by car a -minute round trip.We had some supplies in the form of fruit in my bag and a little water. It was a sunny and warm day and so we set off on our adventure.We began the walk at the old Abbey Bridge which spans the Tyne close to Amisfield. As you walk under its ancient ribbed arches of this late medieval bridge, you get a real sense of its age and the beauty of its construction.The path beyond follows the river and it is almost impossible now to imagine that a great abbey once stood here, with connections to the infant Mary Queen of Scots. A ruined old mill of later centuries still stands here. I reflected on the stories of this location: a courageous nun who defied a flood in the th century and a gruesome murder in the th century and just visible in the near distance the old graveyard, now ringed with trees and almost unrecognisable as a resting place for the dead.A labourer once thought he saw a ghost at the graveyard, but it proved to be something , and I had a wry smile at that tale of a drunken evening over  years ago. These are all tales I have already told here, but they entered my head as we wandered to the gate that led along the northern bank of the river.Hailes Castle is on the southern bank of the river and I knew that there was a bridge that would takes us over. So we set off to find the bridge.But it took us over four hours.It was a stunning walk, with wild flowers and trees decorating the riverbank almost all the way. A grey heron seemed to follow us perhaps he was warning us that the walk was longer than Irsquod anticipated.It is a walk decorated with history too, of course. A stone in the corner of the field by the first gate caught my eye. Deeply ingrained groove marks on it intrigued me. I was later told that it could be the marks of a plough, as the tips of the plough have scraped over the stone a ploughman unwittingly leaving evidence of his unrecorded toil.Halfway along the walk we arrived at the small hamlet of Sandyrsquos Mill. The cottages and mill itself have been beautully restored. The th-century mill still has its waterwheel, although itrsquos now embedded in silt. The mill ceased working  years ago and was transformed into a residential property, but with much of the old machinery inside still intact. It appears to be a very sympathetic and sensitive restoration.It was beyond Sandyrsquos Mill that the distance began to take its toll. The young kids were tired and desperately looking for the bridge. I spotted Traprain Law some distance away and realised that I had badly misjudged the distance and time it would take with wee ones. We had to sit and have a rest and story, with that grey heron listening, to gather the energy to continue.The kids didnrsquot complain much as we wandered along the still-beautul path, now desperately looking for the bridge. As we had rested wersquod phoned for friends to come and lsquorescuersquo us at Hailes Castle with chocolate and water, and we knew they were there waiting for us.Irsquove never been quite so pleased to see Hailes Castle. It loomed suddenly from across the river. I had never approached it from this direction and it certainly did its best to impress. The bridge was just a wee way further and we finally crossed it with a sense of relief.When we arrived at the castle, the kids devoured the chocolate and water, in a way that reminded me of a scene in the movie Ice Cold in Alex. Thank goodness for good friends.Wersquod made it and what a sense of adventure ndash and an achievement!I sat with the kids and told stories as my we went with the friends to retrieve our car. Hailes Castle drips with history but they wanted tales about giants.The day was a lesson for me: to think more carefully about distance when setting on a walk! I thoroughly recommend the path, especially on a lovely summerrsquos day. But itrsquos going to take half a dayyou have kids. So prepare for that!Unbelievably, the kids later wanted to go to a playpark. ldquoWhere do they get the energy  my we asked.ldquoFrom us! I replied!"},{"url":null,"title":"hopes-of-seeing-railway-station-return-to-haddington","story":"RAGESmet with Peter Brett Associates ndash a leading consultancy of engineers and planners ndash to outline the case for improved transports links to and from East Lothian.One of the more ambitious plans was to see theof a railway station to Haddington.Residents of the town have not been served by a railway station since , with the station closing to freight nearly  years later.However, RAGES feels there could still be a possibility of a station ing to the town ndash though the group acknowledged that work needed to be done.A spokesman for the group said: ldquoRAGES expressed its preference for re-opening of the Haddington branch, ideally to the previous terminus on Station Road.ldquoMinimal compulsory purchase relocation of existing industrial units would be required the biggest physical obstacle would be the reconstruction of the A overbridge which was unwisely built without preserving the railway alignment and loading gauge.ldquoA level crossing would be required at Gateside, failing which an alternative road access could be provided for the new houses on the north side of the line onto the A.There was also a suggestion of creating car parking and even a park and ride facility in the town to serve the new service, which would link the town with Edinburgh.The spokesman added: ldquoAs insufficient parking exists at Station Road , a park and ride station at Oak Tree would be essential, which could also serve the substantial Letham Mains and Gateside developments.ldquoJust east of where the A crosses the railway formation, there is a large rectangular piece of ground, occupied only by scrub, which would be suitable as a car park.ldquoAs only single track would suffice between Longniddry and Haddington, it would be possible to retain a footpath cycleway as the line was originally provided with double track throughout.ldquoAn electric train service from Haddington to Edinburgh would provide the speed and capacity which road transport ndash car or bus ndash cannot match.

It is better than some human beings are treated ndash that is the sad truth.Mr Farnsworth was presenting an annual report on the racecoursersquos performance over the last financial year.The Beast from the East snow storm, an outbreak of equine influenza, and a long spell of dry weather all contributed to what he described as one of the worst years the course had been through in his memory.A number of key fixtures were cancelled and profits fell.In December, four horses died during one day of racing at the course but a subsequent review by the British Horseracing Authority ruled that the course and race organisers were not at fault.Councillor Gordon Mackett asked Mr Farnsworththe racecourse had been affected by animal welfare concerns.The course manager said: ldquoWe did have a horrible day when there were four fatalities however, these were all completely separate incidents.ldquoIn a sport like this you will get injuries and fatalities from time to time. It is horric for the people involved.Mr Farnsworth said that the public were becoming more aware of incidents like these through social media which, he said, ldquofuelled the debate around animal welfare.However, he said there had been no indication that it had had an impact on events at Musselburgh, which saw record crowds at its Easter Day racing this year and another sell-out Ladies Day.His report to the committee revealed that the racecourse had reported a loss over the last financial year after it paid over pound, of legal costs relating to the ongoing process by East Lothian Council to find new third-party operators to run the course.Councillor Kenny McLeod questioned why the costs were being met by the course and not the council itself.However, depute chief executive of the council Alex McCrorie told the councillor that the costs were charged to the racecourse because when the new operator was procured it would be the racecourse that benefitted.He conceded to Mr McLeod that, without the legal costs being taken from the coursersquos funds, it would have been in profit last year.East Lothian Council replaced the previous governance committee which oversaw the running of the course with a new committee last year after relations between members of the old committee badly deteriorated and the British Horseracing Authoritythreatening to suspend its racing licence.The new Musselburgh Racing Associated Committeendash which is made up of four elected councillors and two representatives of the racing industry, currently members of Lothians Racing Syndicate ndash has been overseeing the hunt for a new operator.However, the BHA has only granted temporary licences and extensions under the new committee as it continues to monitor its performance.Mr Farnsworth said that the introduction of the new interim committee had caused some problems too.

Here is my version of the story, which I have titled lsquoThe Riddle Rulersquo:IT WAS to be the final race of the tournament. The two knights had been equally matched, and now they would race each other for the prize of a gold cup filled with gold coins.There was an air of excitement as the crowds gathered for this race. Sir John and Sir Harry arrived together, each mounted on their stallions. Sir Johnrsquos horse was called Lightning, while Sir Harryrsquos horse was named Spear.They were equally matched, both knights had won an equal amount of races, and both had won against each other. There was no favourite, everyone knew this race would be very close.The atmosphere was electric with anticipation.Then the kingrsquos storyteller leaned over to whisper in the kingrsquos ear: ldquoYour majesty, this race is the last of the tournament. I feel it should be a race with an extra challenge, so that the crowd are better pleased.The king agreed, but asked the storyteller what he thought the extra challenge should be.ldquoThe race should be a test of the knightsrsquo wits as well as their riding ability, replied the storyteller. ldquoSet them a riddle rule and see how they solve it.ldquoAnd what is the riddle rule to be  asked the king.The storyteller smiled: ldquoDeclare the rules of this race to be thus: the horse which crosses the finish line second will win the cup and coins for its owner.And so the king declared the riddle rule just before the beginning of the race: ldquoThe horse which crosses the finish line second will win the cup and gold for its owner.There was a murmuring amongst the spectators. The knights looked at each other, thinking.When the starter flag was lowered and the king cried ldquogo, both knights stayed at the starting line. ldquoYou go first, said Sir John to Sir Harry. ldquoNo, after you, said Sir Harry to Sir John. But neither knight was willing to leave the start line lest they be deemed to be first.Soon there were boos and clapping from the crowd, but the prize was too great for either knight to risk going first.ldquoThis race is no fun, said the king to the storyteller, annoyed now that hersquod agreed to the change in rules.ldquoGive them until this afternoon to find a way to race, replied the storyteller, ldquothere is a way but they must discover it. It will challenge their wits and also their riding skills.And so the king stood: ldquoThe race is postponed until pm this afternoon. The knights must find a way to race to the riddle rule, otherwise the prize will be forfeited.For the rest of the day there was an excited buzz as people began to discuss possible solutions to the riddle rule with the knights.ldquoWhy donrsquot you agree to cross the finish line together  was one suggestionldquoBut then they would be equal first and the prize would be lost, commented another.ldquoBesides, said Sir John, ldquoI do not trust Sir Harry not to pull his horse back at the last moment. ldquoI do not trust you either, said Sir Harry.The deadline was fast approaching and no solution to the riddle rule had been found.ldquoPerhaps being first is more important than winning the gold, said an old woman.The knights looked at each other, thinking about this. Then they both said ldquonaw and shook their heads.It was  minutes before the race and a child came up to the knights and said: ldquoI have an idea. Everyone looked down at the child and laughed. How could a poor child know the answer when the knights themselves and all the spectators were scunnered But the storyteller was walking by and overheard the laughter. ldquoChildrenrsquos wisdom is not to be laughed at, he scolded them.And so the knights asked the child for the solution.The child said two words to the knights.In a flash, the knights got mounted and prepared to race. When the starter flag was lowered and the king shouted ldquogo, both Sir John and Sir Harry raced as fast as they could, each being desperate to be first across the finish line. Their riding skills were well challenged by this race.Who won does not matter in this story. What matters are the two words that were said by the child.

We are all engaging more online, but the conversations are getting shorter and colder.ldquoThese conversations would be more positive and productivewe could host them in a social context.ldquoWhatrsquos needed is a lsquoFaceFaceBookrsquo where the digital world is used to increase the physical interaction.They have suggested that a large screen cover the back of the building behind the stage that could act as a cinema screen, a digital backdrop to a theatre show and a space for presentations and gaming competitions.Although it is only in the very early stages of planning, the concept was well received by the community council, with member Ferhan Ashiq saying that he was ldquovery impressed with the bold and innovative idea.The community council has the option to either lease or buy the Town Hall from East Lothian Council, and this decision has not been officially made yet but will be the next step that is taken, discussing a business plan and the terms of the transfer with the local authority.The approach is laid out in the strategy, which states that the community council will ldquoreview the best practice from where and arrange research visits to similar facilities. We then refine our idea, seeking feedback from people in Prestonpans. Then we follow the commercial path of least resistance, working with East Lothian Council and other bodies. We bootstrap the idea ASAP with initial funding needed to install the equipment, secure and manage the premise. Then we use the success of the venue to fundraise for improvements and enhancements to the structure of the building to renovate the interior.Brian Weddell, chair of the community council, said: ldquoI was delighted that the feedback from community council members was  per cent positive.ldquoIt is an exciting and imaginative use of a grossly under-used community asset that could help kickstart the revitalisation of Prestonpans High Street.The Town Hall was identied as one of the six viable properties across the county suitable for a CAT, offering local organisations the chance to lease or buy them."},{"url":null,"title":"work-on-affordable-homes-at-letham-mains-haddington-under-way","story":"In total,  new council houses and a further  housing association homes are being built at the Letham Mains site, off the B near Oaktree Junction.The site has a number of dferent developers currently at ious stages of construction as more than  new homes are planed alongside a new primary school on the land.East Lothian Council said that the work on the affordable housing, which was recently awarded to Hart Builders with a total cost of pound.million, was now under way.The homes are expected to be completed in phases between spring and autumn next year, with three more affordable developments expected to start on the Letham Mains site in future years.Councillor Jim Goodfellow, the councilrsquos cabinet spokesperson for housing, said: ldquoThis is great news for current and future residents of East Lothian.ldquoThere is a clear need for new affordable housing developments and these sites at Letham Mains will help contribute to meeting our local housing strategy outcomes by increasing the supply of affordable housing and improving access across dferent tenures and house types.The new Castle Rock Edin will take ownership of the  housing association homes being built on the site.Richard Jennings, the associationrsquos managing director, said: ldquoThere is strong demand for mid-market rent accommodation in East Lothian and we are delighted to deliver an affordable choice of high-quality, well-managed homes for people wishing to be part of the vibrant new community at Letham Mains."},{"url":null,"title":"preview-3-harbours-festival","story":"Residents and visitors alike can enjoy art galleries, live music events, family afternoons with pebble decorating and ukulele orchestras, open houses, cooking demonstrations and workshops over the course of the festival, which runs from Saturday to next Sunday .The festival, which was started more than  years ago, is going from strength to strength, expanding and becoming more erse, with something for everyone in its programme.For the live music fans out there, there is a chance to see the Tom Fairnie Band play their famous Americana music supported by Paul Brown, then Andy Brown, Dropkick and Fuzzystar for the Indie lovers, Alex Hodgson and Rhys Heaven for the folk fans, and to get an eclectic mix all in one sitting, there are the Live on the Lawn sessions, an afternoon of music in the majestic Cockenzie House and Gardens .To keep the young ones and old ones entertained all at once, this year will see a Harbour Family Afternoon added to the programme.

Itrsquos a testament to the continued interest in local heritage and tradition that it is as relevant in  as it was two centuries ago.Now in its th year, the annual Haddington Show will open its gates on Saturday to the crowds and showcase the finest producers, breeders and vendors from East Lothian.The show is a signicant event within the area, with traditional displays of animals, produce and crafts but also offering entertainment and attractions that appeal to contemporary audiences.Of course there is always the lsquoBest in Breedrsquo awards, where competition is fierce but friendly between cattle and sheep breeders, and judging is a serious affair.There are about  horse classes, from veteran riders to the horse and rider fancy dress. The number of entrants reflect the unmistakable popularity of equestrian pursuits within East Lothian.And for those who prefer more craft-based endeavours, there are numerous prizes for the craft schedules, including floristry, baking, stick dressing, photography and jam-making. Itrsquos certainly an inclusive event.Therersquos even a hugely popular vintage farm machinery section, a huge draw for farming and non-farming visitors alike and which makes an impressive vista across the showground.Butyou think itrsquos all about prize turnips and tractors, yoursquod be wrong. Such is the reputation of the Haddington Show it attracts some prestigious performers.One of the most sought-after tickets is for the remarkable pop-up opera shows: a touring version of Scottish Opera who perform in a mobile lorry, complete with seating and stage. Theyrsquoll be singing highlights from three operas during the show and tickets are on a first-come first-served basis on the day.Other notable entertainment is from the Broke FMX stunt motorbike team.

Water to splash in, expanses of sand to run rings round and lots of sticks to be discovered. Balnakeil Beach, in Scotlandrsquos far north, is one of the best dog-friendly beaches in the country: with turquoise waters, dramatic headlands and unspoilt views across the horizon. It is relatively quiet, even in good weather, so your dog should have plenty of space to run wild and explore the beach and nearby sand dunes. A word of warning though-you want to go on further to the northern part of the beach then the path cuts across grazing land, so your dog will need to be on a short lead.. Cairndow, Loch Fyne, Argyll and ButeThe village of Cairndow is located in an enviable position at the head of Loch Fyne, offering a great starting point for walks around the loch. But as well as the idyllic lochside, Cairndow is also home to Ardkinglas Woodland Gardens, a beautul, but suitably ied, private garden that welcomes dogs on a lead. Andall that wasnrsquot enough, you can finish your visit with a trip to the nearby Fyne Ales brewery, which has a cosy beer bar that welcomes dogs with open arms. They are even allowed to sit up on the seats.. Tyninghame Bay, East Linton, East LothianSome dogs love the beach, some dogs love the woods. But why make them choose: the delightful Tyninghame Bay has both. Start at the Tyninghame Links car park and follow the path through the woodland until you reach the sand dunesof Ravensheugh Sands. You can then take in the splendid views of Tyninghame beach -which is mercully quiet compared to its neighbour at North Berwick- before turning onto a track that leads you back to the car park.. The Old Course at St Andrews, FeIconic, revered, and host of the revered Open Championships, the Old Course at St Andrews might not seem like a place for dogs. But they are in fact allowed on the course -provided they are kept on leads- and the Old Coursersquos y fairways can actually offer a great place for a dog walk with a dference. It is best to visit on a Sunday, when the course turns into a pseudo-park for local people. No golf is allowed, children play in the bunkers and dogs are able to wander round without the distraction of balls flying overhead.. Linn Park, southside of GlasgowIf you have a sociable dog that likes making friends, then Linn Park is the place for you. You will be certain to meet plenty of furry friends on your way round the  acres of woodland, waterfalls and grasslands- with even several hours of walking not enough to see the whole thing. The White Cart river even runs through the heart of the park, offering plenty of opportunities to throw sticks into the water for your dog. Andyou exit the park at its Northern gate, you can stop off at the dog-friendly Old Smiddy pub to reward yourself with a well-earned drink.. Burn Anne Trail, Galston, East AyrshireA popular walk among locals, the Burn Anne Trail leads through country roads and woodlands up to a great vantage point above the village of Galston. Although the path features some climbs it isnrsquot too taxing, with most dogsable to manage it with relative ease. Start in the car park across from Barr Castle, before heading towards Burn Anne and into the woodland beyond. From there, the path meanders through the trees and meadows before reaching fields that offer a clear outlook over the countryside- even seeing as far as Ben Lomond on a good day. There are fences that separate the wildle in the fields from the marked path, but it pays to keep your dog close just in case.. Westport Beach, Campbeltown, Mull of KintyreThis ruggedly beautul beach has plenty to keep dogs busy. It stretches for over six miles, with the biggest sand dune area in Argyll, and its position on the windy west coast of creates an abundance of waves to splash in. And when the tide is right, rock pools will form at the far end of the sands: perfect for inquisitive four-legged explorers.. Callander Crags, Callander, StirlingThis walk might involve a bit of a steep climb, but it is well worth it for the views at the top. Provided that you and your dog are fit enough, start at the Callander Crags car park and follow the signposted path through the woods, climbing up steep stone steps to the top of the crags. From there, take a short detour to visit the Jubilee Cairn -a stone monument erected for Queen Victoria ndash where you will enjoy glorious views of the rolling hills beyond.. Pitlochry Dam and Salmon Ladder, Pitlochry, PerthshireSpring is the best time to visit the lsquoSalmon Ladderrsquo at Pitlochryrsquos Dam, as the fish are most likely to be swimming upstream. But, with your dog likely to be uninterested in watching fish, the dam also provides a starting point for a picturesque Perthshire walk. From the Port-na-Craig bridge head to the top of the dam and then on to Loch Faskally, where they should enjoy paddling in the water.. Templeton Woods, Birkhill, DundeeThe  acres of Templeton Woods has several dferent marked trails to follow. Butyour dog wants to run free, there is plenty of space for them to do so- and plenty of sticks to pick up along the way. If the sun is shining, then there is also a large picnic area with barbeques near to the main entrance.. Loch Leven Heritage Trail, KinrossThis -mile trail goes right around the circumference of Loch Leven, butyou donrsquot feel up to the whole thing then it is equally pleasant to do in stages. There are spectacular views of the Lomond Hills and Lochleven Castle on offer, but your dog is likely to enjoy the iety of farmland, woodland and sandy lochside on the way round..Kirkhill Forest, Dyce, AberdeenThere are sticks galore in Kirkhill Forest, with the extensive woodland proving popular with dog walkers, mountain bikers and families. A word of warning though: the forest gets boggy pretty quickly when it rains, so keep your dog at armrsquoswhen they shake off.. Kingsbarns village circular, East Neuk of FeThe East Neuk is one of the loveliest corners of the Scottish coastline, with each small fishing village as lovely as the last. Kingsbarns might be best known for its immaculate links golf course, but also has a great circular walk on offer for those in the know. Start in the village then head down to the Cambo Sands beach -where your dog is sure to love getting into the sea- before making your way back to the village via the Cambo Estate.. Milngavie Reservoirs, East DumbartonshireTwo adjoining reservoirs ndash Mugdock and Craigmadddie ndash provide a flat, pleasant dog walk circuit that proves particularly popular with local residents in the summer evenings. You can walk three miles round one reservoir, or sixyou want to do both, with woodlands at the edge of the Mugdock Reservoiryou want to extend your walk further. And when you finish, you can head to the dog-friendly Bullandrsquos Coffee House on Milngaviersquos Mugdock Road afterwards.. Knockman Wood Circular, Newton Stewart, Dumfries and GallowayThis circular loop is only three miles round, so is a great way to ease yourself into more challenging walks. It follows a quiet singletrack path into some ancient oak woodland, where you might spot some rare birds and butterflies among the many trees.Read more articles in our dog-friendly Scotland series:#Dog-friendly cafesDog-friendly pubsDog-friendly hotels"},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10056966.jpg?type=article-full","title":"discover-some-fantastic-hidden-gems-in-argyll-and-bute","story":"Aside from the areasnatural beauty, there are some fantastic businesses and visitor-friendly spots that are not to be missed.From a festival to tourist sites, craft brewers to gallerys, here we bring some hidden gems in Argyll and Bute that are well worth a visit.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ButeFestButeFest is a boutique family orientated festival on the sandy shores of Ettrick Bay on the Isle of Bute and this yearruns from th-th July.Only  mins from Glasgow and with two dferent ferry routes to get to the island it couldnrsquot be closer to get to this cracking festival.Now in its fthyear,the festival has gone from strength to strength with some amazing musical acts and a whole host of family events running all throughout the weekend.In fact the family fringe events are the key to the entire weekend, from arts and crafts to yoga and theatre productions there really is something for all ages.

It provides a superb vertical foil to the horizontal expanse of the beautul little town, or Royal Burgh of Inveraray. From the top of the tower, the views can be magnicent, sweeping from the Arrochar Alps, Beinn Ime and the Cobbler above the head of the loch, down to the Firth of Clyde and the western hills of Kintyre. From above, the shape of the geological pressures that created Scotland are laid out impressively. At the foot of the Tower, lies the th century planned Royal Burgh.Climb the Tower , look around, and down. On the way up, visit the bells themselves, fitted like a jig-saw into the space, and see the video display of the bells ringing - an almost frightening sight! On the ground floor is an exhibition of Argyll in the First World War.The Tower has a poignant history. It was conceived and built by the th Duke of Argyll, Duke Niall Diarmid, as a memorial to the dead of the First World War, in particular to the Campbells and the ldquomen of my lands. It was an act of personal piety. Ten bells were commissioned from John Taylor and Company of Loughborough. The ten were cast as a single perfectly matched suite. The Scottish Association of Change-Ringers keeps them perfectly timed, and as the second heaviest set of  bells in the UK, they are known and visited by campanologists from around the world, particularly at the bell-ringing festival . Bells traditionally have names, and these bells are named for the ancient Celtic saints who inhabited the boundaries of the Dukersquos possessions: Moluag, Columba, Mund, Brendan, Maelrubha, Blaan, Murdouch, Brigid, Molaise, and Our LadyStella Maris.The Bells were cast in . First they had to reach Inveraray. The first lorry carrying them broke down in Lancashire. Then the second lorry proved unable to climb the Rest and Be Thankful - like so many other visitors before and after. Two bells and the frame had to be dumped and rescued the next day.Then the Tower had to be built. The Duke taxed all his friends and visitors for money. The facing stone came from the quarry in Furnace during winters, the Duke himself collected rubble in his wheel-barrow for the interior of the fabric. The tower was begun in , and finished  years later in , and the bells hung. The cost was just over pound,, approximately pound million in todayrsquos money. The bells could be heard in St Catherinersquos, across the loch.Before long, the tower was struck by lightning, and with the Second World War, ringing ceased. The Tower became almost ruinous. After the war, Lady Glenkinglas founded the Friends of Inveraray Bell-Tower, and gradually restored the Tower to safety, from where the bells ring proudly today during the summer months for visiting bands.The House of Argyll traditionally belonged to the Presbyterian party, with its strong links to the Hanoverian monarchy. In the s the then Duke married an Anglican Duchess, and built the church of All Saints for the Scottish Episcopal Church. Duke Niall Diarmidrsquos spiritual le was centred here, and the holy stillness of the church reflects that tradition. In his spiritual testament, he asked for prayers each All Soulsrsquo Day for ldquoall who died in the War. A local resident who remembers him avers: lsquoFor Duke Niall, that would have included the Germansrsquo. A poignant place indeed!Visit the websiteto find out more.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The Royal an LochanLocated in Tighnabruaich in Argyll, The Royal an Lochan Hotel boasts stunning views of Kyles of Bute.

Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham was one of the Cabinet heavyweights to have been ferried about.Scottish Tory shadow environment secretary Maurice Golden said:ldquoThis proves that Nicola Sturgeonrsquos climate emergency was a gimmick above all . When push comes to shove, her own ministers clearly have no intention of signing up to it. The voters can see right through this nationalist con.Sturgeon responded to weeks of strikes by school pupils and protests by the Extinction Rebellion group by placing climate change at the top of her political agenda.During her speech to the SNP conference in April, she pledged that Scotland would continue to \"lead by example\" as the obligations to the next generation are \"the most important we carry\".She said: \"A few weeks ago, I met some of the young climate change campaigners whove gone on strike from school to raise awareness of their cause.\"They want governments around the world to declare a climate emergency. They say thats what the science tells us. And they are right.\"So today, as First Minister of Scotland, I am declaring that there is a climate emergency. And Scotland will live up to our responsibility to tackle it.\"Her call came weeks after SNP MSPs voted against a Holyrood motion tabled by the Greens calling for an emergency to be proclaimed. The initial disagreement centred on the oil and gas industry,The Government has climate change targets, but some campaigners believe the Nationalist administration is not taking firm enough action, particularly on transport. One of the key challenges is persuading motorists to stop using their cars and instead travel by public transport.However, official Government records show that Ministers have a distance to travel before their actions match their words.Scottish Government HQ is based at St Andrews House in Edinburgh near Calton Hill, less than a mile from the Scottish Parliament.Holyrood can be reached from the Art Deco masterpiece in not much more than  minutes, a journey that is also downhill.Sturgeonrsquos ministerial colleagues used their vehicles more than  times between November  and January to travel between the two landmarks, knocking a couple of minutes off the journey time.In January, Education Secretary John Swinney made use of a Government car for this purpose nine times, Health Secretary Jeane Freeman made the journey on eight occasions, Culture Secretary Fiona Hyslop and Rural Economy Secretary Fergus Ewing did it four times each, while Cunningham and Social Security Secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville did it once.The same records show that Swinney, Hyslop, Cunningham, Brexit Secretary Michael Russell, Freeman, Somerville, and junior ministers Clare Haughey and Christina McKelvie used the chauffeur service for the short trip in December.In the previous month, Swinney, Cunningham, Finance Secretary Derek Mackay, Freeman, Ewing, Somerville and Public Minister Minister Kate Forbes opted for the back seat rather than a short walk. Sturgeonrsquos car journeys are not made available online following advice from the police.NHS guidelines state that  to -year-olds should undertake at least  minutes of ldquomoderate aerobic activity such as cycling or brisk walking every week. It is understood % of the Government car service fleet are hybrid vehicles.Labour MSP Claudia Beamish said: \"Our society needs to change to tackle the climate emergency, and that starts by SNP ministers setting an example to the public. The SNP Government must look at ways to reduce car journeys and to reduce its wider environmental impact.\"ldquoThe Scottish Government is committed to reducing its carbon emissions and replacing fossil-fuelled vehicles with electric vehicles, where appropriate. In line with our procurement strategy, we regularly evaluate existing technologies to assess their operational suitability for future use within the Government Car Service and wider Scottish Government fleet."},{"url":null,"title":"jeremy-hunt-i-back-the-barnett-formula-and-so-should-boris","story":"The Tory leadership contender told The Herald on Sunday that it is ldquoessential to maintain the Barnett Formula, which Johnson has criticised for over fteen years and claimed is unfair on places such as London.One of Huntrsquos closest supporters also urged Johnson, who will take part in a hustings in Scotland this week, to back the call.In another development, aspokesman for the Scottish Conservatives said: ldquoThe Barnett Formula works for Scotland and works for the UK. Any candidate must either commit to it, or set out a very detailed plan for an upgrade.The Barnett Formula, named after the late Labour peer Joel Barnett, was introduced in the s and allocates public spending increases to the Scottish Parliament.Based on population size, rather than need, the system has resulted in Scots receiving a far higher level of spending per head in areas such as health and education.Supporters believe scrapping it could lead to swingeing cuts north of the border and undermine a key plank of the argument for Scotland staying in the UK.Holyroodrsquos funding system has now become a iding line in the battle between Hunt and Johnson to become the next Conservative leader and Prime Minister.Johnson, a former mayor of London, has a track record of hostility to the Barnett formula which goes back to  when he said: \"It is becoming clearer and clearer to people that they are being short-changed. The Barnett formula is producing deeply inequitable outcomes.Three years later, Johnson stepped up his attacks by describing Barnett as a ldquosystem of amazing political antiquity by which the English taxpayer sends about pound billion every year to Scotland as a kind of present.In , he called for funding to be erted from Scotland to London:\"If London isnt moving, the UK is nowhere. A pound spent in Croydon or Tottenham, the areas hit by the riots last year, will generate far more for the rest of the economy than a pound spent in Strathclyde.\"He also said: \"In the end youll create more jobs in Strathclyde or Derby by investing in London than you will by investing in Derby. This is the place that drives the rest of the UK. If it causes Celtic wailing, then Im willing to go there and make the case that its right for them too.His most recent criticism came in the days after the  independence referendum when the then Prime Minister David Cameron said the system would be protected. Johnson responded:\"Im very keen on a Barnett formula which does justice to Barnet with one T [Barnet in north London]. We cant just go on with a system that even Joel Barnett himself thinks is outdated.\"I think there is quite a good way of honouring this slightly odd promise and that is to ask him to redesign it. Id like to see him or someone  have a go. Thats my solution for honouring what I see as a slightly reckless promise.\"Hunt, who has stressed his Unionist credentials in the contest, has intervened to say he will keep the system as Prime Minister.His spokesperson said: ldquoThe Barnett formula is essential to protect Scotlandrsquos public services. Thatrsquos why a government run by Jeremy would maintain it, to help ensure Scotlandrsquos schools and hospitals get the funding they need.John Lamont MP, one of Jeremy Hunts original backers in his bid to become Prime Minister, went further: ldquoThere is no case for scrapping the Barnett formula. Boris said it was reckless of David Cameron to commit to keeping the Barnett formula. The only thing reckless would be scrapping it.ldquoThis is yet another reason that Jeremy is the Prime Minister that Nicola Sturgeon doesnrsquot want. Boris should u-turn immediately and follow Jeremy in pledging to keep the Barnett formula. That is whatrsquos best for Scotland and the Union.Senior Scottish Tories are worried that Johnson could end up backing a no-deal Brexit as Prime Minister, an outcome they fear would provide an electoral boost to the SNP. A majority of Tory MSPs, including Scottish leader Ruth Davidson, are backing Hunt.In a challenge to Johnson, Davidson told the BBC last week: ldquoI want to see him make assurances that itrsquos not Brexit do or die, itrsquos the Union do or die. Thatrsquos exactly what wersquove seen from the other candidate in the race and thatrsquos why hersquos going to get my vote.Johnsonrsquos press team did not respond to an email."},{"url":null,"title":"alex-salmond-unable-to-attend-holyrood-anniversary-event","story":"The Parliament said Alex Salmond, who was charged earlier this year with attempted rape, was ldquounable to attend the gala event, but offered no more details.The Queenrsquos speech in the Holyrood chamber, part of an event to mark the twentieth anniversary of devolution, was made in front of serving and former MSPs.Scotland was run by a Labour and Liberal Democrat coalition in the first eight years of the Parliament, following which there have been terms of minority and majority SNP rule.Salmond was First Minister between  and  and his time in office was marked by some of the most notable episodes of devolution, such as the independence referendum.However, after losing the referendum he was replaced by protege Nicola Sturgeon and he ed to Westminster.His relationship with the Government he used to lead hit rock bottom last year after civil servants investigated allegations of sexual harassment against him when he was in office.Although the Government probe was judged to be illegal, he was later charged with  offences: nine charges of sexual assault, two of attempted rape, two of indecent assault and one of breach of the peace. He strenuously denies any criminality.All three former First Ministers - Salmond, Henry McLeish and Jack McConnell - were invited to yesterdayrsquos event, but only McLeish was present.A Scottish Parliament spokesperson said: ldquoAs is customary, all of the former First Ministers were invited to the ceremony.

But she couldnrsquot find a guide online that was helpful ndash so she decided to get out there and start compiling her own list, and then to put that on a blog, which went on to become the site Dugs nrsquo Pubs.ldquoIt started off, she says, ldquoas a really small blog and it just grew from there. Now,  years later, it is a popular app as well as website and, in Edinburgh alone, there are more than , of the ldquodugs welcome stickers she sends out to businesses that want to advertise the fact that dogs may come in. Dugs nrsquo Pubs is a phenomenon that has spread so the site now covers not just Scotland, but parts of the rest of the UK.What she has noticed over those  years is a sht in perception among businesses. ldquoWhen I started, I worked really hard, locally, to get the word out to businesses that they could allow dogs in. Because a lot of businesses believed that they werenrsquot allowed to let dogs in everybody just used to say, lsquoOh itrsquos hygiene lawrsquo. I actually investigated that. The law was there to say you can allow dogs in ndash just not in a food preparation area. So I spent a lot of time letting businesses know that this is the law.Courting the pooch pound also seems to work for business. In Scotland, % of us own a dog, and all together, in the UK, we spend around pound. billion on dogs yearly. ldquoWhat the businesses told me, says Matthews, ldquowas that when they let people in with dogs those people tend to stay, they tend to have lunch, they tend to come back. I think they have realised therersquos a huge market there of people who will be regulars and will spend money. It came at a time when businesses really needed it.Matthews has been part of changing that culture.ldquoWhat a lot of dog owners have said is that itrsquos the stickers that have really helped them, because in the past they would have been hovering around outside going ndash will we  But a sticker lets them know we can go in and wersquore welcome.For her, having dogs in pubs seems normal. ldquoI grew up in one, she says. ldquoPeople in my family have always run pubs and dogs were always in the pubs and we always had dogs. So for me that was what a pub was. A pub had dogs in.Whenever she sends out the stickers she puts in a covering note saying: ldquoThis sticker yoursquore putting up is not about dog tolerance. Itrsquos dogs welcomed ndash so dogs really do have to be welcomed in the pub, not just tolerated.She doesnrsquot like to reveal her favourites but says: ldquoBecause we lived in Stockbridge when we set it up, I do feel thatI was going to start out and I lived in Edinburgh and I wanted to go for a day out with my dog Irsquod probably start in Stockbridge. That was the heart of Dugs nrsquo Pubs. That was where it started.ldquoThe other one that is really close to my heart is Leith Walk. There are just so many great places there. I feel a real kinship with Leith and especially whatrsquos going on at the moment with Leith Walk, with the threat to it from developers. You want to support those areas.The bloggerTHE holidays are upon us and staycations are all the rage. Yoursquove got your new Herald On Sunday dog-friendly guide in your pocket, but just how easy is it to take your dog with you as you travel around Scotland Someone who knows very well the answer to this question is Samantha Grant, the woman behind the popular blog about a West Highland Terrierrsquos travels around the country, The Wee White Dug. She and her dug, Casper, have travelled theand breadth in a bid to tell a story of Scottish history.Theyrsquove taken the Jacobite steam train, stayed in a yurt, relaxed in five-star hotels, summited Munros, slept on the roof of a Land Rover in a tent on Skye, overnighted in a fishermenrsquos mission and visited the Neolithic tombs on Orkney. Theyrsquore even planning on staying on a fishing trawler. ldquoAll of it, she says, ldquoproperly dog-friendly. I wonrsquot take any special privileges. Casper has been a great front for me to share Scotland with the world but also show how dog-friendly it is. I try to show that travelling with a dog doesnrsquot hamper you in any way or form.Grant, an HR project manager, started out as an Instagrammer, taking photos of her travels around Scotland in which Casper would sometimes feature. She noticed that when he did, her followers rocketed up, and that ldquopeople seemed more interest in him than me. When a friend suggested she blog, she tried it.ldquoIt snowballed, she recalls. ldquoAfter a few months I was invited to run a competition for a whisky festival then a hotel got in touch askingI would come and stay.\"At first these emails were dropping in my mailbox and I thought they think Irsquom somebody  ndash it was a bit of imposter syndrome. Then he just became a known character. Itrsquos a wee bit surreal because hersquos got a huge fanbase.Recently, he was recognised by a couple from South Carolina while they were coming back from Mull on a ferry. ldquoPeople tend to recognise him from his natty Tweed bow ties.One of the most searched categories on the VisitScotland site is ldquopet friendly, and the tourist organisation even has its own Ambassadog, George. But Grant thinks Scotland has always been dog-friendly. ldquoIt is just that people probably have more disposable income these days for going out and eating out and that kind of stuff, so it has become more of a thing for businesses.Many unexpected places, she notes, are very dog-friendly. For instance, she describes a visit to the Camera Obscura in Edinburgh, in which Casper got ldquoreally excited in the mirror maze, although his wee wet nose was smearing their mirrors. The Westie also took a trip into the Tomb Of The Eagle on Orkney, riding on ldquoa wee skateboard. Hersquos been to Fingalrsquos Cave on Staffa, the Bass Rock and the steam ship Sir Walter Scott.One of the most ldquoamazing dog-friendly attractions, she says, is the Jacobite steam train. ldquoI have a picture of him standing in frontit which just went mad on social media. Therersquos never any time when I think it would be a lot easierI didnrsquot travel with him.These days, she says, she makes money out of the blog ndash but itrsquos not about that. ldquoItrsquos about the love of Scotland ndash thatrsquos why I studied Scottish history and Scots literature.

One of the projects south of the border promotes Muslim and minority women to take on leadership roles.The idea of the Lived Experience Leaders Pilot Programme is to put people with first-hand experience of social issues in a position to influence policy and services.With an award of pound,, the Scottish Recovery Consortium will establish a National Lived Experience Network across Scotland, while Inclusion Scotland is receiving pound, to bring together a group of disabled leaders.Michaela Jones is the National Lived Experience Officer for the Scottish Recovery Consortium and she says she hopes the support will ensure that noone has to lsquolose it allrsquo as she did when a lelong alcohol problem caught up with her .ldquoIf we continue to design systems and make policy decisions that do not take into account the voices of people who are directly impacted by those decisions, we will always be missing an important part of the puzzle, she says.ldquoThis award will enable us to work directly with people with Lived Experience and their families to ensure that they can bring their own unique perspective to the table. After all, we all want the same thing, for everyone to have the best chance of getting and staying well.In her eyes there is plenty that coculd be changed ofor the better in the system. ldquoI wasnrsquot ready for the level of discrimination I experienced - I was treated appallingly by the DWP.

Instead of simply being the subject of consultation there needs to be recognition of our role as change-makers and leaders.Mr Young added: ldquoWe are delighted to receive a grant for our Leaders with Lived Experience pilot project. We will use co-production methods to develop a leadership programme that works to promote lived experience leadership and remove the barriers to leadership development opportunities.Ms McGinn said: ldquoThe voices of those with lived experience have frequently been absent from important discussions such as those on assets, services and resources. This funding should help remedy that.

Hersquos had a succession of top  singles, a number one album and is reputed to be worth millions.But, just when you thought Glastonbury had nothing new to show you in a slot that in recent years has been filled by the likes of the Rolling Stones, The Who, Coldplay, Mumford and Sons and Ed Sheeran, Stormzy, only the second black Briton to headline Glastonbury, embodied that all too rare thing in the cultural landscape: the zeitgeist. Dressed in a stab-vest daubed with a faded Union Flag, designed by graffiti artist Banksy, he proceeded to unleash a performance of authority, intensity and authenticity which touched on kne crime, racism and inequality of opportunity.Just when you thought you had the measure of this set, it slammed on the brakes and turned  degrees, transforming into a ballet performed by a company of black dancers, highlighting the awful truth that only recently have they been able to buy ballet shoes that match their skin colour. It changed again, to a joyful summer party, then again to an on-stage church, compete with spine-tingling gospel choir, as the devout young musician praised God.This had it all ndash aggression and anger, humour and wit, virtuosic rapping and soulful singing ndash and it was presented with an astounding level of intelligence and accessibility. It didnrsquot matter a jot whether you liked or knew grime music even watching on television you felt the earth move. This was the moment black British culture flew to new heights.Indeed, the way this young man held the Glastonbury audience, which nowadays consists mainly of white, middle-class former indie-kids in their s and s, in the palm of his hand, was a sight to behold, and a much-needed reminder in these ided times that people from dferent races, ages and backgrounds can still come together.:Kylie Minogue in tears on Glastonbury One of the highlights came when this self-made embodiment of modern Britain led the audience in a chorus of ldquof*ck Boris, the man, lest we forget, who described black people as ldquopiccaninnies with ldquowatermelon smiles, and represents the privileged, insular arrogance that drives the toxic brand of Brexit that is dangerously engulfing parts of these islands.Irsquom sure armchair viewers up and down the country found themselves joining in with the chant, only adding to the irony that many more people chanted F-Boris with a rapper on Friday night than will vote him in as Prime Minister.There was predictable outrage in the right-wing press, feigned offence at the use of swear words against Johnson while the racist, sexist, homophobic language used by the former Mayor of London over many years has been either ignored, or even worse, excused. I donrsquot doubt many of Mr Johnsonrsquos supporters would cross the street to avoid young men who look like Stormzy.Whatrsquos also interesting about this sort of hypocrisy, of course, is that unlike Mr Johnson, Michael Omari, as he is known to his family, is a man of action as well as words. He not only talks and raps about his community and its challenges, but puts his money where his mouth is, creating a scholarship to fund black students through their studies at Cambridge and setting up his own book publisher, #Merky, part of Penguin, to give young people a voice in writing. He is also a prominent and active supporter of justice and compensation for the Grenfell Tower survivors.And while Mr Johnson arrogantly denies or ignores past mistakes, Mr Omari has had the maturity and courage to admit and atone for his, including homophobic tweets posted at the age of . Put simply, Stormzy is already more of a role model than our future Prime Minister will ever be.And by using his  to change the conversation around young black men ndash as , adoring white, middle-class people standing in a field in Somerset will attest ndash he is contributing far more to society than music.Stormzyrsquos headline performance will go down as one of the most spectacular and assured in Glastonburyrsquos -year history.

Edinburgh was full of colour and noise, and there was a real sense of hope and expectation. Donald Dewar’s speech in the parliament’s first chamber was one of those moments where the hair stood up on the back of your neck. In my view – as someone in a dferent party to Donald, with very dferent views on the ultimate destination for Scotland – that speech was one of the finest speeches in modern Scottish history.How much of a privilege is it to run the country and how dficult is the top job There’s no doubt that being First Minister of Scotland has been the privilege of my le.

And like many people in senior positions, particularly women, I have had moments of self-doubt but I believe it’s important to be open about that and to be a role model to young people. But more than anything, I am grateful to have the opportunity to help make Scotland a better place to live.What is the Parliament’s biggest achievement in the last  years  Twenty years on there are so many achievements that we can be proud of, and that have made Scotland a better place to live, work, study and grow up in. From free personal care to the abolition of tuition fees, the ban on smoking in public places, a minimum pricing for alcohol and the introduction of equal marriage. There’s a long, long list of these inidual policies that wouldn’t have happenedwe hadn’t had a Scottish Parliament.Across the world there are other countries now looking to Scotland to learn from the globally ground-breaking things we’ve done on public health, on tackling climate change, and on the work we’re doing around renewable energy.But above any inidual policy, there is a much more fundamental achievement, and that is that,  years on, the parliament has reinvigorated Scottish democracy and become an accepted, established part of Scottish le. We should all take great pride in that.What has been the most dficult challenge the Parliament has faced and you personally The sad and unexpected death in  of Donald Dewar – the man who had driven through the Scotland Act and then become the first First Minister – was no doubt a moment of great uncertainty for all MSPs in the early days of the Parliament.On a personal level, I’d have to say assuming the office of First Minister was my biggest challenge. Despite having spent  years in frontline politics, and seven as Deputy First Minister, nothing can prepare you for the moment where suddenly you are the last word, where there is no longer anyone above you to seek a second opinion on somethingyou want it – everyone is looking to you.What is your most memorable moment There have been many memorable moments. The passage of the Equal Marriage Act and the Minimum Pricing legislation are two key ones for me. I also think the referendum campaign has to be one of them. It not only saw Parliament at its best – with robust debates and intense scrutiny – but also sparked an enormous outpouring of democratic engagement across the country. Although the result didn’t go the way I wanted, the legacy of a more politically involved country is one we should all cherish.I have a lot of memorable moments. It’s not the famous names or the big events, but the stories I hear from iniduals around the country that inspire me. I’ve spent a lot of time lately listening to the le experiences of Scotland’s care experienced young people. Their stories will stay with me forever and drive me to improve their lives and opportunities.In  years’ time, how do you hope the Parliament will have evolved It should evolve in line with the way people in Scotland want it to. The Parliament was established in large part because of the democratic deficit that opened up during  years of a Tory government which became more and more unpopular in Scotland. Despite devolution, Brexit in particular has demonstrated that Westminster is willing to ignore the views of people in Scotland and disregard votes of the Parliament. I have absolutely no doubt that by  we will have completed the powers of the Parliament and become an independent country. That means we will have established a genuine partnership of equals with the rest of the UK and will have ensured that people in Scotland always get the governments they vote for.Are there any people you would like to thank We should never ever forget those who campaigned for decades to see a Scottish Parliament – many of whom never lived to see it become a reality.Then there are those who have worked tirelessly behind the scenes. We couldn’t do our job without the work of the parliament staff, led by the Parliament’s chief executive, Sir Paul Grice, who recently announced he was moving on to a new job after  years. He might not be well-known by the wider public but, as someone who was there from the very beginning, all MSPs and staff owe him an enormous debt of gratitude.For me personally, I certainly would not be where I am today without the support of my mum and dad and my husband Peter.Everyone is invited to join the partySaturday, June ,  is gearing up to be a great day.From am to noon, the Queen will address Parliament and each of the party leaders will speak in response. The audience will include those young people who were born in  as well as finalists from a competition for student film-makers who produced a short film on the impact the Scottish Parliament has had in their area. There will also be a number of performances celebrating the best of Scotland’s culture and music and the Makar will perform a new piece of work.In the afternoon, the Parliament will open its doors for a day of celebration – a party everyone is invited to join from pm to pm.There will be a chance to sit in the Presiding Officer’s seat and see how it feels to take charge, as well as retro games like giant Jenga, Kerplunk and space hoppers. There will also be live music, dancers, face painting and caricaturists.And of course, there will be birthday cake and food too. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: “It will be a great day, full of colour and energy. Parliament always does these events well and brings in so many people from across Scotland. “I hope we spend the day not just looking back on what has been achieved, but focused on the work the parliament still has to do.“The public are often sceptical of politicians, but I hope people across the country will reflect on how far we’ve come with the parliament and the dference it has already made to so many people’s lives.”"},{"url":null,"title":"nicola sturgeon the scottish parliament s greatest achievements","story":"The Scottish Parliament will celebrate its th anniversary today .Her Majesty the Queen will take part in the th anniversary celebrations today, with the iconic Parliament building in Edinburgh being open from pm to pm for visitors to join in the birthday celebrations.And in an exclusive QA, Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told us what she believes the Parliament’s top  greatest achievements are.The country’s top politician also shared her thoughts on Brexit and the future, sounding a note of caution for the UK’s next Prime Minister.Here, in her own words, Nicola walks us through the Parliament’s success story...Right from its earliest years, the Scottish Parliament showed that it was ready to take policy decisions substantially dferent to those at Westminster to help build a better country.A clear early example of this was the introduction of free personal care for the elderly. This was a substantial commitment but was vital for Scotland’s long term interests, preparing ourselves for the challenges of an ageing population. We’ve recently extended free personal care to cover all those who are assessed as needing it, no matter their age.MSPs also charted a dferent course when, following a change of administration in , parliament voted to scrap tuition fees in Scotland, restoring Scotland’s long and proud tradition of free education.Similarly, the decision to abolish prescription charges brought to an end what was little more than a tax on ill health. The NHS of course is the greatest, and most valued, example of a universal service where care is provided on the basis of need and not ability to pay. Our health service, like others across the world, faces challenges. But it is a real achievement of the Scottish Parliament that we have resisted the marketization moves south of the border while ensuring that under the current government Scotland’s AE departments are the best performing in theUK.On other occasions, the Parliament has led the UK in making bold policy choices, such as the ban on smoking in public places. Our Climate Change Act includedthe most ambitious emissions reduction targets of any legislature in the world and, as Health Secretary, I was heavily involved in the campaign to introduce a minimum unit price for alcohol, which we knew would play a key role in tackling Scotland’s unhealthy relationship with drink – another world leading measure.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.glasgowsouthandeastwoodextra webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"As the Scottish Parliament prepares to celebrate its th anniversary, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reflects on both its journey and her own.\"  First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reflects on  years of the Scottish Parliament viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"GLAS | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"GLAS | Article Teaser\"It took a decade of hard work to make this policy a reality and I am personally very proud of the campaign, working with stakeholders, to persuade MSPs to back minimum pricing, as well as overcoming a legal challenge that went all the way to the Supreme Court.I am personally committed to making sure every child and young person in Scotland gets the best possible start in le. We have already delivered an increase in free, high quality childcare for all three and four year olds and extending entitlement to eligible two year olds and will increase it further before the end of this parliament.Scotland has also become a much safer society under devolution. Recorded crime has fallen to some of the lowest levels seen since the s. In particular, non-sexual violent crime has fallen substantially, thanks in no small part to the excellent work of the Violence Reduction Unit, which was established over a decade ago with cross-party support and is now being copied across the UK.In recent years, new powers have come to the Scottish Parliament and with those powers come increased responsibilities for MSPs to deliver for the people ofScotland.Income tax policy is now a key feature of the annual Scottish budget. We’ve used these new powers to introduce a fairer income tax policy, with most people paying less tax than they would south of the border – while continuing to raise revenue to support investment in the economy and public services.Last year Parliament passed the wide-ranging Social Security Act, paving the way for devolution of a number of benefits, as well as creating a number of newbenefits such as increased carers’ support allowance and best start grants for families with young children – and a new social security agency to deliver them. This new agency has a culture of dignity and respect at its heart and early feedback from service users has been overwhelmingly positive.I also appointed the first gender balanced Scottish cabinet and we are encouraging more women to stand for parliament, and bring a better balance to ourpublic le.Over the course of the Scottish Parliament consistent action has been taken to ensure communities have the opportunity to own the land they live and work on.Many communities have benefited from the right to buy that now covers rural and urban communities.Of course, the foundation of our country is a strong and resilient economy. That’s why we have slashed or abolished business rates for , premises –saving almost £. billion for our small businesses.We have invested in our infrastructure with all governments building new schools and hospitals and, of course, the iconic Queensferry Crossing.And, to help make sure we have the workforce we need for years to come, we have delivered just over a quarter of a million Modern Apprenticeships in the lastdecade.In April this year, new legislation to tackle controlling and coercive behaviour came into effect, giving Scotland some of the most robust domesticabuse legislation in the world.I’m also proud of the many steps we’ve taken to make Scotland a fairer society, including the introduction of equal marriage rights – attending one of the first same-sex weddings in Scotland is a memory that will stay with me for a long time.And we all worked together over many years to help Glasgow successfully host the  Commonwealth Games. This helped to inspire Scots to get more active,delivered new facilities and put Scotland on the world stage. It was a sight to behold.My final achievement is perhaps harder to quanty. There is no doubt that the re-establishment of Scotland’s parliament has profoundly changed our political culture for the better, with our nation’s lawmakers much more accessible to those they represent. It has also enabled us to have conversations we wouldn’t have had and to debate our own future, with the  independence referendum generating an increase in democratic engagement.Looking ahead, we now face the signicant challenges posed by Brexit which, of course, Scotland’s people and parliament overwhelmingly oppose. Given the long-term damage that Brexit will cause to Scotland, and the material change in circumstances this represents, I believe it is only fair that people are given the choice of whether to become an independent country. Indeed, the current SNP Government was elected on a clear manesto commitment that people should be offered that choice should Scotland be taken out of the EU against its will. Polls consistently show that people living here believe the decision on whether to hold a referendum should be a matter for Holyrood and not Westminster. Twenty years after it came into being, that is an important measure of the way people in Scotland view the Parliament and one that the new UK Prime Minister would do well to heed."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"July ,  at : amPlans to enhance the main entrance to St Magnus Cathedral are due to go on display this week — with feedback invited from cathedral users and the wider Orkney community.

HIAL have note received any further proposals for strike action.Inglis Lyon, HIAL’s managing director said: “We are obviously disappointed that our latest offer has been rejected by Air Traffic Control Officers, despite enhancing our formal offer following last-minute discussions with Prospect.“It is unfortunate that the industrial action has been reinstated during the peak holiday period and I would like to apologise in advance to our passengers, customers and local communities for the disruption this will inevitably cause.“The offer was made within the parameters of the Scottish public pay policy in a bid to resolve the dispute to the satisfaction of both parties.  We have encouraged Prospect to meet and discuss an alternative solution within the flexibilities afforded to the company. We remain committed to resolving this dispute and a meeting with Prospect will take place on Thursday  July.”David Avery, Prospect negotiations officer, said: “Prospect members in HIAL have overwhelmingly rejected the revised pay offer made by HIAL. The work to rule which was suspended during the ballot will restart tomorrow, Saturday, June . Prospect will meet with representatives on Monday to consider the ballot result prior to a meeting with HIAL on Thursday to try and resolve this dispute and reach an offer which is acceptable.”Responding to news of the rejected pay offer Orkney MSP Liam McArthur said: “This is deeply disappointing news. The long-running industrial dispute has already caused serious disruption to those using our leline air services and this now looks set to continue. With a busy summer period now underway, the potential impact of this action is likely to be greater than ever.“What is abundantly clear is that absolutely no-one benefits from this damaging dispute. I, therefore, urge the unions and HIAL to get back round the table as soon as possible and find a solution.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This has been under constant review, some might say attack, since .#Commenting after the Coastguard Agency consultation meeting in Edinburgh yesterday, Thursday, on the future of emergency tug provision in the north of Scotland, Mr Carmichael said: “For the third time in nine years the Maritime Coastguard Agency is again consulting on future provision of emergency tugs and for the third time in nine years it looks like a botched job.“The consultants engaged by the MCA have been set tight and arbitrary deadlines.

We saw some cracking houses over the course of series one and there are far more gems to uncover for series two.”The first series of Scotland’s Home of the Year was broadcast on the new BBC Scotland channel in April and May this year.The series has since seen its audience continue to grow on iPlayer with requests to view so far hitting more than a quarter of a million – ,.The format saw three judges – architect Michael Angus, interior designer Anna Campbell-Jones and lestyle blogger Kate Spiers – travel theand breadth of Scotland to discover architectural gems and unearth some stunning interiors. Both traditional and contemporary properties were put under the microscope and judges considered everything from a one-bedroom apartment to a centuries-old country castle … and everything in between.Each home was scored on ality, distinctiveness and clever design and from seven finalists, one clear winner of series one was chosen – the White House in Kirkcudbright, Dumfries and Galloway, created by proud owner Lesley Smith and her late husband Mike.Series two will have a slightly longer run than series one with nine -minute heats, each featuring three properties from a specic part of the country. The  houses featured will then be whittled down to a final nine which will go under the spotlight in an hour-long final episode.Gerard Costello, executive producer, IWC Media said: “We are thrilled that Scotland’s Home of the Year is ing to the BBC Scotland channel.

There has to be a commitment to reducing the numbers of geese and not just keeping the population at its current level.“This means we need to see funding that lasts long enough to ensure that the measures take effect and that farmers have confidence that their concerns are being seriously addressed.“I will be closely monitoring the new measures being taken forward by SNH in the coming months and at the outcomes of SNH’s study on goose management in the islands.“I also look forward to hearing how the Minister intends to ensure that efforts going forward are sustained so that farmers in Orkney can have confidence that the Scottish Government are serious on dealing with the problem of excessive geese numbers”.Mr McArthur said that, while the announcement of measures was welcome, progress on the issue will take time and government must remain committed to finding a resolution.He said: “It is clear that the minister recognises the importance of tackling this issue and the scale of the challenge involved. While the package of measures announced by SNH today is welcome, it is also clear that it is going to take time to achieve the objective of bringing greylag goose numbers down to a sustainable level.“That is why it is so important that the Scottish Government now stays the course. Ongoing funding will be needed to support the work of the local management group and allow coordination to take place.#The minister agreed to look at ways in which this might be achieved and to come back with more detailed thoughts in due course.“I am encouraged by the developments today but also determined to make sure that this now translates into effective action to address what has been a long-running issue affecting Orkney’s farming community”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

One of the new measures is a study looking at how the birds# numbers could be brought down to .SNH have committed to supporting egg oiling and corralling activities, with an expert in corralling geese to visit the county to advise farmers on how this could be used and training for egg oiling being made available.Contractors will also be funded to carry out egg oiling at specic areas next season.As mentioned, a study will also be carried out to create an Orkney-wide plan to reduce geese numbers. According to SNH, this study will consider the practicalities, cost and location for a number of possible measures bring the birds# population down.SNH also elaborated on a previous announcement of an expansion to the licence to shoot the birds, with a new Orkney-specic licence to cover the period from February  to June  — outside the open shooting season and the time covered by the General Licence, which allows Greylag geese to be shot from July  to August  and during the open season from September  to January .This means farmers will no longer be required to apply to the SNH Licensing team for an out-of-season licence but can make a quick call to the Kirkwall office for permission.The new measures include volunteer shooters being available again this year in August and September to undertake goose control on farms which are experiencing issues with geese.SNH is considering further changes to licences, in particular, a mechanism to increase bag limits, and a possible extension to the General Licence, currently available in July and August, to include May and June.Finally, volunteer shooters will be available again this year in August and September to undertake goose control on farms which are experiencing issues with geese.Graham Neville, SNH’s Northern Isles and North Highland area manager, said: “We understand increases in greylag goose numbers have seriously impacted on farmers and crofters on Orkney. Working closely with the local goose management group, we have committed to measures that will help protect crops, while still maintaining the balance between conservation, farming and hunting.”News of support for these measures also followed an announcement earlier in the week that the sale of goose meat and funding have been extended in Orkney and the Western Isles, until the end of .copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The concern is that, although resurfacing and general maintenance continues to be done, this may not fix the issue in the long-term.OIC has now engaged a specialist team to look at the issue, who#ll be deploying state of the art equipment to take radar readings through the causeway down to sea level, providing valuable information on its deep make-up.This data will then be used to come up with options for short and long-term maintenance of the road, with general inspections and periodic minor repairs continuing until the results of the survey are fully considered.Due to the nature of the work, there will unfortunately be road closures and a convoy system in place on the evening of Monday  July. The work has been scheduled for between .pm and .pm to minimise disruption, by ensuring that traffic from the last Pentland Ferries arrival has passed through. Delays of up to  minutes are possible.The work will begin with coring taking place, which sees four small cylindrical sections of the road removed, analysed and then replaced. This allows the contractors to identy the make-up of the top layers of the road and calibrate their equipment accordingly.The second stage of the work sees a specialist vehicle driven at usual traffic speed across the barrier a number of times, taking video and radar footage as it moves.The third and final stage sees a piece of hand-pushed equipment moved across the barrier at walking speed taking Ground Penetrating Radardata of the full depth of the structure as it goes. The GPR system emits short duration pulses of electromagnetic energy. These pulses or scans are transmitted into the road and reflections from material boundaries or embedded featuresare detected by a receiver. Through analysis of the reflected signals a continuous D model of the Barrier can then be provided, determining material thickness and construction changes.  This should therefore determine what,any, underlying defects there are within the matrix of the causeway. The survey allows data to be taken down to depths of five metres.The video survey will provide a high resolution and spatially referenced video to enable the visual condition of the surface to be assessed to sub-metre accuracy. This will be matched with the GPR survey to produce a visual model to pinpoint anomalies in the surfacing.John Wrigley, OIC roads and environmental services manager said: #As a key element of Orkney#s travel network, we keep a keen eye on the state of this road.#Our ongoing monitoring has shown that the surface continues to deteriorate despite previous interventions — which would suggest that resurfacing is not going to fix the problem in the long-term.#We now need to carry out this important piece of work to seethere could be a more deep-rooted reason for the issues — which should lead us to an appropriate and cost-effective solution.##Previous survey work has given us detailed information on the top layers of the road, but this new survey will look deep into the construction for voids or other potential failures.  We apologise for the delays that this survey will cause on the night of  July # but we#re sure that local road users will understand that this is necessary as part of finding a long term solution to improving the structure of the road.  We#d ask that road users take their time in the vicinity on the night and would also take the opportunity to remind people of the mph advisory speed limit that already exists on the first Barrier.#East Mainland, South Ronaldsay and Burray councillor, Andrew Drever added: “I accept the concerns that have been raised over a period of time, particularly by motorcyclists, and I am pleased to see this piece of work getting underway.#Once we have the survey results, we’ll be able to look at options and hopefully find a way forward in a short a timescale as possible.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We understand it’s still an issue in some areas, with a dficult balance between conservation, farming and hunting.“Our goal is to give farmers and crofters the tools they need to safeguard their crops, by giving them the control to manage goose numbers sustainably through sport shooting, other control, or selling goose meat for profit.”The pilots are now being extended until the end of .

They have been locked in talks ever since amid deep isions over how best to balance political, geographic and gender considerations among the  member nations.With the selection process bogged down for the second EU summit meeting in a row, the leaders are still considering Dutch socialist Frans Timmermans to replace Christian Democrat Jean-Claude Juncker as president of the EUrsquos powerful executive arm, the European Commission. -- vw,vw,px, px\"European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker sits prior to a round table meeting at the EU summit in Brussels--ldquoLetrsquos see, Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said of Mr Timmermansrsquos chances when briefly descending from the meeting room at EU headquarters at around breakfast time.The Timmermans option has deeply ided the European Peoplersquos Partyas it would surrender the key post to the rival Socialists and Democratsbloc despite the EPP remaining the biggest group in the EU following last monthrsquos election.Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov, an EPP stalwart, posted a video on his Facebook account of a discussion with Mr Timmermans in which Mr Borissov said the Dutchman should get the commission job while the less coveted parliament presidency should go to EPP candidate Manfred Weber.But Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar insisted that the ldquovast majority of the EPP prime ministers donrsquot believe we should give up the presidency of the commission quite so easily, without a fight. -- vw,vw,px, px\"A journalist rests during the late-night negotiating session in Brussels--After negotiations started early on Sunday, summit host and EU Council president Donald Tusk had more than  bilateral meetings in his attempt to find a breakthrough.The appointments must take into account political affiliation, geography ndash balancing east and west, north and south ndash population size and gender. The leaders of EU institutions are supposed to impartially represent the interests of all member nations globally and in Brussels.Some leaders discussed the roster of upcoming vacancies, which also include the EUrsquos top diplomat, the president of the European Parliament and the chief of the European Central Bank , on the sidelines of the Group of  summit in Japan that concluded on Saturday.Mr Tusk wants nominations to be wrapped up soon, seeking to prevent further erosion of public confidence in the EU amid Brexit uncertainty and intra-bloc isions over managing migration. -- vw,vw,px, px\"European Council president Donald Tusk, left, with Renew Europe party member Guy Verhofstadt--There was hope at the previous summit on June - that more time would clary who should replace Mr Juncker. German Chancellor Angela Merkel backs Mr Weber, the German conservative whose centre-right EPP is the largest political group in the European Parliament but lost seats in the EU elections in May.French President Emmanuel Macron has suggested Mr Weber lacks the political and government experience for such a high-profile role.Mr Weber could still be considered for the head of the European Parliament, which is the EUrsquos only elected institution.Mrs Merkel said there was still a good possibility for Mr Weber and Mr Timmermans, the top centre-left candidate from the SD group, to be among the winners of the top positions.-- vw,vw,px, px\"German Chancellor Angela Merkel arrives for the EU summit--Other leaders from the same political family disagreed.The EPP and the SD are the two biggest political groups in the EU, but both lost seats in Mayrsquos polls, where far-right and populist parties, pro-business liberals and the Greens made gains.EU leaders want to fill the positions soon because the European Parliament is set to pick a new president next Wednesday.Under EU rules, member countries choose who will run the commission, replacing Mr Juncker. The parliament must endorse that choice. But the assembly has insisted that only the lead candidates from parties that ran in last monthrsquos elections should be eligible for the post.ldquoThe lead candidates is not the only criteria, said Mr Conte.The commission proposes and enforces EU laws on policies ranging from the massive single market to agriculture spending, and from competition issues to immigration. -- vw,vw,px, px\"European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker--The job responsibilities are huge: Mr Tusk and Mr Juncker negotiate with the likes of US President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping, while the head of the ECB can set monetary policy for the  nations that use the shared euro currency.The outgoing group of EU officials was lopsidedly Italian, with Antonio Tajani holding the parliament top post, Mario Draghi head of the ECB and Federica Mogherini the EU foreign policy chief.Top candidates include current prime ministers Stefan Lofven of Sweden and Andrej Plenkovic of Croatia. Others mentioned include Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier of France, Greens leader Ska Keller of Germany, Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite and Margrethe Vestager, the EUrsquos competition chief since .copy -.

Rob Dobson, director at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey, said: ldquoThe downturn in UK manufacturing deepened during June, as the impact of firms unwinding stockpiles built before the original Brexit date continued to reverberate through the sector and exacerbate weak demand.Business optimism slipped to its third-lowest level since the survey began in June, though % of respondents expected output to be higher in one yearrsquos time.New export orders declined for a third straight month due to softer global economic growth and persistent uncertainty over Brexit.As employers faced smaller workloads, job numbers went down for a third straight month.Duncan Brock, group director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement  Supply, said: ldquoThe sectorrsquos strength is slowly slipping away, deprived of the oxygen of a reduction in Brexit uncertainty and an associatedof confidence to the marketplace.ldquoAll the signs from the manufacturing sector point to another decline next month unless someone pulls a rabbit out of the Brexit hat.copy -.

Naturally enough it is a time for back-slapping by its performers and the exchange of self-congratulatory platitudes from those that think more government is good in itself, irrespective of whether expected outcomes are achieved or how ruinous the unintended consequences are.I am not of that ilk. I was sceptical of the proposed Scottish Assembly in  and therefore voted No in that referendum, and was not moved to change my mind in  and established the No-No campaign for that reason. Once Tony Blair defeated John Major in his landslide victory, there was no doubt that some form of devolution would happen, and so it came to pass. Given what has happened in Scottish politics from then, including a Tory wipe-out that took  years to correct , it must be fair comment to say Major’s premiership was the greatest threat to the Union to date.There is a tendency among nationalists and devolutionists to talk up one person or another , or one political event or another , as existential threats from which the UK must succumb. This is practically always arrant nonsense that should come with big flashing red lights asking, “What are the author’s motives ”The monumental lack of self-awareness or contemptuous arrogance of our political bettersresults in routine claims by the First Minister and other SNP hacks that this or that right-wing bogeyman of the day is a threat to devolution or the use of powers by the Scottish Parliament. The fact that the SNP understood, correctly, that devolution was a unionist political concept designed to halt the growth of nationalism and was not supportive of it until the final slam-dunk confirmatory referendum has been lost in the euphoric mists of time. One example of a nonsense claim is the idea that Johnson is such a bad prospect for Prime Minister that the Scottish public would no longer support remaining in the UK were he to win his party’s leadership election and become PM. Yet Johnson was a better mayor of London than Theresa May was a Prime Minister – by a country mile. Boroughs such as Lambeth and Hackney did not rise up and revolt, wishing to secede. No, Johnson was re-elected, while May has literally been run out of town for her repeated political deceit, failure to listen and regular failure in policy delivery. If the Union can survive May’s off-the-scale ineptitude, then Johnsonshould be able to achieve a Boris Bouncethat initially strengthens rather than weakens the general belief in the Union. What happens next is beyond anyone’s ken.Asto demonstrate my point, both Hunt and Johnson are making efforts to show how their potential premiership would be good for Scotland’s place in the UK. Given the potential that Brexit offers for ing decision-making more locally, not just to Westminster but to Holyrood, and given that there is at long last a recognition that far more needs to be done and branded as the benefits of UK economic or social support, one could be forgiven for believing that the Union could become much stronger, following a deal or a no-deal Brexit.Johnson was right to point out that,the EU referendum result is not respected, then the corresponding blow to democracy that it represents is also a blow to the Union. For those Scottish constituencies that produced a strong Leave vote, such as Moray and Banff  Buchan, and then unseated their SNP MPs with Tory replacements, a failure to leave the common fisheries policy would surely be viewed as a second British betrayal that wouldthem to the SNP fold. In that respect Hunt’s greater support for May’s disastrous Withdrawal Agreement must surely count against his unionist credentials.After  years of the Scottish Parliament, both Hunt and Johnson feel they have to talk about how they will defend the Union. Surely this is a recognition that the unionist devolution project has failed in one of its core aims of providing stability in the UK by reducing the attraction of nationalism through greater decentralisation. Many of the ideas coming forward have merit but where are the ideas for decentralising from Holyrood – or repealing the many new Scottish laws that can be shown to have been damaging or counterproductive to the claims made of them  While English politicians are being creative in an attempt to strengthen the Union, very few Scottish politicians are even willing to admit devolution is deficient and requires a completely new and realistic attitude towards self-criticism.Devolution has not bound the country closer together, but instead has allowed nationalists to push us apart. It is not so much that the UK is more ided, as Scotland is ided more itself. Never have Scottish people been so pitched against each other and never has the nation been so ungoverned by its ruling class than it has been under devolution.A final observation is that,the Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party leaders honestly believe that the Union comes before everything, they should look at their own party name to see it is they who are riding two horses. Is theirs a Conservative Party in Scotland that just happens to be historically unionist or a genuine unionist party that draws from the well of practical politics and therefore does not take sides in the Tory-Labour ide If it is Conservative “and” Unionist they should recognise that crafting Conservative policies cannot always put unionism first some might have benefits for the Union but others might carry some risks to it that require mitigation, for the policies will not be defined by their unionism but by their Conservatism . If Ruth Davidson runs a unionist party she should have learned from the more nuanced and taciturn Arlene Foster, who quite rightly – as a unionist first – has declined to take sides in the Tory leadership contest. Political consistency aside, Davidson would then more easily be able to craft a sincere working relationship with a prime minister who publicly was only her third choice – or never her choice at all.Brian Monteith is an MEP-elect for the Brexit Party.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"scotland s national cycle path is a huge missed opportunity says lesley riddoch","story":"Poor maintenance and design means ournational cycle path is a huge missed opportunity, writes Lesley RiddochDoes Scotland have the worst national cycle path in the UK Despite efforts to become an active nation, it seems we do.

As well as coming under attack from the SNP, Mr Johnson faced pressure from the Scottish Conservatives, with a spokesman saying the formula “works for Scotland and works for the UK”, adding: “Any candidate must commit to it or set out a very detailed plan for an upgrade”.The SNP accused Mr Johnson of “gimmicks” and said the Conservative government was “plotting” to use Brexit as an opportunity to impose further cuts on the Scottish budget.A spokesperson for Mr Hunt said: “The Barnett formula is essential to protect Scotland’s public services. That’s why a government run by Jeremy would maintain it, to help ensure Scotland’s schools and hospitals get the funding they need.”Borders MP John Lamont, who is running Mr Hunt’s campaign in Scotland, said support for the Barnett formula “shouldn’t even be a dficult question”.“There is no case for scrapping the Barnett formula,” Mr Lamont said. “The only other people who want to get rid of it are the SNP by iding the UK.”A source close to the Johnson campaign later said he had no plans to change the formula.Mr Hunt also came under pressure over his willingness to proceed with a no-deal Brexit, despite having said he put the Union ahead of leaving the EU. Speaking on the BBC’s Andrew Marr show, Mr Hunt insisted that delivering Brexit and protecting the Union were “compatible”.Writing in The Scotsman today, Douglas Ross, Conservative MP for Moray, said that Mr Johnson was “passionate” for Scotland to “grow and prosper” and that he understood “the political sensitivities” of the country.Mr Johnson’s comments on the Union came before a hustings he is due to attend in Scotland this week, when his attitude to the Barnett formula will come under the spotlight, and as a Panelbase poll revealed that opposition to a second Scottish independence referendum in the near future was reducing. Polls have also suggested most Scots would vote to leave the UKMr Johnson became prime minister. He has a personal approval rating in Scotland of minus .Mr Johnson has previously said the Barnett formula was “deeply inequitable” and was a “system of amazing political antiquity by which the English taxpayer sends about £ billion every year to Scotland as a kind of present”.He has also said that a pound spent in Croydon was worth more than a pound spent in Strathclyde in terms of economic generation, and that more jobs would be created in Scotland by investing in London, adding “ it causes Celtic wailing then I’m willing to go there and make the case that it’s right for them too”.Yesterday the SNP demanded the Tories immediately rule out widescale funding cuts for public services in Scotland.SNP MSP Tom Arthur said: “It is outrageous that the Tories are now plotting to use Brexit as an opportunity to railroad systematic cuts to Scotland’s budget – offering a grim insight into what Scotland can expect from the next Tory prime minister.“The Tories have longed for the opportunity to hammer Scotland’s budget for years – but the people of Scotland won’t stand by while Westminster politicians plot to cut money from our vital public services to fund their disastrous no-deal Brexit.“Yet again the mask has slipped and fatally undermined the Tories’ attempts to portray themselves as working in Scotland’s best interests.”He added: “Boris Johnson’s latest scheme to appoint the next Tory leader as Minister of the Union is simply laughable – voters will see this meaningless gimmick for what it is.”However, a source close to Mr Johnson’s campaign hit back, saying: “There’ll be no change to the Barnett formulaBoris wins the leadership of the \u2028Conservative and Unionist Party and becomes Prime Minister. “For the SNP to suggest otherwise shows a hitherto unseen level of desperation and underlines just how much they would fear a Conservative and Unionist Party led by Boris.”In his interview Mr Johnson insisted he was prepared to borrow to finance “great objectives” at the same time as \u2028cutting taxeshe succeeds Theresa May, stressing he would “keep fiscal responsibility”.On proroguing Parliament to push through Brexit, Mr Johnson said he did not want to do it nor expected to – but kept the option on the table.Yesterday Mr Hunt also said he would be prepared to pursue “with a heavy heart” a no-deal Brexit despite the risks to business and said some of his spending pledges would be delayed as a result, although he would push on with a cut to corporation tax.Mr Hunt sought to maintain a tough-sounding approach to Brexit, including a warning he could refuse to pay part of Britain’s £ billion exit bill to the EUnegotiations fail, while repeating that he believes he can secure a deal.Mrs May criticised Mr Johnson’s “do-or-die” attitude to the Brexit deadline.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"div","story":"A DIVE vessel with  women on board was escorted into port after she began taking in water off Shetland on Sunday. issued a mayday call in bad weather soon after midday when she was approximately eight miles east of Sumburgh Head.

We came here to compete at a higher level away from our domestic season, our domestic league and we#ve experienced some great highs and we were almost there to get into that final.#On how hard it would be to get his players up for the bronze match on Friday, Main said it would be #tough#.He added: #The guys are hurting but I#ve asked them to pick themselves up – and pick themselves up quickly, this is just part of character rolling.#There#s a lot of positive to take away.

They will ask the Shetland Islands Council to declare a climate emergency, as Orkney Islands Council did earlier this year. raquoWhat an amazing turnout, thanks to everyone who participated. 👏🏻🙌🏻As long as people in power put the value of money ahead of anything then we will never cease to destroying the planet until mother nature herself decides for us. For the le of the planet no amount of money can compare to what mother nature gives us.Earth#s nemesis is our banking systems and what they represent.As the Bibles says Timothy ,  # For the Love of Money is the root of all kinds of evil #.I#d very much like to read the rest of Johan Adamson#s comment but can#t find it here.Involving children in the spread of propaganda mirrors the ways of Chairman Mao and his #cultural revolution#. It is an increasing trend in UK and one we should surely reject.So, instead we should indoctrinate them in the ways of continued, pointless consumerism that is managing to waste resources and destroy the environment  Why is this behaviour any more #normal#  These are intelligent young people who know their own minds, ones who can be bothered to get up and make their voices heard.I didn#t advocate consumerism though. Children should not be pushed into anything, including consumption.The reason the older generation are skeptical, they#ve seen it all before.You#ve been reading the Mail again, Ali!For goodness sake, Brian, learn some basic simple science and stop the socialist dogma. Daily Mail!! grow up. Ask yourself the following question, how does today#s GlobalWarming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age  Anyone who cannot answer that question is too ignorant to hold an informed opinion on today#s climate change.Stops PC Plod and the band of merry men, from going in with batons to quell the grown-ups waffling on about, why their leader Comrade Corbyn inspires them with his words.How about giving them a half decent education concentrating on sciencesubjects. Then they would have an informed and considered opinion, not just the usual Greenwash so popular with the ignorant. If gted they may even go on to contribute with useful research and technological ideas so unlike are present green, ignorant and wholly ill-informed flock in thecouncil chamberAn area of industry which has not been looked into with any proper statistical information is thisof Agriculture. This industry produces more green house gases than the all of transportation. In fact, it is several times greater than transportation. The catch  scenario is this industry has had no regulation or legislation is regard to reducing greenhouse gases, infact, due to population growth, the pollution created by agriculture is vastly on the increase. Technology has played its part, but it is a situation where reducing pollution is very, very dficult to achieve given the nature of the industry itself. As the population increases, this will become more relevant in terms of the overall pollution created, and no doubt, something will have to be done. Whether sea based farming of certain foods may reduce the pollution, but much of agriculture is still based on land and the production of meat will still create problems related to greenhouse gases in terms of land used for meat production and or crop production as well. It is a dilemma which will become more relevant as the population increases.I can assure you these bairns weren#t pushed into anything. They were toldthey wanted to go they had to complete a form. One of mine wanted to go, the other didn#t. One asked a question at the Town Hall and I am very proud # not that she had to protest # but that she had the courage to do so, and silence many there.Well done young folk # out of the mouths of babes as they say.It hardly takes any courage to join a protest, especially one being encouraged and congratulated onby so many folk! The courage comes from not following the crowd herd and forming an independent and educated view. Jumping headlong onto the bandwagon is easy, understanding the science and striving to do something about it the hard bit. Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid.Especially a meaningless strike from school, what child would not love a day off among mates  No doubt the pig ignorant and stupid will be so impressed. A bit like supergluing yourself tp a bus or train, outstanding!!!I didnt say it took courage to join a protest, I said it takes courage to speak at the Town Hall. Andit was about time off school, they all would have gone. Please have more respect for our bairns and young folk.And these bairns are, for your information, studying the stem subjects at school.Whether by accident or design this provides a very convenient fig leaf for the council#s lamentable performance on child poverty.Much was made of the #children#s march# at the SIC#s education committee meeting today however in a news report about the part of the same meeting that dealt with the council#s child poverty action report, it was clear that the council have done next to nothing since the Shetland Inequalities Commission reported in March .know. All these admirable young citizens are guilty of is taking a stand based on commonly accepted information. I could ask what special knowledge does Ian think he has that allows him to lord it over them# but nerves fail me.On Ian’s earlier point, it is self-evident thatwe need some people with a high level of competence in STEM subjects who can take critical stand on matters scientic. Gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included! Learners on this path can also become alert to common logical fallacies. Even those who like Ian, with a preference for physical sciences, can benefit. Happily don’t need to be much of a scholar to spot an ad hominem attack. With all due respect for Ian’s past achievements in the physical sciences, it would be nicehe could make his points without belittling others #kids included. That’s a normal standard “of decency and tolerance” btw.I so agree with these word #gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included!#.

It is a time to reflect on le, listen to beautul songs, and a prayer session is also available afterwards for those who wish to get involved in that.“I think with the issues of addictions with drugs and alcohol becoming more of an issue in North Belfast, the Divine Mercy group offers something dferent to anyone who is seeking help.“Whatever is going on in your own le or your family’s le,your son or daughter is suicidal or has addiction problems, I would encourage you to come along to the Divine Mercy group.“There is help available, which is why people come back. It’s an outlet for people also and a comfort zone for them. The Divine Mercy gives these people hope.“There are young lads coming here who are broken in their lives. The reason we can draw them in is because we are all from dferent backgrounds and we are able to reach out to them.”One of the great successes of the Divine Mercy group has been the regular Cursillo residential weekends in Benburb.The Cursillo runs from a Thursday evening to a Sunday afternoon with participants able to meet people and explore their faith further in a serene and spiritual environment.Hugh Byrne, another key figure in the Divine Mercy group, said the Cursillo is a le-changing experience for those involved.“After three days, they are dferent people. It is truly a le-changing experience and I have seen that with people over the years.”Hugh is also responsible for talking to anyone who comes to the Divine Mercy group in order to offer help and advice.“I sit and have a chat with the lads every week,” he added.“If I get them to listen, that is the start. If we help turn one person’s le around, that is better than none.“I ask them how far they are in their addiction whether it would be alcohol or drugs.“Some people have fallen away but there have been a lot of successes. Relationships and marriages have been fixed and people have turned their lives around.“We also have good links with rehabilitation services and other helplines to point people towards further help.”At last Friday’s meeting, the group were joined by some American visitors who ed to Belfast a year on from experiencing the Divine Mercy group for the first time.Thomas says the success of the group has been extremely encouraging and a sign that they are on the right path.“It was great to see the visitors from the USA who were here last year and wanted to come back over again,” continued.“They are going back to spread the word about the work the group does.“The group can only get better. We started with just three people so we have come a long away in quite a short time.“People are coming back so we must be doing something right.“We have the prayers and so on and then we come out and sit and have tea, coffee and biscuits. It is great to see everyone bonding and talking to each other.“People don’t realise how powerful the Divine Mercy is. It doesn’t matter what is going on in your le.

No formal or transparent selection process was used in her selection for appointment nor was she given a written contract of employment, statement of main terms and conditions or job description.During , following several years of signicant growth, the firm decided to consider promotions from associate solicitor grade to salaried partner. Mrs Mercer and two other colleagues were promoted to salaried partner later that year.However, the following year, when she applied for promotion to the role of an equity partner, she was told she did not meet the eligibility criteria. Mrs Mercer did not find out about the promotions of her comparators at the time they took effect on June , , because they had not been announced internally. Instead she learned about them around  through what she described as the \"office rumour mill\". When she enquired about applying for promotion to the next stage, she was informed that there would be no more movement in the firm for the foreseeable future.Mrs Mercer flagged ious issues about her pay during  and  and the fact that promotions were taking place without any formal or transparent selection process.In June  she informed one of firms partners that she wanted to be paid the same salary as her male comparators and to have her bonus calculated on the same terms as theirs. Mrs Mercer was later told that the firm had decided to defer the issue of her salary and bonus until the end of the financial year as part of a wider review of business and salaries. Following this she lodged an internal grievance, seeking equal pay with her comparators on the ground that she was performing like work with them. Her grievance was rejected as the firm was of the view that her work as a salaried partner was \"not as demanding as that of a salaried partner benefiting from a profit share arrangement\". The legal practice accepted that Mrs Mercer was receiving less remuneration than her male colleagues but did not accept that she was undertaking like work with them. It contended that, although she and her male counterparts were all qualied solicitors, there were signicant dferences in the work they and Mrs Mercer were undertaking both in respect of legal work and other responsibilities.In addition, the respondent contended that,Mrs Mercer proved that she was undertaking like work with her comparators, there were genuine material factors which were not the dference of sex and which explained and justied any dferences in pay.The tribunal found that Mrs Mercer was employed on like work with all her comparators going back six years to June .The firm was ordered to pay her £, in respect of the dference between her gross annual salary of £, and the modied amount of £, going forward. She will also receive £, arrears of annual salary falling six years before the date of her claim in June  along with interest of £, on arrears."},{"url":null,"title":"high do mla claire sugden and beau get married in clifftop ceremony","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Mr Cooper himself believed that the events of that day  years ago irretrievably changed the course of history in Northern Ireland.Another stalwart of the Civil Rights era in Derry, Dermie McClenaghan said: “Ivan was one of the most courageous people I have ever known. In the context of the Civil Rights struggle in the north, to say that he went out on a limb is hardly enough.”A Book of Condolence in honour of Ivan Cooper was also opened at the Guildhall yesterday by Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council Michaela Boyle.Ivan Cooper’s funeral service will take place at St Peter’s Church of Ireland tomorrow at noon and his remains will be interred at Altnagelvin Cemetery afterwards.Mr Cooper is survived by his we Frances, daughters Sinead and Bronagh, son-in-law Conor and grandchildren Cashel and Luca.Ivan Cooper hailed from Kilaloo near to village of Claudy in County Derry just a few miles from the city. Born into a working-class Protestant family in January , Mr Cooper’s family moved to Derry’s Bogside when he was around -years-old.He was briefly a member of the Claudy Young Unionist Association, but in April of  he joined the Northern Ireland Labour Party .His first foray into electoral politics also came in  when he stood as a NILP candidate at the Stormont general election. Although he attracted a good degree of cross community support, he wasn’t elected.Ivan Cooper’s lelong commitment to non-violence as a political methodology made him a natural character to fit within the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association .

One of his first major public pronouncements came in the summer of that year and characterised the fundamental principles of the entire movement.At a protest meeting in the foyer of the Guildhall he said that Protestants and Catholics should stand up for their rights together “as the blacks in America were fighting.”The unication of people away from their religious denominations would remain the dominant feature of Ivan Cooper’s political activism throughout his  years. He was convinced that both communities in Northern Ireland could work together for common goals. However, some within the Protestant and unionist community viewed this stance as nationalist in outlook and tainted him as a traitor.Nevertheless, Ivan Cooper continued his agitation based on the Civil Rights  and after the RUC attack on the October  march in , he ignored a month-long Stormont government ban on parades in Derry.However, following violence after a number of marches in the city, Cooper called for an end to spontaneous demonstrations. As confrontations between demonstrators and the RUC continued to escalate in early  after a People’s Democracy march was attacked at Burntollet, residents of the Bogside cordoned the area off with barricades.Whilst Ivan Cooper managed to persuade locals to dismantle the barriers, the chances of redeeming an already tense political situation had probably already gone. As the sectarianism he had fought so hard to keep at bay crept steadily back into the issues at hand, most Protestant people who had supported NICRA backed away from the movement.At the Northern Ireland general election of , Cooper was elected as an Independent MP for Mid-Derry and in doing so unseated the sitting Nationalist Party representative Paddy Gormley.The Battle of the Bogside began on August ,  after violence erupted following the annual Relief of Derry parade by the Apprentice Boys.As the first of three days of fighting grew increasingly heavy, Cooper attempted to restrain rioters by linking arms with Eddie McAteer and John Hume. As the trio were swept aside by the advancing crowd, Cooper was knocked unconscious by a brick.In August , Ivan Cooper became one of the founding members of the SDLP with John Hume, Paddy Devlin and Gerry Fitt. After Stormont was prorogued in , he was again elected as one of the representatives from Mid Ulster to the Northern Ireland Assembly in . After the power sharing administration tumbled in the face of the Ulster Workers Council Strike in , Cooper was again elected to the Northern Ireland Constitutional Convention in .He was also the SDLP candidate for the constituency at both Westminster elections in . In the first one in February that year, he succeeded in splitting the nationalist vote and as a result caused the defeat of Independent MP Bernadette McAliskey.After boundary changes created the Foyle constituency in , Cooper stood aside to let John Hume have a clear run at claiming the seat. After this point, the overall political situation characterised as it was by ever increasing levels of violence, saw Ivan Cooper gradually withdraw from politics and concentrate more on his accountancy work."},{"url":null,"title":"temperatures sore ensure pets stay cool","story":"With temperatures predicted to go as high as  degrees today, dog owners are being urged to pay extra attention to their pets.The RSPCA says it receives many enquiries and reports about the welfare of animals over the summer months, particularly when its very hot.

OrsquoHare and Diarmuid OrsquoConnor exchanged points before Keegan and Ciaran Treacy finished the job in added time.Mayorsquos five-point winning margin was a bit flattering and the final result would have been so much more dferent had Down taken all their chances.Downrsquos season is now over, but Tally has laid the foundations for better things to come.Saturdayrsquos defeat may well have been the last game in a Down shirt for a few of the sidersquos older players as there is a plethora of young players just waiting to get their chance and Tally seems to be the man to give them that opportunity.Down: R Burns, D OrsquoHagan, B McArdle, G Collins, R McAleenan, K Kernan, D Guinness, J Flynn, C Poland, C Francis, C Mooney , P Laverty, P Havern , D OrsquoHare , C Harrison .

Cousinstalks to site manager Garret WalshGranted, my visit took place on a glorious summer’s day with only a little wind to put the turbines through their motions, yet as the -metre blades of the six wind turbines rotatedaround me, the only noise I could hear was the bleating of sheep who grazed in the shadow of the mighty machines.Site manager Garret Walsh, said: “It’s a wind farm on a working farm. We try to be as low impact as possible..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p “We rent the land from the land owners. They continue to farm it. It’s a very positive relationship. At the end of the day it’s a commercial relationship, but it does help an awful lotyou’re friends with your neighbours.”The site is unmanned though it is Garret’s responsibility – as a CGN Europe Energy employee – to ensure the turbines are always at the ready to take advantage of optimum wind conditions: “Our job is to make sure the place runs safely and efficiently. We do a quarterly inspection, realistically we’re here more often than that.”Garret inside the control roomIn its simplest form, the electricity generated by the wind which turns the blades of the turbines is transferred via , volt underground cables to CGN’s substation before being transferred to the adjoining NIE substation and then onto the grid at Carnmoney.Standing nearly  metres tall from base to the tip of blade, the Enercon-manufactured turbines are made of steel and held in place by reinforced concrete foundations.Each turbine at Carn Hill produces . megawattsof energy, a total of . MW for the site. Although electricity needs are dependent on season, that is roughly enough energy to power , homes for a year.Garret explained the wind conditions needed to generate electricity: “The faster the wind is blowing the more electricity is generated.Carn Hill site manager Garret Walsh and NIRIGs Meabh Cormacain at the wind farm“They start to generate electricity at around eight or nine miles per hour.“These turbines don’t have a gearbox. You can’t step up the ratio so you can generate electricity at lower wind speeds.“When the wind gets up past  miles per hour it has a safety cut off. You could be driving past a wind farm and it could be blowing a gale but the turbines aren’t turning. \"  \"  Reported  Years Ago : Wealthy young man dies in on Grand Tour of Europe Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“If it’s not turning it’s normally down to no wind or very high wind.One of the six turbines at Carn Hill wind farm near Carrickfergus“It’s like anything, you drive it too fast and it starts to fail.”Discussing the location of the wind farm and issues people have with the presence of large turbines on the landscape, Meabh Cormacain, manager of Northern Ireland Renewables Industry Groupsaid: “On shore wind farms need to be up high to make the most of the wind, Carn Hill in particular is one of the most visible wind farms in the UK given its location close to Belfast and sightline from North Down.” “There’s a lot of misinformation about wind farms that can be counteracted with the right information. There’s only one thing I can’t argue with. If people don’t like how they look, that’s fair enough. It’s quite subjective.“The turbines are designed to have a low visual impact, the paint is a sky-coloured shade of white, though not always the colour of skies you get here in Northern Ireland.“There are a fair amount of people who say the turbines are quite relaxing.“People are concerned with change. They can be uncertain about what a wind farm can mean for them. What we tend to see is that once the wind farm is operating people stop seeing it after a while. It’s like electricity pylons. You can’t imagine the landscape without them but you stop seeing them because you get used to them.”While Garret is responsible for managing the turbines at Carn Hill, the maintenance of the machines is carried out by another company.He said: “It may be a case you have to have a crane on site for a major component change. A lot of the work is done remotely, for example software updates. “Our job as asset manager is to monitor performance. These machines are an asset, we need to run them as efficiently as we can. They can be monitored from Dublin, from Paris.”Meabh said: “There’s times we’re not going to need all the energy that is being produced, for example, a fabulously windy day in the middle of the summer.“The system operator has an extremely sophisticated set of management tools and they will be monitoring the output from every wind farm, every solar farm in as granular detail as they can get. They will be sending out signals to manage the output. “Unfortunately when we have surplus energy that we don’t need we can’t export it because of our isolated island location, everything just gets turned down. We need better interconnection to help resolve that.”Garret said: “Carn Hill would be one of the smaller wind farms. A big wind farm would have around  turbines and produce something like  MW, then you’ve got huge ones like Whitelee Wind Farm in Scotland which produces over  MW.”Meabh said: “When you go off shore the energy capability leaps up even more. There are less restrictions. There are plans underway to developy a MW turbine. That’s basically the same as Carn Hill in one single machine off shore.

George Massy-Beresford, her father, was a landowner and an accomplished sportsman. The Hon. Alice Mulholland, her mother, was the youngest daughter of the Lord Dunleath. Described as ‘a rebel’ and ‘a dficult child’, Monica was educated at home and attended a girls’ school in Dresden for a year.Kinawley Parish Church, Derrylin. Pic by Kenneth AllenGeorge Massy-Beresford was an enthusiastic yachtsman, building and racing his own yachts. It was a passion he shared with the other aristocratic and gentry families of the Erne basin. The Times in August  reported that George Massy-Beresford’s Mistral won a race organised by Lough Erne Yacht Club, founded in  and sixth oldest yacht club in the British Isles, for the second year in a row. The Times also noted that Mistral had a crew of six, including the owner’s -year-old daughter..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p Monica was clearly close to her father. In , when she was , Monica was allowed to drive his De Dietrich, the first motor car in that part of County Fermanagh.Massy-Beresford was a leading light in the Ulster Volunteer Force in the years before the outbreak of the Great War. In April  Monica accompanied her father to Larne to collect part of the Clyde Valley’s cargo for the Fermanagh volunteers.In  Varinka Muss, Monica’s daughter, visited Fermanagh and spoke to Patrick Gillespie, a family retainer, about his memories of both George Massy-Beresford and Monica during the third Home Rule crisis.‘Well I remember our Squire, Mr George, God bless him in his grave. He was a hard master – but, goodness me, how he could command. It was worse than a recruit would get in the army. And he paid no attention to high or low. Lords and gentlemen, farmers and servants from all around, they all got the same treatment!’Of Monica, Gillespie recalled: ‘Miss Monica… she was a grand one! She often came with Mr George to morning parade and shooting practice… indeed that young girl could hit the target at least as well as the others. Many times she had a hand in smuggling guns into here from England. She hid a couple in her skirts when she went through control in Belfast or Dublin.’On  June  Monica married Jørgen Adalbert de Wichfeld, a Danish aristocrat and diplomat, and went to live at Engestoft where there was a lake ‘that reminded her so much of Lough Erne and St Hubert’s’. The couple had three children: Ivan , Varinka Wichfeld-Muusand Viggo .Monica’s favourite brother, Lieutenant John Clarina Massy-Beresford , served with the Royal Field Artillery in the Great War and was killed in action on  August  at the age of . He is buried in Bertrancourt Military Cemetery in France. It may be simplistic to suppose that this was the cause of her antipathy towards the Germans in the Second World War.During the Second World War she was active in the Danish Resistance. \"  \"  Reported On This Day  Years Ago : Press gang set fire to boat to trick sailors into jumping ship Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"She began her involvement in the resistance by raising money for the underground press. She then assumed leadership of the resistance groups on the islands of Lolland and Falsteruntil she was betrayed by a fellow resistance fighter and captured by the Gestapo.In prison she wrote a letter which was smuggled into a neighbouring cell. It reveals how restrictive and claustrophobic she found Fermanagh le: ‘I always walked alone when I was a little girl I set myself down on a rock in the lake, and dreamed of how I would make my way out of that poor country and that narrow circle to which I belonged. ‘I wished to see other lands, to get to know other people, to live le.’She did not break under Gestapo interrogation and was condemned to death in May .On being condemned to death, she sat down, pulled out her powder-compact, and powdered her nose. She raised her eyes for moment and asked the three judges:‘Anything , gentlemen ’‘Yes, you may have permission to make application for mercy, which will be favourably considered.’‘Does that apply to my companions ‘No!’‘Then it is of no interest!’The sentence caused uproar in Denmark because she was the first woman to be condemned to death in Denmark for many centuries.Bowing to pressure, the German authorities commuted the sentence to le imprisonment and dispatched her to a concentration camp in Germany.Although we might imagine that she inhabited a world of privilege as a girl, as a result of her father’s eccentric ideas on raising children, she actually had a very Spartan upbringing.She was taught to show aversion to expressing any physical discomfort or pain. She was also very frugal where food and drink were concerned. These qualities may have served her well when she was interrogated by the Gestapo and in the concentration camp. However, she contracted pneumonia and died in Waldheim camp on  February .A memorial service was held for her in St Saviour’s, London, on  April .In Engestoft Church there is a sandstone memorial tablet with bronze script to Monica Wichfeld. In Derrylin she is commemorated on the War Memorial in the Parish Church.In  Flemming B. Muss and Varinka Wichfeld Muss published an account of Monica’s Le entitled Monica Wichfeld: A very gallant woman, a translation of the book originally published in Danish.Flemming B. Muss was Monica’s son-in-law. He was the Special Operations Executive’s chief agent in Denmark from  onwards and was awarded the DSO for his contribution to the resistance movement. Varinka had acted as his war-time secretary.In  Christine Sutherland authored a second account of the le of Monica de Wichfeld entitled Monica: Heroine of the Danish Resistance.• Gordon Lucy is a well regarded Ulster historian and the author of a number of books on unionist history.try catch  TrendingThe  Northern Ireland homes you can buy for less than pound,Tributes flood in for Willie Frazer: campaigner for victims of terrorism dies, aged Enniskillen Road Races: Republic of Ireland rider Kevin Baker lsquocriticalrsquo in hospital after crashN.I. weather set to sizzle in degC mini-heatwave -

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them. This has been carried out in towns and cities across the UK to protect the local heritage.The petition can be found at www.change.org p vale-of-glamorgan-council-save-the-victorian-heritage-of-penarth u .I will continue to work with your local Labour councillors on these issues.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John.

If there are issues we will try to work through those issues.ldquoSometimes we will have to make decisions that not everyone is going to be happy with.ldquoWe have to be honest with people. We have to say these are the facts and whether we like it or not we will have to do some things dferently or not at all.Cllr Burnett added. ldquoBut we have to be honest about the levels of pressure on local government.ldquoOur priority has to be services to the most vulnerable.The Labour-led coalition includes members of the former Conservative cabinet, which quit the party when former leader John Thomas was deposed as leader of the Vale Tories. The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for. It will be realistic and fair for everybody.School improvementsThe new cabinet says delivering on major new school buildings is a priority for the new administration.Developments in the pipeline include new builds forPencoedtre and Whitmore High Schools, and expansion and refurbishment of Ysgol Gymraeg Bro MorgannwgAgeing schools in the Vale are set to get a pound. million cash boost for repairs.Llancarfan Primary SchoolLlancarfan Primary School was set to be lsquoclosedrsquoand moved to a new pound million facility in Rhoose.The previous cabinet had approved the plans despite protests from parents and campaigners.Cllr Moore said Llancarfan School move was ldquopremature - but did not commit to scrapping the plan entirely.ldquoIf itrsquos justiable itrsquos justiable, he said. ldquoIf itrsquos not, we will look at alternatives.ldquoItrsquos not an easy decision to take. Itrsquos something we have to take some time about.ldquoWhat Irsquom not going to do is jump or kowtow to people who shout the loudest.Cllr Burnett has previously tweeted the closure of Llancarfan ldquowouldnrsquot be happeningLabour were running the council.New roadsWork continues on outline business cases for two major new roads being proposed ndash the A to M link around Pendoylan and Dinas Powys Bypass between Barry and Cardf ndash but no decision has been made whether either will actually go ahead.The future of both roads rests on whether Welsh Government and the council deem them viable, and whether ministers cough up the cash to fund them.But Cllr Moore said he doesnrsquot think Welsh Government will find the money required for the Dinas Powys Bypass.ldquoItrsquos out of our hands, he said.IncineratorCllr Moore said he believes Welsh Government will order the Barry Biomass incinerator to carry out an environmentalimpact assessment.Cllr Moore, who has previously attacked what he termed ldquoscaremongering and lies around the biomass plant, said he did not want the facility in Barry Docks.He said: ldquoWe opposed it vehemently, both as a council and as a party and personally. It shouldnrsquot be there.ldquoBut now it is there it has to operate within legal parameters.ldquoIf it does, therersquos nothing anyone can do about it.The council refused the original planning permission for the facility, but a planning inspector allowed it in  following an appeal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

They have been locked in talks ever since amid deep isions over how best to balance political, geographic and gender considerations among the  member nations.With the selection process bogged down for the second EU summit meeting in a row, the leaders are still considering Dutch socialist Frans Timmermans to replace Christian Democrat Jean-Claude Juncker as president of the EUrsquos powerful executive arm, the European Commission. -- vw,vw,px, px\"European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker sits prior to a round table meeting at the EU summit in Brussels  --ldquoLetrsquos see, Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said of Mr Timmermansrsquos chances when briefly descending from the meeting room at EU headquarters at around breakfast time.The Timmermans option has deeply ided the European Peoplersquos Partyas it would surrender the key post to the rival Socialists and Democratsbloc despite the EPP remaining the biggest group in the EU following last monthrsquos election.Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov, an EPP stalwart, posted a video on his Facebook account of a discussion with Mr Timmermans in which Mr Borissov said the Dutchman should get the commission job while the less coveted parliament presidency should go to EPP candidate Manfred Weber.But Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar insisted that the ldquovast majority of the EPP prime ministers donrsquot believe we should give up the presidency of the commission quite so easily, without a fight. -- vw,vw,px, px\"A journalist rests during the late-night negotiating session in Brussels  --After negotiations started early on Sunday, summit host and EU Council president Donald Tusk had more than  bilateral meetings in his attempt to find a breakthrough.The appointments must take into account political affiliation, geography ndash balancing east and west, north and south ndash population size and gender. The leaders of EU institutions are supposed to impartially represent the interests of all member nations globally and in Brussels.Some leaders discussed the roster of upcoming vacancies, which also include the EUrsquos top diplomat, the president of the European Parliament and the chief of the European Central Bank , on the sidelines of the Group of  summit in Japan that concluded on Saturday.Mr Tusk wants nominations to be wrapped up soon, seeking to prevent further erosion of public confidence in the EU amid Brexit uncertainty and intra-bloc isions over managing migration. -- vw,vw,px, px\"European Council president Donald Tusk, left, with Renew Europe party member Guy Verhofstadt  --There was hope at the previous summit on June - that more time would clary who should replace Mr Juncker. German Chancellor Angela Merkel backs Mr Weber, the German conservative whose centre-right EPP is the largest political group in the European Parliament but lost seats in the EU elections in May.French President Emmanuel Macron has suggested Mr Weber lacks the political and government experience for such a high-profile role.Mr Weber could still be considered for the head of the European Parliament, which is the EUrsquos only elected institution.Mrs Merkel said there was still a good possibility for Mr Weber and Mr Timmermans, the top centre-left candidate from the SD group, to be among the winners of the top positions.  -- vw,vw,px, px\"German Chancellor Angela Merkel arrives for the EU summit  --Other leaders from the same political family disagreed.The EPP and the SD are the two biggest political groups in the EU, but both lost seats in Mayrsquos polls, where far-right and populist parties, pro-business liberals and the Greens made gains.EU leaders want to fill the positions soon because the European Parliament is set to pick a new president next Wednesday.Under EU rules, member countries choose who will run the commission, replacing Mr Juncker. The parliament must endorse that choice. But the assembly has insisted that only the lead candidates from parties that ran in last monthrsquos elections should be eligible for the post.ldquoThe lead candidates is not the only criteria, said Mr Conte.The commission proposes and enforces EU laws on policies ranging from the massive single market to agriculture spending, and from competition issues to immigration. -- vw,vw,px, px\"European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker  --The job responsibilities are huge: Mr Tusk and Mr Juncker negotiate with the likes of US President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping, while the head of the ECB can set monetary policy for the  nations that use the shared euro currency.The outgoing group of EU officials was lopsidedly Italian, with Antonio Tajani holding the parliament top post, Mario Draghi head of the ECB and Federica Mogherini the EU foreign policy chief.Top candidates include current prime ministers Stefan Lofven of Sweden and Andrej Plenkovic of Croatia.

Abandoned - BlissThe first dog to arrive at the centre was -year-old Spaniel Grace, found by a member of the public at the side of the road. She was taken to the vet immediately, but after an owner didn’t come forward, she was brought to Dogs Trust.Two weeks ago, another Spaniel - aged eight and nicknamed Bliss by the team - was found tied to a fence not far from the rehoming centre. Like Grace, the Spaniel has not been microchipped, which has been a legal requirement for all dogs since  and the easiest way to identy a dog who has become separated from their owner. Shockingly just one week later, a Cairn Terrier - less than a year old, was found by a rehoming centre staff member at the very same spot where Bliss was left. Terrier Rizzo was lucky to be found as she is quite small and it would have been easy to miss her in the long grass.The most recent addition to the ranks of abandoned pooches is Sally, an eight-year-old Collie cross, who was found as a stray by a member of the public and brought to the rehoming centre.Abandoned - RizzoOonagh Philips, Rehoming Centre Manager said: “We want to remind anyone who no longer feels that they can care for their dog to contact their local rescue organisation for support. When a dog is abandoned on the road side, it not only puts them in danger, but also drivers. We are so thankful that all four of these dogs were found when they were.“Grace and Bliss were very shaken up by their ordeal when they came into our care and it took them a couple of days to build trust around people again. We could tell Rizzo hadn’t eaten in a while, which could have resulted in a deterioration of her physical health. Sally is incredibly sweet natured, and just like the others, will make a wonderful addition to the right home.“We are not sure why there has been a recent influx in dogs being abandoned. We always remind people that ‘A Dog is for Le®’ but we understand that le happens, and places like Dogs Trust are there to support any dog owner who experiences a bump in the road and needs our help. Sometimes the most responsible thing we can do as a dog owner is admit that we aren’t coping with our pets, but it is important to ensure they are kept safe and not left to fend for themselves.”If you

Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/bbobb.jpg","title":"coffee chain bob and berts creating  new jobs","story":"Posted on Monday  June  by John Mulgrew A Northern Ireland coffee shop chain is creating  new jobs as its expands it reach across the UK with eight new stores, it has emerged.
