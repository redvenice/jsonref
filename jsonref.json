In what could turn out to be one of the shortest heatwaves of all time, the freak conditions are expected to dissipate rapidly, with Monday set to be 10c degrees cooler than today.And many experts are warning that because of climate change, this could be the shape of things to come — short, sharp bursts of unbearable heat.           Of course, when it comes to the pool itself, the proof is in the pudding. My nine-year-old daughter Martha is something of an expert. Already a keen competitive swimmer, she has been nagging me for years to get a pool of her own (Tom with his daughter Martha)         Best for big gardens is Zodiac Hippo Original Rectangular Pool, £6,495, splashandrelax.co.ukSo how to cope? Simple. Get your own pop-up swimming pool — for the day.After all, if the sun’s only going to shine for a matter of hours, there’s little point in enduring the fuss, faff and considerable cost of maintaining one all-year-round.And while a paddling pool’s all well and good, when the heat’s on you want to submerge yourself in something a little bit more substantial. So, on Thursday, I put a call in to David Donald, whose company Splash and Tickle specialises in renting out swimming pools, hot tubs and spa equipment.‘Some people don’t want the hassle of a permanent pool,’ he tells me. ‘There’s all the effort of maintaining it year-round when you probably only want it for a couple of months. With a rented pool, you can have it for a weekend, a week or however long.’The one I order has a diameter of 5 metres and is a bit over 1 metre deep.         Best for smaller spaces is the Intex Easy Set Swimming Pool, £62.79, amazon.co.uk         Best for pool parties is Zodiac Winky Original Round Pool, £4,195, splashandrelax.co.ukWhile I won’t be swimming lengths in it, it holds a considerable amount of water — 11,000 litres to be precise — meaning that, unlike a paddling pool, it won’t become soupy hot within a few hours of the sun bursting through the clouds.It consists of a solid wooden frame which David slots together in three hours, inside which a heavy-duty plastic pool liner is fitted.‘Unlike one of those inflatable pools, you can lean on the sides and they won’t collapse,’ points out David.The pool comes with its own filtration and heating system and the pH and balance of the water is maintained with the addition of chemicals, as with a normal pool.Filling it with a hose will take the best part of a day — or if you can’t wait that long to cool down, you can order in a tanker of water which will fill it to the top in half an hour. But expect to pay £500 or so for the short cut.         Best for splashing cash is Laghetto Dolce Vita Pool 510, £18,000, agbudget.co.ukAs for the cost of the pool, it comes in at £1,200 for the weekend. But much of that cost covers delivery and putting it up, so a longer rental would make better financial sense.And while it may sound like a lot, the cost of installing a proper pool will cost you anything from £25,000 to £100,000-plus, depending on its size. On top of that are heating and maintenance costs which will add thousands each year. Worth it if it’s a scorching summer, but less so if the sun shines as rarely as it has done so far this year.As well as private clients, David’s pools are often to be found at corporate events and in the VIP camping sections of festivals. As well as the pool, he can provide a changing room complete with towels and lockers.          Best for staying up all summer is the Rectangular Steel Pro Frame Pool, £426.99, amazon.co.uk         Of course, when it comes to the pool itself, the proof is in the pudding. And my nine-year-old daughter Martha is something of an expert.Already a keen competitive swimmer, she has been nagging me for years to get a pool of her own.‘Perfect,’ she says, in between jumping in and sailing around on an inflatable pink flamingo. ‘Can we keep it?’Maybe for a bit, I tell her. And, of course, once the Saharan bubble bursts, I can always call up David and get him to pick up the pool — and replace it with one of his hot tubs. "},{"url":null,"title":"Diana match Charles hadnt boyfriends","story":"Share this article We stood in the hall, where Barbour mackintoshes and wellington boots were squashed next to an umbrella stand. It was like being in a rambling country house. She was in blue jeans and a twin-set with pearls, which she fingered constantly.As I walked into the flat, Diana\u0027s shoulders were bowed as though standing straight would draw too much attention. Her skin was transparent and she blushed continuously, especially when talking about Charles. \u0027It\u0027s absolutely maddening to see things written about me, and him, when I haven\u0027t said anything.\u0027 She paused. \u0027But I don\u0027t know what the future holds.\u0027I asked if anyone was advising her on how to handle the situation. \u0027No!\u0027 she said, shocked. \u0027I don\u0027t think the Royal Family is aware of what is happening here. At least we didn\u0027t talk about it when we were in Norfolk.\u0027Apparently she\u0027d crept away at night the previous weekend to stay at Sandringham, managing to evade reporters. I wondered aloud if she\u0027d wound sheets together to climb out of the window. She laughed. \u0027No, I got a very fast driver and we shot off in a puff of smoke. I had my new car delivered somewhere else where I stayed the night, then shot off to Norfolk.\u0027 It was Prince Charles\u0027s 32nd birthday party. \u0027Unfortunately,\u0027 she added, \u0027somebody found out I had a new car and even though I parked it miles away they found it.\u0027So the siege went on. \u0027I\u0027ve no idea why the whole thing has built up to such a peak,\u0027 she shrugged. \u0027I think it\u0027s because everything happens for the Royal Family in November. Princess Anne married and had a baby in November. It\u0027s the Queen and Prince Philip\u0027s anniversary. And of course it\u0027s Charles\u0027s birthday and everyone is dying for him to get married, and I was the one who was around this time.\u0027A little disingenuous perhaps. Not every pretty young woman is asked to stay at Sandringham for these highly personal events.         Every morning when she tried to jump into her red Mini, photographers would race her to the first set of traffic lights, hoping she would be stopped long enough for them to get a shot or, worse, that they would cause a little accident, which would give a more dramatic shotThen she changed the subject, apologising for what a nuisance all the attention must be for other people in our building. \u0027It must be so bloody for everyone who lives here,\u0027 she said. \u0027I feel so awful about it.\u0027 I assured her we were taking it in our collective stride.I knew she wanted me to write what she said, although she was afraid to say much. She thought she was \u0027suitable\u0027 for a future king, only because she did not \u0027sleep around\u0027. It was clear she thought herself second best to her older sister, who had been Prince Charles\u0027s girlfriend for almost a year but had been crossed off the eligibility list. Not for lack of blue blood – the Spencer blood was probably bluer than the Windsors\u0027 – but for reportedly telling journalists she\u0027d had \u0027thousands of boyfriends\u0027. Diana strongly implied she was a virgin, and she obviously felt that was the only reason \u0027The Family\u0027 had approved her as a future bride, although I did not write that in my interview. \u0027I don\u0027t really know why they like me,\u0027 was what I wrote. \u0027You see my sister Sarah was going out with Charles last year and she talked about it to the Press but she talked too much and they murdered her.\u0027I\u0027m OK because I haven\u0027t got a background.\u0027 I looked surprised. No background? Daughter of the 8th Earl Spencer, distantly related to the Royal Family, directly related to the Churchills? No, it turned out she meant a background of leaping in and out of bed with people. \u0027That\u0027s what everyone else seems to have. I mean I haven\u0027t had a chance to have that kind of background, I\u0027m still only 19!\u0027 She looked shocked and embarrassed. \u0027But people are longing to dig something up about me.\u0027 She looked at me sideways. \u0027It\u0027s like the story about me meeting him on the Royal Train in the middle of the night.\u0027She was referring to reports, denied by the Palace, that she\u0027d had an assignation with the prince when the train was in sidings in Wiltshire. \u0027I simply couldn\u0027t believe it,\u0027 she exploded. \u0027I\u0027ve never been near the train, let alone in the middle of the night!\u0027 I was told later, by a reliable source, that the woman on board was Camilla.I was very sympathetic, but as I turned to go, realising a cup of tea was not on the cards, she apologised again for the disruption she\u0027d caused to others in our building. \u0027I am so, so sorry for interrupting the lives of the people who live here,\u0027 she said.She told me when she was finally allowed a bodyguard, a woman dressed in black who shadowed her like a, well, shadow, a very dark one, but effective. I could see the top of the woman\u0027s head as I slipped down the stairs behind Diana, neither of us waiting for the old Victorian lift. None of the other members of the Press spotted her, that\u0027s for sure. Diana, soon to be HRH Princess of Wales, was learning her lesson.                 "},{"url":null,"title":"RICHARD KAY reveals astonishing life 6th Earl Carnarvon","story":"Share this article And, last year, Wynne, now 90, was reunited with them. To his amazement, they were in reasonable condition and the sound quality was almost as good as he remembered.Wynne’s cache of tapes is an extraordinary record of a golden history of one of our most popular country houses — particularly in the context of a big-screen version of Downton Abbey, due later this year.The storyline of the film sees Downton preparing for a royal visit by George V and Queen Mary in 1927. Intriguingly, this fictional visit is set just four years after Carnarvon had inherited the earldom and with it Highclere Castle. With fact and fiction so aligned, the history of the tapes adds significance.The story begins in 1973, when Barry Wynne, who helped launch Thames Television, received a phone call from the then 75-year-old Lord Carnarvon. A year earlier, Wynne had written a well-received book about one of the great archaeological finds of the 20th century, the tomb of Tutankhamun. It was a subject close to Carnarvon, whose father had funded the expedition.But the peer did not want to talk about his father. Encouraged by the publisher Lord Weidenfeld, who wanted ‘all the dirt’ on a man reputed to be one of the great rakes of the 20th century, Wynne and Carnarvon set to work.         The dancer and Prochy\u0027s second wife Tilly Losch ‘Here he was in his mid-70s and he wanted to put down a record of his life,’ says Wynne. ‘He was great raconteur.’But, having signed his acceptance of the manuscript, the peer, under pressure from his advisors about the frank reminiscences, had second thoughts. Baffled when Carnarvon pulled the plug on the enterprise, Wynne’s shock only increased when he was summoned to the office of the earl’s London solicitors.‘From a drawer, his lawyer pulled out a wad of £1 notes and counted out 50 of them,’ Wynne recalls. ‘I particularly remember that they were used notes, that seemed deliberate.’ It was the act of a crashing snob. ‘Of course, I walked out on the spot.’After finally securing a payoff, Wynne handed over a copy of the manuscript and his notes, but not the tapes. According to him, the recordings were not part of the action.‘They were mine, not Carnarvon’s, made on my wife’s tape machine.’Nevertheless, he sent the tapes to his sister’s home in Paris for safekeeping. They remained there for 25 years before being moved to his agent’s office in Central London for a further 15 years. In recent times, they had been looked after by his younger daughter, which was when they went missing.After two failed marriages and a decade living on a yacht, Wynne has now settled in Cyprus. And it was there that he received the call to tell him the tapes had been found.It came from his daughter’s ex-boyfriend, who said his father was selling a hotel in the market town of Louth, when at the back of a cupboard he found the box of tapes.‘I didn’t know this young man but I remember it was Boxing Day and I told him he’d given me the best Christmas present ever,’ Wynne says.The tapes are once again safe under lock and key with Wynne’s solicitors. What is on them is bound to fascinate historians and broadcasters. Few figures in the racy Twenties and Thirties were as louche and as well connected as Henry Herbert, 6th Earl of Carnarvon.Known as Porchy after his courtesy title Lord Porchester, he was a soldier, sportsman, bloodstock breeder, exhibitionist, chat-show guest and apparently lover of half the women of Berkshire.According to a wonderfully indiscreet obituary, he liked to tell how, as a young cavalry subaltern, he had been chased through the back gardens of Maidenhead by cuckolded husbands. It described him as a ‘most uncompromisingly direct ladies man’, a euphemism to describe a flasher.He thought nothing of taking other men’s wives as his mistresses. One was Joan Bowes-Lyon, a noted beauty and a cousin of the Queen Mother. She was married to Frank Bellville, a fellow soldier, who attempted to blackmail Porchy by threatening to expose the affair unless he paid him £10,000.Convinced he had been entrapped, Porchester refused to pay and broke off the affair.         Highclere Castle, which features as Downton Abbey in the hit ITV television series As a child, he told Wynne, he lived in fear of his forbidding and dissolute father and his rich but cold mother, Almina, illegitimate daughter of Alfred de Rothschild, a flamboyant member of the banking family.He recalled how, as a ten-year-old boy, he was taken to a Christmas party at Buckingham Palace where he collided with the portly Edward VII, knocking him to the ground. He then compounded this social faux pas by spilling ice cream over the king’s granddaughter Princess Mary’s new day-dress.For this he was beaten by his furious, social-climbing mother, who then instructed the family butler to lock him in an attic and feed him only bread and water for two days as punishment for disgracing the Carnarvon name.It was nothing to humiliations visited on him by his father. After a bad school report, the young Porchy was ordered to undress and bend over, whereupon his father, armed with a birch rod, gave him six strokes on his bare backside.A page at the Coronation of George V in 1911, he remembered the waxed moustaches of Germany’s Kaiser and the Russian Tsar. During World War I, when serving with the 7th Hussars in Mesopotamia, his horse was shot from under him and a bullet pierced his pith helmet. He also led a firing squad which executed a Turk spy. Afterwards, his hands shook so much he was unable to withdraw his pistol to deliver the coup de grace and threw up.But he had no such qualms when he saw an Arab cutting off the boots of a dead brother officer. Drawing his pistol, he shot the man dead. He also helped himself to the field glasses of a dead Turk officer, which he used for racing for the rest of his life.After the death of the 5th earl, Porchester secured the financial future of Highclere by slashing estate staff numbers and selling works of art. To raise more money, he turned his pastime for rearing racehorses and gambling on them into a profession.During the abdication crisis, he was asked to intervene by the Royal Family. As a close friend of Edward VIII, he met the king in a Turkish bath in St James’s, and appealed to him to keep Wallis Simpson as his mistress, but not to make her his wife.His own marital record was hardly unblemished. He married twice, first to American Catherine Wendell and then to Austrian-born dancer and Hollywood star Tilly Losch. Both ended in orce. Catherine had abandoned the family home because of his philandering, and years later he attempted to sue Tilly for desertion after she, too, ran out on him.Despite his reputation, he was not always successful with the opposite sex. In 1936, he was reported in New York to be engaged to society beauty Tanis Guinness, but she jilted him and eloped to Mexico with a screenwriter.Ten years later, his name was linked with the British actress Jeanne Stewart and, in the late Fifties, he was said to be contemplating marriage to Mme Jacqueline Descamps, the blonde daughter of a Belgian baroness, who was almost half his age.Even so, with Downton Abbey set to return to the screen later this summer, the real-life saga of the scion of Highclere and the new-found tapes reveal a story every bit as dramatic. "},{"url":null,"title":"Kynren Bishop Auckland transforms northern town","story":"Share this article ‘Its addictive. It’s infectious. It makes everything in your life better,’ says Christine Chisholm, a dementia carer who is part of the mounted cavalry team. ‘I’ve made so many friends and I’m so grateful.’ Another cavalry member chips in. ‘We’re all grateful to Jonathan.’Indeed, Jonathan Ruffer’s name is forever popping up. How he has changed everything. How he has bought Bishop Auckland back to life. How he has reconnected the town, with hundreds of new friendships cemented during rehearsals and performances.‘The town was on its knees. It was going to ruin,’ says Andrew, a middle-aged centurion and Great North Air Ambulance fundraiser.         A volunteer grapples with a donkey. As well as the volunteer cast, there are hundreds of ‘Experience’ Archers — welcomers who are given the same training as the London 2012 volunteer team. With tickets sales of about £4 million each year, the show is now self-funding. But Jonathan hasn’t stopped at Kynren. He has gone on to establish the Auckland Project, which is focused on regeneration of the area‘Kynren has given people a sense of pride, in their town, in themselves and it has completely changed all our lives because we’ve made so many friends. I was born in this town, but I have never had so many friends.’Bishop Auckland, once a beacon of the mining north, has struggled for nearly half a century to find new purpose since the last deep colliery closed in 1968. Butchers and fishmongers closed, the market square filled with discount outlets, charity shops and takeaways, and hope faded.Jonathan’s love affair with the place stems from his passion for old Spanish art. In particular 12 paintings by Francisco de Zurbaran, which had been housed since 1756 in Auckland Castle, one of Europe’s best preserved former ‘bishops’ palaces’.When, in 2013, the Church of England announced they were selling the paintings to help fund priests working in poor areas, Jonathan — a gentle, bespectacled chap who grew up 30 miles away in Stokesley — offered to buy them. And then, because it seemed a shame to move them, he bought the castle, too, in a job lot that cost £15 million.‘I was persuaded, quite reluctantly, to take the castle — these old buildings can be absolute nightmares,’ he says.But he soon realised that keeping the Zubarans was neither here nor there to most people in Bishop, as locals call it.‘Would this be good for the community?’ he says ruefully. ‘It was a futile gesture.’ And then a golf course became available nearby, and Jonathan, an evangelical Christian since an epiphany as a student at Cambridge, had what he likens to Abraham’s calling by God.‘Abraham was called on a journey, but he wasn’t given the destination. That is exactly what’s happened to me,’ he says. ‘I could not possibly have not done what I’m doing, but I still don’t know what the plan is.’Perhaps not, but he found himself donating another £35 million to set up the charity, Eleven Arches, and through it launched the idea of Kynren with the help of expert advisers in the hope it would show the doubters — pretty much everyone who had heard his bonkers proposition — and revitalise the community.Jonathan, who is married to a palliative care doctor and has a daughter, isn’t the sort to do things by half. He wanted to deliver the same success as Puy du Fou and so he persuaded a member of its board to help his new charity.He also asked Roxanna Smith, Gina Martinez and Katie Pearson, who choreographed the Olympic opening ceremony, to help.Music was commissioned from Nathan Stornetta, who worked on Pirates Of The Caribbean, while local celebrity, Kevin Whately, of Inspector Morse and Lewis fame, provided voice-overs.Jonathan also managed to persuade Anna Warnecke, an Olympian who represented her native Germany in three-day eventing for 20 years, to join as Head of Cavalry and Estates.As well as the volunteer cast, there are hundreds of ‘Experience’ Archers — welcomers who are given the same training as the London 2012 volunteer team.With tickets sales of about £4 million each year, the show is now self-funding. But Jonathan hasn’t stopped at Kynren. He has gone on to establish the Auckland Project, which is focused on regeneration of the area.So there is now a new 15ft viewing tower over the town, a gallery featuring mining-themed work by prominent artists and, to come, a new museum on the history of Christianity. And of course there is the castle, which has undergone an £18 million refurbishment — Jonathan and his family live in a lodge in the grounds — and will open to visitors.When I arrive at the site three days before opening night, I find the atmosphere joyful and the scale astonishing.         There are fountain ballets, a Viking longboat that rises out of a purpose-built lake courtesy of underwater ers, a burning village, flaming arrows, the re-enactment of a mining disaster of the 1870s, the Coronation and 100kg of fireworks lighting up every showThere is a huge area of landscaped meadows, stable blocks, 16 huge changing rooms (known as villages), a wooden 8,000-seat stand and the ‘stage’ — actually a vast expanse of lake, castle, railway and cathedral — with Auckland Castle, which is illuminated at night, as a stunning backdrop to the show.Sadly, I am too late to join the jousting, or practise being dragged along on a rope behind a horse, learn a complex dance routine, or drive Boudicca’s chariot. But the mantra at Kynren is that there is something for everyone.So I spear some plastic fish with a wooden pitchfork and chat with Karen, who assures me that coming to Kynren rehearsals with her husband several times a week has revitalised their marriage.Next, I mend a fishing net, stir the boiling cabbage broth for the Vikings and then rehearse for a Roman chariot ride. The chariot is driven by a very handsome centurion called David and pulled by four thoroughbred horses.The attention to detail is astonishing. Every piece of tack is glossy and gleaming. Every centurion helmet (apart from, perhaps, mine) is straight and every tassel tangle-free.We do loop after loop past the empty stands, perfecting timing, formation and posture.The logistics are mind-blowing. And that’s even before they start herding 150 animals and 1,000 volunteers into each show.Each Archer plays multiple parts, changing up to six times in the course of a performance. The costume department has more than 10,000 items — doublets, royal regalia, Boudicca’s feathered headdress, thousands of boots and belts and gloves.A huge team of mostly volunteers, aged from 42 to 78, work all year round sewing, fixing, laundering or, more often than not, just spraying everything with diluted vodka. ‘It gets rid of the bacteria very nicely,’ says Chris Livingstone, a retired civil servant whose sister was a costume designer for Elton John and Queen. (‘It’s in the blood,’ she says.)As opening night approaches, the hours put in by the core team spiral — 18-20 hour days are standard, says Anna Warnecke.No one is bothering about overtime. Everyone — even the small number of paid staff — volunteers on show nights. And, oddly, no one seems to care about the weather.But there is fevered excitement for the now-legendary opening and closing show parties. ‘The after-party went on so long last year, I went home on the milk float,’ says Andrew, the centurion. How bloody brilliant!The impact of Kynren is extraordinary.

The £3million revenue was expected to cover the price of apartment itself as well as stamp duty, VAT, and legal and marketing costs.It was also set to cover the winner\u0027s utility bills and service charges on the property for the first year. They said the raffle complies with UK gambling regulations and the prize would be drawn independently. Mr Jackson, 28, and Mr Dee, 27, bought the flat for £1.35million and spent about £300,000 refurbishing it.The work included taking out stud walls to make it more open plan and installing modern and luxury fixtures and fittings. The pair from South Yorkshire, who met at university, have been property developing for two years. Guy Meacock, director of the buying agency Prime Purchase, blasted their decision to hold a raffle. He said: \u0027A raffle cheapens what is a pretty serious exercise. It is highly unlikely people are going to start raffling off their houses.\u0027The endeavour usually ends with failure, with competitions website Loquax recording just two out of 50 contests which ended with a property being given away.            Property developers Mr Jackson and Mr Dee were aiming to sell a minimum of 300,000 tickets to make the project viable         The £3million revenue would cover the price of apartment itself as well as stamp duty, VAT, and legal and marketing costs         The prize was also expected to cover the winner\u0027s utility bills and service charges on the property for the first yearThey have now launched the company Caus - Latin for \u0027windfall\u0027 - to legitimise the process of raffling off property and hope to do more in the future.Mr Jackson said: \u0027There is no denying the property market in London has slowed due to the uncertainty over Brexit and the recent increase in stamp duty. That has left people a little unsure about the property market.\u0027Harry and I looked at the situation and thought about doing something outside the box. We don\u0027t want this to be a one off and want it to be a recurring thing. We want to legitimise the whole concept of raffling a property.\u0027We will have the opportunity to add further properties to this platform after this competition has finished. We aren\u0027t trying to solve the London housing market.               The duo said the raffle complied with UK gambling regulations and the prize would be drawn independently         Mr Jackson, 28, and Mr Dee, 27, bought the flat for £1.35million and spent about £300,000 refurbishing it         The pair from South Yorkshire, who met at university, have been property developing for two years\u0027We are trying to build a platform for people to spend £10 on a ticket to have a chance to buy a high-end London property.\u0027 The flat had two bedrooms and two bathrooms and is in a luxury five-storey block.Mr Jackson said: \u0027We have fully refurbished it and it is now a very desirable property that we think would sell quite easily on the open market. \u0027But we have held off putting on the market with the intention of running this competition. This isn\u0027t a case where we have a property that won\u0027t sell. \u0027We are offering a very premium product to people who couldn\u0027t others afford to buy it.\u0027C A D I V U SRaffle falls flat as £2m property raises £227,000 | News | The Times"},{"url":null,"title":"Thousands Glastonbury festival goers complain huge queues water hot temperatures","story":"Share this article          These two girls poured water from a bag above their head in what looked like an attempt to cool down in the searing heat         Anna Hedges, Glastonbury\u0027s special events manager, defended their water preparations.

Playing from its disembodied head was a dizzying barrage of techno, bass and electronic noise from some of the world’s most cutting-edge artists.In the crowd meanwhile, body glitter – hopefully biodegradable! – remains the accessory of choice.Sheryl Crow generated some of the biggest singalongs of the day for the likes of If It Makes You Happy – and even had her two young sons working as guitar technicians. As Michael Cragg noted: “By the time the classic Everyday Is a Winding Road kicks in, she’s back in the crowd’s palm, posing for photos and even sharing a kiss with a sunburnt punter.”Aside from walking about eight miles a day, yoga is the exercise of choice at Glastonbury – and Power Ballad Yoga adds an extra impetus for all those outstretched arms.George Ezra’s buoyant, boyish music simply wouldn’t make sense in Glastonbury’s classic drizzle. But luckily for him – perhaps because of him? – the crowd was indeed firmly “underneath the hot sun” for his set. As the ’s Laura Snapes said: “In this miserable day and age, only a churl would resist Ezra’s sunbeam blast of charisma.”Bastille played a blinder, leaning into their set like headliners and making one of the clearest political statements of the day: singer Dan Smith draping himself in an EU flag.And there’s still two more days to go!

Her first novel, The Border of Paradise (2016), explored mental illness, family and migration. Wang was named a best young American novelist by Granta (2017) and is the recipient of a Whiting award (2018). She was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder in 2013 and late-stage Lyme disease in 2015. Her New York Times-bestselling essay collection, The Collected Schizophrenias, which steps both inside and outside of her condition to bring it to light, has just been published. It won the Graywolf nonfiction prize.You write: “I’ve inherited a love of writing and a talent for the visual arts from my mother, as well as her long and tapered fingers I’ve also inherited a tendency for madness.” Could you tell me more about that inheritance of mental illness?In the beginning, I didn’t know that there was any mental illness in my family tree. I didn’t know about my mother’s mental illness. I didn’t know about my great-aunt who had died in a mental institution. I didn’t know about my mother’s cousin who had killed himself. There was all this family secrecy around mental illness. A lot of that has to do with cultural stuff – this idea of saving face and not wanting to be open about these things that are not considered appropriate to talk about or that might bring shame upon the family. As I was getting diagnosed, I learned more about what was in my bloodline. What are your memories of growing up in the midwest?I grew up in a small town that was mostly white and my parents were immigrants dealing with their own stuff, trying to live in this new country. I remember being called racial slurs by other little kids in elementary school, and being confused and embarrassed by my parents who had different accents. I feel so bad about that now. There were things about growing up in a mostly white community and the strain that put on my parents that affected my brother and me. One time in public, this woman was yelling at my mother to take us kids and go back to her own country. In the book, you explore the relationship between creativity and mental health. Why do you feel it’s important not to glamorise it?I do want to be careful not to glamorise mental illness when it comes to creativity because more often than not it actually tends to inhibit creativity. I wrote Perdition Days when experiencing psychosis, but that was a fluke. It’s more normal for me not to be able to function, let alone write, when I am very ill. I want to emphasise and never lose sight of how much suffering is involved.The essays viscerally evoke your experiences, for example, your first hallucination…I was in my senior year at Stanford. Hallucinations kidnap the senses. When I was in the shower and heard the voice saying: “I hate you”, I was so sure I heard it that I started coming up with all kinds of explanations could it be coming from the pipes or drain or showerhead? That kicked off a whole period of hallucinations on and off for many years.You write powerfully about Cotard’s syndrome, which makes people believe they have already died…It was incredibly difficult – there were times I felt I could pretend things were OK and I was in this afterlife, but for the most part it was awful. There were times when I could not stand to be conscious. I would get through every five seconds – I’d think five seconds, the next five… it was one of the hardest things I’ve gotten through.Was it challenging to write the book?It was as traumatising as writing a memoir in many ways. I talked to friends who’ve written memoirs, including Blair Braverman, who wrote Welcome to the Goddamn Ice Cube, because I was having such a hard time. I’d have to go through thousands of pages of journal entries and remember and relive awful things. It was helpful to be reassured that it wasn’t strange to find it so hard to write, that it was quite common to be retraumatised by writing about things that had happened.Is it true you listen to music while writing? I listened to Ultraviolence by Lana del Rey when writing The Collected Schizophrenias – I must confess that I was secretly hoping the book would get to her somehow and she might find out that I’ve acknowledged her.You mention other books exploring mental illness – what for you was the most powerful?One book that was really important while I was writing The Collected Schizophrenias was Andrew Solomon’s The Noonday Demon. I used it as kind of a lighthouse. I found it so captivating.Which writers do you most admire?Marilynne Robinson – she’s absolutely brilliant. Also Toni Morrison. When I won a Whiting award, she was supposed to give a speech at the ceremony but she couldn’t make it because of a storm. I was so disappointed but also mildly relieved as I admire her so much that I knew I’d not be able to say anything intelligent if I met her.What classic novel did you read recently for the first time?Rebecca – and I was delighted.• The Collected Schizophrenias by Esmé Weijun Wang is published by Graywolf Press (£11.99).

Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.Thomas Wolfe told us that you can never go home again. But you can do some re-reading, as Diane Cano explains:Re-reading in my ninth decade a book I first read as an adolescent: Look Homeward, Angel, by Thomas Wolfe. Even as an adolescent I thought of it as a novel especially suited for young teenagers, full of enthusiasm and new pain. It is still racist and misogynist and full of (glorious) lists, but I am no longer the indignant girl I was. Now I just relax into the tolerance of knowing, with Auden, that Time “worships language and forgives everyone by whom it lives”. Oh, how Wolfe throws those words up, around, over and through - everything.“I am not sure why,” says gavernism, “but I am re reading The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde by Stevenson”:Perhaps because I feel that social media today plays the role that chemicals play in that novel: it opens up a dark side of us that can roam around in the dark, anonymously, doing as it pleases. The issue now, as with the novel, is that hidden never really stays hidden, does it?The Silk Roads: A New History of the World by Peter Frankopan is “outstanding” according to darrylxxx:So many interesting stories, connections, insights and so easy to relate to where we are now as a global population. Shows how things ebb and flow over time – our current “reality” isn’t fixed in stone.“I do love Home Front diaries,” says NicolaVintageReads, who has been reading May Smith’s wartime diary These Wonderful Rumours:Ration books, Time and Tide magazine, sitting in a cold cellar waiting for the all-clear siren, tennis parties, wartime wedding cakes with cardboard imitation icing, seeing the newly released Disney films Dumbo and Pinocchio at the cinema, billeting evacuees, fear or Goering’s plans but spirit of the Blitz.WebberExpat is also “loving” Lucia Berlin’s A Manual For Cleaning Women:A bitterly hilarious, brutally truthful, elegantly incisive collection. Wonderful, just a brilliant, up-front, trusthworthy voice. One which does not overstay its welcome, nor get too repetitive meandering between stories.The sense of growing unease is palpable. I like the way Roth explores events – mainly a growing wave of anti-semitism in an isolationist America in WW2 governed by a right wing president – through the experience of a really well-defined young Jewish boy and his family.Becoming by Michelle Obama has impressed nicegirl2:I’m not really one for reading non-fiction but this is brilliant – so well written, smart, funny and humble (so far).Visions of Gerard by Jack Kerouac haunts dylan37:A childhood in the 1920s, a saintly hero brother who disappears too soon, Catholic dreams in a Massachusetts winter, survivor guilt and a family struggling with mourning.There’s a different kind of Kerouac energy here introspective, spiritual, angelic and natural. The ghosts of the great wanderers float through these words – William Blake and Walt Whitman, with the touch and feel of sad autumn leaves. There’s that strange melancholy of a dying season, disappearing like smoke from a slow burn bonfire. A haunting and beautiful small book, about the biggest of subjects.Red Bones by Ann Cleeves has intrigued jimitron5000:There is a certain slow burning intrigue about this book. The location adds an immense amount to the story and covers for the times when not much happens. It develops nicely into a really enjoyable novel. I have read the first two and will endeavour to read the rest of the series. Funnily enough I have never managed to sit through a whole episode of the TV show.Finally, a fascinating literary nugget from Zdzisław Najder’s, Joseph Conrad: A Life, courtesy of interwar:Pursuing Joseph Conrad’s beginnings as a writer, I came across this:In March 1893 the Torrens, “one of the most famous sailing ships of its day”, set sail from Adelaide, Australia on its return voyage to London. On board was a wealthy young English barrister who had been travelling round the Pacific. From shipboard he wrote to his mother about meeting a remarkable man, the ship’s Polish mate:“A capital chap, though queer to look at he is a man of travel and experience in many parts of the world, and has a fund of yarns .... He has been right up the Congo and all around Malacca and Borneo and other out of the way parts…”John Galsworthy had not yet turned to writing and his new friend, Konrad Korzeniowski, though secretly working on a novel, had not yet become Joseph Conrad. Both would remain friends, however, as they gained fame for their fiction.If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

At least, that’s what it feels like when you’re there: it’s so vast, so utterly overwhelming. The size of Colchester is the latest comparison (as though that means anything to anyone). At night, if you stand at the back of the Green Fields, you can see the festival stretching down, twinkling, filling the valley all the way to the lit-up cross.Our tent is small, and so are you. Teeny-tiny you is inside enormous Glastonbury, part of it at all times, whether you’re being teased by drag queens in Block9, watching the sun come up in the Sacred Space, traipsing along the surprisingly quiet main drag in the heat or curled up on your coat in the foetal position somewhere between the Left Field and the Glade, wondering if you’ll ever stop shaking. It’s a Narnia of escapism, of living in the moment, a fantasy break away from the everyday. A bubble of joy – or at least a hiccup of concentrated sensation – in a world of never-ending routine. “In Glastonbury,” tweeted a friend yesterday, “my life is perfect and unsustainable.”The experience of Glastonbury is so intense and fleeting, in fact, that it seems obvious to think of it as separate from everyday life. Surely this once-in-the-year carnival is a magical world that disappears as soon as you turn your back? But Glastonbury doesn’t float above the cow fields. It is plugged into our culture, deeply rooted. Not just in its locality – this is not about the ancient mysteries of Avalon, though some of us have time for that – but in our society. Glastonbury is born of the normality that we return to its culture grows from its time.In the late 80s, when the posters for Glastonbury still made reference to1960s psychedelia and the main stage was a pyramid because a pyramid was deemed to have special powers when the drugs on offer were mostly acid and mushrooms, and the lasers were green and seemed as though they came from the future back then, Glastonbury had a DIY, anarcho feel. There was a Travellers’ camping field and soap-dodgers (dogs on strings, road warriors): a big-booted, dreadlocked scary army. They drove through the festival in their Mad Max vehicles. Around that time, Archaos, the alternative French circus, performed on top of the Pyramid stage for three nights running, with a man walking the high wire and crashed cars plummeting down the sides. What can I say? It was of its time.Glastonbury is banning single use plastics. The world’s largest greenfield festival wants to avoid scenes of the area in front of its legendary stages being strewn with plastic after the shows have ended. In 2017, visitors to the festival got through 1.3m plastic bottles.\u0026nbspFor 2019, festival co-organiser Emily Eavis said “We’re asking people to bring a reusable bottle to the festival this year, which can be filled up from one of 37 WaterAid kiosks or 20 refill stations.”People are also being encouraged to take other steps to limit their impact on the environment, such as using public transport to get to the venue, avoiding the use of undegradable wet wipes, not leaving their tents behind to prevent them ending up in landfill, and opting for biodegradable glitter instead of the plastic kind.This year the festival will also feature a procession held by climate crisis activists Extinction Rebellion.As was the Madchester Glastonbury, some time in the early 90s, when hundreds of gatecrashers came in over the wall (easiest at the back of the festival), or under it and out through a conveniently positioned tent, popping through the flap one by one like a silent comedy sketch. That time when every crowd pressure point, the tight spaces where you crossed rivers or cut back along the train track, was full of Reni-hatted scallies, pushing pills.We could be here for ages. Each Glastonbury is different. Mostly, you recall them by the mad things that happened: that one where the hippy fell out of the tree and his friends called for an ambulance by whistling down the valley to each other that one where the naked, middle-aged woman masturbated next to the bandstand that one with the man with the duck. Sometimes, you remember the bands, but they tend to be the backdrop, rather than the action. It’s the people who are the festival. Different people now, dressed differently, dancing to different music, doing different drugs. You could call this fashion, of course. Or you could call it society.From the outside, Glastonbury appears to be a festival that has, as the dads say, its finger on the pulse. It generates news: minor royals getting down with the kids “Wooh, Jeremy Corbyn”. This year, that chant has gone, replaced by Stormzy’s “fuck the government, fuck Boris” and the climate activism march through the ground by Extinction Rebellion and Greenpeace. There are more queer people at Glastonbury, drawn by Block9, and the fact that Pride is on a different weekend, for once.Glastonbury isn’t the first with trends, but it adopts them and brings them to mainstream attention, sells them to those who would never dream of going to a festival, the sofa-bound, tweeting, Fomo’d music lovers. There is an ebb and flow of influences, in and out of Glastonbury and everyday life. Health and safety culture, green activism, the fabulosity and kindness of drag queens, grime acts as pop stars. No plastic water bottles this year, everyone filling their own camping bottle from taps – this is starting to happen on the high street. And food: today’s pop-up, dirty burger, queue-forever dining experience is a direct descendant. If you’re having a meal in an indoor-outdoor food market, sitting on a wooden bench, eating from a tin plate – that comes from Glastonbury. If you’re going glamping – nature plus hedonism – likewise. Wearing sequins to an everyday event? Doing yoga, then balloons? Valuing experience over ownership? “Making” – God help you – “memories”? Glastonbury has got to you. Even if you’ve never been.“It’s amazing,” someone said to me recently, “how Glastonbury seems to be the first with everything.” Well, duh. No matter how amazing the environment, how wonderful the bands, how trippy the new head-on-its-side stage, festivals exist because of the people who go there. Festival-goers are not passive consumers of extreme experience – many are active, ha ha – they bring themselves to the action. They are the action. All the small excitements, the inidual joys, the silly moments with strangers. If you’re there, you are Glastonbury. In the words of now: it you. And though it might seem like a magical bubble, so much so that you cry when you see your front door because it’s over, you take Glastonbury home with you and, from there, out into the world.

Tasneem-Summer Khan meets a coach, an umpire, and a player inspiring girls and the game to come togetherYou won’t often hear cricket described as trailblazing it’s more commonly thought of as reactionary. However, spurred on by a summer of World Cup and Ashes cricket, women and girls all over Britain are making their mark on the sport.Asma Ajaz-Ali, a third-generation British Pakistani who grew up in inner-city Birmingham, experienced a variety of socioeconomic and cultural barriers to playing the game. Despite this lack of access to the formal game, she taught her brothers to play on an informal basis, then began running sessions for women and girls who had never before held a bat, supported by Warwickshire CC.“People think cricket is all upper middle-class men,” says Ajaz-Ali, who joined the ECB’s ambitious South Asian Action Plan, supported by NatWest, that aims to transform community engagement by recruiting 2,000 female mentors. “I go to mosques, temples, community centres, and get children and women from everywhere involved. Children see their mothers coaching and feel pride. It tells them they can do that too. These initiatives change opportunities and cultural attitudes for generations.”Ajaz-Ali prefers to focus on the future than lamenting her own lack of opportunity growing up. “I can’t bring back that time for me, but I can offer something to these girls,” she says. She sees change happening in the sport and aspires to generate more: “I have women playing in shalwar kameez, I coach asylum seekers. The point is to break down barriers and build inclusivity. Cricket is such a cool sport. It’s vibrant, it’s dynamic, and we have to try harder to make more people, particularly girls of all backgrounds, understand that.”Much like Ajaz-Ali, Laura Caughey found it hard to get a game of cricket. Growing up in Northern Ireland, she attempted to join a team as a child, only to be told she could practise with the boys but, lacking female peers, could not play in matches. “That stuck with me through adulthood and it’s not something I want more girls to experience.”Caughey decided to focus on a different aspect of the sport – umpiring. “I’d watch Simon Taufel and study what he did … he was my cricket idol growing up.” She became Ireland’s second female umpire this year when she was appointed to the representative panel of match officials.Through umpiring, Caughey has met like-minded people and helped to shape the conversation through administrative panels, eventually helping to set up and develop a women’s side at her local Carrickfergus CC. Reflecting on the enduring dismissive attitudes towards women in the sport, she says: “I just want to enjoy my season and let my on-field speak for me.”Ellie Threlkeld has been playing cricket for 10 years. She credits her experiences in mixed-gender cricket for developing skills which saw her move from the age-group county setup to playing for Lancashire Thunder in the semi-professional Kia Super League.Recognising the limited prospects for women cricketers, she opted to study psychology at Loughborough. The university’s enviable facilities and MCCU membership enable her to simultaneously develop her game and prepare for another option if cricket doesn’t work out.Threlkeld – who has ambitions to replace her England wicketkeeping heroes Sarah Taylor and Amy Jones one day – volunteers, coaches, and does ambassador work to grow interest and participation. “Assemblies get a great turnout, and girls can see how good it is to be a cricketer, but kids don’t just need role models – they need more thrown into the game so it’s an actual career.“A lot of women don’t have the option to train full-time – they need to work to earn a living. If there was money involved in the game, everything would improve faster.”With women all over the country dedicating their time and energy to the sport, barriers are shifting – new generations of girls are becoming women under the tutelage of these inspirational characters, and it’s hard to imagine anything but a positive future for British women’s cricket.For almost four decades, NatWest has supported cricket, with a mission to make the game easier for everyone to play and enjoy. A proud partner of the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) and the charity Chance to Shine, NatWest champions cricket at all levels - from grassroots support for local clubs and getting more people involved in the game to supporting current and future England stars and helping fans cheer on their teams, however and wherever they choose.With NatWest, cricket is a game that has #NoBoundaries.

And Sones received reports from other researchers of similar mass mussel deaths at various beaches across roughly 140 miles of coastline.While the people who flocked to the Pacific to enjoy a rare 80F beach day soaked up the sun, so did the mussel beds – where the rock-bound mollusks could have been experiencing temperatures above 100F at low tide, literally roasting in their shells.Sones expects the die-off to affect the rest of the seashore ecosystem. “Mussels are known as a foundation species. The equivalent are the trees in a forest – they provide shelter and habitat for a lot of animals, so when you impact that core habitat it ripples throughout the rest of the system,” said Sones.“I would expect that this actually impacted the entire region, it’s just that you would have to have people out there to document it to know,” said Sones.Years of research into ocean health has focused on rising water temperatures and the effects of acidification on marine life. Kelp and coral are suffering in warmer waters, starfish are melting, and shellfish are breaking down.But there is less data on the impacts of these kinds of one-off extreme weather events in the open coastal air. The Northeastern University marine ecologist Brian Helmuth designed a robot mussel that can measure and log temperatures as the animal would experience them.“We no longer think of climate change in the future when we do this kind of forecasting work,” Helmuth told BayNature, which first reported the cooked mussels phenomenon. “It’s how do you prepare for it now.”The University of British Columbia biologist Christopher Harley documented a similar event at Bodega Head in 2004, but he and Sones believe this one was probably bigger.“These events are definitely becoming more frequent, and more severe,” said Harley, citing diminishing mussel beds along the west coast, up to British Columbia. “Mussels are one of the canaries in the coal mine for climate change, only this canary provides food and habitat for hundreds of other species.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d49c18986d8c04f91c927c690118c1cf7c40bd2/698_367_6065_3641/master/6065.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6c74e2f853d5d25c0e8881d7f270da64","title":"alexandria ocasio cortez met greta thunberg hope contagious climate","story":"One is America’s youngest-ever congresswoman, the other a Swedish schoolgirl. Two of the most powerful voices on the climate speak for the first timeAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez enters a boardroom at her constituency office in Queens, New York, after a short delay which, a political aide hopes, hasn’t been caused by a constituent waylaying her in the corridor. (“They can get really excited to meet her.”) Greta Thunberg is in her home in Sweden, her father testing the technology for the video link while the teenager waits in the background. The activists have never met nor spoken but, as two of the most visible climate campaigners in the world, they are keenly aware of each other.Thunberg, now 16, catapulted to fame last year for skipping school every Friday to stand outside the Swedish parliament, protesting against political inaction over the climate crisis and sparking an international movement, the school strike for climate, in which millions of other children followed suit. Ocasio-Cortez, the Democratic Representative for New York’s 14th congressional district is, at 29, the youngest woman ever to serve in Congress, whose election over a well-funded incumbent in 2018 was a huge upset to politics-as-usual. She has been in office for less than a year, which seems extraordinary given the amount of coverage she has generated. In February, Ocasio-Cortez submitted the Green New Deal to the US House of Representatives, calling for, among other things, the achievement of “net-zero” greenhouse gases within a decade and “a full transition off fossil fuels”, as well as retrofitting all buildings in the US to meet new energy efficient standards.The Green New Deal, while garnering support from Democratic presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris and Amy Klobuchar, was mocked by speaker Nancy Pelosi (“the green dream or whatever they call it”), and defeated in the Senate by Republicans. Like Thunberg, however, Ocasio-Cortez gives every appearance of being galvanised by opposition, and has the kind of energy that has won her 4.41 million Twitter followers and makes establishment politicians in her path very nervous.In the course of their conversation, Ocasio-Cortez and Thunberg discuss what it is like to be dismissed for their age, how depressed we should be about the future, and what tactics, as an activist, really work. Ocasio-Cortez speaks with her customary snap and brilliance that, held up against the general waffle of political discourse, seems startlingly direct. Thunberg, meanwhile, is phenomenally articulate, well-informed and self-assured, holding her own in conversation with an elected official nearly twice her age and speaking in deliberate, thoughtful English. They are, in some ways, as different as two campaigners can get – the politician working the system with Washington polish, and the teenager in her socks and leggings, working from her bedroom to reach the rest of the world. There is something very moving about the conversation between these young women, a sense of generational rise that, as we know from every precedent from the Renaissance onwards, has the power to ignite movements and change history.Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez It’s such an honour to meet you!GT Thank you so much for standing up and offering hope to so many people, even here in Sweden.AOC One of the things I’m interested in hearing from you is that often people say, “Don’t politicise young people.” It’s almost a taboo. That to have someone as young as you coming out in favour of political positions is manipulative or wrong. I find it very condescending, as though, especially in this day and age with the access to information we have, you can’t form your own opinions and advocate for yourself. I’m interested in how you approach that – if anyone brings that up with you?GT That happens all the time. That’s basically all I hear. The most common criticism I get is that I’m being manipulated and you shouldn’t use children in political ways, because that is abuse, and I can’t think for myself and so on. And I think that is so annoying! I’m also allowed to have a say – why shouldn’t I be able to form my own opinion and try to change people’s minds?But I’m sure you hear that a lot, too that you’re too young and too inexperienced. When I see all the hate you receive for that, I honestly can’t believe how you manage to stay so strong.AOC I think the thing that people sometimes don’t realise is that here in the United States, because of the gap between the rich and the poor, people really identify Wall Street as a very potent political force. With our rules, politicians are allowed to accept campaign contributions on a level that is probably beyond what happens in other parts of the world.But what people don’t recognise is how strong the fossil fuel lobby is. The Koch brothers in the US have essentially purchased the entire Republican party, but people forget they made their money off oil and gas. That is where their fortune comes from. And I think that’s what we’re up against. So the severity of the pushback indicates the power that we are challenging. You can look at that with despair, or you can look at it with hope. That’s how strong we are: we’re so strong that we’re able to take this on credibly and actually build a movement against it.GT Yes, I mean, the oil lobby is huge in the US, and we also have that kind of lobby in Sweden. Not as much, but...AOC What is the most effective tactic in gaining attention for the environmental movement? What have you done, or what have been the practices that have been most galvanising?GT I think this whole movement in which I just sat down in front of the parliament, alone – I think that had a huge impact, because people saw it and were moved, and became emotional. Millions of children around the world, striking and saying, “Why should we study for a future that may not exist any more?” This is not only me, but everyone in the movement.GT Many people, especially in the US, see countries like Sweden or Norway or Finland as role models – we have such a clean energy sector, and so on. That may be true, but we are not role models. Sweden is one of the top 10 countries in the world when it comes to the highest ecological footprints, according to the WWF – if you count the consumer index, then we are among the worst per capita.In Sweden, the most common argument that we shouldn’t act is that we are such a small country with only 10 million inhabitants – we should focus more on helping other countries. That is so incredibly frustrating, because why should we argue about who or what needs to change first? Why not take the leading role?AOC We hear the same exact argument here. And this is the United States of America! People say, “Well, we should wait for China to do something.” There’s this political culture of people trying to say America First – that the US is the best nation in the world, yet at the same time they’re saying, “Well, China’s not doing it, why should we?”And I think it’s the same argument: are we going to choose to lead, or are we going to sit on our hands? It seems as if they take pride in leading on fracking, on being the number one in oil, in consumption, in single-use plastics. But they don’t seem to want to take pride in leading on the environment and leading for our children.GT Yes. I mean, countries like Sweden or the US, since we are rich countries, need to go first. Because people in poor countries need to be able to raise their standard of living. We have a duty to lead when we already have, basically, everything.It’s enormously easy to follow – it’s the easiest thing in the world. And there are detriments to following. You are too late. You do not control your destiny. You are not in control, period. You are often under the thumb of someone else. But it is enormously easy because you don’t have to determine the future. It seems as if, really, it’s a decision on whether we’re going to lead or not.GT Before I started school striking, I was like that. I was so depressed and I didn’t want to do anything, basically. But what I find encouraging is having all these people who are fighting on different sides in different ways, to create a better future and to make us avoid catastrophic climate breakdown.The school-striking children, when I see them – that is very hopeful. And also the fact that people are very unaware of the climate crisis. I mean, people aren’t continuing like this and not doing anything because they are evil, or because they don’t want to. We aren’t destroying the biosphere because we are selfish. We are doing it simply because we are unaware. I think that is very hopeful, because once we know, once we realise, then we change, then we act.AOC I had a similar tipping point, although it had more to do with income inequality. Many people know that several years ago I was working in a restaurant, and I had gone to college, and I had worked on so many things, but my family had fallen in to a lot of misfortune – my father had gotten sick and so on. And I was working in this restaurant and I would go, day in and day out, and I was so depressed. I felt so powerless, and as though there was nothing I could do that could effectively counter the enormous number of societal structures that are designed in the US to keep the working class poor, and to keep the rich, richer. I was really wallowing in despair for a while: what do I do? Is this my life? Just showing up, working, knowing that things are so difficult, then going home and doing it again. And I think what was profoundly liberating was engaging in my first action – when I went to Standing Rock, in the Dakotas, to fight against a fracking pipeline. It seemed impossible at the time. It was just normal people, showing up, just standing on the land to prevent this pipeline from going through. And it made me feel extremely powerful, even though we had nothing, materially – just the act of standing up to some of the most powerful corporations in the world.From there I learned that hope is not something that you have. Hope is something that you create, with your actions. Hope is something you have to manifest into the world, and once one person has hope, it can be contagious. Other people start acting in a way that has more hope.GT Yeah. I know so many people who feel hopeless, and they ask me, “What should I do?” And I say: “Act. Do something.” Because that is the best medicine against sadness and depression. I remember the first day I was school-striking outside the Swedish parliament, I felt so alone, because everyone went straight past, no one even looked at me. But at the same time I was hopeful.AOC It’s true that people don’t know when those small actions can manifest into something. I’ve seen it even in office. There’s so much cynicism about, how powerful can this be? Just me showing up?I think sometimes we’re so obsessed with measurement. What does me standing outside of parliament with a sign do? It doesn’t lower any carbon emissions immediately. It doesn’t change any laws directly. But what it does is make powerful people feel something, and people underestimate the power of that. It is becoming harder and harder for elected officials to look people in the eye.Just this morning I was sent a picture of an older gentleman from the midwest, which has just seen some catastrophic flooding – we’re starting to see flooding in the US where there was never flooding before. In the midwest there’s a disaster package that’s not getting passed, and he was just there with a sign saying, “Do you care about me?” He stood outside the congressional building, knowing that members are going to have to pass him by, and it’s very much inspired, I would say, by the actions that you’ve taken.GT I have a question. I have heard about how bad the situation is in the US with climate denialism, but I find it very hard to believe. It’s bad here in Sweden – but I have seen reports of how little the US media mentions the climate crisis and how it is treated. How bad is it really?AOC I would say that it has historically been very, very bad. But it’s actually getting much better.In the 1970s, ExxonMobil had internal science that not only definitively proved that climate change was real, but they themselves, the oil company, invested in modelling to see how bad it was going to be. Some of their models were so sophisticated that, back in the 70s, they were predicting our weather patterns as far out as 2012 – and many of them were accurate. They knew exactly what was happening.We have historically had an issue with media coverage of the climate crisis – I think they don’t realise that not covering it is just as bad as denying it. We have issues because much of our media is profit-driven, and if it doesn’t drive ratings they will not cover it as much. But we simply don’t have a choice. We have to do this.AOC Why do you think young people have been more powerful and persuasive on this issue, in particular?GT Many reasons, but I think the main one is that it is our future that is at risk. Most of us know that this is going to affect us in our lifetimes – it’s not just something that might happen in the future. It’s already here and it’s going to get worse, and many of us understand that this is going to make our lives much worse. And also that as young people, we aren’t as used to the system. We don’t say, “It’s always been like this, we can’t change anything.”AOC I’ve always said to people that youth is a mindset. And young people, we tend to come in and almost take that mindset for granted because as you said, we haven’t seen the world before, this is our first path, and so we have a tendency to question all of the nonsensical things that have just gone on for reasons of outdated logic. I have three- and four-year-old nieces and nephews, and they’re always asking, “Why, why, why, why?” For a lot of people it can be somewhat irritating. But I think sometimes it’s irritating because they don’t have the answers.You can be much older and still part of a youth movement, if you refuse to do things just because that’s the way they’ve always been done. I believe that young people just have a natural distillation of the world that is so pure. I’ve always felt that social movements, and youth movements in particular, should continue to be the moral compass that guides our vision.GT Yes, it always reminds me a lot of the Emperor’s New Clothes. Everyone believes in this lie, that only a child dares to question.I think the mere refusal to accept that can change our world. That’s exactly what you’ve done.GT I think we’ve both done that.Thunberg says that she is planning to travel to the US in August, so she can attend the UN Climate Action summit on 23 September.AOC That’s incredible. I’m so excited to follow that. Let us know how we can help from over here. I think one of the things that we need to start communicating is that this a global struggle, and it’s not about what is Sweden doing, and what is the US doing – it’s about what are all of us doing, as one movement? I think the power of that is very real. I wish you well, and I know many members of Congress who would be thrilled to meet you.GT Thank you so much.AOC Thank you so much, Greta. Be sure to let us know when you have an arrival date. If you land in New York, we will give you a Queens’ welcome!• This conversation appears in the ’s Weekend magazine and has been abridged for length.If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine’s letters page in print, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3f1a354719f00192dc073638c61a9f8f340933b/0_113_5256_3154/master/5256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2de450bfa2be8d30ca177a741305cdef","title":"cows farts children climate questions answered","story":"What are young people most worried about? We put their queries to the expertsYou are obviously both smart and thoughtful kids, so I will be blunt and tell you that climate change is already causing big changes in our world. You can see this in the melting of the ice sheets in the Arctic and Antarctica, in the rising temperatures in cities around the world, in the changes in how much rain we get, and, perhaps most importantly, in the extinction of many plants and animals that are not able to adapt.One of the most important ideas to grasp about climate change is that it is not a future event: it is happening now, in real time, and those changes will only accelerate in the coming years and decades unless we radically reduce the amount of greenhouse gases we release into the atmosphere (mostly from burning fossil fuels). That’s why we must take action now.Are the changes we are seeing irreversible? That depends on how you think about it. For example, scientists know that ice sheets have come and gone many times in our planet’s history, driven mostly by slight wobbles in the Earth’s orbit that change the amount of sunlight hitting the planet (other factors, such as the eruption of volcanoes, have also played a role). So the ice sheets we are losing today will, in all likelihood, grow back some time in the distant future. But we’re talking millions of years.On the other hand, when a particular kind of frog becomes extinct because it cannot adapt to our rapidly warming world, it is lost for ever. We humans are pretty smart and capable creatures, so I don’t worry that we’ll figure out ways to adapt. And maybe we’ll even figure out ways to make it a better world.But it will be a whole lot easier – for us and for every living thing on the planet – if we take action now to minimise those changes, both today and in the future. I really like the world we live in, and I’m sure you do, too. It is a beautiful place. Let’s fight to keep it that way.• Jeff Goodell, author of The Water Will Come: Rising Seas, Sinking Cities, And The Remaking Of The Civilized WorldScientists have published a surprising amount of work relating to animal farts and our climate. It has been hypothesised that large dinosaurs (the sauropods) may have changed the Earth’s climate with their farts. Sharks are rarely seen farting. But like sheep and goats, cows are a type of ruminant – that is, they have four stomachs. This means a lot of methane, one of the gases that causes the worst warming. One cow can produce up to 200kg of methane a year. Most of it is released as burps, but some certainly escapes out of the rear end, too! Because humans eat so much beef and milk, there are an awful lot of cows in the world, and their burping and farting causes a sizable contribution to our greenhouse gas emissions, making up nearly a third of all emissions from agriculture, by some estimates. This certainly makes them a strong contender for the animal with the farts that do the most damage to the planet (even if their burps are worse).• Dani Rabaiotti, environmental scientist and co-author of True or Poo?, Quercus, £8.99Well, the good news is that nearly all politicians in this country accept that climate change is happening and that it’s caused by human activities almost all political parties have now accepted that we face a climate emergency. This is an amazing change from just a few years ago, and it’s happened because of people like the climate strikers.But declaring an emergency and being prepared to take the necessary steps to address it are not the same thing, and politicians – especially those in government – don’t match their words with actions. For example, the environment secretary, Michael Gove, was championing the expansion of Heathrow airport at exactly the same time as apparently agreeing that there’s a climate crisis – in spite of the fact that air travel is one of the fastest-growing sources of greenhouse gas emissions.One of the problems is that most politicians won’t accept that we need a very different economic model, one that recognises that continuous growth isn’t possible on a planet with limited resources. We need to change our idea of what success looks like, so that instead of being obsessed by money, we measure human wellbeing and the health of our natural environment.There are also vested interests in maintaining the status quo. Too many powerful corporations benefit from the way things are now, and many give large donations to political parties, asking politicians to resist taking action. The good news is that ideas such as the Green New Deal are getting more support, as people recognise that investment in a green economy provides decent jobs and a better quality of life, as well as a more secure future. The role of young people in keeping up the pressure is vital – your generation is making a real difference. But we don’t have much time.• Caroline Lucas, MP for Brighton Pavilion, was elected as the UK’s first Green MP in 2010People who don’t see climate change can be frustrating because the scientific facts are so clear. But, as you’ve probably discovered, facts don’t always help people see the reality. If anything, bombarding people with facts makes them more sceptical and argumentative. So, what else can you do? Here are three things.First, it’s really important to acknowledge the other person’s good nature, and to identify common ground and shared values – areas where you have agreement. Just because someone doesn’t believe in climate change, it doesn’t make them a bad person. You probably both care about things like family and other people. Affirming shared values reduces the feeling of being attacked being argumentative rarely succeeds.Second, invite people to think about their legacy – how their grandchildren and future generations will react to their actions (or inactions). If they are willing to acknowledge even a small chance that climate change is real, don’t they want to be on the right side of the argument?Finally, be really clear that climate change matters to you, that you are personally worried about it, and that you are asking them to help address it because you are scared. Friends, family and others are much more willing to help when they realise something is important to someone they love, even when they may disagree about the facts.Daisy Furmston and Chloe Nolan, both 14,  Hemel HempsteadThis is a great question. Think about your bathtub at home. Imagine the tub is the world’s atmosphere, the water is carbon dioxide, and the tap is running. If we leave it on, eventually the tub will overflow and cause great damage to the house. The same is true of emissions. If we continue to emit CO2 at the current rate, we are going to see catastrophic consequences.So, how do we solve this problem? The first and most obvious thing is to turn down the tap – ie reduce our emissions. The good news is, there are a number of great minds working on technological solutions – from renewable energy to electric vehicles – to do just that. However, the bathtub is still full of too much water – the air is already full of CO2 at dangerous levels – and if we cannot turn the tap off completely, the tub is going to overflow. So, we are also going to need to pull the plug – and that means removing CO2 directly from the atmosphere.This may sound impossible, but it isn’t. My company has developed a technology called direct air capture that removes CO2 using large fans to pull air through a filter that has a liquid capture chemical flowing over it. That chemical binds to the CO2, removing it from the air, and then we purify and compress it.After that, we can bury it permanently, injecting CO2 into rock formations deep underground. This means we create something called “negative emissions” by doing this, we will be able to bring our global emissions down to zero at a much faster rate. Eventually, these facilities will be key to reducing the level of CO2 in the air back to safe levels.• Steve Oldham, CEO of Carbon Engineering, a Canadian-based clean energy companyGood question. We always thought that the answer is that it would take many centuries, because climate science has generally assumed that levels of CO2 will remain in the atmosphere for a very long time: that global heating is essentially locked in. We are now seeing a real awakening, by scientists, organisations and activists about how to draw carbon down from the atmosphere. We can do this by using both natural techniques, such as planting more trees, and newer technologies that can filter CO2 from the air. So then the question is: can we reduce greenhouse gas emissions to very small and manageable levels, and remove significant amounts of carbon in time to avoid runaway climate change, which could occur within 10-12 years?Whatever the answer to that is, we must do everything we possibly can sooner than we think we can, and more brilliantly and imaginatively than we think possible. “Drawdown” is the name for the point when emissions peak and then begin to go down on a year-to-year basis. But even if we achieve this aim, most people think that there would be at least a 20-year lag time before temperatures start to measurably go down.There’s always the danger that if we take too long, warming will have increased to the point where melting ice emits methane, creating yet more temperature rises. The planet is then warming itself without humans doing anything to make it happen. In that case, all bets are off.• Paul Hawken is author of Drawdown: The Most Comprehensive Plan Ever Proposed To Reverse Global WarmingYou can be very powerful when it comes to action, as -: Greta Thunberg has showned the world the power of ordinary schoolkids. This is because climate breakdown will hurt younger generations the most, and you have done the least to cause it. Most adults realise this at some level, even though they aren’t doing much to stop climate breakdown, yet. Most of us recognise our moral obligation to leave children a decent future, which obviously includes a decent planet.The main thing ordinary schoolchildren should do is find ways for your voices to be heard, loud and clear. We need everyone to wake up and realise how serious this is. Climate striking every Friday is a great start. If you get in trouble with your school, it gives you a good reason to talk to the media: your voice gets louder. Because what’s more important – staying out of detention or having a livable planet? This takes courage, it’s true, but I think we find courage in ourselves when we have a great need. And there’s no greater need than stopping climate breakdown.Other things you can do include:1. Find groups of people who already understand the seriousness of climate breakdown, and get involved.2. Talk about climate breakdown with your friends, parents, teachers, the news media.3. Learn about it so you can answer questions.4. Try out creative new ways to express the urgency, beyond school striking.5. Reduce your own fossil fuel use. “Walking the talk” makes you authentic and empowered.• Peter Kalmus, climate scientist at Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Lab and author of Being The Change: Live Well And Spark A Climate RevolutionAllow me to start with a joke: If we don’t reduce emissions, the future will be like the film Waterworld – terrible.It’s important that we learn to laugh for two reasons. First, the climate crisis is here to stay, even if we do start to fix it soon. And humour can be a coping mechanism. It can help us deal with a problem that is so overwhelming it makes us feel small, depressed or futile. You have to laugh or you’ll cry, basically. We need to find ways to survive the grief and the loss of so many things we currently take for granted.Second, and perhaps more importantly, I believe that laughter is an excellent way of reaching wider audiences and engaging people who are less interested in the topic. Comedy makes people more open to new ideas. So humour can also be used to get the message across. Laughter has a strong social function in bonding groups of people together and also helps make the message more relatable.I know this because I’m both a climate researcher and a standup comedian. I do serious science stuff during the day, but then tell jokes about the climate at night. Talking about climate change using comedy helps me think about it in a different way, and to communicate in a simpler manner. I think more scientists should try it.And, just so you know, I fully support the school strikers. I’m just annoyed that they didn’t call it the minors’ strike.• Matt Winning’s show, It’s The End Of The World As We Know, is part of the Edinburgh festival fringe. His podcast, Operation Earth, airs this summerThere are many ways that we contribute to climate change through our daily activities, often without realising it. It can be interesting to do a personal greenhouse gas inventory. Do you eat a plant-rich diet, take short showers, walk, bike, or take public transport to school, buy used clothes, repair broken appliances, hang your clothes to dry, and avoid air travel? You can find carbon calculators on the internet that help you to work out the impact of your behaviours.However, the biggest thing that most of us do that contributes to climate change is to assume that what we do does not really matter. We underestimate our own capacity to contribute to a sustainable world. We tend, instead, to assume that things just have to be the way that they are.It’s easy to forget that you can inspire your friends, parents, school and community to try alternatives, such as providing vegetarian options, improving public transport options, investing in renewable energies, and so on. Or that you can also engage in politics, and work with others for climate justice and sustainability. The potential for each of us to contribute to a fair, sustainable and thriving world is huge. We don’t always realise it, but we matter more than we think.• Karen O’Brien, professor at the University of Oslo and co-founder of cchange.no, a website aiming to give people knowledge, skills, and tools to make ethical transformationWith thanks to Poole high school, Dorset St Bernard’s high school, Westcliff-on-Sea, Essex John F Kennedy Catholic school, Hemel Hempstead, Herts, and the  Education Centre.• If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine’s letters page in print, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eaec6a7f452233bff187d15e779c45a8b61b8c2f/312_103_4351_2612/master/4351.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8c72c50aa8901ad171808449597f1e8d","title":"mums ask when cows and their calves separated rise ethical milk vegan","story":"As vegan activism boosts awareness of animal welfare issues, more dairy farms let calves stay with their mothers. But is this really any better for the cows?A field of cows with suckling calves may sound like a normal rural scene. In fact, the view at David Finlay’s farm on the Dumfries and Galloway coast is a sight you’d be unlikely to see on any other dairy farm in the UK.Almost all calves are separated from cows within hours or days of birth on dairy farms. This allows farmers to sell the milk that the calves would otherwise drink.But it is a reality of dairy farming that jars with animal welfare campaigners and consumers, and one of the sector’s three biggest emotive issues, along with giving cows outdoor access and the killing of male calves straight after birth.“It’s the one thing we’ve always been asked about by mums on our farm tours,” says Finlay. “They just don’t like seeing calves separated from their mothers so soon.”The public reaction has led to a slow growth of a new sector, calling itself “ethical dairy farming”, where the calves are not removed immediately from their mothers. One expert estimates that around 400 dairy farms in Europe and Australia are trialling methods – varying widely from one farm to the next – for what is known as “calf at foot” systems. With a herd of 125 cows, Finlay’s farm near Castle Douglas in south-west Scotland is the largest known producer in Europe to introduce the calf at foot system. But the switch, now in its third year, has been far from easy.Finlay began the project in 2017 with the hope of proving such a method could work at a bigger scale. “The first year was disastrous,” he says, admitting that he wanted to call it quits. “We just couldn’t get the cows away from the calves and into the milking parlour. For weeks we’d be dragging the cows in there.“It took a long time for them to trust that the calves were still going to be there when they came back. It was so much stress as the cows just weren’t used to it and didn’t know what the rules were.”Finlay had to be talked into keeping the system going for another year by his family and other staff after his herdsman grew sceptical about the project and left, but by the second year the cows had begun to grow used to having their offspring around.The calves still need to be separated after weaning at around five months, a process Finlay and his new herdsman Charles Ellett have learned to manage by starting off with overnight periods of separation first.“That first day we don’t open the gates in the morning though there is a huge outcry from the calves and cows,” says Finlay, who has got round it by introducing a surrogate mother – usually an older cow not producing much milk. They then use this cow to lead all the calves into a field on the other side of the farm to settle them.The initial period of overnight separation helps create social bonds between the calves, says Finlay, making the final separation easier. The female calves will then stay on the farm to become milking cows, while the male calves are sold after five to seven months to produce veal.Leaving calves with their mothers has been found to reduce mortality rates and help them grow quicker by having all-day access to their mother’s milk, rather than a milk powder substitute. The suckling can also help protect cows against mastitis, one of the biggest disease risks facing dairy farming today. However, the suckling adds up to “crazy amounts of milk” lost to the farmer to sell, says Finlay. He estimates his losses at more than 2,000 litres per cow being taken by the calf, which equates to upwards of £500 in lost revenue based on the current UK average milk price. The cows also hold back fat for their calves when taken into the milking parlour, “giving us semi-skimmed milk”, jokes Finlay.But Finlay believes the model can work and that the improvement in the health and immune systems of the young calves will yield long-term idends that will compensate, to some extent, for loss of milk. And he has already seen a surge in interest in what he is doing from across the UK and overseas.Last year he raised more than £50,000 through a crowdfunding campaign to support the farm and its cheese production facilities. Conversely, vegan activism has also helped, he says. It is the loss in milk more than anything else that Finlay thinks will put off all but a niche group of dairy farmers from ever considering it unless they can secure a premium for the leftover milk. However, he is hopeful that consumer support for more ethical farming approaches will be boosted by activism.But other dairy farmers remain sceptical of the health and welfare benefits for the cows and calves – as well as the economics of making it viable. “It’s only ethical if you don’t know what the downsides are,” says National Farmers’ Union dairy board member Phil Latham, who runs a dairy farm in Cheshire and separates his calves at one week.“Yes, the calves get to spend more time with their mother, but there are a whole host of compromises with an increase in disease risk from the mixing of different age groups and a lack of control over the calf’s food intake. The longer you leave the calf on the cow, the bigger the stress when you do separate them.“It’s pandering to urban ignorance. If he can get a market premium from doing it and survive the milk losses then good luck to him, but it’s not about maximising welfare in my mind,” he says.Helen Browning, dairy farmer and CEO of the organic trade body the Soil Association, separates her calves and cows within 24 hours, but then keeps them with a surrogate mother cow who has been retired or rested from the dairy herd. Under organic standards, calves are separated from their mothers after birth, but are always kept in groups and must be given cow’s milk for their first 12 weeks.“Calves hate being weaned and cows hate their calves being taken away, whether after one day or five months. But it is better to do it before a bond has developed. In nature cows would live together as a family with cows and their grandchildren and great-grandchildren, so we are already interfering a lot with that family process,” she says.In terms of cow and calf health and welfare, farm vets say separation is not a priority. “If you really want to improve animal welfare then we should try to tackle lameness, calf mortality and ensuring the calf gets sufficient quantities of colostrum,” says Dr Kathryn Ellis, a farm animal vet at the University of Glasgow.Browning says dairy farmers are looking to learn from what Finlay is doing, but that the industry still needs to think through what is best for the welfare of both calves and cows being kept to produce milk. “We should think about what issue we’re trying to resolve. Is it an emotive issue or a welfare issue? I think it is the former.” Despite the scepticism, Von Keyserlingk estimates that more than 400 dairy farms are trialling calf at foot systems in Europe and Australia. Not far from Finlay’s farm in south-west Scotland, another dairy farmer keeping calves with their mothers has recently started selling his milk to consumers at £1.59 a pint.“This could be the norm in 20-30 years, just as tie-stalls were in the past. But it’s a fundamental change for how farms operate so we need to help farmers figure out how to make it better for the health and welfare of cows and calves and at the same time practical for farmers,” says von Keyserlingk.“To better support farmers in this transition, new research is needed on how these systems may be managed to function best for the cows and calves, including reducing the risk of currently common production diseases such as mastitis and lameness,” she adds."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0bb97ca99ff5c2f1ad3b85fef98d4db234512cb6/193_522_4891_2934/master/4891.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=21ac40635f99cd01fce42d9120852d2c","title":"plan to sell 50m meals electricity water air solar foods","story":"Solar Foods hopes wheat flour-like product will hit target in supermarkets within two yearsA Finnish company that makes food from electricity, water and air has said it plans to have 50m meals’ worth of its product sold in supermarkets within two years.Solar Foods is also working with the European Space Agency to supply astronauts on a mission to Mars after devising a method it says creates a protein-heavy product that looks and tastes like wheat flour at a cost of €5 (£4.50) per kilo.The Helsinki-based company, assisted by research from the VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland and the Lappeenranta University of Technology, will apply to the EU for a novel food licence later this year before starting commercial production in 2021.The powder known as Solein can be given texture through 3D printing, or added to dishes and food products as an ingredient.It is produced through a process similar to brewing beer. Living microbes are put in liquid and fed with carbon dioxide and hydrogen bubbles, which have been released from water through the application of electricity. The microbes create protein, which is then dried to make the powder.Dr Pasi Vainikka, the chief executive of the tech startup, said the company had produced a carbon-neutral way to produce a fully natural protein source without wasting land or water. Pre-engineering on a full-scale factory had just started, he added.“It is a completely new kind of food, a new kind of protein, different to all the food on the market today in how it is produced as it does not need agriculture or aquaculture,” he said.The foodstuff was said to mark a break with a thousand years of production. “If we go back in time in the gatherer societies we have just been using more of the same, plants and animals,” he said.Vainikka said he did not expect his product, which he described as the world’s most environmentally friendly protein, to challenge farmers in the next two decades but that it was a “new harvest for the people”. Three-quarters of the world’s calories originate from 12 plant and five animal species.Half of the world’s habitable land is used for farming and scientists claim the peak catch for the fishing industry, in terms of efficiency, was 20 years ago.Vainikka said the powder could be an “ingredient like any ingredient in the food” or it would be possible to “make the powder into fibres that resemble meat or bread”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/61efa9ba100dec32f2bf79448bf896adecc50497/0_0_4068_3179/master/4068.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=a5805fec3d8b6305c27339400c47ee9b 2020w","title":"meera sodhas vegan recipe for mango sticky rice","story":"Treat yourself to a pillow of chewy, sticky rice laced with coconut and the freshest, sweetest new-season mangoMy relationship with mangoes can be split into two halves: before I first ate Thai mango sticky rice at a roadside shop called Maewaree in Bangkok, and after.Before, I thought of myself as a mango purist (I am Indian, after all) and that nothing could beat an alphonso fresh out of the box. But I was wrong. There is something extraordinarily special about the marriage between milky, sweet coconut and delightfully chewy sticky rice that brings out the best and sunniest side of any mango. Eating it is pure joy, so make it while you can (ie, while mango season lasts).I rarely advocate buying new kitchen kit, but an inexpensive bamboo steamer is worth its weight in gold (for foolproof steamed rice, or to steam shop-bought or homemade dumplings, if nothing else).

Add enough cold water to cover the rice, then leave it to soak for around four hours. Meanwhile, line the top layer of a bamboo steamer with muslin. Drain the soaked rice, then put it inside the steamer and, using your fingertips, even it out, so it sits in a thin layer. Wrap the sides of the muslin over the top of the rice and put the lid on the steamer.Fill the pan in which you will put the steamer with 2-3cm cold water and bring to a boil. Lower the heat to a simmer, carefully lower in the steamer and leave to cook for 20-25 minutes, or until the rice is tender.While the rice is cooking, scrape the coconut cream into a small saucepan, add the sugar and salt, and stir to mix. Bring to a boil, then take off the heat. Peel the mangoes, cut off the four “cheeks” from each one (eat the rest another time, or immediately) and thinly slice each cheek.When the rice is cooked, unwrap the muslin – take care, because the steam will be very hot.

Peter Gerhardsson’s Sweden matched them stride for stride, though, with the impressive Stina Blackstenius striking what proved the winner early in the second half.The game, which featured drinks breaks as players battled the heat, came to life on 13 minutes as Sweden’s Sofia Jakobsson was released down the left channel by a Kosovare Asllani pass, only to see her effort blocked by Almuth Schult. Three minutes later Lina Magull opened the scoring at the other end, lashing in a superb turn and volley.Germany’s lead lasted six minutes, though – Jakobsson equalising with a fine breakway finish. It was the first World Cup goal Germany had conceded since they lost to England in 2015’s third-place play-off and the blow clearly rattled them. The half ended with Sweden on top, encouraged by a series of defensive panics in the German box.Germany replaced Linda Dallman with Dzsenifer Marozsan at the break in a bid to regain the momentum but within two minutes were behind, Blackstenius blasting into the roof of the net from close range after Schult parried Fridolina Rolfo’s header.Germany laboured to find a way back but their dominance of possession was restricted to the middle of the park, Sweden holding their defensive shape and still threatening on the break. Blackstenius went close again on 72 minutes and Schult kept out a fine Jakobsson effort with 12 minutes left.Germany had claims for a late penalty turned down via a tense VAR check after Alexandra Popp was clattered, before, deep into added time, Marina Hegering, under pressure at the far post, flashed a header high and wide.• Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure discussion remains on topics raised by the writer.

Now, two days on from that wonder strike against Norway, she is back on terra firma in Lyon, the French city that has long been the ultimate finishing school for her and other world-class players, preparing for England’s Women’s World Cup semi-final against the USA on Tuesday.“The standard across Europe is set by Lyon,” says Bronze, who moved to the club from Manchester City in 2017. “We’re so far ahead of so many teams. In training every day it’s 11 internationals v 11 internationals, so I’m having to defend against the world’s best strikers every day.“At the start it was hard, and for the first month I couldn’t get near the ball in training. Then I got up to speed. It’s definitely been the right move.”The bald statistics are striking. Lyon have steamrollered their way to the last 13 titles in France’s Division 1 Féminine, as well as the last four Champions Leagues, making them without any doubt, the greatest club team in women’s football history. For good measure they also have 16 players at this Women’s World Cup, including England’s Nikita Parris, who recently joined from City, as well as the Ballon d’Or winner, Ada Hegerberg, who declined to play because she did not think Norway’s setup was professional enough.Hegerberg’s tone is very different when it comes to talking about Lyon, calling them “the perfect model of how you should run a modern club”. You can see why. While many other clubs pay lip service to women’s football, Lyon push it at the front and centre.The women’s teams from the academy upwards, for instance, share facilities with the men – including training pitches, medical staff and a cryotherapy chamber. There is also “the mental cell” which helps with the psychological pressures of performing. And as Dahbia Hattabi, the Lyon correspondent for Foot Mercato in France explains, ideas are exchanged and fermented between staff too. “There is a lot of interaction between coaches of both teams, and the players know each other well too,” she says.“Everything is together for both teams to think only football. The only difference is that the men play at Groupama Stadium, while the women only play there for big matches, usually in the Champions League.”Lyon’s president, Jean-Michel Aulas, who started the women’s team in 2004, also regularly comes to watch and provides charter jets for the players. Recently he also recruited a new coach, Jean-Luc Vasseur, who has managed in Ligue 1 with Reims. It is difficult to imagine an English Women’s Super League club attracting – or being able to pay – someone with such experience. “But you notice the little things at Lyon too,” says Laetitia Béraud, a women’s football writer at Le Monde. “For instance they will often weigh each player before and after training and matches to track hydration levels in order to make sure each player is at their best level. That shows how professional the club is.”But Béraud insists there is something else as well: an understanding that both sexes are treated the same way from the top level down to the kids. “I am 26 now, but even when I was growing up in Lyon we knew the club was scouting girls as well as boys to join their academy,” she says. “It seemed normal to us. Only later did I realise how radical that was. It allowed girls to dream they could make it as a professional too. Over the past decade a lot of the French team players have come up through the Lyon system.“I’d also highlight the attitude of the men’s team too. At training it is not unusual to see them happily watching and waiting for the women to finish. In many clubs the women would be not be allowed to use those same facilities – they would be for the men’s teams only.”Crucially, they pay well, too. When L’Équipe published the salaries of the top French players at the World Cup they were led by Lyon’s Wendie Renard and Amandine Henry on €29,000 (£26,000) a month, with several other Lyon players on between €10,000-€18,000. Meanwhile Hegerberg is reportedly on somewhere around €34,000 a month. True, Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo will earn a dozen times that in a week. But for the women’s game these are extraordinary figures, especially for a team that does not regularly attract more than a few thousand supporters each week.It is also telling that Lyon recently sold their TV rights to Canal+ for €1.2m a year. In 2017 that same deal was for €200,000 leading you to wonder what it might be in another two years’ time.So how have Lyon been so successful? It helps that they established a women’s team early. They were not quite the first movers – Montpellier established their women’s team before them – but they were up and running in 2004, while most English clubs only started to merge their operations when the women’s domestic league turned professional in 2010. Incredibly, two of the biggest clubs in Europe, Manchester United and Real Madrid, have only launched women’s teams in the past year.Lyon’s men dominated French football in the early 2000s but a sharp dip in their performances coincided with the national women’s team reaching the semi-finals of the World Cup in 2011. “That was a revelation,” says Béraud. “We had never seen women’s football on public TV and when the semi-final happened a lot of people got interested, they saw a lot of players were from Lyon. That definitely sparked a massive interest in the women’s team. Now they are very popular.”Hernandez also cites the smart recruitment policy – which has included bringing in the captains of Germany and Japan, Dzsenifer Marozsán and Saki Kumagai, as well as players such as Bronze and Parris – as important factors. However, he insists it is not just about money.“PSG and Manchester City could spend more money on the women’s game than Lyon, and maybe one day they will. But can they replicate the culture?” he asks. “That is the big thing here. The women’s players really feel like they are part of the club. Other teams might let them wear the shirt but otherwise they make them feel like second-class citizens.”And Hattabi, who follows Lyon more closely than most, does not see their superiority ending any time soon. “They always want to win and they plan to dominate France and Europe for several more years,” she says.“And it’s not like they are resting on their laurels. There are young players like Selma Bacha and England’s Nikita Parris arriving so the next generation is ready – and waiting to fire.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/631d241e3870bc8c963a170c1e70d0015a47c872/0_368_4227_2537/master/4227.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c757fc1b5bfb6cfd5ab3c91cbb3f97b4","title":"worry trafficked uk first legal red light zone leeds holbeck","story":"Leeds’ managed zone for prostitution was meant to make life safer for women, but, amid a firestorm of opposition, who is benefiting from the radical approach?During the day the Holbeck industrial zone looks pretty innocuous. Perched on the southern edge of Leeds city centre, it backs on to residential streets peppered with betting shops, newsagents and takeaways.Yet at night this industrial zone becomes something very different. It transforms into the UK’s first designated red light zone where, between the hours of 8pm-6am, street prostitution operates openly with neither the women nor the sex buyers facing prosecution.Prostitution is not illegal in the UK but related activities, such as soliciting in a public place, pimping and kerb crawling, are unlawful. By suspending these laws and creating a wholly decriminalised market for prostitution, this radical approach – known as the “managed zone” – has transformed a banal square mile of industrial buildings and scrubland into an ideological battleground, revealing the bitter isions over the response to prostitution in the UK.Five years on, as Leeds city council faces a firestorm of opposition and an inquiry is opened into the future of the zone, I went back to Leeds to see how the managed zone has affected the lives of those who live and work around Holbeck.For the women who work in the zone at night, the biggest change is that they no longer face the prospect of arrest. Sarah* worked the streets of Holbeck “three or four times a week” until last December to fund her and her boyfriend’s heroin and crack cocaine use.She says that before the managed approach was introduced, things were awful. Now she doesn’t have to worry about the police.“I was constantly looking over my shoulder, worried about getting picked up by police,” she says. “I was arrested something like 20 times in the five years I was doing it, and I could never pay the fine, so they would come looking for me and I’d sometimes get arrested again.”The managed approach was launched by Leeds city council in 2014 after research found that efforts to reduce prostitution weren’t working.Those who support the managed zone passionately believe that what is happening in Holbeck is an opportunity to make life safer for the women working there. Equally fierce opponents – of which I am one – believe it has created an open street market for sex buyers and promotes trafficking and exploitation in one of the UK’s biggest cities.I ask Sarah if she feels safer working in the zone as opposed to outside of it.“I don’t know about safe, but I hate being arrested. It makes me feel like dirt,” she says. “The punters are just the same, they’re pretty horrible, but I don’t see any other way it can be done. I don’t want to get arrested, and a lot of the girls say that the police used to pick on them because they just thought they were scum. To be honest, I don’t think the zone can really do anything other than keep it contained for a while.”Basis Sex Work, a pro-sex work NGO receiving funding from the city council to provide services to women on the zone, believes the approach has helped women report violent punters to the police. One report claims that since the launch of the zone, women are now six times more likely to report violent crime than they were in 2013.Its chief executive, Gemma Sciré, says that the zone has made a crucial difference to their work, helping them reach women who are in desperate need of essential services and support.“We give out alarms, we take crime reports and make sure when it’s cold or hot that they have the basic human necessities of food, drink, warm clothes,” she says. “We help them navigate the legal system.”Sciré and I fundamentally disagree on what is happening in the zone. She doesn’t consider the work that the women are doing to be exploitation and insists that from their experience those in the zone are working freely and without coercion. Yet she demurs when I ask her whether the managed zone is working out the way she thought it would.“I can’t give you a yes or no,” she says. “It works in some ways, but it needs more work.”Others who were involved in designing and launching the zone are less circumspect.Mark Dobson works for Leeds city council and was one of the main architects and champions of the zone when it launched.But now he’s changed his mind. He was badly shaken by the murder of Daria Pionko, a Polish woman working in the zone who was battered to death by a sex buyer just a few months after the zone became operational. He says he is dismayed by what he has seen unfold on the streets of Holbeck since, including reports of increased sexual assaults and rapes.“People told me that we were supporting the women, and moving away from a very draconian system where the women were being punished by the police,” says Dobson. “In fact, what’s happened is the amnesty has clearly been there for the men, but I can’t see anything tangible that’s been done on the other side of the equation to take women out of prostitution.”Leeds city council has also failed to stem the rising tide of local anger towards the zone.Ian Staines set up a flooring business 1993, in the heart of what would become the managed zone. When I visit him at his place of work, he says that the impact of the zone on him and other residents has been traumatic. He says after a local woman was raped in 2018 on her way home from work by a group of men who assumed she was soliciting, many don’t consider their community a safe place to live.“Murder, serious assault, and rapes have all taken place on the zone. We see condoms and needles all over the place, and even human faeces,” he says.There have been no arrests or investigations for sex trafficking or pimping since the zone opened. Yet despite this, Staines says that he, like many other locals, are worried about what might be happening to the women working there at night. One woman who used to work in the zone told me that she saw busloads of Romanian women brought into the zone at night and picked up in the morning. Nigel Perry, another Holbeck resident who has lived in the community 50 years in a small terrace house a quarter of a mile from the zone, is also alarmed by what he is seeing.“Next door to me there are two or three young Romanian women. I have only ever seen one of them leave the house in months, and she was accompanied by a man. I worry that they are trafficked. Men come to the house all hours of the day and night. I don’t think the women can speak any English.”Supporters of the zone point to the lack of arrests of pimps or traffickers as evidence that no criminality is occurring in the zone. But Kevin Hyland, the former anti-slavery commissioner who headed up the politan Police anti-trafficking unit, says this doesn’t mean it’s not going on. According to an all-party parliamentary group on prostitution and the global sex trade in 2018, sex trafficking is happening on an “industrial scale” across the UK, going undetected by police officers and ignored by punters.“There’s plenty of evidence – I’ve seen it firsthand myself – that taking a hands-off approach, and effectively removing law enforcement increases the flow of trafficking,” he says. “If demand is not challenged, then sexual exploitation will continue and will increase.”I ask Gemma Sciré about rumours of trafficking. She calls it a “very difficult term” and says that in their experience, the majority of women working in the zone are doing so of their own free will. Sciré says there are “migrant sex workers” in the zone who come from countries such as Romania and Poland and says they don’t have much contact with them because “clearly they are fearful of authorities because of previous experience in their own countries”.For Basis, the benefits of the zone are that women are no longer being arrested and stigmatised, has better access to its services, and can be helped to find alternatives to prostitution. But what about the punters?On a street just outside of the zone, a lone man sits in his car, hazard lights on. I asked if he would be happy to talk to me about coming to the zone to pay for sex. I explained I was a journalist, and he agreed to talk.“I get lonely,” says Henry*, “but I’m too selfish to put up with somebody 24-hours a day. I like female company so this is a good arrangement. They get money for their drugs or whatever, and I can release some frustration. Mind you, some of the girls don’t make any effort at all.”I asked Henry if any of the women have pimps. “Most have a pimp or a boyfriend who’s sending her out for his drugs,” he says. He tells me that he has witnessed a lot of violence on the zone from “angry, drunken blokes”. I asked if he often sees police in the area, and he tells me “no”. “They ride around sometimes just so they are seen, but other than that, we can do what we like. That’s how it should be, it’s a free country.”Does it work, I ask Henry? “It works for me,” he says.*Names have been changed to protect identities"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/94db4220ab43513b167afd449f9abb828b3ff973/0_960_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?width=220\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e2248646fd29de6690548ade80d28132 220w","title":"a simple guide to finding the right travel insurance for you","story":"Travel insurance is hardly the most exciting holiday purchase, but it’s one of the most important. So, before you head off to warmer climes, check out this simple guide to holiday insurance to make sure you’re fully covered …Travel is said to broaden the mind, but for peace of mind it makes sense to secure the right travel insurance before you head off.According to Compare the Market, almost one in four people fail to take out travel insurance, leaving themselves at risk of returning home with a hefty bill should the worst happen – according to the Association of British Insurers, the average cancellation claim is £816, while the average medical claim is £1,300. Ouch!That’s not to say that the world of holiday insurance is easy breezy. With so many different policies on the market, narrowing down the right one for you can feel like an overwhelming chore.But fear not, travel fans – we’ve simplified the world of travel insurance to help you secure the right policy for your trip in a jiffy …Is travel insurance really necessary?Look, no one’s going to stop you from travelling without insurance, but it really wouldn’t be advised. We all head off in the hope that our trip will be all sunshine and poolside margaritas (well, some of us do!), but sadly not every trip is quite so blissful.Medical claims are one of the highest costs facing insurance companies. The NHS might treat us for free, but medical care in other parts of the world can come with a sizeable price tag, and some hospitals overseas may not even treat you unless they know you can pay for the care.So whether you fall ill, have a valuable item stolen or have to cut short or extend your trip due to an emergency, forking out for travel insurance could save you big bucks in the long-term.One size does not fit allTravel insurance is like a good suit – it’s got to be tailor-made. There are almost endless variables to consider from whether you want single trip or annual cover, to the number of people you want to include on the policy, and the activities and eventualities you want to insure against.Yes, finding the right travel insurance can be a tricky business. If you’re not sure where to start, Compare the Market is a good port of call. Not only can it provide you with an impartial and independent comparison of policies from a range of UK providers – based on your specific needs – in just a few clicks, but the travel insurance section of its website also has FAQs and helpful pointers (including sections specifically dedicated to different types of trip, such as golf holidays, backpacking and family trips) to help you narrow down your options.Read the small printAs with all insurance policies, when purchasing travel insurance, it’s really important that you READ THE SMALL PRINT! Check you’re happy with the excess (ie the amount you’ll have to pay towards any claim you make), ensure you’re definitely covered for all the activities you’re planning on doing, and double check you’re satisfied with the circumstances under which you’ll be able to make a claim.There is one more vital detail to check with travel insurance – how the country you’re visiting is classified geographically. Yes, you might think a country’s location is set in stone, but that’s not quite the case when it comes to travel insurance. Insurance providers group some countries differently for instance, while some classify Egypt and Turkey as Europe, others class them as “worldwide” destinations.Don’t leave your travel insurance to the last minuteIf you’re one of those people who gets their travel money at the airport, this point is probably for you! Smart shoppers bag their travel insurance as soon as they’ve booked their trip. Why? Because if your holiday is cancelled or delayed you should, depending on the terms of your precise policy, be able to claim for it – which ought to take some of the sting out of the situation.Head over to comparethemarket and get a travel insurance quote for your next trip.

But we can do more to bring the laws on marriage ceremonies up to date and to support couples in celebrating their commitment,” she said.The Law Commission published a report in December 2015 that raised concerns about the inconsistency of marriage laws, which have not faced wholesale reform since 1836.The justice secretary, David Gauke, said: “Whilst we will always preserve the dignity of marriage, people from all walks of life should be able to express their vows in a way that is meaningful to them.“This review will look at the red tape and outdated rules around weddings – making sure our laws are fit for modern life.”The Law Commission will consult with faith groups and other stakeholders, and produce recommendations in 2021.The announcement was first mooted by the chancellor, Philip Hammond, at the budget last autumn, but Downing Street has highlighted a series of policy reforms in recent days, as May tries to show she has a legacy beyond her Brexit travails.The initial Law Commission scoping review of wedding venues was commissioned by the Tory-Lib Dem coalition government, five years ago, and found that a wider choice could make marriage “both cheap and personal”.But the government’s response then was to warn that a review would throw up complex wider issues. In particular, there were concerns about providing equal treatment for religious and secular ceremonies.And the issue continued to be left on one side as the government was consumed with Brexit. The then justice secretary, Dominic Raab, said in September 2017: “Now is not the right time to develop options for reform to marriage law.”May has only now chosen to commission the next part of the reform process, as her three-year premiership draws to a close. “This review will look at how we can ensure marriage keeps pace with modern Britain,” she said.A wider range of venues is already available in Scotland. In England and Wales, the choice is governed by the Marriage Act 1949, which says the ceremony must take place in a narrow range of premises including a church or register office or an approved venue such as a hotel.The law could be changed to allow weddings to take place outdoors, or in temporary structures such as marquees – but a final decision to press ahead will be left to May’s successor."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19fc3ed9a11f9c83a60551d5793f86ef340ea00d/0_0_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=297a2ded4d230f4c5260e2a75b015f5a","title":"blind date adam james","story":"What were you hoping for?A man with integrity, a great sense of fun, a passion for carbs, and loyalty, courage and honesty.First impressions?In the best possible way – an absolute sweetheart.

I am grateful beyond measure that I have been able to feed her. It wasn’t always thus.Gallia’s older sisters, my identical twin girls, Raffaella and Celeste, now aged three, were born 10 weeks early. They needed oxygen to breathe, an incubator to regulate their temperature, intravenous nutritional support and a nasal-gastric tube that dripped breast milk directly into their unready stomachs to sustain them in place of their lost umbilical cord. They weighed just a shade over 2lb each and they would spend 56 days in hospital before they were well enough to come home.I lay in the aftermath of an emergency caesarean while a gentle midwife showed me the distinctly ungentle manoeuvres required to hand-express. She squeezed and squeezed, but the tears that slid down my face came more readily than colostrum. My breasts had expected two more months of pregnancy they were as unready as the rest of me. In the end the midwife left with 0.4ml in a tiny syringe. In the days that followed, the babies’ needs were so modest – 1ml an hour between them – but it was still more than my body would yield.For two days my scant production was supplemented with donor milk. In their first days the feeding tube went into their mouths, for their nostrils were too little even for the tiniest of lines. A syringe was screwed on to the top of the tube, the plunger depressed, the whole “feed” over in moments – 0.5ml is about five drops, less than you would feed a day-old kitten. But those scant droplets were keeping my daughters alive. I stood by, feeling useless, guilty, grateful. I had failed to keep them safe inside my body and now I was failing to provide the scant nourishment they needed.But somewhere out there I felt the presence of another mother – and I felt supported, nurtured by her care. Here, take this. I have, you need. I felt so close to her I could almost see her face. She was anonymous, yet there were things I knew about her: she had a new baby. Without doubt, she had her own worries. Yet her generosity made possible the miracles that were my daughters. She offered up her antibodies to newborns in a state of terrifying immune compromise. She held my hand and we shielded the babies as best we could from necrotising enterocolitis (death of the bowel) and from sepsis, from deadly bacteria and viruses. Because of her, I was granted space to heal, to catch up, to learn.I expressed and expressed. I Googled and cried, and then I expressed again. There was a surprisingly robust uniformity of opinion on the internet, and sources ranging from science to quackery. But it was generally agreed that the following are good for the production of breast milk: malt, porridge oats, dark beer, garlic, black sesame seeds, carrot juice, barley, asparagus, brown rice, almonds, alfalfa, fenugreek. As two-thirds of my meals came from a hospital vending machine I opted for supplements, ignoring “directions for use” and swallowing fenugreek capsules until I began to smell like a chicken curry. Spice permeated my skin my breath and sweat took on its tang. Who knows if it worked, but my milk soon came in – probably it always would have done.After a day or two we no longer needed donor milk. But those days were not an inconsiderable gift: research has shown that for the tiniest premature babies, born with immature guts and immune systems, formula milk increases the incidence of necrotising enterocolitis (NEC), one of the most feared killers in neonatal intensive care. In 2016, a study in the Journal of Pediatrics found that formula-fed infants were at a higher risk of developing NEC compared with those who were breastfed, and an article the same year in Pediatrics found specifically that the increased availability of donor milk is associated with reduced incidence of NEC.Donating breast milk isn’t widely publicised and is woefully under-funded. It is a constant frustration to services that there are more than enough willing milk donors around the country, but the banks do not have the financial wherewithal to process, store and distribute sufficient stock. Despite the well-established proven health benefits of breast milk for both pre-term and full-term infants, there is not the funding to ensure equal distribution around the country. Access is patchwork, dependent upon local trusts and policies.Donating breast milk is not the same as milk sharing, a practice as ancient as wet nursing. The Facebook page Human Milk 4 Human Babies UK has 23k likes, and steady traffic around the country offering and requesting milk. But while milk banks screen and pasteurise, milk sharing is informal and, crucially, unscreened for viruses and pathogens. Exclusive breastfeeding is what we are told, endlessly, is best, and an inevitable consequence of such educational campaigns is that mothers who struggle to nurse their babies are left feeling inadequate, without necessarily having access to the support that might enable them to overcome their early difficulties. But new models might permit safe provision to home and hospital. The Hearts Milk Bank provides milk to neonatal units and to mothers struggling to feed. Priority goes to women who cannot feed due to chemotherapy, mastectomy or illness and to babies with bowel or terminal illnesses who cannot tolerate other food. With greater funding, they hope to be able to provide lactation support and safe donor milk to anyone who needs it. “Ninety per cent of mothers who want to breastfeed stop before they intended to,” says Natalie Shenker, co-founder of Hearts. “If everyone had support with breastfeeding after giving birth, including access to a lactation consultant and donor milk where necessary, breastfeeding rates in the UK could be transformed.” Thinking I was an old hand at the pumping game, I didn’t register as a donor until I had the requisite two litres in the freezer. I was familiar with the hygiene protocols required from my own days expressing in a hospital, so I thought I knew what I was doing. I filled out a lifestyle questionnaire and had a chat with a nurse on the phone. It all looks good, she told me. They would send a courier for the milk and once they had received it I would go to my local hospital for a blood test: HIV, syphilis, hepatitis B and C. Just one more formality – what temperature was my freezer? It has to be -18C, she said, or colder. Still on the phone, I padded into the kitchen where -16C was illuminated in red. I peered sorrowfully into the bottom drawer in which 37 bags of milk were stacked between boxes of fish fingers and Soleros. “Yes, of course.” Softly I closed the door, and took a breath. “Minus 18. No problem at all. I’ll start again.” Yes, but just “think of the calories,” said a friend.I write this, as I write much else, attached to a breast pump. They have come on light years: these days I have no ghastly ca-thunking locomotive soundtrack, no Carry On protuberances, no flanges. Breast pumps have always been ludicrous: one part agricultural, two parts penis extender. In the milking shed of the newborn intensive care unit, we sat in a circle, tits out, conversation punctuated by the obscene slurp and suck, and the wheeze of the motors. Occasionally someone would turn theirs up too high and yelp other times we would get distracted, chatting, and someone else would begin to overflow, and make the inevitable spilled milk joke, even as the tears began to fall.My twins are bonny and well. The trauma of their first months is behind us, but I will never forget it, nor would I want to. I pump after Gallia has had her morning feed, and then in the evenings once she’s down and I have collapsed on the sofa I wander around the house on the classic parents’ nightly perambulation, picking up Duplo, recovering abandoned socks. It has so easily become part of my routine that I barely think about it five minutes here, 10 minutes there, not enormous amounts, but a slow accretion in the freezer, until sooner than you’d think it is time to call the courier. I am fulfilling a promise I made to myself, long ago.Mother Ship by Francesca Segal is published by Chatto \u0026amp Windus at £14.99 or £11.49 from bookshop.

You may not have given much thought to what animal-based products crop up in your house, but there are many: fabrics, from silk to wool to sheepskin, are an obvious example – but is your mattress vegan? What goes into your cleaning products, or your energy provider? And is there such a thing as vegan loo roll?The fact is, you can take a vegan approach to choosing almost anything for your home – and it needn’t be complicated or expensive. Next time you have to replace an item or redecorate a room, shop around for vegan options – you’ll be surprised at what’s available.Many people choose to go cruelty-free at home for compassionate reasons, but there’s a compelling ecological argument, too. The environmental footprint of vegan products is dramatically smaller than that of those derived from animals they also tend to use far fewer chemicals in their production. (The leather used to make a sofa has to be heavily treated with resins and preservatives, for example. With a plant-based alternative, you’ll avoid exposure to these types of substances.)Some big retailers stock vegan homewares, including John Lewis, Habitat and Ikea. Soft furnishings are an easy place to start. Manmade versions of animal-derived fabrics are often more affordable than the real thing, and perform well, too. There are vegan fabrics made from recycled bottles (try weavergreen), leathers made from pineapple fibre (try parkinfabrics), and acrylics or other synthetics, linen, PVC, satin and cotton (opt for organic cotton, though, as its production is far less damaging to the environment).Paints are trickier: they often include animal derivatives and most have been tested on animals, so you’ll have to pay a little more for plant-based, vegan alternatives. The good news is that these are often VOC-free, giving off none of the unpleasant chemicals that can trigger health problems. Lakeland paints are vegan, and Auro offers a vegan range, too.If you’re choosing wooden furniture, think about how the timber is sourced. Trees provide habitats for thousands of different species and the climate-altering effects of deforestation are well known, but we don’t always consider this when investing in a new chair or table. Look for FSC-certified items or those made from reclaimed wood. Or consider bamboo: it grows speedily and uses little water in its production. To make sure your new purchase hasn’t been varnished or glued with animal-derived products, you’ll need to look for certified vegan items: check out peta.org.uk, treehugger, or online vegan department store wearthlondon for ideas.Cleaning products are a bit of a minefield, with product-testing an issue and animal derivatives in many items but there are plenty of options out there. If the thought of scrolling through lists of ingredients sounds as interesting as watching your plant-based paint dry, don’t despair: look for products that carry the Vegan Society or Leaping Bunny logos, or visit veganwomble for lists of homecare products.While you’re rethinking everyday purchases, avoiding plastics is an obvious step that will have an impact on the wellbeing of countless species: how about investing in some good old-fashioned handkerchiefs instead of plastic-wrapped tissues? In fact, reconsidering your choice of personal care products (from condoms and razors to sanitary items) can make a huge difference, and there are vegan versions of all of these.What about other supplies we need? A major cost for most of us is our energy bill: is it possible to make a vegan choice when it comes to our provider? Surprisingly, yes. Green energy is a step in the right direction, but just because a supplier uses renewable energy, it doesn’t make it vegan. One energy source used by many companies is anaerobic digestion (AD), an eco-friendly process in which micro-organisms are used to break down waste, including animal, and produce biogas. It’s a green process that reduces our toll on landfill and the amount of methane released into the atmosphere, but it’s not a vegan one (octopus.energy has a more detailed explanation). But this year, Ecotricity launched as the UK’s first certified vegan energy provider, guaranteeing that there’s no trace of animal by-products used in its production. Vegan living is simple. It’s about making informed decisions every time we buy something, and about sending a message to producers at the same time: that we don’t need animals to suffer so we can fill our pillows or clean our dishes. By making ethical and compassionate choices, we can still enjoy a beautiful home, while doing all we can to safeguard the place where we all live – our planet.If you’re revamping your flooring, go for sustainable cork (colourflooring is launching a carbon negative cork floor in early July), lino tiles, or reclaimed wood (vegandesign.org and veganhaven are great cruelty-free resources). Use recycled glass, stainless steel or bamboo storage jars, rather than plastic – these don’t need to be high-end purchases: think Argos, Amazon and Robert Dyas. Use vegan-friendly cleaning brands such as Dr Bronner’s, Astonish, Bio-D, and Method. Some supermarket own-brands are vegan, too – check their websites, or mix up your own cleaning solution with white wine vinegar. Swap beeswax wraps or clingfilm for vegan food wraps (from thewisehouse). For tableware, try the Uma recycled glass tumbler and carafe from thegiftedfew.

Exhibit A: Robin Day’s 1964 Forum sofa, pioneering in its mix of oak and steel. There are folkish wooden dolls by the architect and designer Alexander Girard – “another hero of ours”. Next, a prized set of tumblers made as commemorative souvenirs for the New York World’s Fair of 1964. “It was a showcase for midcentury architecture and design: the last hurrah for the American dream before the realities of the Civil Rights Movement and the Vietnam War set in,” says Mark, warming to this theme. “Each one is a piece of social history.”They wish their south London home was an example of enlightened, postwar architecture, too. “We’d always imagined ourselves living on a 1960s estate with a shared garden and garage for the Mini, that’s how geeky we are,” says Keith. But modernist houses are rare so the couple, co-founders of interiors business Mini Moderns, settled for this contemporary townhouse instead. Tucked behind a Victorian terrace, on the site of a former print factory, the three-storey property is part of a development of 15 live-work houses designed for the creative businesses – photographers, artists, designers – who give the mews its communal feel. Flowers and sculptures sit outside front doors in summer the ground-floor double-height studios turn into party venues. “We like the friendly atmosphere. We’ll water our neighbour’s lavender when she’s away and friends take in deliveries if we’re out,” says Keith.From the studio, we head upstairs to the three-bedroom duplex where Burt Bacharach drifts from the speakers and light streams in through the wide windows. “When we moved in this was a featureless, magnolia box with horrible surfaces. So we said right, let’s eradicate the worst bits and give it a 1960s townhouse vibe,” says Mark. Out went the carpet (“a cat magnet”), replaced by wooden floors painted grey for a vintage Linoleum effect. New sliding doors lead to the compact, monochrome bathrooms.The couple insist they are not purists (a bank of sleek fitted wardrobes is from Ikea), but almost all the furnishings here have provenance. In the bedroom, George Nelson’s 1948 Bubble pendant glows next to a chair designed by Ernest Race for the Festival of Britain in 1951. Inspired by another design idol, Gio Ponti, they also designed the floating ply bedside tables and strikingly tall headboard that adds to the streamlined feel.Initially, they painted everything white, but gradually the house has become a testing ground for their midcentury–feel designs. “If we can live with them, then at least we know other people can, too,” says Mark. The pattern-loving couple grew up in Yorkshire and all their designs spring from the “warmth” of shared memories. “We never met as teenagers, but we did all the same things. We watched 1960s films on Channel 4. At weekends we went to junk shops and spent our pocket money on 1950s wire fruit bowls or painterly curtains which we’d turn into shirts for Saturday nights out,” reminisces Keith.The blue and white waves of their “Whitby” wallpaper evokes summer holidays on the Yorkshire coast (“Spain hadn’t been discovered then”), while “Art Room”, adorned with oil lamps and African masks, pays homage to sixth-form still-life classes. In the hallway, graphic “Pluto” (inspired by dazzle camouflage) clambers over the walls and ceiling, adding to the feel that you have tumbled into an Op Art painting.When they launched in the mid-1990s, some of the duo’s earliest clients included the Southbank Centre, Radio 6 and John Lewis. Now their vibrant Paisley design, inspired by Hanif Kureishi’s Buddha of Suburbia, hangs in the permanent collection at the Whitworth Art Gallery in Manchester.Wallpaper also brings colour to the staircase, which rises to the top floor. Like that yearned-for 1960s house, this is the main living area: kitchen, dining area and sitting room flow towards the long terrace. Here, walls were removed to open up the boxy landing. “It didn’t take much to make the place feel much sleeker,” says Keith. New doors, in a mix of plywood and paint, transformed the developer kitchen into their design ideal: “Frank Guille’s 1958 kitchen for the British manufacturer Kandya to be precise.” The G-Plan sideboard belonged to Keith’s mum (“I was too late to save the rest, which went on the bonfire,” he laments), the clunky 1970s Trimphone still rings “very loudly” and the compact Danish dining table, bought at the annual Midcentury Modern Show in Dulwich, southeast London, flips open to seat eight: “Another example of good design.”That teenage compulsion to rummage through market stalls for overlooked gems has never left them. Pocket-money finds – Susie Cooper cups, orange-spined Penguin books – have been joined by more sophisticated purchases, such as 1970s West German studio and sculptural crockery, designed by Susan Williams-Ellis for Portmeirion in the 1960s. “We only collect olive green.” Their favourite pieces are displayed on the flat-pack “String” shelving which has travelled with them from previous, rented homes. “The system was designed in 1949 by husband-and-wife team Nils and Kajsa Strinning for a publisher who was looking for an affordable, easy-to-install way to display books,” says Keith. “It’s never been out of production since – which is just the kind of anecdote we like.”Mid-Century Modern Living, by Keith Stephenson and Mark Hampshire, is published by Kyle Books (£20).

Still, it’s always better to wilt than to drip because sunshine magnifies the potential of any artist. When the Proclaimers opened the Pyramid stage on Saturday with songs as benevolent and beloved as I’m Gonna Be (500 Miles) and Sunshine on Leith, the field was already one giant open goal.The previous day the weather was a good friend to two very different exporters of Californian good vibes. Glowing with professionalism, Sheryl Crow was “How y’all feeling out there?” in physical form while Mac DeMarco’s hungover ruminations were even more ragged and idiosyncratic than they are on record. Rain would have hobbled both of them.The fact that two out of three Pyramid headliners are white rock bands is a misleading anomaly on Glastonbury’s most erse bill yet, with many American stars materialising at Worthy Farm for the first time. Lauryn Hill led a faultless band through her first and only album, 1998’s The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill, but appeared to be distracted by a long war of hand gestures with the sound technician, with the result that a slick performance of a classic album somehow failed to connect. Far more inviting was Michael Kiwanuka, who managed to tap into everything great about 70s soul without ever straying into pastiche. His band’s disco-flavoured expansion of Black Man in a White World was an extraordinary alloy of indignation and joy.There’s no substitute for the palpable delight of artists who have waited years for their big Glastonbury moment. Outgrowing their mid-afternoon billing, Bastille played as if they were headliners, bringing along backing singers, a brass section and guest star Lewis Capaldi. Frontman Dan Smith proclaimed their set “our favourite gig ever”, before a packed field sang Pompeii back to him.Joe Talbot from Idles went one better by sinking to his knees sobbing with emotion at the Park. The Bristol punk band draw their life-or-death intensity from their refusal to hold anything back. When Talbot talked about coming to Glastonbury at a low point in his life, to be part of something bigger, the crowd rallied around him, making for a cathartic, unforgettable performance. “We’ve waited our whole lives to do this,” he said with hoarse conviction.Fast-tracked to superstardom, Stormzy’s status as Glastonbury’s first black British headliner alone would have made his set a landmark, but he transcended all expectations. Headlining the Pyramid stage on Friday night, his opening salvo of politically charged grime, lit up by lasers and jets of flame, was merely the first act of a beautifully structured set, full of surprises.What began with one man on stage – in a union jack stab vest designed by Banksy – steadily blossomed into a multifaceted celebration of black British life, adding musicians, gospel singers, ballet dancers, BMX riders and – a curveball, this – Chris Martin from Coldplay. Even as the 25-year-old MC grinningly declared it “the most legendary night of my entire life,” it wasn’t a triumph for him alone. By inviting Dave and Fredo to perform Funky Friday, their landmark rap number one from last year, or reeling off a list of pretty much every MC in Britain, he was symbolically bringing everybody else with him.It was Stormzy’s generosity as much as his ambition and energy that put this in the same league as Jay-Z’s 2008 headliner, which brought hip-hop to the Pyramid stage, and even Beyoncé’s fabled Coachella sets. It is one thing to deliver an exceptionally crafted performance without a dull moment it’s quite another to use your platform to champion a whole culture. Historic and then some."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57890de28a02e65a1b358e6d1025af202ded9961/0_215_3219_1931/master/3219.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=25bd0afbc4885d13a5c87f4959a0e97d","title":"lewis capaldi at glastonbury 2019 review laughter through the tears","story":"Other stageHis self-deprecating schtick can’t last long in the face of such huge success, but the Scottish songwriter’s A-grade banter helps offset his sad ballads“Glastonbury, do you like rock’n’roll?”, Lewis Capaldi asks the sprawling Other stage crowd at the start of his set, as if about to launch into a rollicking Great Balls of Fire. And then, with perfect comic timing: “Well, you have come to the wrong fucking set my friends. However, if you like questionably chubby young men from Scotland to sing sad songs, you’re in for a treat.”And boy, are they sad. So universally so, that they start to bleed into one another like the ink on a tear-stained love letter. Beats from Carl Cox’s four-hour set in the Glade cut into Capaldi’s more spartan songs, like a mate telling him to cheer up. Had it been raining, as it so often does at Glastonbury, this could have been insufferably dreary. But Capaldi has such charisma, and such a beautifully burnished soul voice, that the majority of this set is engaging, and at times moving.He begins with a flourish of the banter that so importantly offsets the sadness of his songs: the video screens play Noel Gallagher’s disparaging “who’s this Capaldi fella”?” interview, and Capaldi emerges dressed as Gallagher in a parka, swiftly removed to reveal a T-shirt with Gallagher’s face embedded in a heart. This breezy pisstaking is quickly directed towards himself. “I hope you don’t hate it” is how he introduces Hollywood “Man with breasts plays Glastonbury” is another self-descriptor. Headspace is introduced thus: “This one is really fucking sad, and it’s six minutes long, so hold tight”. This schtick could tire quite quickly from here on out – he’s playing to thousands of people who love him and his album has been at No 1 for five of the last six weeks – but for now it’s a tonic between the devastating heartbreak of his piano-and-guitar ballads.He could do with more songs like Hollywood, which has a George Ezra-ish bounce to it along with a touch of the Mumfords, and Grace, a slick and sturdy piece of soft-rock gospel (he sadly ducks out of trying to reach its arresting top note, though). Hopefully, come album two, he’ll let his songwriting elide with his more buoyant side – there could be such joy in seeing him be joyful. But when those power ballads have melodies as sturdy as Someone You Loved, they hit you right between the tear ducts.On record, there are times he can tend to be mannered: letting his voice break to denote the most acute sadness, and doing some very strange bleating things with his vowels that go way beyond his broad Scottish accent. But live, these are bled out as he projects his voice towards the hills surrounding the Glastonbury site. There’s an almost doo-wop quality to the way he brings in his falsetto when he deploys it on Forever, it is eerily like fellow bantering blubberer Adele.After all the self-deprecation, his evident joy at seeing thousands of people sing Someone You Loved back at him has hopefully persuaded him that he really is adored. But he has a final quip to anyone who remains unconvinced: “If you haven’t enjoyed it, keep it to your fucking self.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8317cf770cefe11fd131bf3492416051c31ac6f5/0_117_2979_1788/master/2979.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=260daf4482918d8f1b94d819bada8ce3","title":"stormzy glastonbury review pyramid stage","story":"Pyramid stageNot only is this headline performance a show of supreme talent, it also underlines how Stormzy’s talent and charisma has pushed forward UK rapThe notion of Stormzy headlining the Pyramid stage at Glastonbury is an intriguing one. On the one hand, an artist who’s only released one album being elevated to such a rarefied status – up there with Jay-Z, Paul McCartney, U2 and the Rolling Stones – seems unprecedented. On the other, a persistent rumour around the site suggests that Stormzy’s show cost more to stage than any other in the festival’s history. That may or may not represent one of the histrionic myths that annually circulates around Worthy Farm – festival-goers with long enough memories to remember Glastonbury before the arrival of the internet and its fact-checking powers may recall the story that used to go around in the 1990s that Cliff Richard had unexpectedly died. But watching Stormzy perform, you can believe it. His set opens with the kind of pyrotechnics most acts would use to triumphantly conclude their performance, and it doesn’t let up from that point on.You could argue that constitutes an attempt to bedazzle anyone who doesn’t think the 25-year-old rapper has enough material to fill a headlining set, but his performance passes without the kind of lulls you might expect from an artist without years and years of hits to draw on. Bulking things up by wheeling out a cover of Shanks and Bigfoot’s UK garage chart-topper Sweet Like Chocolate proves an inspired move, likewise performing his remix of Ed Sheeran’s Shape of You.The sense of all stops being pulled out is hard to miss. If the first three songs pass with Stormzy on stage, with only his union jack vest, his DJ and an intense light show for company (the latter comes complete with a ticker tape that, instead of news events, shows the names of south London boroughs) that quickly changes. There’s a ballet interlude – designed to underline the fact that black ballet dancers now have shoes designed to match their skin tone – there’s a vast gospel choir, there are dancers, complete with a little kid busting moves, there are children on bikes popping wheelies as Stormzy performs Vossi Bop. There are also special guests: if Ed Sheeran can’t be here in person, then Chris Martin from Coldplay can, playing keyboards and harmonising on Blinded By Your Grace Pt 1.For all the eye-popping, OTT aspects of the show, there’s something very human and touching at its centre. When not imperiously rapping, Stormzy looks genuinely overwhelmed by the size of the crowd he’s drawn on what he describes as “the greatest night of my life”. Another guest, fellow rapper Dave, congratulates Stormzy at length on his achievements before leaving the stage, and, under the circumstances, it doesn’t feel like hyperbole. As Dave seems to suggest, Stormzy’s sheer charisma and talent have elevated an entire generation of black British music. Stormzy himself pays tribute to a string of new-school British rappers as varied as Little Simz, Not3s and Slowthai – and all of them would not be in such a strong position without Stormzy.As he performs Shut Up, the track that turned him from an underground figure to a mainstream phenomenon, or stands centre-stage amid an explosion of confetti with arms outstretched before launching into Big for Your Boots, Stormzy’s performance doesn’t feel like a personal triumph so much as a victory lap for British rap: after decades as US rap’s poor relation, here it is, headlining the biggest music festival in the world in considerable style."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac0b7cd86e3e7bda5ed22c75821e7ef99c498270/0_207_5895_3537/master/5895.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a14cd8904226a1e646f99813b958d695","title":"ebola is back can it be contained podcast","story":"The current outbreak of the deadly virus in the DRC has been called the most complex public health emergency in history.

Political, security and cultural complications – not least a refusal to believe that Ebola exists – have thwarted efforts to overcome the Democratic Republic of the Congo’s deadly outbreak. Senior global development reporter Peter Beaumont tells Anushka Asthana about his recent trip to North Kivu, which is at the heart of the recent outbreak. He discusses why some health officials are calling it the most complicated public health emergency in history.  health editor Sarah Boseley,  who reported on the 2014 outbreak, looks at how that was contained – and why the situation is potentially far more frightening this time round.  And: the ’s northern editor, Helen Pidd, looks at whether the “northern powerhouse” has been a success five years after its creation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9481ae4c8c169b2b550da9e0c2d07185b014a76/114_339_3325_1995/master/3325.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6e50f96fa6ad85726f09435567e17047","title":"g20 may asks saudi prince for transparency in khashoggi case","story":"Prime minister urges open legal process over murder and raises Yemen concernsTheresa May has raised concerns about the murder of Jamal Khashoggi and the humanitarian cost of the conflict in Yemen during a face-to-face meeting with the Saudi crown prince at the G20 summit in Osaka.The prime minister held a bilateral meeting with Mohammed bin Salman on Saturday at what will be May’s final global summit before she steps down in July.A senior government official said May had called for an open and transparent legal process in the case of the Saudi journalist who was murdered in Istanbul – and underlined the importance of the relationship between the UK and Saudi Arabia.“On accountability for the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, the PM said the legal process needed to be open and transparent,” the senior official said, adding that the pair had “concluded by agreeing on the importance of the relationship” and of “regional stability”.Khashoggi was brutally murdered at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October last year. Riyadh has claimed the attack was a “rogue operation,” and has put several people on trial behind closed doors. But a report by a UN special rapporteur recently found that Khashoggi had been “the victim of a deliberate, premeditated execution, an extrajudicial killing for which the state of Saudi Arabia is responsible”.On the conflict in Yemen, the official said: “The PM reiterated the need to keep working on finding a political solution to end the conflict, which is causing significant humanitarian suffering.”UK arms exports to Saudi Arabia were ruled to be illegal by the court of appeal earlier this month because of the government’s failure to assess the potential humanitarian impact of the weapons’ use in Yemen.Delivering the judgment, Sir Terence Etherton, the master of the rolls, said ministers had “made no concluded assessments of whether the Saudi-led coalition had committed violations of international humanitarian law in the past, or during the Yemen conflict, and made no attempt to do so”.The UN has called the conflict in Yemen the world’s worst humanitarian crisis, estimating in February that 17,700 civilians had died, and 3.3 million people remained displaced.The international trade secretary, Liam Fox, has said the government will appeal against the ruling.May’s demeanour as she met the crown prince did not appear as frosty as it did when she met Vladimir Putin on Friday, when she upbraided him over the Salisbury poisoning, calling it a “truly despicable act”.May also told the Russian president she would continue to defend liberal values, after he gave an interview to the Financial Times in which he claimed liberalism was “obsolete” and made light of the poisoning of the Russian former spy Sergei Skripal in the UK."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b836be8892adbee7a634e239393cf4504de13d10/0_87_2982_1789/master/2982.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=87b652c0292280fb79d8ec2cad1e2363","title":"how brexit party won euro elections on social media","story":"Analysis highlights key to success of Farage party and identifies dozens of pro-Brexit bot accountsThe Brexit party used simple messaging, an active social media presence and a “overwhelmingly negative” attack to win the online battle before the European elections, according to a new analysis of the campaign.The analysis also identified dozens of pro-Brexit party accounts with a “high likelihood of being inauthentic”. The accounts were all created relatively recently, had Brexit party profile pictures, tweeted dozens to hundreds of times a day, and posted almost exclusively about Brexit.From posts made between 5 April and the election, The Brexit party made 212 to Change UK’s 62 posts. It received 325,900 shares, compared to Change UK’s 7,200 shares. Change UK’s messaging was criticised as complex, suggesting that a vote for them would lead to a second referendum, which would in turn allow the British public to have a final say. The Brexit party’s posts were more direct and emotionally charged, compelling followers to “save democracy, support Brexit”, or help Britain avoid humiliation. The Brexit party’s Facebook posts were an average of 19 words long. Change UK’s were 71 – more than three times longer.In 212 posts, the Brexit party avoided talk of immigration or the benefits of Brexit, focusing instead on the idea that cancelling Brexit would be undemocratic, or as they’d put it: “This isn’t about left or right, it’s about right and wrong.”Mike Harris, the chief executive of 89up, said: “The Brexit party’s social media campaign is a lesson for the pro-Remain parties who were significantly less effective during the European elections. The Brexit party spent less than a tenth of Change UK, the Greens and the Liberal Democrats in the last week before the elections, but had significantly more reach and engagement with the public.“While some of this was potentially due to inauthentic bot activity, a lot was due to the clarity and simplicity of their messaging which the Remain parties must learn from.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ab309586e55bd02f5ee85455752643cf5918b5e/0_2614_3370_2021/master/3370.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=28f1928947d8c7bea65c453b3c93bace","title":"share your experiences of sure start childrens centres","story":"Whether you helped set up the programme in your area or your family used a centre near you, we would like to hear your storiesThe flagship Sure Start programme has saved the NHS millions of pounds through the benefits it has brought to children including some of the most deprived areas and reducing the number of those taken to hospital, according to a study.Research by the Institute for Fiscal Studies “found that where Sure Start offered high levels of service in poor neighbourhoods in England, visits to hospital to treat injuries fell among all children of primary school age, and by a third of all 11-year-olds”.Tracy Brabin, the shadow early years minister, said: “This research shows the critical role Sure Start plays in children’s health, as well as their development.

In making it the Monégasque, who has repeatedly proved his credentials as a future world champion, beat the current title holder, Lewis Hamilton, into second. For Hamilton, however, the place he had secured at the Red Bull Ring was far from certain. In the balance for two hours he was ultimately given a three-place grid penalty for impeding Kimi Räikkönen.With F1 suffering from Hamilton and Mercedes dominance this season, the front of the grid in Austria at least now represents a truly intriguing proposition. Red Bull’s Max Verstappen starts alongside Leclerc on the front row. Valtteri Bottas is in third and with Hamilton gaining a place due to Kevin Magnussen’s penalty from fifth, he is in fourth in front of McLaren’s Lando Norris. On the short, tight circuit in the Styrian mountains this should present a mighty battle in the opening laps.Hamilton was investigated by the stewards for impeding Räikkönen’s Alfa Romeo at turn three in Q1. He was close to the inside line when the Finn looked to go through on a quick lap, although he went wide as soon as he was aware of Räikkönen. Having spoken to both drivers, the stewards concluded Hamilton had not taken sufficient action and forced Räikkönen to abort his lap.“Totally deserved the penalty today and have no problem accepting it,” Hamilton wrote on Instagram. “Was a mistake in my behalf and I take full responsibility for it.”Hamilton had already been well beaten by Leclerc, who has been on fine form here and pulled off a series of superb laps under great pressure. He laid down his marker with his first hot run in Q3, with a time of 1min 3.208sec, before putting his second lap exactly where he wanted it. On the final runs he improved with a time of 1:03.003, this time two-tenths up on Hamilton.It was far from a perfect weekend for Ferrari, however, as Sebastian Vettel suffered a mechanical problem in the final session and set no time, finishing in 10th. Ferrari discovered a problem with the air pressure line in Vettel’s engine between the second and third sessions, but although the team worked furiously on it he was unable to emerge for the final runs. He will start in ninth because Magnussen has a five-place grid penalty for taking a new gearbox.Hamilton has started from behind the front row only once this season and that was third to Leclerc’s first F1 pole in Bahrain, another race where Ferrari had the edge. They held the advantage here but before the results of the steward’s inquiry Hamilton was bullish about his chances.“Of course I’ll be pushing for the win tomorrow,” he said. “Ultimately that is always the goal but it is not going to be easy to get close and pass the Ferraris as they have been very, very fast all weekend. Of course I’ll give it absolutely everything.”He will be disappointed but the stewards have imposed penalties four times for impeding this season. Williams’s George Russell was also given a penalty here and Hamilton’s punishment is consistent with those decisions. Nor will it greatly derail his season. He still leads Bottas by 36 points and Vettel by 76, while Leclerc trails his teammate by a further 24.The day, however, was undeniably Leclerc’s. It is his first pole in Austria and one he will be optimistic of converting into his debut F1 win. He was hugely unlucky in Bahrain not to take the flag after he dominated the race until a mechanical problem relegated him to third. Having spoken about needing to adapt to changing track conditions in the final part of qualifying, he did so superbly in Austria. Now he must simply repeat the form when it matters on Sunday.The Alfa Romeos of Räikkönen and Antonio Giovinazzi were seventh and eighth, with Pierre Gasly ninth for Red Bull. Renault’s Nico Hülkenberg was in 12th place but will take a five-place grid penalty for using his fifth engine of the season. His teammate, Daniel Ricciardo, was 14th. The Haas of Romain Grosjean was 11th.McLaren’s Carlos Sainz was 15th but will start from 19th having taken an entire new power unit and gearbox for this race. He is joined at the very back by Toro Rosso’s Alexander Albon, who took a slew of new components but qualified 13th.Sergio Pérez and Lance Stroll were 16th and 17th for Racing Point with Daniil Kvyat 18th for Toro Rosso. George Russell and Robert Kubica were 19th and 20th for Williams."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/379c82424e0b1a756dcb3e173a833adbad08333e/0_34_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=06581a8f9d1eda4078486e9fd3910a62","title":"new zealand v australia cricket world cup 2019 live","story":"Australia ensured they finished above the Black Caps with victory at Lord’s with Mitchell Starc and Usman Khawaja their key men“The wickets haven’t been what a lot of people thought,” says Kane Williamson. “They’re perhaps a bit tired.” They have been strange pitches. Virat Kohli said today that everyone was expecting England to dominate in their own conditions. But they haven’t been English conditions at all: neither the green seamers of yesteryear, nor the buffet-bar flat tracks of recent ODis in England. The pitches have been slowish, often two-paced, and two-faced – promising runs but delivering wickets, mainly to fast left-armers. Starc took five today, to become the first man ever to take three World Cup five-fors in a career Trent Boult took four, including a hat-trick, which ended up as a magnificent irrelevance. Thanks for your company and your emails to Geoff and me. The OBO will be back tomorrow to see whether India really are invincible – and England are doomed.About 45 minutes ago, Pete Salmon sent this email. “I’m predicting an India v Australia final! Who’s with me?!” The exclamation mark is the clue: the real question is whether anyone is not with Pete. The big four in this tournament has turned into a big two. Australia are now further out in front, with 14 points from eight games, while their only conquerors, India, are second with 11 from six. New Zealand have 11 too, but from two more games, and now with a much worse net run rate (0.57 to India’s 1.16). Pakistan have crept up to fourth with nine from eight. Somebody with three defeats is going to fiddle their way through to the semis: England have to make sure it’s them....is not Mitchell Starc. Clearly taking five for 26 is not enough. The award goes to Alex Carey, which is fair comment in a way as he turned the match with his fluent strokeplay.A game that seemed beautifully poised turned out to be nothing of the sort. It wasn’t really a cricket match at all – it was a pair of sadistic experiments. The Aussies, who had been relying rather too heavily on their openers, decided it would be fun to collapse to 90-odd for five, to see if the lower order could bail them out. It did, thanks to Alex Carey, the only man on either side to come in and find the boundary consistently – he hit 11 fours in his 71, which was six more than Usman Khuwaja in his 88, and nine more than any New Zealander. Armed with 243, which shouldn’t be enough, Australia made it even harder for themselves by seeing if their captain Aaron Finch could set a new world record for the most bowling changes in a one-day innings. He chopped, he changed, he behaved like Mike Brearley on speed. He used eight bowlers, many of them starting with one-over spells. It was like insisting on hiring a Volkswagen Beetle when you already have a Bentley. The Bentley, when he went back to it, cruised out and ran over the New Zealanders, who went from 97-2 to 157 all out in 18.1 overs. They were both timid and chaotic at the same time: it was as if they were suddenly being managed by Boris Johnson.It’s all over. Starc is now so dominant that he can take a wicket with an awful ball. It’s short, it’s wide, it’s going for at least one wide and possibly six, until Santner helps it round to long leg. That is a drubbing.43rd over: NZ 157-9 (Santner 12, Boult 2) Santner has been watching this nonsense from the other end, and he’s had enough. He swings Lyon for six, then has such a big mow that his inside edge is missed by Carey behind the stumps. Lyon’s figures can afford to take a slight dent: he finishes with 10-1-36-1.42nd over: NZ 144-9 (Santner 5, Boult 0) So that’s a wicket maiden for Starc, who now has the frankly ridiculous figures of 9-1-26-4.Nice moment for the pub quizmasters: Trent Boult, who took a hat-trick earlier, comes in to try and stop Mitch Starc taking one. And he succeeds, getting neatly behind a straight one. Finch, so much for being Mr Funky, gave Starc only a slip and a gully for that ball, when Steve Waugh would surely have had six slips, two gullies, a silly point and a short leg.Yet another one. Starc’s nip-backer is too good for Lockie Ferguson, taking out his off stump.40th over: NZ 141-8 (Santner 4, Ferguson 0) Yet another wicket for the majestic Starc. He now has 22 wickets, as many as he got in the whole of the 2015 World Cup, when he was Player of the Tournament. With the clatter of wickets, I didn’t have time to look at Twitter, where a news story may now be developing. “Is that Smith on the grandstand boundary?” says Michael Keane. “Looks like stuff’s being thrown at him.” Three minutes later he tweets again: “Now lots of security. Getting ugly. And a naval officer. F**k’s sake people, this is Lord’s.”Another one! Starc is reversing it now and his inswinger comes booming in to pin Sodhi in front. Sodhi reviews, but it\u0027s umpire’s call.39th over: NZ 136-7 (Santner 3, Sodhi 4) A New Zealander plays a decent attacking shot, at last, as Ish Sodhi lofts an off-break from Lyon over the man at short fine leg. That was like a sweep played with an upright bat. It’s all over bar the tiny innovations.Desperate times, desperate measures: Jimmy Neesham tries the skies too and Lyon says “that’s mine”.38th over: NZ 131-6 (Neesham 9, Santner 2) Starc’s seventh over goes for just a single. Early on, there was a big four in this tournament. Then England had a wobble and there was a big three. Now it’s a big two. The last half-hour means that Australia are more likely to avoid India in the semis, and therefore meet them, back here at Lord’s, on July 14.And here’s Geoff Wignall again. “Aren’t the Aussies just taking the opportunity to play around with and test their bowling options in a game they don’t especially need to win but are going to anyway?” he wonders. “A bad day for England - points for Pakistan and final game incentivising for NZ.”37th over: NZ 130-6 (Neesham 8, Santner 2) A better over for New Zealand: nobody gets out. They need 114 off 13 overs at a rate of nearly nine.36th over: NZ 126-6 (Neesham 4, Santner 1) So that was three wickets for seven runs in four overs. Devastating from Australia, dismal from New Zealand – but they should still make the semi-finals. If England lose tomorrow, not only do India go through, but they take NZ with them, as England would then be unable to get more than 10 points, and NZ already have 11. Whether they will go any further is doubtful: their excellent early form is draining away.Latham chips into the leg side, and Smith, cheered by that wicket, takes off like a salmon and catches it like a retriever going after a frisbee. Game over, I suspect.35th over: NZ 124-5 (Latham 14, Neesham 4) On the progress chart, the black worm is almost going downwards, waving goodbye to the yellow one. These two have 18 off 41 balls between them. They could reverse that in the next three overs and still have a battle to get over the line.34th over: NZ 121-5 (Latham 13, Neesham 2) Off goes Cummins and back comes Lyon, who whistles through an over for just a single. NZ need another 123 off 16 overs, which suddenly looks like far too many. 33rd over: NZ 120-5 (Latham 13, Neesham 1) So, at last, one of the funky bowling changes comes off. Finch deflects the credit, giving two thumbs-up to the Australian balcony, where Justin Langer is sitting with Ricky Ponting. There had just been a drinks break, smuggled in when Taylor was out, so maybe the message was sent out then. Well bowled Steve Smith, who tried several googlies in that over. The commentators think the wicket-taking ball was one of them, but I reckon it just went straight on.How do you turn a drama into a crisis? Launch your first ball, which is also the first ball of a new spell from a part-time leggie, straight to long-off. Oh dear.32nd over: NZ 118-4 (Latham 12, de Grandhomme 0) Taylor had just played a handsome pull for four, so he can’t have been feeling too tied down – maybe he was intoxicated. Anyway he tried to be Viv Richards and the upshot is that NZ have lost both their big wickets.Taylor suddenly hits a full ball straight up in the air. I can’t even work out how he did that. It stays up there for several minutes, and when it finally comes down Carey does well to keep calm and cling on. Australia are on top. 31st over: NZ 112-3 (Taylor 25, Latham 11) You’ll never guess what’s just happened. A bowling change! Lyon’s off-breaks give way to Maxwell’s, which is like replacing Paul McCartney with Noel Gallagher. Maxwell, to be fair, goes for only three, but I’m not sure what Finch is doing here – he could win it with just his main men.“Good afternoon,” says Ed Smyth. “Surely the answer to what happens to the ball in this heat is that the sunburn makes it a Test ball?” Ha. The four serious bowlers are making it feel like that.30th over: NZ 108-3 (Taylor 23, Latham 9) Finch continues his bid for the world record for bowling changes in one innings by taking Starc off (5-0-18-1) and recalling Cummins. He starts with four dots and rattles both batsmen with his bounce. 29th over: NZ 107-3 (Taylor 23, Latham 8) Another good over from Lyon nearly brings a run-out, as a direct hit comes in and Latham saves his skin by scraping some of it on the pitch, with a very committed e. I haven’t been bothering with the run rate required, as it’s been so modest, but it has now reached six and a half. 28th over: NZ 104-3 (Taylor 22, Latham 6) Starc concedes only a single. Latham is right out of form, which can perversely help a batsman – no better time to clamber out of a slump.The bowling figures are showing that there’s a reason why part-timers are part-timers. Smith, Finch, Stoinis and Maxwell have combined figures of 6-0-34-0, while the four proper bowlers have 22-1-67-3. We’re watching two different ball games.27th over: NZ 103-3 (Taylor 22, Latham 5) It’s as if all those part-time bowlers were just a dream. Finch, fully awake now, brings back Lyon, who bowls a better, sharper, more testing over than 0-6 might suggest. 26th over: NZ 97-3 (Taylor 21, Latham 1) So Finch, after being too funky, finds exactly the right note. And Starc is the first man to 20 wickets in this World Cup. The top five are all seamers, and Jofra Archer is the only right-armer, outnumbered by Starc, Lockie Ferguson, Mohammad Amir and Trent Boult.“How is the heat affecting people?” asks John Starbuck. “You’d think the Aussies would be right at home, otherwise why would they live in an extreme country? It’s warm here in t’north but not properly hot, which I gather is the case down south. Does it do anything significant to the ball, though?” It makes it a bit grumpy.What do you do when your bowling changes suddenly go wrong? You make another one. Finch summons a proper bowler, Mitchell Starc, and he does the business, moving one away from Williamson for a regulation caught behind. That’s the big one.25th over: NZ 92-2 (Williamson 36, Taylor 20) Maxwell bowls something so slow that Williamson changes his mind a couple of times before driving it, whippily, to mid-off. He picks up a single which takes him to 6,000 in this format. What a player he is, and he confirms it by hitting his next whippy drive in the air, over mid-off. Off the past five overs, New Zealand have doubled the scoring rate (six an over rather than three). And all they’ve had to do is help themselves from the hotel buffet. 24th over: NZ 85-2 (Williamson 31, Taylor 18) A caption shows that Kane Williamson now has the most singles of any batsman in this World Cup, nudging – or nurdling – ahead of Joe Root. As if hearing this, he suddenly produces a six, flicked into the Mound Stand off Stoinis. That’s the first six of the day, as the world’s best players do their best to turn the 50-over game into Test cricket. 23rd over: NZ 77-2 (Williamson 23, Taylor 18) As a captain, you have to treat yourself the same way you treat your troops, so Finch banishes himself after a single over, same as Smith. He continues the merry-go-round by sending for Maxwell. The batsmen say thank you very much and enjoy their cartons of milk. Has Finch been too funky? 22nd over: NZ 73-2 (Williamson 22, Taylor 15) Finch makes his fourth bowling change in four overs as Behrendorff finally gets a rest and Marcus Stoinis comes on. The past two overs have been a drink in the desert for the batsmen.21st over: NZ 68-2 (Williamson 19, Taylor 14) Finch has now officially jumped the shark. He takes Smith off after one over and brings on... himself! One ball is straight from club cricket, a full toss that would be a wide down leg had Taylor not swatted it for four. That’s the first boundary for nine overs.20th over: NZ 61-2 (Williamson 18, Taylor 8) Behrendorff is bowling his ninth over, which is refreshing. Though not for him in this heat, and he shows it by serving up two wides. The legitimate deliveries are on the spot as ever, with one bringing not so much a shout for LBW against Taylor as a plea. It was turned down, rightly, as the ball pitched just outside leg. So the second batch of ten overs produced even fewer runs than the first – 30 rather than 31.19th over: NZ 57-2 (Williamson 17, Taylor 7) Aaron Finch may not have got runs today, but he’s on fire with his captaincy. He sees Lyon doing so well (3-0-6-0) and takes him off, perhaps for a change of ends. And he brings on... Steve Smith, with his part-time leg-breaks. I thought I was joking when I said he might get a three-for.18th over: NZ 53-2 (Williamson 15, Taylor 5) Williamson breaks the shackles for a moment, cutting Behrendorff for two, and then he’s dropped again! And again there’s no blame attached, as it was a slower ball and Carey did well to get a fingertip to it, ing away to his right. Williamson is the cat who’s got away with giving two quarter-chances.

She founded the Just Data Lab, which aims to bring together activists, technologists and artists to reassess how data can be used for justice. Her latest book, Race After Technology, looks at how the design of technology can be discriminatory.Where did the motivation to write this book come from? It seems like we’re looking to outsource decisions to technology, on the assumption that it’s going to make better decisions than us. We’re seeing this in almost every arena – healthcare, education, employment, finance – and it’s hard to find a context which it hasn’t penetrated.Something which really sparked my interest was a series of headlines and articles I saw which were all about a phenomenon dubbed “racist robots”. Then, as time went on, these articles and headlines became less surprised, and they started to say, of course, the robots are racist because they’re designed in a society with these biases.The idea that software can have prejudice embedded in it is known as algorithmic bias – how does it amplify prejudice? Many of these automated systems are trying to identify and predict risk. So we have to look at how risk was assessed historically – whether a bank would extend a loan to someone, or if a judge would give someone a certain sentence. The decisions of the past are the input for how we teach software to make those decisions in the future. If we live in a society where police profile black and Latinx people, that affects the police data on who is likely to be a criminal. So you’ll have these communities overrepresented in the data sets, which are then used to train algorithms to look for future crimes, or predict who’s seen to be higher risk and lower risk.Are there other areas of society – such as housing or finance – where the use of automated systems has resulted in biased outcomes? Policing and the courts are getting a lot of attention, as they should. But there are other areas too, such as Amazon’s own hiring algorithms, which discriminated against women applicants, even though gender wasn’t listed on those résumés. The training set used data about who already worked at Amazon. Sometimes, the more intelligent machine learning becomes, the more discriminatory it can be – so in that case, it was able to pick up gender cues based on other aspects of those résumés, like their previous education or their experience.In your book, you assert that the treatment of black communities is an indication of what’s to come for other communities more generally. How would you say this extends to technology? Thinking about how risk is racialised is one way into understanding how those systems can eventually be deployed against many more people, not just the initial target. This is one of the things we can see with these new digital scoring systems – these companies which don’t just look at your personal riskiness, but also your social media and the people you’re connected with. If someone you know has defaulted on a loan, that can affect you. So actually, incorporating and gathering more data can be even more harmful to people’s lives.What role can legislation or regulation play in changing this direction? I’m personally a little sceptical – the passing of a law can be a placeholder for much more significant progress because people prematurely celebrate, even if not much changes. But I do increasingly think that legislation has a role to play. Even if a particular law is just a regulation in a state, or one country in Europe, it can be very effective because if these companies want to roll out technologies universally, and then they find they have to change something up for a certain jurisdiction, it can then be an obstacle. Other elements, like state-level protections for whistleblowers are vital, because there has been retaliation against workers at these tech companies. Home DNA testing kits are increasingly popular, and genomics screening is more commonplace too. Are you concerned about how technologies are being used, and weaponised? We did an informal audit of three DNA testing companies when I was a postdoc at UCLA. The results we got back were completely different across the three companies, because of their own reference data. These companies have access to our data, which they can buy and sell to other companies, and there’s really very few regulatory safeguards on how this is going to be used. The similarity between those technologies – the DNA testing kits, artificial intelligence, machine learning – is that the reference data shapes so much of the prediction. We have to question how it’s put together, what iniduals are being used as reference points.How aware do you think people are of issues around algorithmic bias, or automated systems? Since I started working on this book, a little over two years ago, I have seen a dramatic shift in the tone of the conversation around technology. Part of that has been spurred on by Facebook and Cambridge Analytica and the US election. More and more people are realising that this idea of big tech coming to save us, it’s really been dismantled. Part of it is shifting from a kind of paranoia around technology to what my activist colleagues like to say: from paranoia to power.Could a more erse workforce in Silicon Valley potentially provide a solution to these problems? More ersity in Silicon Valley is important, but won’t automatically address algorithmic bias. Unless all those erse people are empowered to challenge discriminatory design processes, ersity is a ruse. We need a complete overhaul of the larger accountability structures that shape tech development, and we definitely can’t wait for Silicon Valley to become more erse before implementing much stronger regulation and accountability.• Race After Technology by Ruha Benjamin is published by Polity Press (£14.99).

Three creatives explain how their old man has inspired them throughout their livesThere are few experiences more bonding than sharing a drink with your dad. Over a glass, or two, of Tobermory 12 Year Old whisky, a writer, photographer and magazine journalist, give a frank glimpse into their relationships with the men who raised themWhen I first told my dad about the subject of this piece, how his creativity has inspired my writing, he responded with the traditional Druker facial expression (somewhere between a sneer and a shrug).“Pheh,” he said. “It doesn’t even inspire me.”It’s taken us a long while to get to this point, sat across a table from each other, talking like a pair of adults. Mostly over coffee. Occasionally something stronger.My dad has a huge personality, but he’s not a big drinker. Two wine gums and a glass of water and he’s pissed, he says. I used to drink a bit too much. Now we meet somewhere in the middle. We used to be too different, too much the same to do this. We had rows, we didn’t get on. But times change. Times change people. And now we have moments.My dad retired around the time I was stumbling into adulthood. After a life of work and activism, he took up creative pursuits, playing in bands and DJing world music, funk and jump blues, expanding on his lifelong passion for music. As funny as he is, he takes it all very seriously.I notice the ways I’m like him, now. And the ways I want to be like him. He’s probably the funniest person I know. Cutting, absurdist and lightning quick. He’s got a sharp reply before you’ve finished talking. And when chatter falls to quiet, he’ll point strangers out, invent stories about them, tell me who they’ve just had a row with.He’s also a walking encyclopedia for film, music and literature. Pick out an old soul single and he’ll tell you who played bass on the B-side.His morality is like a lodestone to me. My understanding of the world was forged by anti-apartheid fundraisers, picket lines and marches before I could walk, and it’s informed by him to this day.It’s only now, as I pick it all apart, I realise how much of him is in everything I write. Sometimes behind the words on the page or the mouths of characters. Sometimes just kibitzing in my ear, telling me to lighten up and try putting a joke in for once.So now we have fleeting moments of connection I treasure. Something he never got to do with his dad. Something that will always be with me.He can also be a bit of a putz, to be fair.My dad and I haven’t always gotten on, with my stubborn teenage behaviour and his old-fashioned views. But as my mum doesn’t really drink, my dad had someone to share a tipple with when I started drinking. Even now when I go home he jokingly asks when I’m moving back to be his drinking buddy. We found out about one another’s likes, pet peeves and favourite drinks (mine: tequila, his: whisky). I got to know about his fascinating life and him as a person, rather than just my dad. You think you would know these things about your parent, but over a drink, this authority figure fades and a friend emerges.Being someone who studied fashion and has always been obsessed with clothes, we often find ourselves chatting about the topic. You’d never know to look at him in his home-knitted vests, but my 76-year-old dad was quite the fashionista back in the day! He showed me his old Dior suits, bought with his first paychecks, and that ignited my interest in vintage fashion – which was a step outside of all my high-fashion magazines. I make my own clothes as much as possible, and when video-calling my seamstress of a mum for help, my dad is often in the background ready to pipe in with some advice – a longer hem, more fitted, a different button – and I hate to admit it, but a lot of the time he’s spot on.I know every child says this, but my dad is one of the best cooks on this earth (owning a successful takeaway for 20 years might have something to do with it). But one thing that’s certain to come up when we meet up is talk about food. I’m always bugging him about how he made a dish while I ply him with a drink, hoping for him to spill his secrets. As someone who could only boil pasta when I left home, I now make dishes from around the world. My love for cooking and fascination for flavours is down to him.I’m now an entertainment journalist at a leading women’s magazine. He may not know the people I write about in my job, but he’s always been supportive of me and keen to learn more about the industry I’m in. It wasn’t easy to get into, and I know that my perseverance in my career is the same as my dad’s “never quit” work ethic that got him from Hong Kong to the UK in his 20s, and got him his successful business after many less successful ones. And that’s certainly something to say cheers to.My dad, David, inspired my passion for both photography and Scotland – which I’ve had a lifelong love affair with.He’s Scottish, in fact he’s very Scottish – he’d play the bagpipes at my school and my two brothers and I would often wear kilts – but his work as a doctor meant I was born and raised in the East Midlands, which is billiard table flatness.When we would visit my granny in Forres as a kid my brain would be absolutely fried by the beauty of the place, I just always had an affinity and always felt Scottish – although when I moved there when I was 18 I was constantly and very much reminded that I wasn’t!My parents enrolled me at the Findhorn Foundation in Forres, which is a spiritual community, where I did something called the Youth Programme, which enabled me to develop my photography and led to my career, and had me moving back to Scotland as soon as I could.Dad loves my work and is so proud. He was an amateur photographer and had a dark room at our home, and I used his Rolleiflex as my first camera I’ve been lucky to have a dad who is so supportive.My two brothers are very academic, and obviously my dad is too, being a doctor – plus my grandparents were doctors, so I had a lot of pressure to “do something”. I’m dyslexic, and at school I just wasn’t academic, so photography really opened up so much.The Isle of Mull is both one of my and my dad’s favourite places in Scotland, and I love exploring every nook and cranny with my camera. It’s incredible and erse, a bit like a mini Scotland in one. It’s mountainous and moory and it has breathtaking beaches.It’s wild but it’s got towns like Tobermory where there’s theatre, and there’s a real sense of community about it, yet it still has this complete remoteness, which is what I love most about it.And of course, there’s the distillery in Tobermory. The whisky somehow manages to taste like Mull by encapsulating its myriad qualities. It’s beautiful, peaty and completely an island whisky.To learn more about the art of the Hebridean distillers visit tobermorydistillery"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57e834cc6619ece467feaa20cc96f7443aaf4240/0_26_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=725c3da9f2771e8dd18881e4b7aecf85","title":"minneapolis pastor and his church expelled for permitting gay marriage","story":"Leaders of the Evangelical Covenant Church have voted to defrock a Minneapolis pastor and expel his church – for permitting gay marriage.Collison, who became a pastor at First Covenant in downtown Minneapolis in 2009, told the Star Tribune he was “not surprised” but “saddened”.“I feel grounded in the path we have chosen,” he said. “I feel grateful for the pastors and churches who stood up for us. I feel compassion to those caught in the middle.”The ECC said First Covenant was free to keep operating and can keep its church building. First Covenant said Collison will continue serving as lead pastor.In 2014, a First Covenant staff member officiated at an offsite wedding of two women from the church worship band. The church has also put out a “love all” statement that said it welcomes members of the LGBTQ community to participate in the church, including serving in leadership roles, and says it offers pastoral care including weddings “to all in our congregation without regard for ability, race, sex, gender identity or sexual orientation”.ECC leaders also voted on Friday night to remove another pastor, the Rev Steve Armfield, a retired Michigan minister who officiated his son’s same-sex wedding in Minneapolis in 2017. Armfield also was accused of violating the denomination’s same-sex marriage ban.Leaders recommended that Collison, Armfield and First Covenant be forced out because they violated policies on human sexuality, specifically “celibacy in singleness and faithfulness in heterosexual marriage”.“The ECC is mindful of the complexity, the sensitivity and the pain that matters of human sexuality can bring,” said Michelle Sanchez, an ECC executive minister. “We talk about the desire for both freedom and responsibility as a denomination. Those two things were coming into tension in this case.”First Covenant Church was founded by Swedish migrants in 1874. Today, the denomination has about 875 churches with 280,000 members nationally.“I hope this historic church someday changes its mind and then returns to our family,” ECC president John Wenrich said in a statement.Armfield, an ECC pastor for 47 years, served an ECC church in Red Wing, Minnesota, in the 1970s.“It is so unbelievably upsetting to see my father, Dan, and my fellow members of First Covenant experience the hate, deceit and actions that go against the teachings of love and inclusion that Jesus Christ preached,” said Matthew Armfield, who attends First Covenant."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/723f03e6f21e19ade5fdf539a496f7d3352d022a/489_1206_4628_2777/master/4628.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=25336076501dcfb090e487d310cab6ae","title":"europe eu riven tensions faces stormy fractious autumn","story":"Angela Merkel has the shakes. Emmanuel Macron has the collywobbles. And still Europe has no idea who will be in charge as it contemplates a stormy autumn strewn with political booby traps. In Britain, the Brexit deadline of 31 October is the only date that matters. But the EU, fragmented, disputatious and wounded to an extent unusual even by its fractious standards, is taking one day at a time.Sunday’s special summit is a case in point. It was convened by an exasperated Donald Tusk, the outgoing European council president, after this month’s regular heads-of-government meeting failed to agree on his successor or who will fill other key posts, including European commission president and president of the European central bank. Now they are having another try.Arguments over who gets what plum job are nothing new. But this time the standoff reflects some more basic, structural problems. Perhaps the biggest is that the Franco-German motor – the axis that has traditionally powered the EU – is stalling. Macron and Merkel are at odds over much more than who can best fill Jean-Claude Juncker’s boots.Since becoming modern France’s youngest president in 2017, Macron, 41, has lobbied hard for a “European renaissance”, meaning a more integrated EU that acts as a bulwark against reactionary populist-nationalist forces at home and wields strategic influence globally. His open letter to Europe’s citizens in March called for enhanced budgetary, financial and defence cooperation – and an “internal security council” overseeing borders, migration and a common asylum policy.Merkel, 64, who was a government minister when Macron was still at school, is much more cautious. The German chancellor and her Christian Democrat-led coalition are wary of grand French ambitions, partly because her business supporters worry Germany would end up paying. Merkel, brought up in East Germany under Soviet domination, is wedded to Nato and the transatlantic alliance in a way French leaders rarely are.Europe’s apparent inability to rescue the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran from Donald Trump’s ravages illustrates the limits of its bid to be a global player. The EU has sought ways to circumvent American oil and trade sanctions, and so prevent the deal’s collapse. But it was castigated last week by Iran for not trying hard enough, and by the US for trying at all.To defy Washington in this way, albeit unsuccessfully, was unusual for EU leaders. Yet the main reason for their failure was economic, namely the pre-eminence of the dollar as the international currency of choice. Any company or bank that wants to keep on doing business round the world, or in America itself, simply cannot risk US treasury reprisals for breaching sanctions.“The brute reality, as things stand, is that Europe does not yet have the tools – or the will – to project its power,” wrote Tom McTague in Atlantic magazine. “The euro cannot be a credible alternative to the dollar as a reserve currency until it is radically reformed, and without a credible reserve currency Europe’s financial might cannot match that of the US.” On this analysis, it could be argued Macron’s European vision is the right one.Europe’s ambitions on the global stage will be further constrained by a clutch of pressing internal problems. EU parliamentary elections last month revealed a continent experiencing extreme political volatility. Rightwing nationalists, such as Alternative für Deutschland, made advances, but so, too, did greens and liberals. The losers, overall, were traditional mainstream centre-left and centre-right parties.A likely consequence is that the new European parliament will be a less biddable, more unpredictable creature. That will pose critical management challenges for whoever takes up the top EU posts this autumn. And these shifts are mirrored at the national level. Macron, under withering fire from gilets jaunes protesters, struggling with low approval ratings, and harried by a formidable hard-right rival in Marine Le Pen, is fighting to save his presidency. These stresses could push him into more disruptive positions on contentious European issues.In contrast, Merkel’s reassuring presence has long provided Europe with a sense of continuity and stability. But the “Mutti Merkel” era is coming to a close. Falling support for the CDU, evidenced by state election reverses, has already led her to declare she will not stand for re-election in 2021. Inevitable speculation over her health, after she was twice seen physically shaking in public, will add to uncertainty about Germany’s future course.The autumn looks troublesome for other reasons, too. The commission is pushing, perhaps unrealistically, for a 2021-27 budget deal – always a isive issue. Pressure from Green MEPs and climate crisis activists will increase following the failure of this month’s summit to agree a 2050 carbon-neutral emissions target. East European states were blamed, but France and Germany’s inability to collaborate effectively was again cited as a factor.A dispute between Cyprus, Greece and Turkey over oil and gas exploration rights in eastern Mediterranean waters is potentially turbulent. Meanwhile, rightwing nationalist governments in Hungary and Poland, which goes to the polls in November, remain at odds with the commission over judicial and media freedom and governance issues.And then, to cap it all, there is the Brexit deadline. EU leaders insist this is Britain’s problem to resolve. But there are tense undercurrents. Once again, France and Germany do not see eye to eye, with the latter more open to another British membership extension. And Macron seems to be itching for a fight with Boris Johnson. Whatever they say now, EU leaders know a no-deal Brexit could ruin everyone’s Christmas."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/edd56bbaf0a28e3455616d4fc172564638cb5381/0_146_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fa263ad4d7e04fce8e80afcfe7729ce9","title":"greece tourism florida of europe","story":"Tourists in hats, cameras slung around their necks, crane them for a view. In the heart of old Athens, it is a reminder that the holiday season has begun. Last week as parties from cruise ships were guided through the narrow streets and squares of Plaka beneath the ancient Acropolis, industry officials were rejoicing at another seemingly immutable fact: that Greece is now among the most popular destinations in the world, poised to attract about 33 million tourists this year despite global economic uncertainty.Around a sixth will visit Athens, a capital that not that long ago was synonymous with anti-austerity protests and bypassed by holidaymakers heading straight for the isles. “There has been a massive increase with each year being a record year for the last six years,” Yiannis Retsos, the country’s tourism chief, told the Observer. “Greece has become trendy for sure.”Gloria Guevara, the council’s president and chief executive, has described Greece as “an exemplary case study of how valuable an asset travel and tourism can be when the government prioritises the sector”.The spectre of over-tourism has also prompted fears of whether a country of 11 million people can cope with an influx three times its population. “This is no longer a game of numbers,” says Retsos, who heads the Confederation of Greek Tourism (Sete), the voice of more than 50,000 private enterprises in the sector. “What we have to do now is go through a maturity process, manage our destinations so that tourists and locals, alike, are happy, extend the season and invest in public infrastructure. If by magic Greece were to attract another 10 million visitors it wouldn’t be able to handle such numbers.”More than ever, he said, it was vital that roads, ports, airports, waste disposal and electricity grids were upgraded after years of cutbacks during the country’s long-running battle to remain in the eurozone.“Tourism is Greece’s competitive advantage and it can be the locomotive of development for the entire economy,” says Theodore Pelagidis, professor of economics at the University of Piraeus. “But long-term salvation will only come when it becomes the Florida of Europe, improving services enough to attract foreigners to live here permanently. It has everything going for it, a unique quality of life and natural beauty that few other countries are blessed to have.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aca7758fb62608a09cedf63461c1aea4cc1b0860/360_0_4395_2637/master/4395.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6a0f5ea04b4ea3619ffd94c38dc06869","title":"montpellier melts 45c heatwave europe","story":"The south of France is like August in Death Valley, officials say, but lessons have been learnt from the deadly summer of 2003“Where shall we put it?” asked Luc Gomel, the director of Montpellier zoo. “Right on the front gate, to make sure the joggers see it,” came the reply from the reception desk. “They always complain if bits of the park are shut.”Gomel, sweat patches already blotting his armpits in the early morning heat, pinned the red notice to the gatepost. It warned that, because Montpellier was both on red alert for a heatwave and rated as a “severe” wildfire risk, special measures had been put in place at the zoo.The city, in the Gard region of the south of France, is baking hot. It was confirmed on Saturday that temperatures reached a record high for the country of 45.9C on Friday in Gallargues-le-Montueux, a nearby village. The weather service said that was comparable to August temperatures in California’s Death Valley. Météo-France lifted its red warning on Saturday but forecast a “very hot day” across a large central band of the country.Seven hundred firefighters battled wildfires in the Gard – in some areas the fires had closed sections of the motorway. Fifteen firefighters were hurt but no serious injuries were reported, although in the neighbouring region of Vaucluse, a cyclist died after collapsing in the heat while riding in the mountains. His was the sixth heat-related death in the sweltering weather covering much of western Europe. Three people died as a result of the heat in Italy, where Milan was hit by power cuts caused by the demand for air conditioning. For a fourth consecutive day, in Spain, temperatures rose above 43C on Saturday, causing two people to die from heat-related complications. Forty of Spain’s 50 regions were placed under weather alert, with seven of them considered to be at extreme risk, the national meteorological agency said.At Montpellier zoo, Gomel wasn’t worried so much for the animals as for the visitors. On Thursday, three children on a school trip from the nearby town of Arles were taken to hospital suffering from heat exhaustion. “I don’t think their supervisors were being very sensible,” said Gomel. “Apparently they were letting them run around everywhere.”He was taking no chances this weekend. Fire trucks were trundling around, soaking the pathways with water. Parts of the park with steep inclines were off-limits: no lions or bears today. The zoo’s current star attraction – the cheetahs, who gave birth last November – were showing how it’s done, lying like lean, furry chaise-longues in the shadows.France remains chastened by the memory of the 2003 heatwave, in which an estimated 15,000 people died. Not this time, said the health minister, Agnès Buzyn, who was visiting Carémeau hospital in Nîmes. “Unfortunately, it’s impossible to guarantee that no one will die, but we’ve put everything in place to ensure it’s the lowest number possible. Compared with 2003, we’re extremely well prepared – especially with respect to the elderly, especially those isolated at home.”Over in Nîmes, no one was walking on the limestone esplanade outside the arena walls the fake centurion union had obviously given everyone the day off. A hot wind, which felt like it bypassed the eyelids to begin desiccating the corneas directly, licked the streets.A few hundred metres away at a refreshment point – one of three set up by the city – offering bottled water and a place for a breather in the Maison Carrée arts centre, Alina Richard echoed the good news from the hospital she had only had to serve one person in real distress. She offered lunch advice to a student. “You should eat something fresh and cooling,” she said.“I had a salade Niçoise!” he offered, beaming.Even the Jardin de la Fontaine, with its ornamental canals, offered little respite. Dust swirled off the ground where a group of locals were playing pétanque.Patric, a retired Nîmois lorry driver, shrugged off the pressure cooker atmosphere. “It’s nothing – we’re used to it. You’ve just got to let it pass,” he said. But Baptiste, a psychology student from Bordeaux who was dousing himself at a water fountain, was fearful about the future: “We already have an unstable economy – can you imagine adding regular droughts to that too?”Back down by the arena, Thierry, a roadie working for an events company, thought there may be a lesson for National Rally-voting Nîmes. “It’s the degree or two extra that makes doing this tough,” he said. “That’s why sub-Saharan African has nothing – it’s impossible to work in conditions like this. People here should go and work there. It’d be an education for some people.”The World Meteorological Organisation said last week that 2019 was on track to being one of the hottest years globally, and 2015 to 2019 would then be the hottest five-year period on record. It said the European heatwave was “absolutely consistent” with extremes linked to the impact of greenhouse gas emissions.Back at the water fountain in Nîmes, the psychology student contemplated the possibility of record temperatures being beaten regularly in the years ahead. “Have you seen the film Interstellar?” he said. “The Earth isn’t going to die all of a sudden. It’ll be a slow, sad decline.”"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/06/11/TELEMMGLPICT000197062411_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqWZZ9520Qrn8RyVs0byqFfxdYxsWUQUCtgJX18DpO5X4.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"making final call publish mps expenses","story":"Former editor of The Daily , William LewisIts publication led to the biggest parliamentary scandal in a generation, but two national newspapers had already turned the story down.The decision to pay for the full expense claims of every MP in Westminster was laced with risk: the leaked information could have been deemed stolen, or worse - it could have been a hoax.

A report by the London School of Economics (LSE) into children’s attitudes towards the internet found they overwhelmingly wanted a ‘grand erasure’ of their online footprint to stop childhood mistakes affecting their future.The research, which was funded by the Information Commissioner\u0027s Office, also found that children were generally trusting of tech companies in the same way they are of their schools.LSE researchers reviewed more than a decade’s worth of studies into children’s understanding of their online data and also conducted focus groups with more than 160 secondary school-age children.Professor Sonia Livingstone, who led the research, said children were generally “outraged” when they learned how much of their personal information is being hoarded online and wanted “a fresh start” when they turned 18.She said: “They say ‘whatever I do before I am 18 should be wiped off’ as it shouldn’t have any effect on them as an adult. They want a kind of grand erasure because they talk about the importance of making mistakes and just being kids trying things out.”The Government is currently looking at a range of new measures to better protect children online including imposing a legal duty of care on tech giants and introducing an Age Appropriate Design Code, which will mean social media giants will have to assume users are children if they can\u0027t age verify them.Duty of Care white paperMost social media companies have a minimum age of 13, but due to the lack of proper age checks the study found children as young as nine said they had profiles.The study found that children generally took instructions they received online on “face value” and often didn’t understand how tech companies were commercially benefiting from the information they handed over. As a result, they found it “puzzling” that internet companies often asked them to give out details they did not see as relevant to the service.The children interviewed were also shocked to learn that material they thought they had deleted could still exist online and wanted “delete to mean delete” when it came to social media.Other features children wanted from tech companies were a way to see which other companies their details had been shared with and “child-friendly mechanisms” to edit their information.Prof Livingstone said the children were generally mystified as to why tech companies were interested in personal information they saw as quickly going out of date as they grew up.She added: “Creepy is a really common word that they use. It’s creepy and sinister that all that data is being kept.”Duty of Care CampaignTheresa May determined to push through \u0026#39legacy\u0026#39 spending demandsJohn Bercow\u0026#39s fresh plot to derail Brexit revealed as allies say he hopes to stay as speaker until ChristmasTroubles murder trial soldier cites IRA shout-out in his defenceHuawei fallout sees Sir Mark Sedwill lined up as Britain\u0026#39s new US ambassador for Gavin Williamson\u0026#39s cabinet returnJeremy Hunt can win over Left-wing voters, claims Penny MordauntBoris Johnson to set up Brexit \u0026#39war cabinet\u0026#39 to force through Britain\u0026#39s EU departure in 100 daysIain Duncan Smith interview: Brexit is the start - Boris Johnson is going into battle with Jeremy CorbynCarrie Symonds\u0026#39 flat builder breaks silence as he claims walls are so thick neighbours could not hear motorbike revvingComment: Don\u0026#39t expect the next Tory PM to have the guts to grapple with the NHSFather of London Bridge terrorist blames West for son\u0026#39s radicalisation as British hate preachers \u0026#39exploit\u0026#39 young MuslimsAnger over proposed RSPCA moves to campaign against angling and horse racingPregnant woman killed and unborn baby left critically injured in London knife attackInside the WTA Wimbledon launch party: Navratilova and Evert encourage today\u0026#39s stars to put aside rivalriesNew wildfires rage in Europe as punishing heatwave claims more livesHarvey Weinstein\u0026#39s new lawyer says women need to take responsibility for their actionsChampion sailor to be reunited with £10,000 Rolex lost overboard 20 years agoDuke and Duchess of Sussex surprise sports fans with a visit to the baseball Complaints over ticket allocation as England face torrid reception from India\u0026#39s travelling armyDuke and Duchess of Sussex surprise sports fans with a visit to the baseball Germany agrees secret deal to return painting stolen by Nazis to Uffizi Galleries in FlorenceWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/technology/2019/04/21/TELEMMGLPICT000032877532_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqwDgGh3pkom49KxtKngnUa36K9dyKixjq8GqZuuMTIBE.jpeg?imwid","title":"need first amendment internet counter troubling censorship social","story":"The repercussions of companies with an effective monopoly on our news using their position to impose ‘values’ should concern us allFor all its focus on ersity, Silicon Valley is about as ideologically erse as a vegan powwow The advent of modern technology has brought us extraordinary freedoms.

The whistle-blowing examiner said that there was “no debate at pre-standardisation among the senior examiners”.They added: “That means that the meeting where the standard is evaluated and agreed was a farce. We had examiners horrified at the standard.”Problems in the standards were flagged by the number of markers failing to spot elements supposed to ensure consistent standards.In one, the pupil was given 14 out of 40 when the “correct” score should have been 21, and in another a pupil was awarded 26 marks when a more senior examiner deemed the “correct” mark to be 40.They told the Times Education Supplement magazine that some examiners were so unhappy with this year’s standardisation materials they used those for 2018 instead.Claire Thomson, AQA’s director of operations, said: “These personal opinions, which the user has now deleted, don’t reflect the overall picture.“Getting students the results they deserve is our top priority and we have very effective quality assurance measures in place to make sure examiners mark to a high standard.”Ofqual, the exams watchdog, uses a system called “comparable outcomes” to ensure that roughly the same proportion of pupils get similar grades each year, and those who are the first to take the new, reformed courses are not at a disadvantage compared to other cohorts.Theresa May determined to push through \u0026#39legacy\u0026#39 spending demandsJohn Bercow\u0026#39s fresh plot to derail Brexit revealed as allies say he hopes to stay as speaker until ChristmasTroubles murder trial soldier cites IRA shout-out in his defenceHuawei fallout sees Sir Mark Sedwill lined up as Britain\u0026#39s new US ambassador for Gavin Williamson\u0026#39s cabinet returnJeremy Hunt can win over Left-wing voters, claims Penny MordauntBoris Johnson to set up Brexit \u0026#39war cabinet\u0026#39 to force through Britain\u0026#39s EU departure in 100 daysIain Duncan Smith interview: Brexit is the start -

estimated to be worth around £10,000 - while on his passenger boat off the British coast in 1998, believing it went overboard.But Mr McColl became suspicious the watch may have been stolen and reported it to Devon and Cornwall police. In 2016, the sailor said the auction house contacted him on behalf of a seller to ask if he owned the watch engraved with his name and to see if he wanted to buy it back.Mr McColl said that the auction house would have known it was his and had been stolen, due to the Rolex being listed on an Interpol list. The Rolex which Mr McColl will be reunited withHe subsequently attempted to take the auction house to court as his watch was returned to the seller, known as Mr Guidi, who also claims ownership. But the 71-year-old celebrated sailor was declared the rightful owner of the watch last week in a court order from Truro County Court.“The watch is of no value to me, it’s not about the money, it’s effectively my Olympic gold medal, Mr Gardini gave it to me after our crew won the San Francisco World Championships in 1988,” Mr McColl told The Sunday .In a letter addressed to Mr McColl dated January 2017, Rolex confirmed that the watch was listed on the manufacturer\u0027s stolen database in 1999 and a month later, they confirmed it was registered by Falmouth Police as stolen around the same time.In April this year, a Christie’s representative contacted Mr McColl to discuss the return of his watch, asking him to collect the watch himself, or declare whether he needs it to be shipped.A spokesperson for Christie\u0027s said: “Christie’s has made every effort to seek a resolution to this situation on behalf of the two parties. “We have now ensured the parties are in touch direct in order the ownership question can be resolved between them.”They added: Under no circumstance would Christie’s knowingly offer any object where there are valid concerns over the ownership.Theresa May determined to push through \u0026#39legacy\u0026#39 spending demandsJohn Bercow\u0026#39s fresh plot to derail Brexit revealed as allies say he hopes to stay as speaker until ChristmasJeremy Hunt can win over Left-wing voters, claims Penny MordauntIain Duncan Smith interview: Brexit is the start -

Our supply is running as normal. As always in hot weather, demand for water has increased, so we have put in place the usual restrictions on staffguest showers and the limited number of public showers.Many of those who pitched up at Worthy Farm resorted to wipes and toiletries such as dry shampoo to circumnavigate the need for showers altogether.One attendee gets creative and jumps into a water feature to cool down during the 31C temperatures at GlastonburyAs temperatures rose on-site ambulance control said it received 27 calls for assistance for heat-related illnesses, with more expected over the weekend.Festivalgoer Sara Roberts said both showers and drinking water have been difficult to find.The 39-year-old said: There\u0027s barely anything available and there are no facilities where we are staying.She added that she hoped tomorrow would be easier when we don\u0027t have the burning sun on our heads.On Twitter, David Corway posted a photo of the closed showers with the caption: “Showers out at Glastonbury. Worst news since they announced The Killers.” Revellers pour water over each other to keep cool during the heatwaveMeanwhile another music-fan, who uses the handle Dave the Techy, tweeted a picture of himself in the shade and said: “Sitting in the Hospitality area in the only outside shade. No shower today. Glastonbury getting seriously short of water on these hot days.”Georgina Fernandez, 24, used the opportunity of no showers to get creative and spent yesterday morning taking it in turns to throw water over the heads of her friends then it\u0027s just a flannel for the next few days, she said. Signs around the festival urged revellers to keep hydrated, but this year\u0027s ban on single-use plastic means its 200,000 attendees are unable to buy bottled water. In response to the heat, Glastonbury Festival said they were now providing Cans of Life Water, which were on sale for £1.80, for free.Fans with reusable bottles can also keep topped up at refill sites, but campers took to social media on Thursday to berate the long queues of up to 40 minutes. Theresa May determined to push through \u0026#39legacy\u0026#39 spending demandsJohn Bercow\u0026#39s fresh plot to derail Brexit revealed as allies say he hopes to stay as speaker until ChristmasTroubles murder trial soldier cites IRA shout-out in his defenceHuawei fallout sees Sir Mark Sedwill lined up as Britain\u0026#39s new US ambassador for Gavin Williamson\u0026#39s cabinet returnJeremy Hunt can win over Left-wing voters, claims Penny MordauntBoris Johnson to set up Brexit \u0026#39war cabinet\u0026#39 to force through Britain\u0026#39s EU departure in 100 daysIain Duncan Smith interview: Brexit is the start - Boris Johnson is going into battle with Jeremy CorbynCarrie Symonds\u0026#39 flat builder breaks silence as he claims walls are so thick neighbours could not hear motorbike revvingComment: Don\u0026#39t expect the next Tory PM to have the guts to grapple with the NHSFather of London Bridge terrorist blames West for son\u0026#39s radicalisation as British hate preachers \u0026#39exploit\u0026#39 young MuslimsAnger over proposed RSPCA moves to campaign against angling and horse racingPregnant woman killed and unborn baby left critically injured in London knife attackInside the WTA Wimbledon launch party: Navratilova and Evert encourage today\u0026#39s stars to put aside rivalriesNew wildfires rage in Europe as punishing heatwave claims more livesHarvey Weinstein\u0026#39s new lawyer says women need to take responsibility for their actionsChampion sailor to be reunited with £10,000 Rolex lost overboard 20 years agoDuke and Duchess of Sussex surprise sports fans with a visit to the baseball Complaints over ticket allocation as England face torrid reception from India\u0026#39s travelling armyDuke and Duchess of Sussex surprise sports fans with a visit to the baseball Germany agrees secret deal to return painting stolen by Nazis to Uffizi Galleries in FlorenceWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/health-fitness/2019/02/22/TELEMMGLPICT000188970502_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?i","title":"let snobbery reading get way good book","story":"For a long time – like three decades – I could only read magazinesReports of reading’s death have been greatly exaggerated – generally by the sort of people who like to believe that Things Are Always Getting Worse because it gives them a masochistic parasexual thrill andor makes them feel that their little lives are at some epoch-making point of history.These will be the same sorts now moaning about people not reading anymore in my experience, they themselves are people who’ve never read much anyway but want you to think that they do because they like to look down on what they probably think of as the Brexit Chav Pasty Mob who struggle with Heat magazine.All that’s happened is that UK book sales fell for the first time in five years in 2018, thus ending...To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Rails expand as they get hotter and can start to buckle. Speed restrictions are imposed as slower trains exert lower forces on the track, reducing the chance of buckling.“Keeping passengers moving is always our top priority. But we want people to be prepared. Where soaring temperatures do lead to us having to put in place slower speeds for safety reasons, please bear with us as our dedicated teams of engineers work to fix the problem. It may mean your journey takes longer over some portions of your journey. We’d also remind passengers to carry some water with them so they don’t get too parched.”Some parts of the country saw roads softening as temperatures shot up.Gritters have been deployed in some areas to spread crushed rock dust to create a non-stick layer between the surface and vehicles’ tyres, with the AA warning that roads begin to soften at around 27C.Cumbria County Council said: Our gritters are on call. Roads are 20C hotter than the air and melt at 50C.The Communication Workers Union shared pictures of roads damaged by the heat, with one taken by a post office worker on Exmoor showing a stretch of melted road with tyre impressions in the softened surface road at Heasley Mill, near North Molton, Devon.Drivers have been advised to use warm soapy water to clean sticky tar from their vehicles.At the same time daytrippers clogged coastal routes as they headed for the seaside, including the A23 to Brighton, A31 to Dorset, A30 to Cornwall and M55 to Blackpool.More than 30,000 UK breakdowns were expected on Saturday, with call-outs set to have doubled in tourist areas according to the RAC.More than 150,000 visitors were expected in Brighton, 75,000 in Bournemouth, 75,000 in Great Yarmouth and 50,000 in Blackpool.Festival-goers keep cool during day four of Glastonbury Festival at Worthy Farm, Pilton, SomersetFestival-goers at Glastonbury have been warned to stay hydrated and wear sunscreen by organisers as it looks to topple its record of 31.2 C in 2017.At the Wimbledon Championships, the heat rule has been expanded and will for the first time apply to men as well as women in the singles matches.The rule allows a ten minute break to be taken between certain sets when the heat stress index is at or above 30.1C and one player requests it.Judy Murray is among those who had complained that male players should also benefit from the rule, saying last year: In men\u0027s singles you are having to play five sets, you could be out there four or five hours. It is very important to protect the health of the players.”Temperatures are expected to drop to between 20C and 25C as the Championships get underway on Monday, but spectators are encouraged to wear suitable clothing and bring sun cream.Fans are allowed to bring empty refillable bottles into the ground this year and the number of refill stations and fountains has been increased to more than 100.But the heatwave is set to be short lived, with an Atlantic front forecast to send highs dropping to 25C on Sunday, 22C on Monday and just 19C on Tuesday.Simon Partridge, a forecaster with the Met Office, said: There\u0027s extreme heat in Europe and heat got across to the UK, with highs pushing towards the 35.6C June record.More and more heat is being pumped north from Africa through Europe, with highs in France again in the 40s.But heat will be shunted away from the UK on Sunday as an Atlantic front brings cooler conditions.”Theresa May determined to push through \u0026#39legacy\u0026#39 spending demandsJohn Bercow\u0026#39s fresh plot to derail Brexit revealed as allies say he hopes to stay as speaker until ChristmasJeremy Hunt can win over Left-wing voters, claims Penny MordauntIain Duncan Smith interview: Brexit is the start - Boris Johnson is going into battle with Jeremy CorbynTroubles murder trial soldier cites IRA shout-out in his defenceBoris Johnson to set up Brexit \u0026#39war cabinet\u0026#39 to force through Britain\u0026#39s EU departure in 100 daysHuawei fallout sees Sir Mark Sedwill lined up as Britain\u0026#39s new US ambassador for Gavin Williamson\u0026#39s cabinet returnComment: Don\u0026#39t expect the next Tory PM to have the guts to grapple with the NHSFather of London Bridge terrorist blames West for son\u0026#39s radicalisation as British hate preachers \u0026#39exploit\u0026#39 young MuslimsAnger over proposed RSPCA moves to campaign against angling and horse racingCarrie Symonds\u0026#39 flat builder breaks silence as he claims walls are so thick neighbours could not hear motorbike revvingPregnant woman killed and unborn baby left critically injured in London knife attackInside the WTA Wimbledon launch party: Navratilova and Evert encourage today\u0026#39s stars to put aside rivalriesNew wildfires rage in Europe as punishing heatwave claims more livesHarvey Weinstein\u0026#39s new lawyer says women need to take responsibility for their actionsChampion sailor to be reunited with £10,000 Rolex lost overboard 20 years agoDuke and Duchess of Sussex surprise sports fans with a visit to the baseball Complaints over ticket allocation as England face torrid reception from India\u0026#39s travelling armyDuke and Duchess of Sussex surprise sports fans with a visit to the baseball Germany agrees secret deal to return painting stolen by Nazis to Uffizi Galleries in FlorenceWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/06/03/14/indian-air-force-1.jpg","title":"pilot birds fuel bombs explosion indian air force ambala","story":"IM Subscribe NowIM Subscribe NowCreated with Sketch.IM  Subscribe NowIM  Subscribe NowSubscribe NowSubscribe NowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Try Independent Minds free for 1 monthSee the optionsClick to followThe IndependentAn Indian Air Force (IAF) pilot caused multiple explosions as he dumped fuel and bombs after flying through a flock of birds.The collision with the unfortunate animals caused an immediate engine failure on the Jaguar aircraft which was forced to make an emergency landing following the incident.Before the pilot could land, he had to dump fuel tanks and Carrier Bomb Light Stores, a form of practice bomb, which caused explosions on the ground below.The pilot was commended by authorities for “assessing the situation in seconds” and following the standard operating procedure for such an incident.In a statement the IAF said: “His actions bear testimony to the highest professional standards of the IAF resulting from extensive operational training.”“The professionalism and quick thinking by the pilot not only saved a war waging asset but also the lives of many civilians in the area adjoining the airfield.”The incident took place in Ambala, India, on 27 June.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Shame on Labourit backs them, and on any Tories who join them.MPs have repeatedly promised to honour Brexit. Yet they reject the only deal on offer and the EU refuses to improve it. No Deal isn’t The Sun’s favoured option, but it IS the logical and inevitable consequence of their game-playing.Grieve hopes instead to stop Brexit . . . by blackmailing his own Government and, sickeningly, holding a gun to the heads of the poor both here and abroad.But No Deal would still be the default. And funding would have to be immediately restored. Grieve is madhe thinks anyone but him and his Remainer friends will be blamed for targeting benefit claimants, OAPs and schools.Their conceit is repugnant. Even Theresa May, normally one to mince her words, calls them “grossly irresponsible”.This Cabinet lacks resolve, but our new one must unite to face down the wreckers. Boris Johnson is right to say there would be no place in his for those unwilling to back No Deal as a last resort.If it means exile for Amber Rudd and her allies, so be it. Voters have had enough of MPs and ministers issuing threatsthey don’t get their way.WE are sick of Theresa May trying to inflict damaging policies on her successor to establish a “legacy” in her last days.Her new milkshake tax must be thrown out. There is no credible case for it.The Government says the fizzy drinks levy “succeeded” because makers cut sugar in their recipes. Rubbish. The sole point was to make people less fat, and it hasn’t. If it’s failed on that, it’s failed.Spreading this folly to milkshakes compounds the stupidity.Voters will flock to a new Tory PM who champions consumer choice and puts nanny state zealots back in their box.It’s a sweet prospect.ONLY leftie class warriors could fail to admire a graduate who sets up a viable company and creates jobs.Entrepreneurs are our economy’s leblood, providing work for millions and putting food on families’ tables.So we welcome Jeremy Hunt’s pledge to wipe out their student debtthey launch a start-up hiring more than ten people for five years.Too few graduates do so.

both of these work to combat allergies without making you feel tired.Get undressed in the bathroomPollen can get trapped on clothes, so getting changed in the bathroom as soon as you get home means you wont spread pollen around the place.This is particularly importantyoure someone who undresses in your bedroom, then leaves your pollen-laden clothes near your bed for you to breathe in all night while you sleep.Use eye dropsMany hay fever sufferers will get red, sore and itchy eyes when symptoms flare up.But to there are a couple of ways to stop them streaming and soothe irritation.You can try eye drops with antihistamine properties, available from most pharmacies, to reduce inflammation.Just squeeze one or two drops into each eye four times a day.If you hate the thought of drops, you could also consider an eye mist which works in the same way - just spray it once or twice onto closed eyelids to to three times a day.Wear wrap around sunglassesYou may not think wrap around sunglasses are the coolest look - but then nor are red, runny eyes.Andyou want to keep pesky pollen at bay then its definitely another great option to try.Theyre also effective at protecting your eyes from dust and wind as well as keeping them moisturised.Dont dry clothes outsideAlthough the sun and fresh air make for the perfect drying solution for freshly-washed clothes, its a nightmare combo for hay fever sufferers.Pollen will cling to your clean washing and cause symptoms to flare when you next pop those clothes on.Experts recommend avoiding this especially when pollen counts are high, so be sure to check the forecast.Otherwise, try to dry your clothes indoors where possible.Experts predict a million new people will develop an allergy to pollen this summer.An estimated  per cent of adults in the UK reported suffering from hay fever in , according to research.Last year that figure increased to  per cent with a million new people buying hay fever medicines and remedies for the first time.The rise is believed to be due to changes in our climate as weather conditions become more extreme clearly defined seasons are blurred.Experts say a long winter followed by a short spring condensed the flowering season of trees and shrubs into a much shorter time period.They say this causes a so-called pollen bomb as plants burst into le at the same time.This also causes more severe symptoms in people with long standing hay fever.It comes as we hit peak grass season in the UK, while other pollen sources such as nettle and dock come into season too.In Britain, its thought that more than  million people suffer with hay fever -

It means marriages could take place at home or outdoor spots rather than a church or a registry office. It would also save prospective husbands and wives some hard-pressed cash as they will not have to fork out for a licensed premises hire. The Government has launched a two-year review on how and where marriages can take place. At the moment they must be carried out in a licensed venue by a registrar or licensed minister for them to be legally binding.    That means couples who want an outdoor wedding – currently only permitted in Scotland – have to have two events, one legal and the other ceremonial. Religious chiefs insists a church is still “the best place” for a wedding. But the Wedding Celebrancy Commission welcomed the review. Member Anne Barber said: “There is a huge demand from couples who say they don’t want to go the to the registry office before. They want to do it at the same time.” And National Association of Wedding Professionals director Siobhan Craven-Robins added: “This eliminates the hire cost of booking a licensed venue. It creates more opportunity for people who are on a tighter budget.”Theresa May said: “We can do more to bring the laws on marriage ­ceremonies up to date.”But Humanists UK argue the reforms should go further to join Scotland and the Ireland in allowing ­celebrants to perform legally binding ceremonies.    The laws, many of which date back to the th century, will be reviewed by the Law Commission, which will consult with faith groups. Any new venues would have to meet the existing test of solemnity. But the Church of England said research shows being “married in a place that has meaning is still important”.Reverend Canon Dr Sandra Millar, who heads the CofE’s work on weddings, said: “The moments of waiting to walk down the aisle, standing at the steps and exchanging timeless vows that can only be said in a church, and turning to walk out of the church as anewly-married couple, are cherished.”"},{"url":null,"title":"baby girl born hair thick","story":"NewsBaby girl born with hair so thick people mistake her for a dollLondon baby Dollys hair was so long her mum Katie Canham had to get her a haircut at just three monthsShareCommentsByAliki Kraterou:,  JUN Updated:,  JUN NewsDollys mum says the five-month-old sometimes gets mistaken for a doll \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA mum-of-three was taken aback when her fourth child was born with thick wavy locks.

The zones cover ,sq miles, from the Northumberland coast to the Isles of Scilly, and form vital sites for nursing underwater habitats back to le.    Banned activities in the blue belts include trawling, scallop dredging and other commercial fishing – along with wave or wind power development, flood defences and naval manoeuvres. Thousands of volunteers help gather information and monitor marine protected areas for the Wildle Trusts, which look after , nature reserves.    The number of blue belts has risen by  in the past month. The creatures get their weird names because they literally resemble baked beans or fried eggs, because of their comical shapes or, in the case of the undulate ray, the way it rolls its body through the water. The rare short-snouted seahorse is another creature on the up after fishermen in Dorset reported sightings.

Those who leave their engines running while parked could be slapped with even bigger tickets under the new Department for Transport proposal, championed by Chris Grayling. The Transport Secretary announced today that he plans to launch a public consultation into the tougher penalties, aimed at reducing toxic pollution near schools. Currently idling motorists can be handed a fixed penalty notice of £, rising to £unpaid after  days. But the punishment hasnapost been changed since  and is well below fine levels for similar offences, the department says.    Although police can tackle idling, with more signicant penalties available in courts, usage of these is low and it is hoped the new plans will provide guidance to local authorities on their anti-idling powers, enabling them to enforce the law more effectively. The Government says vehicle idling is a major factor in poor air quality, particularly in areas with large numbers of waiting vehicles – such as outside schools, at taxi ranks and bus stations. Mr Grayling said the move will tackle dangerously high levels of pollution. We are determined to crack down on drivers who pollute our communities by leaving their engines running, particularly outside school gates where our children are breathing in this toxic air, he said.    “Putting a stop to idling is an easy way to drive down dangerously high levels of pollution, reducing its impact on the environment and our health.” Poor air quality is the biggest environmental risk to public health in the UK, the DfT said in a statement. Every minute, an idling car produces enough exhaust emissions to fill  balloons with harmful chemicals, including cyanide, NOx and PM.. The microscopic pollutants can result in a range of health problems - from heart and lung disease to strokes and cancer - and have been shown to be particularly damaging to children.  The consultation, expected to launch this summer, will also explore how to deal with repeat offenders who keep their engines running following several warnings. These proposals are the latest move in the Government’s drive to improve air quality, which include grants to encourage the purchase of cleaner vehicles, the commitment to end the sale of new conventional diesel and petrol cars and vans by  as part of the Road to Zero strategy, and the doubling of investment in cycling and walking since .

Manson, who shoes horses at Prestbury Park, the home of the Cheltenham Festival, pleaded guilty to harassment at Cheltenham Magistrates Court yesterday. This related to nine main acts affecting the victim between October ,  and January , . Sue Gethin, prosecuting, described how Manson threw her underwear in a bin on December . She said: He got in her face and said aposbin dayapos and seemed to think it was funny.    The court also heard that Manson called her a four-letter word and blamed her for the coupleaposs unborn son dying when she had a miscarriage. Reading from a victim impact statement, Ms Gethin explained the woman thought the relationship soured after six months, when Mansonaposs behaviour concerned her. The victim said she loved him and the good times outweighed the bad. But Manson became extremely unsupportive when she lost her baby in May last year. She said: On the evening of my birthday, the same day he threw my clothes into the bin, he called me a baby killer. As a result of his behaviour, Iaposve lost the person I once was. Tony Miles, mitigating, said: Mr Manson is thoroughly ashamed of is behaviour. This is a relationship that started well and ended badly.    He was given a -week prison sentence, suspended for  months, and a two-year restraining order. Manson, of Newent, is barred from contacting the victim or going to one of four addresses in Gloucestershire where she either lives or visits. The court also ordered Manson to pay the victim £,, a victim surcharge of £, and court costs of £. After the hearing, a spokeswoman for the racecourse said that Manson was not an employee of the company and works for us as a contractor.

The -year-old was slapped with the penalty after he traveled down from Blackburn on Sunday, June .He parked being told by another church friend it was possible to do so, the Manchester Evening News reported .David used the toilet in a nearby McDonaldaposs and was shocked to find the ticket on his vehicle when he ed at .am. Wardens explained to David he needed a permit to park outside the church and said there were signs displaying parking information. David only managed to catch the last  minutes of Sunday mass due to the incident. The professional cleaner has written to appeal against the £ fine, explaining he was attending church.  The council said tickets are issued to those who do not display church permits. Mr Addison has submitted another appeal decision to the council, but said he faces having to pay up soon or the fine increases in price. He said he had made a special trip to Manchester to attend a service at St Annaposs Church for the first time: I popped into the toilets at McDonaldaposs before the service then saw there was a parking ticket on my car.

They are very robotic in their responses. I didnapost park to go shopping, it was right outside the church. They were wrong to give it to someone parked outside a church.  A Manchester City Council spokesman said: The parking bay Mr Addison used is not intended for general use, but is reserved for vehicles which require essential access for events at the church - for example, hearses which are attending funerals, or bridal cars.   Permits allowing the use of these bays are issued by the church at their discretion, however, Mr Addison was not displaying such a permit and was ticketed.     We have advised Mr Addison of his right to appeal and are awaiting further contact from him at this stage.  "},{"url":null,"title":"drivers who leave engines running","story":"NewsDrivers who leave engines running to be fined £ in crackdown on pollutionChris Grayling says Government are keen to put a stop to idling to reduce levels of toxic air that poison communitiesShareByNigel NelsonPolitical Editor:,  JUN NewsLeaving your engine running could land you with a hefty fine \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailDrivers who leave their engines running while stationary will face £ fines.

The Liverpool Hope University psychology student was rushed to Whiston Hospital and given anti-stroke medication. She was then transferred to The Walton Centre in Aintree where she underwent surgery to relieve the pressure on her brain. Doctors told the family that the stroke was caused by a blood clot on Ellyaposs brain, but efforts are ongoing to find out what led to the clot.

A stroke occurs when the blood supply to part of the brain is cut off, causing a brain injury, disability or death as brain cells begin to die. The le-threatening medical condition requires urgent treatment, as the sooner a person receives treatment, the less damage is likely to happen. Treatment can include medication or even surgery. Survivors are often left with long-term problems caused by injury to their brain. What are the symptoms  The main symptoms can be remembered with the word aposfastapos, the NHS says.Face - the face may have dropped on one side or the person may not be able to smile Arms - the person may not be able to lt both arms and keep them there due to weakness or numbness Speech - their speech may be slurred or garbled, or they may not be able to talk at all Time - dial  immediatelyyou notice any of these signs or symptomsWhat are the causes  The two main causes are ischaemicand haemorrhagic . The NHS says  per cent of all cases are ischaemic. A aposmini-strokeapos, known as a transient ischaemic attack, occurs when the blood supply to the brain is temporarily interrupted. It also requires immediate treatment. How to prevent a stroke  Conditions that can increase the risk of having a stroke include high blood pressure, high cholesterol, atrial fibrillation and diabetes. People can signicantly reduce their risk by leading a healthy lestyle. The NHS suggests eating a healthy diet, exercising regularly, drinking alcohol in moderation and not smoking. Sarah said: Sheaposs worked for us since she was  just after finishing school. She is just a lovely girl and a fantastic member of the team. We have never had any problems with her. She always does things in the right way and properly which is not what you would expect from a teenager. Cha added: We are just dumbfounded that so many people want to help out.

Peter Hallwood, , had the roof of his Runcorn home blown off in Storm Doris in February  - and he called on Kirk Smith to carry out the repair work. Kirk, who played Keith Rooney in Brookside and trucker Pete Collins in Emmerdale, was running a company called KC Ltd. The former actor quoted Peter £, to fit a brand new roof - but when Peter said he wasnapost covered by his insurance and couldnapost afford it, he slashed the price. Peter paid Kirk £, to fit a new roof for him, but when the leaks started pouring in, he realised the roofer had only done a patch-up job. He claims the house was left uninhabitable and that he had to call another company out in July  to fix the roof properly. After months of chasing Kirk for answers and asking for his money back, Peter took his case to small claims court in March this year.  Kirk was ordered to pay Peter nearly £, plus £ in costs. Speaking to the Liverpool Echo about his roofing nightmare, energy sales worker Peter said: Back in February when it was Storm Doris, my roof blew off. My house is at the end of the row on Handforth Lane in Runcorn. It has a flat roof and about  roofs came off. Iaposve known Kirk as a family friend and he has done work for me before so we trusted him. He said I was going to need an entire new roof with a quote for £,. I went to the insurance and realised I wasnapost insured properly for a flat roof, so I said aposI donapost know how Iaposm going to do it Kirk.apos He said he wouldnapost use scaffolding, which he had quoted me for, or the internal work. He said he would cut back and because I was a friend he would do it for £,. I had looked at other roofing companies who quoted about £, for a full roof. However, despite feeling like Kirk had done him a favour with his cut price quote, Peter soon started realising it hadnapost solved the problem. Peter said: [Kirk] repaired it and then the leaks started coming through. He said he would send some sub-contractors out to patch it up. They were lovely lads and they said [Kirk] told them to patch over it. [Kirk] said he had re-felted the whole roof. He said he was going to give me a full roof and then when I was asking him to come back and have a look at it, he would never come back.  On two occasions, Kirk sent sub-contractors out to patch up the problems - but frustrated Peter had enough and called out another company to do a full survey. The results revealed that the roof had just been felted over, rather than being totally replaced like Kirk had promised. Peter said: I went to small claims court in March [this year] and he was ordered to pay me £,. and costs of £. It was gutting because the house was wrecked from top to bottom, there was the stress of not knowing when it was getting fixed and I didnapost have the money to get it fixed again. He added: He has cost me a lot of money and stress. The property was completely uninhabitable due to us not being able to complete the works. Kirk was in Emmerdale in  and , before his character Pete died when the lorry he was driving collided with a bus. He was previously in Brookside between  and  playing Mike Dixonaposs student pal Keith.

As Marjorie picked up the phone her grand-daughter Rhiannon, , screamed down the line: “Nan, get round here quick! Dad’s done something to Mum and he’s set the house on fire!” Marjorie, , and husband Denis, , raced to daughter Karen’s house to find Rhiannon and her sisters – Imogen, , and a teenager – in hysterics outside their blazing home. The girls’ bleating dad Thomas Peter was there too – denying he had done anything wrong. But the horrible truth would emerge within minutes.    Serial adulterer Peter, , had stuffed a flannel in Karen’s mouth, strangled her, set her on fire – then locked her in her bedroom as the house went up in flames. Marjorie, speaking to a national newspaper for the first time about that hellish day, August  last year, said: “We raced to the scene to see our grand-daughters outside in their pyjamas. “They yelled ‘Mum’s inside! We have to get her out!’ Then we were confronted by Thomas. “He told us, ‘Karen’s left home. She has taken the dog for a walk’. “The girls swore their dad was lying. They said their German shepherd was inside their car.” Marjorie said she screamed at Peter: “What have you done to her!”    She said Peter barred the way and said: “No one’s going in the house! Marge, you know I’d never hurt Karen.” But after the fire crew broke down the door to the bedroom in Romford, Essex, they found Karen’s badly burned body. Marjorie went on: “We saw Thomas handcuffed and taken away. But we didn’t see Karen’s body being brought out as we had been moved back by then. “When it came to identying Karen’s body, Denis was very firm that only he should go inside East Ham morgue. “He told me, ‘I don’t want you to see her like that’. “We are haunted by the fact we stood there helpless as Karen remained trapped inside the burning house. “I have nightmares that Karen was alive when he set fire to her. How can any parent ever get over that  The girls could easily have also died in the blaze.”  Karen had endured  years of hell at the hands of control freak Peter. He carried out affairs with four women at once. Last summer, Karen decided enough was enough and was about to leave him, telling friends: “I want my le back.” She ditched her wedding ring, got her tongue pierced and had Lord of the Rings tattoos. Marjorie said: “Thomas was furious and said he would leaveshe had any more – and one of Karen’s friends joked that she should have more so he’d go.” But Karen would die before she got the chance to flee. Peter had taken out a £, le insurance policy on Karen’s le just a month before killing her. In February he was jailed for le with a minimum of  years for murder and arson. During the trial, Marjorie learned for the first time that Karen and Peter had orced before remarrying, that he was an adulterer – and he tried to strangle her before. They split in  with Karen citing adultery on his part – before remarrying in . Marjorie said: “We were shocked.”  Marjorie was also horried to learn about Peter’s affair with four women. She said: “He played them off against each other. Later the girls told us one of the women he was seeing came storming round and was screaming and shouting outside the house.” Of the earlier strangling attempt, retired factory worker Marjorie said: “Karen went to police but later told them to drop charges. We think she was scared of him. “Karen told the girls how unhappy she was, but not to say anything to me and Denis because she didn’t want to alarm us. “Thomas knew how to turn on the charm. Initially I thought he was a lovely guy, but over time we saw another side. “He was a real know-all who didn’t like itanyone corrected him about a facthe got it wrong. “We realised that even though she worked at the Job Centre, she was always short of money. Thomas had an accident years before while working at Ford. “He injured his back and got a big payout. His favourite phrase has always been ‘milk the system’.” Sentencing him at the Old Bailey, Judge Richard Marks QC said Peter was an “arrogant, egotistical chauvinistic controlling bully”, adding: “What a twisted mentality you have... this was a planned killing for financial gain.”    Marjorie said: “When Karen was with her daughters, she was full of laughter and happiness. It was a joy to see them. “She used to love taking them to the stables to ride their horse Poppy. Then one day Karen called in tears to say, ‘Poppy has been killed’. “Someone had slashed her throat.” Now the family believe Peter killed Karen’s horse – after discovering from relatives he had stabbed a cat to death with a garden fork when he was a child. Marjorie last saw Karen the day before the murder. She recalled: “She came round with Imogen on my th birthday. Then they surprised us by coming along that evening to the RAFA club, where we all had a bit of dancing and fun together. “Just before she left, Karen gave me a big hug and said, ‘Happy birthday Mum. I love you!’” Marjorie is now warning other domestic violence victims to speak out before it is too late. She said: “We want to warn anyone suffering from domestic violence not to suffer in silence, but to go and talk to someone about it before it is too late. “There is help out there from the police and other agencies.” "},{"url":null,"title":"grooms nightmare 26 hour journey","story":"NewsGrooms nightmare -hour journey back from Marbella stag do after epic prankIain Tate’s three extra flights from Malaga to Leeds took in Dusseldorf, Paris and Dublin and lasted  hoursShareCommentsByJeremy Armstrong:,  JUN Updated:,  JUN NewsIain Tatewith the stag party in Spain\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailCheeky stags sent their groom on a ,-mile trip back from Spain.

The renovation involved turning the former five aposdormitory-likeapos staff accommodation into a single home, building two orangeries, replacing the windows, chimneys, staircases, and some high-tech upgrades around the house. The money comes from the Sovereign Grant, which was valued at £. million this year and comprised of profits from the Crown Estate.

Together they make up the Ovacome Choir, the brainchild of Craig McMurrough, who lost his younger sister Cheryl to the disease three years ago. Craig says: “I grew up in Dublin and singing is in my blood. I wanted to create a safe space where people could sing to their hearts’ content and,they felt like it, discuss their cancer stories without any pressure.” Since starting the fortnightly sessions last October, the choir has attracted over  members. And they can drop in at any time at the London offices of cancer support charity Ovacome.    Craig goes on: “Having lost my sister, I know it’s not just those women who have experienced oian cancer who need support, but close friends and family too. “There are no auditions, you don’t have to read music – all that matters is you like singing, want to improve your wellbeing and perhaps support others too.” Victoria Clare, CEO of Ovacome, says oian cancer can be incredibly isolating because it is less common – with just , new cases reported each year compared to over , for breast cancer. She says: “Creating communities through choirs can have an incredible, positive impact on wellbeing for cancer patients and their families.” The charity has plans to roll out similar choirs to other UK cities in the near future. Here, seven choir members tell their story: Ruth Retired nurse Ruth Payne, , from Wanstead, East London, was diagnosed with oian cancer at . She has run support lines for Ovacome for  years. She says: “The Ovacome choir is a joy. Everyone there knows how you feel, but without having to explain yourself. “Stepping outside your cancer story for a few hours every other Saturday is such a relief. “Many members have never sung, so for them it’s a revelation. For cancer survivors and sufferers, singing is more le-affirming than I could begin to describe.” Cathy Volunteer Cathy Selford, from Maida Vale, north-west London, is a choir volunteer and supports musical director Naveen Arles. She says: “I’ve lost so many friends through cancer, but never oian cancer, so saw it as a great way to learn what these women and families had experienced, how I could help. “With two other ­volunteers, Clare and Viv, I sing to help build confidence and bring them together as a group. “Singing next to women with incurable cancer with a smile on their face is so humbling and inspirational.” Jane Jane Hatfield, , from Honor Oak Park in south-east London, was diagnosed with stage three oian cancer in January. After major surgery, she has finished chemo and is waiting for the final scan to seeshe is cancer-free. She says: “I thought singing through my treatment would be a great way to distract myself and to find some joy in le when there was so much uncertainty. “What I found particularly buoying was meeting other women who’d survived, to give me hope I might get through this. “Seeing them alive and well and belting out tunes with gusto put a smile on my face at a dficult time. We don’t take ourselves too seriously and laugh all the time.”    Samixa It was seven months after first going to her GP that Samixa Shah, , from Edgware, North London, was diagnosed with stage four oian cancer in June . She says: “I’ve always believed in a holistic approach to health, I know the mind can help the body healyou give it a chance, so Ovacome’s health and wellbeing events are perfect – be it yoga, belly dancing, or singing. “My husband Bakul and I have been involved in Indian karaoke since . If I’m happy or sad, singing is the answer. I really can’t overstate the value of the Ovacome Choir. “When you sing, you really listen to the lyrics, which can lt you and give you a sense of purpose and meaning. “When I met choir founder Craig, I gave him the biggest hug to let him know how I felt about what he’d created. “I just hope it spreads so more women and loved ones can share its positivity.” Sandra After two years of symptoms, Sandra Lee, , from Farningham in Kent, was diagnosed in November . Now living with incurable oian cancer, she is a regular at the Ovacome choir along with her daughter ­Genevieve. Sandra says: “I heard about the Ovacome Choir after attending a health and wellbeing workshop. “It never fails to give us a high. It’s probably the only time I can escape myself and forget I’ve got cancer. Every day really does feel precious. It’s not about being good at singing – like me, many of the ladies there have ‘chemo-brain’, so remembering the lyrics is an uphill struggle. But we just laugh about it and sing our hearts out. “I count down the days when I can sing with my new family of friends, my daughter digging her elbow into my ribs smiling when I forget the words again!”    Genevieve Aged , Genevieve Lee lives with her mum and says: “I’ve always loved singing and know how ­therapeutic it can be, the blood pumping through your veins, opening your airways and belting out a tune.“I can just about sing, but Mum’s got a shocking voice, so it tooksome convincing.“Now every other Saturday is like Christmas for her. “She just lights up when she’s there. The laughter is infectious and she has made friends for le. “I seriously have to remind myself she has incurable cancer – she looks so happy and carefree. “The choir is the single best thing that’s happened to us in years.” The choir is directed by Naveen Arles, , who is also artistic director of the London International Gospel Choir. Last year he was awarded a British Citizens Award for his work in the arts and ­creative healing. Nav says: “The original plan was for me to be a medic to help people, then I realised I could make more impact with singing. “The Ovacome Choir encapsulates everything I believe in, to make the world a better, brighter place. “Seeing people who’ve never sung before light up in the darkest of circumstances is incredible.”To find out more about the choir, email events@ovacome.org.uk or call   "},{"url":null,"title":"jeremy corbyn vows give armed","story":"NewsJeremy Corbyn vows to give Armed Forces their own unionhe becomes PMEXCLUSIVE: Under the Tories pay has fallen by nearly six per cent for Army privates and Corbyn wants this to be addressedShareCommentsByNigel NelsonPolitical Editor:,  JUN NewsJeremy Corbyn wants to give power back to those employed in the Armed Forces \"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email The Armed Forces will get their own unionJeremy Corbyn becomes Prime Minister – though they will be banned from striking.

Prince Harry and his we Meghan needed the work to block out the roar of , jets a day taking off and landing directly over their luxury Windsor home, five miles west of Heathrow.Without it they might have struggled to get a decent night’s kip for themselves and two-month-old son Archie. The original reported estimate for soundproofing was just £,. But experts now believe the figure is much higher. Locals reacted with fury yesterday that the couple, both millionaires, had not paid for the lion’s share of the work themselves – while ordinary folk have to fork out thousands of pounds.     Businessman Kye Merkett, , who lives in Datchett, four miles from Heathrow, said: “There’s no reason they couldn’t pay for it. “They should put their hand in their own pocket or put up with the noise like the rest of us.” Yesterday, Harry and Meghan put the row over the renovation cost out of their minds as they joined crowds at the Boston Red Sox v New York Yankees baseball game at the London Stadium. The event was in support of the Invictus Games Foundation – one of Harry’s great causes – and Meghan was thrilled to receive a number  Yankees shirt with Archie’s name on it.

This money comes from the Sovereign Grant, valued at £. million this year and comprised of profits from the Queen’s property portfolio , which are paid to the Government. Twenty-five per cent of these profits are paid to the monarchy to fund the upkeep of its property, travel, security and staff. While the Sovereign Grant isn’t taxpayer money, it is considered to be public funds, belonging to the state.

Twenty-five per cent of the profits go to the monarchy to fund the upkeep of its property, travel, security and staff. While the Sovereign Grant is not taxpayer money, it is considered public funds, belonging to the State. Frogmore Cottage was previously five separate quarters for servants. Experts believe the soundproofing to the Grade II-listed house includes new “blocking layers” under the , sq ft tiled roof. Further layers would have been needed above the ceilings and within an estimated , sq ft of external walls. All exterior doors would need to be soundproofed and  windows upgraded to triple-glazing, at up to £, each.   Soundproofing technicians claim the work could cost between £, and £million. As a result, a new air-condi- tioning system would have to have been installed to avoid harmful moisture. Meghan, , has been working closely with architects and builders throughout the renovation of Frogmore, which was a gt to her and Harry from the Queen. The final bill may top £million. It reportedly includes painting interior and exterior walls with vegan paint, removing partitions, creating new doors, replacing staircases and adding bathrooms, bedrooms, a nursery and a kitchen with a “floating floor”. Substantial rewiring meant providing the house with its own electrical sub- station, while gas and water mains were upgraded. Designs submitted to Windsor and Maidenhead Borough Council have included two orangeries.  The cost of redecoration, believed to include lavish furnishings costing £,, is not included in the £.million. And under Palace rules the royals do not have to declare any expenses spent on property that come in under £,. A source said: “Harry and Meghan would find it very dficult to live there without proper soundproofing because of the scale of the noise pollution. “All the soundproofing work would need to be of a high enough standard to take into account a third runway being installed at Heathrow in the future, so there shouldn’t be any more work needed.” Residents who live within approximately three miles of Heathrow – where the noise level is above  decibels – can apply for funds towards soundproofing. But residents just outside have to foot the bill themselves. Retired councillor Malcolm Beer, , said: “We live around six miles from the end of the runway and we’re not eligible for any compensation. If people here want to soundproof their homes they have to pay for it. They can’t rely on handouts. “This will rankle with a lot of people. I’m far from pleased. If you’ve got the TV on and a plane flies past you won’t hear a thing. The only option is to turn up the volume andyou open a window for ventilation, you’re scuppered. It’s a nightmare.” Graham Smith, of anti-monarchy group Republic, said: “They should be paying for their own refurbishment.” A Palace spokesman last night said the cost of soundproofing would be nowhere near £million, but refused to elaborate on specic details. A Buckingham Palace spokesperson said: Speculation that £million of the renovations at Frogmore was spent on soundproofing is a wildly inaccurate fabrication.

I am struggling to think of a single redeeming feature about this.  Elsewhere, the organisers of a similar competition found themselves in hot water with the Advertising Standards Authorityafter it found the promotion had not been administered properly. Two people complained that Raffle House had changed its entry method halfway through the promotion, offering free tickets to those making later entries. This, and the extension of it closing date, were found to be in breach of the code. Tickets to win the £, one-bedroom flat in Brixton, south London, launched in April last year and the original closing date was June .    This was extended and now the raffle is due to end on Sunday.

Harrowing footage from this yearaposs festival shows the hounds - mostly stray dogs or stolen pet dogs - trapped in tiny cages where they canapost stand or breathe properly. They are then taken to a slaughterhouse in Yulin, Guangxi province of south-west China. The distressed dogs were left with little food or water and have become malnourished while being kept in a dark warehouse. The festival, known as Yulin Lychee and Dog Meat Festival, started on June  to celebrate the summer solstice.    Though itaposs not a traditional celebration, the event was heavily promoted by the Yulin government for driving tourism back in  and dog traders deemed it a business opportunity to boost meat sales. Keith Guo, a media officer for PETA Asia, toldthat dog traders hit the dogs in the head with a rod and blow-torch them to burn their coats before boiling them in hot water to remove any remaining fur. He said: Most of the time, the dogs are not killed instantly but are knocked unconscious when the vendors batter them in the head. The dogs wake up when they were being boiled or blow-torched alive. Some of them are slashed in the throat to have the blood drained from the body.    Each year, an estimated  million dogs and four million cats are slaughtered for meat across China, according to the Humane Society International. Claire Bass, Executive Director of Humane Society International UK, said: “The dog meat trade in China is first and foremost about crime and cruelty. The Yulin festival is one small but distressing example of an unspeakably cruel trade run by dog thieves and sellers who routinely steal pets in broad daylight using poison darts and rope nooses, defy public health and safety laws, and cause horrendous suffering, all for a meat that most people in China don’t consume.   Clips posted on Weibo, the Chinese equivalent to Twitter , show dog vendors killing the four-legged friends in a cruel and inhumane way.One video shows a dog left petried and struggling to escape as it watches its another animal being killed by a dog trader. Another one shows a greyhound being carried to a boiling cauldron by three men as a little boy watches in horror. The dog howls in terror as it tries to free itself before two men hold it down and cover it with a lid until it dies.  Animal rights campaigner Michele Brown said: This animal died the worst death imaginable. You can see raw fear in the dogaposs eyes as itaposs carried towards the boiling water. As they drop the dog into the water it screams for help, skin burning and blistering. It flails around so much, two strong men have to hold on to the lid. The young boy is an innocent child and he appears to be repulsed by what he saw. Many of the slaughtered dogs are to be sold and served by locals as they replace pork or beef in the cuisine.    Keith, who is also an animal lover, said the local market at Yulin is selling the meat at about  to  yuanper kilo and dog stew is one of the common dishes seen during the festival. He explained that dog meat smells and tastes aposgamierapos compared to other types of meat, and chefs would garnish it with chilli peppers and ginger to cover the strong odour.    In Yulin, a restaurant called Yulin No. Crispy Dog Meat has gained fame for its roasted dog meat over the years. Last year, it set up over  tables inside and along the road outside the restaurant to serve dozens of customers, said local sources. Asked what would the dog traders do to the unsold dogs as the festival approaches its end on June , Keith said: Most likely they will kill all of them, because they are not going to keep the dogs for another year. They will make it into processed food such as dog jerky.

Especially here, where they have an extensive menu dedicated to them categorised by flavour and even offer “cocktail experiences” for those looking to learn from their mixologists. Our waiter recommended a real fruit mocktail with lots of real crushed fruit and berries and juices to provide a thirst quenching mix without the alcohol .We relaxed into the quiet and sipped our drinks in the sun as we pondered over the vast menu options.The venue’s interior is a mix of classic wooden floors with soft leathers and muted tartans in greys and brown, combining traditional charm with modern comfort. vw, px\"  The menus are bound in heavy leather books, and there was plenty of choice.My other half ordered bruschetta to startwhich, of course, we ended up sharing. Well, I am eating for two!Who knew that three simple slices of toasted bread with oils and tomato could be so delicious  Also, both of us were pretty in awe of the little yellow tomatoes – spot the uncultured pair.I toyed with the idea of my usual steak pie-pick and even deliberated a fish dish, but in the end we both went for the same main course of chicken tikka curryand it was presented beautully.The plate held rice and naan with a small dish of mango chutney and a large dish of gorgeously bright-coloured chicken tikka.The chicken was wonderfully soft and the tikka sauce was full of flavour, not too salty with just a bit of zing. vw, px\"  I’m notoriously soft when it comes to anything spicy, but this was just enough for me and I only needed water for my tingly lips towards the end of finishing the plateful.We were both equally surprised at the portion size from the Caird. Although it felt upmarket, there was no scrimping on the food.I chose the brownie for dessert and my partner the sticky toffee pudding . Again, both platefuls looked almost too good to eat.My dark chocolate brownie was topped with drizzled caramel sauce next to a scoop of vanilla ice cream with sprinkles of crushed chocolate and chocolate sauce. Strawberries and homemade fudge was presented to the side in a design with shards of wafer and small dollops of salted caramel and strawberry mousse.

It would have been a little, maybe slightly, awkward. When the news came out it was near to the end of the season, so all I could do was give my all for Ayr to win.“And it’s not something you even remotely think about it when you’re playing on a Saturday. It’s not in your head, you are just doing your job in the day.”While he’s known for months he was Tannadice-bound, it was only with the start of pre-season training at the beginning of the week that he was able to get down to working with his new team-mates.And already, he admits, he’s been impressed with what he’s seen.With most of the squad that will be used next season already in place, he is confident the quality required to live up to expectations and secure automatic promotion is there.“Just from the first couple of days of training you can see the quality in the squad and the players the manager has to choose from. To be added to that is, obviously, good for myself and, hopefully, I can stay in the team and do well.“I have experience of winning the Championship with St Mirren so I think I’m ready for that challenge of the expectation of winning games and playing in front of a big crowd at Tannadice. I’m confident that I can handle it and I’m sure we’ll be doing all we can to make it happen.”And he’s made it clear that, for all the Championship is a ision he rates highly, he plans to be spending most of his United career operating a step up from it.“I’m ready to challenge myself at a higher level. It would have been greatUnited had gone up last season but % the aim is to win this league.”"},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-the-old-firm-menzies-and-easterhouse-gangs-feature-in-our-look-back","story":"Another selection of photographs from the Herald and Times archive, today spanning the  years between  and ."},{"url":null,"title":"memories-pictures-from-across-glasgow-throughout-the-years","story":"Images from the archives of the Herald and Evening Times."},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-old-photographs-of-glasgow-through-the-years","story":"Images from the archives of the Herald and Evening Times."},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-do-you-recognise-any-of-these-old-photographs-of-glasgow","story":"Images from the archives of the Herald and Evening Times."},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-do-you-recognise-any-of-these-old-photographs-of-glasgow","story":"Images from the archives of the Herald and Evening Times."},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-how-many-of-these-old-photos-of-glasgow-do-you-remember","story":"Images from the archives of the Herald and Evening Times."},{"url":null,"title":"watch-moment-angus-woman-zoe-archibald-gets-stuck-in-toy-car","story":"THIS is the hilarious moment a Scotswoman got stuck in a childrens toy car - and had to be cut out using a bread kne."},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-memories-of-happy-days-gone-by-in-glasgow","story":"Images from the archives of the Herald and Evening Times."},{"url":null,"title":"the-rocket-man-elton-john-tribute-night-heading-to-kilmarnock","story":"A TRIBUTE night to Sir Elton John is set to hit Kilmarnock."},{"url":null,"title":"interview-with-glasgow-singer-dylan-john-thomas","story":"WHEN yourenamed after legend Bob Dylan, you have to be pretty bold to embark on a music career."},{"url":null,"title":"ho-wong-glasgows-final-message-to-evening-times-readers-as-it-closes","story":"A WELL-KNOWN Chinese restaurant has shared an emotional message with Evening Times readers as it prepares to close after  years."},{"url":null,"title":"jess-glynne-pulls-out-of-trnsmt-festival","story":"Jess Glynne has pulledout of TRNSMT Festival following advice from her vocal surgeon."},{"url":null,"title":"history-of-womens-golf-the-focus-of-glasgow-study","story":"THE first in-depth study of the history of womenrsquos golf in Scotland is being launched by Glasgow researchers."},{"url":null,"title":"over-4m-of-funding-approved-to-make-glasgow-homes-more-energy-efficient","story":"MORE than pound million of funding has been approved in a bid to make city homes more energy efficient."},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-stroll-down-memory-lane-with-old-glasgow-pictures","story":"Weve been busy digging through our picture archives to bring you some gems.

Being a team player and praising the guys back in the factory, or choosing to take all the credit yourself will affect the speed and success of upgrades to your car as well as future moves to bigger teams.It#s not just you, the player that will be able to move between teams, other drivers will sign contracts with other teams as their careers rise and fall. A new wave of drivers will also move in to challenge the dominance of the likes of Hamilton and Vettel over the games  seasons.Each of the F cars have their own little quirks, some like the Ferrari#s have pure straight line speed, others, like the Mercedes feel a little more composed in the corners.Moving into the classic cars you can really feel the raw untamed power these vehicles had, they all feel more twitchy, more out of control and really push you to the limits # as they did the drivers at the time.Each car can be tailored as much or as little to your personal style and the inidual track your racing on to maximise your lap time. vw, px\"  That said, hitting holding your nerve through a high speed corner as the force feedback tells really makes you feel how close to the edge you are, does feel fantastic.As you#d expect from Codemasters # F  is a simulation racer. Realism is key. However, tweaking the assists will allow the game to give you a bit of a helping hand with things like gear changes, brakes and traction control, while a D racing line with braking points can be displayed on the track as you get used to the controls.As you gradually turn these off with increasing confidence you#ll really start to get the most of this fantastic game.For those out there that like the challenge of a real person, the multiplayer mode has also had a bit of TLC.Improvements to matchmaking and the penalty system should make sure you get fairer races, against players that won#t shove you off the road and slam into you at corner # unless that#s what you#re after!The league system and weekend championships also bring a competitive edge to proceedings, and for esports fans it#s also easier than ever to follow the digital racing series.F  is pushing the current generation of consoles to their limits and the developers have done an incredible job of improving on last year#s already fantastic offering.With some yearly games there can be temptation to skip a year, butthere#s every going to be a Formula One game you need to pick up # this is the one. vw, px\"  Using the replayto check out your own performance really allows you to take the time to focus on the beautul attention to detail that has gone into recreating the world#s most iconic tracks.Combined with the tweaks to the cars themselves, which make them feel more realistic than ever before, this really is a must-own game for F fans and racing fans in general."},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/06/5d15af676e4f71.47568359.jpg ","title":"aberdeen community groups take part in 24 hour litter pick","story":"Residents young and old turned out to take part in a -hour litter pick across Aberdeen.Groups, schools, and organisations were cleaning up their area as part of the Aberdeen City Council-organised event.It saw  community litter picks over  hours, starting at midnight.It began with the council’s environmental services team near the River Dee, followed by the other groups every hour.During last year’s event,  black bags of rubbish were collected, along with larger items including a car bonnet, a doocot, a satellite dish, vacuum cleaner and four shopping trolleys.Other groups taking part this year included Friends of Walker Dam, the council’s countryside rangers and tree team, Friends of Seaton Park and Brighter Bucksburn.Sheila Gordon, chairwoman of Friends of Seaton Park, said: “It’s about the efforts to keep our city clean.

Who in Argyll and Bute is responsible for this plan  How many of the outcomes have been achieved As someone who has been involved with autism personally and professionally for many years, I find it extremely disappointing there seems to be an inability by those in authority to get organised enough to address the issues and provide services for autistic people and their families.There is no need for further drafts and consultations.Someone in the authority needs to take responsibility for the existing strategy and implementation plan and get on with it.Maureen Mackintosh, Ardrishaig.Sir,Scotland’s small building firms had a strong start to , in contrast to the UK construction small and medium sized enterprisesector, according to the Federation of Master BuildersScotland.The FMB State of Trade Survey for the first quarter of , the only quarterly assessment of the UK-wide SME construction sector, showed SME workloads declined for the first time in six years.In Scotland, however, there was a jump of  per cent compared with the previous quarter. Thirty per cent of weighted responses were positive, up from  per cent from the fourth quarter of .It is encouraging the Scottish construction industry is bucking the wider Brexit trend with workloads and enquires in rude health. The UK-wide picture is very dferent, with the construction SME sector overall contracting for the first time in six years.Scotland’s good fortune could be due to fewer EU workers being based north of the border compared with other parts of the country, like in London where one in three construction workers are from the EU.Relying less heavily on migrant workers has meant the Scottish construction industry hasn’t fallen foul of thousands of EU workers ing home during the long march to Brexit due to no longer feeling welcome in the UK or sure of their future here.Scotland’s builders, however, must not be complacent. Looking ahead, the First Minister has indicated thatthe UK does leave the EU later this year, she wants a second independence referendum before the next Scottish Parliament election in . This additional political uncertainty, on top of the continued uncertainty stemming from Brexit, could impact on the construction sector in Scotland.The fear is a looming second referendum could test consumer confidence this year and next. For construction SMEs, this is particularly concerning as their prospects are vulnerable to dips in consumer confidence as so much work comes from the private domestic sector.Gordon Nelson, Director of FMB Scotland.Sir,I was joined by my fellow Conservative councillors in Kilmory recently as we discussed atthe numerous challenges facing Argyll and Bute.Ferry sailings, roads, education and the SNP#s late single farm payments were all mentioned.With the SNP hammering local authority spending and cutting our budgets, challenges in delivering services will become more prevalent.Despite this climate of cuts from the separatists, Conservative councillors are delivering for Argyll. This includes extra funding for the Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund, more funding for infrastructure and an increase in roads winter maintenance resources across Argyll.As ever, my fellow Conservatives and I will continue to fight non stop to make sure our rural constituency is not sidelined by this unceasingly urban and separatism-obsessed over centralising Scottish Government.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and Islands ward.Sir,I photographed this unusual visitor to Kilduskland Road, Ardrishaig, on April .

The lane floods, so between trying to dodge puddles, you land in dog dirt.I wish they would fix the path because a lot of people use it, some of them pensioners with or parents with prams.Celia MacFarlane, Lochgilphead.Sir,Seven out of ten people with diabetes feel overwhelmed by the demands of their condition and this signicantly affects their mental and physical health.That is why we are calling for new national standards for diabetes emotional and mental health support and to increase support available in Argyll to people living with diabetes.As part of Diabetes UK’s Diabetes Weekwe are urging people in Argyll to #SeeDiabetesDferently and back our campaign for national standards for diabetes mental health support and services.Our recently published research revealed the relentless nature of diabetes can impact people’s emotional well-being and mental health, ranging from day-to-day frustration and low mood, to specic psychological and mental health dficulties including clinical depression and anxiety.The findings, published in the report #Too often missing: Making emotional and psychological support routine in diabetes care#, show that diabetes is much more than a physical condition – and that emotional and psychological demands of living with diabetes should be recognised and support provided.Diabetes Scotland is urgently calling on the NHS to create national standards for diabetes emotional and mental health services. These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"monsters and magic come to lochgilphead booksigning","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead#s Argyll Book Centre is holding a book signing with Lari Don.The Secret of the Kelpie author will be in the indie book shop on Saturday June  to read her new book to eager ears and talk to readers about their favourite folk tales and inventing monsters.After a quick break, Lari willto read excerpts from her spellbinding Spellchasers trilogy to inspire you to imagine magical adventures of your own and tell one of your favourite myths.Born in Chile, Lari Don was brought up in Scotland where she has worked in politics and for the BBC.

regions first Premier Inn.And now that developers have dropped controversial proposals to include a new supermarket, the plans are being given the thumbs up from David Parker.Mr Parker, who represents Leaderdale and Melrose at the local authority, told us: \"I am pleased that Newland Assets have listened carefully to the representations they have received concerning the Borders Gateway proposals.\"A Class  food retail store was very much against local and national planning policy for the site in Tweedbank as it introduced out of town shopping but the developer has listened carefully to ious concerns on this issue and removed it.ldquoThe new proposals have taken on board many observations made so far during the planning process and the revised plans are better in terms of design, road layout and visual impact.\"I am very excited about the economic impact this development could have on the wider Borders economy.ldquoSecuring a Premier Inn for the Scottish Borders will help put our region firmly on the tourism map and the economic impact of Premier Inn and the potential for other investors to follow them, is something which must be grasped.ldquoThe revised Borders Gateway proposals will complement the work taking place to develop the Tweedbank Innovation Park and will sit comfortably alongside the public and private sector projects which are underway at Tweedbank at present.\"The pound million Borders Gateway development also includes a BP filling station, a Costa drive-thru coffee shop, and a MS kiosk.And it is expected that the new outlets will create up to  jobs.Although the wider vision of the development had been welcomed, the supermarket part of the plans had come in for criticism.And Newland Assets revised their plans to omit the supermarket earlier this year.Councillor Parker added: ldquoBorders Gateway has the overwhelming support of the public and many businesses in the area and now that the food retail plans have been dropped there is no reason why these proposals should not be fully endorsed by the planners and backed by Scottish Borders Council.\"The economic advantages of this proposal signicantly outweigh the very small number of policy considerations which are left.ldquoAlthough it was right for the planners to raise concerns about the previous proposal, now that the developer has listened carefully to all the objections and amended the plans accordingly to deal with them, the Borders public simply wonrsquot understand why the council isnrsquot backing this ambitious inward investment opportunity.\"It will help bring new jobs and secure existing jobs and undoubtedly lead to a tourism boost in the Scottish Borders.ldquoI look forward to this development receiving approval and work commencing on

Looking ahead, the First Minister has indicated thatthe UK does leave the EU later this year, she wants a second independence referendum before the next Scottish Parliament election in . This additional political uncertainty, on top of the continued uncertainty stemming from Brexit, could impact on the construction sector in Scotland.The fear is a looming second referendum could test consumer confidence this year and next.

The day after the crash, Superintendent Jim Guy of Strathclyde Police said there had been no evidence from the crew of any problems before the tragedy.He said the evidence available suggested an accident rather than terrorist attack. The scene of the crash was sealed off almost immediately and an air exclusion zone was imposed.Although most of the wreckage was left for accident investigators to examine, it is understood Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch officers removed boxes and cases containing secret papers on Friday morning.On Saturday,  personnel from RAF Machrihanish were drafted in to help find and catalogue debris from the crash.FIFTY YEARS AGOKintyre could be surfers# MeccaKintyre could become the major centre in Britain for surfingthe enthusiasm of two young men gets the encouragement it deserves.One of them, George Raynes, of Bishopbriggs in Lanarkshire, is secretary of the Scottish Surf Club, and with his treasurer, James Short of Glasgow, has just completed a preliminary survey of several of the Kintyre beaches with a view to exploiting them for the sport of surfing.George has surfed on beaches all over Britain and also in the Channel Isles and in Europe and he thinks that the beaches at Machrihanish and Southend could become the Mecca for British surfers and the venue for the British Championships.He was particularly impressed with the waves at Machrihanish but thinks Southend has great potential as well.He told the Courier: #The possibilities here are tremendous. These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area. In the winter one would have to wear a wetsuit, of course, but the conditions are ideal and the wave forms have great potential # after all, they are coming straight in from the Atlantic over the north of Ireland.#What I#d like to see is a surf club established in Campbeltown. It could become a great asset from a tourist and amenity point of view.#And any Kintyre people who really took up the sport would have a great advantage over other surfers when it comes to competition because they have the benefit of readily available beaches all year round.#If this club gets going, the chances are that the British surf champions in the years to come will be Kintyre people.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOOrr Ewing CupFootballers were favoured with beautul weather last Saturday and the games played on Kinloch Park in the Orr Ewing Cup competition brought together very large gatherings of spectators.The match in the afternoon was brought to a sudden termination by an unfortunate dispute over the award of a goal. The opposing teams were Kintyre and HMS Thames.Kintyre opened strongly and after  minutes# play had scored twice. The dispute arose over the award of the second goal, which Thames claimed to be offside.The referee, Mr Duncan McCallum, an old Hearts player, was of a dferent opinion, and on his allowing Kintyre the goal, the naval team without more do walked off the field.It is understood that the Thames team intimated to the league at the weekly meeting on Monday night their withdrawal from the competition.The teams were: Kintyre # Jas McKinlay: James Black and Archd Sharp: M Muir, A McCrank and T Cameron: R McGeachy and D Brown: Dan McNaughton: N Scally and J Donaldson.HMS Thames # Meese: Jesseman and Love: McCloud, Hirst and Fernie: Dunnell and Weekes: McGeachy: Slynn and Segrott.Referee # Mr D McCallum.In the evening, the opposing teams were Campbeltown and Kilbrannan. A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game. He is a fearless player with a rare turn of speed and a most deadly shot.At least three of six goals came from his foot, and were beautully taken, while he was the means of a fourth which he gave the right wing the honour of finishing.Kilbrannan#s solitary goal was well taken by Brown after a clever break through and an inidual run.Kilbrannan has material for the making of a team that should get much better results than they have so far achieved.The players are keen and inidually have a lot of football in them, but an almost entire absence of method both in attack and defence spoils their chances.The teams were: Campbeltown # A McCallum: G Quigley and Chas McKinven: D Kelly, J McDonald and John Martin: Chas Black and Arch Black: Arch O#May: W McKillop and James Martin.Kilbrannan # John McIntyre: D Bannatyne and Wm Gilchrist: J Short, N McKenzie and James Boyce: D Gilchrist and M Brodie: C Kelly: D Mathieson and J Brown.Referee # Mr W Mustarde."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week june 7 2019","story":"As I retreat into the comfort of a warm house and an even warmer coffee, I wonder what it must have been like for Columba and his fellow monks as they made their way from the shores of Ireland to the wilds of Argyll.The fragile shell of a coracle was not the most effective shelter against the wildness of our coastline.Yet they came.

There are several factors influencing this, but the major factor which has tipped the balance is the extended funding hours and the negative impact this is having both financially on small businesses, like Mary Poppins, and to the quality of early learning and childcare.New Scottish Government policy instructs councils to increase their funded childcare hours from  to , by . This move also includes longer opening hours and a move from term time to year-round opening hours to attempt to make childcare more nationally accessible.Ms Dewar said: ldquoThe money received for funded places does not cover the costs of providing the quality of early learning and childcare which we want and are required to provide, especially with regards to staff costs.ldquoThe timescales and measures that the Scottish Government has put in place to educate a workforce to meet the increased requirements are insufficient, and there is a serious shortfall to meet the requirements of the extended funding.ldquoEast Lothian Council indicated it estimated it would require approximately  staff to facilitate the increase in funded hours in East Lothian. The majority of these posts are early learning and childcare practitioners.ldquoThe local authority advertises early learning practitioner posts at between pound. and pound. per hour. Private nurseries are unable to compete with these rates of pay due to the funding rates we are allocated.A group of parents and staff, including Ms Dewar, are visiting county MSP Iain Gray to discuss the problems, but Ms Dewar added that unless he can ldquowork a miracle and change the policy, then it is unlikely the decision to close the nursery will be reversed.When asked about the nursery, Mr Gray said: ldquoThe loss of any nursery provision is disappointing, particularly with the Governmentrsquos , funded hours policy set to be implemented next year.ldquoIn the case of the Mary Poppins Nursery, the owner has highlighted a number of factors that have contributed to their decision to close.ldquoI have written to East Lothian Council about some of these issues.ldquoHowever, there are also wider issues at play here. The nursery sector has been warning the Scottish Government that private nurseries are struggling in the run-up to the roll-out of its flagship , policy from August .ldquoMinisters must act quickly to address the sectorrsquos concerns and ensure that the capacity exists to deliver the funded hours next year.A Scottish Government spokesperson said: ldquoIt is, of course, concerning to hear of any nursery considering closure, and the obvious effects this might have on staff, parents and children.ldquoEast Lothian Council has provided assurance that they will support families to find alternative early learning and childcare places for children who had been expecting to use the Mary Poppins Nursery from this August.Ms Dewar added: ldquoI am distraught that circumstances have forced me to this decision and that such a wonderful place for children to experience their early years is to close.The decision was met with an outpouring of grief on social media.The nurseryrsquos recent th birthday was marked with a garden party.The nursery was founded by Sue Armstrong, affectionately still called lsquoMiss Suersquo, after she had written to Mary Poppins author P L Travers to askshe could use the name.Miss Sue said: ldquoI received many letters from P L Travers about the nursery.ldquoAt the beginning, she wanted to know what the nursery was going to be like. She had no objection to me using the name, she just wanted to find out more. I ended up meeting her as well.ldquoWe were hoping to get her to come and open the nursery  years ago, but her arthritis was bad. We stayed in touch, however. I would send her letters about how the nursery was getting on along with photos, and she would write back saying how she liked it, and ideas of what to do.ldquoShe said that the children should be encouraged to make up their own stories. lsquoChildren like doing that,rsquo she said.Miss Sue sold the nursery to Ms Dewar in  as she was ldquosick of all the paperwork.She said. ldquoWhen I heard it was to close down, well, itrsquos just all so sad really. Itrsquos such a terrible shame.ldquoIt is such a nice and happy place for the children, homely and warm. Itrsquos just awful that it canrsquot stay open.Miss Sue still attends events at the nursery, dressed as the iconic nanny Mary Poppins.She added: ldquoIn the film, Mary Poppins says that shersquoll stay until the winds change. Well, maybe this is the wind changing for Mary Poppins Nursery.Ward councillor Craig Hoy said: ldquoThe closure of the Mary Poppins Nursery is deeply regrettable but reflects the real pressures the independent sector is experiencing as a result of the SNPrsquos , hours policy.\"The Government faces huge problems to provide the free childcare it has promised.

Five minutes in a car can cover a distance which would represent a fairly long walk.Itrsquos kind of a simple principle, I know, but one I sometimes forget, as I did a couple of weekends ago. We set off from an event at Amisfield Walled Garden for a walk. My idea was to walk along the River Tyne to Hailes Castle and thenndash by car a -minute round trip.We had some supplies in the form of fruit in my bag and a little water. It was a sunny and warm day and so we set off on our adventure.We began the walk at the old Abbey Bridge which spans the Tyne close to Amisfield. As you walk under its ancient ribbed arches of this late medieval bridge, you get a real sense of its age and the beauty of its construction.The path beyond follows the river and it is almost impossible now to imagine that a great abbey once stood here, with connections to the infant Mary Queen of Scots. A ruined old mill of later centuries still stands here. I reflected on the stories of this location: a courageous nun who defied a flood in the th century and a gruesome murder in the th century and just visible in the near distance the old graveyard, now ringed with trees and almost unrecognisable as a resting place for the dead.A labourer once thought he saw a ghost at the graveyard, but it proved to be something , and I had a wry smile at that tale of a drunken evening over  years ago. These are all tales I have already told here, but they entered my head as we wandered to the gate that led along the northern bank of the river.Hailes Castle is on the southern bank of the river and I knew that there was a bridge that would takes us over. So we set off to find the bridge.But it took us over four hours.It was a stunning walk, with wild flowers and trees decorating the riverbank almost all the way. A grey heron seemed to follow us perhaps he was warning us that the walk was longer than Irsquod anticipated.It is a walk decorated with history too, of course. A stone in the corner of the field by the first gate caught my eye. Deeply ingrained groove marks on it intrigued me. I was later told that it could be the marks of a plough, as the tips of the plough have scraped over the stone a ploughman unwittingly leaving evidence of his unrecorded toil.Halfway along the walk we arrived at the small hamlet of Sandyrsquos Mill. The cottages and mill itself have been beautully restored. The th-century mill still has its waterwheel, although itrsquos now embedded in silt. The mill ceased working  years ago and was transformed into a residential property, but with much of the old machinery inside still intact. It appears to be a very sympathetic and sensitive restoration.It was beyond Sandyrsquos Mill that the distance began to take its toll. The young kids were tired and desperately looking for the bridge. I spotted Traprain Law some distance away and realised that I had badly misjudged the distance and time it would take with wee ones. We had to sit and have a rest and story, with that grey heron listening, to gather the energy to continue.The kids didnrsquot complain much as we wandered along the still-beautul path, now desperately looking for the bridge. As we had rested wersquod phoned for friends to come and lsquorescuersquo us at Hailes Castle with chocolate and water, and we knew they were there waiting for us.Irsquove never been quite so pleased to see Hailes Castle. It loomed suddenly from across the river. I had never approached it from this direction and it certainly did its best to impress. The bridge was just a wee way further and we finally crossed it with a sense of relief.When we arrived at the castle, the kids devoured the chocolate and water, in a way that reminded me of a scene in the movie Ice Cold in Alex. Thank goodness for good friends.Wersquod made it and what a sense of adventure ndash and an achievement!I sat with the kids and told stories as my we went with the friends to retrieve our car. Hailes Castle drips with history but they wanted tales about giants.The day was a lesson for me: to think more carefully about distance when setting on a walk! I thoroughly recommend the path, especially on a lovely summerrsquos day. But itrsquos going to take half a dayyou have kids. So prepare for that!Unbelievably, the kids later wanted to go to a playpark. ldquoWhere do they get the energy  my we asked.ldquoFrom us! I replied!"},{"url":null,"title":"hopes-of-seeing-railway-station-return-to-haddington","story":"RAGESmet with Peter Brett Associates ndash a leading consultancy of engineers and planners ndash to outline the case for improved transports links to and from East Lothian.One of the more ambitious plans was to see theof a railway station to Haddington.Residents of the town have not been served by a railway station since , with the station closing to freight nearly  years later.However, RAGES feels there could still be a possibility of a station ing to the town ndash though the group acknowledged that work needed to be done.A spokesman for the group said: ldquoRAGES expressed its preference for re-opening of the Haddington branch, ideally to the previous terminus on Station Road.ldquoMinimal compulsory purchase relocation of existing industrial units would be required the biggest physical obstacle would be the reconstruction of the A overbridge which was unwisely built without preserving the railway alignment and loading gauge.ldquoA level crossing would be required at Gateside, failing which an alternative road access could be provided for the new houses on the north side of the line onto the A.There was also a suggestion of creating car parking and even a park and ride facility in the town to serve the new service, which would link the town with Edinburgh.The spokesman added: ldquoAs insufficient parking exists at Station Road , a park and ride station at Oak Tree would be essential, which could also serve the substantial Letham Mains and Gateside developments.ldquoJust east of where the A crosses the railway formation, there is a large rectangular piece of ground, occupied only by scrub, which would be suitable as a car park.ldquoAs only single track would suffice between Longniddry and Haddington, it would be possible to retain a footpath cycleway as the line was originally provided with double track throughout.ldquoAn electric train service from Haddington to Edinburgh would provide the speed and capacity which road transport ndash car or bus ndash cannot match.

It is better than some human beings are treated ndash that is the sad truth.Mr Farnsworth was presenting an annual report on the racecoursersquos performance over the last financial year.The Beast from the East snow storm, an outbreak of equine influenza, and a long spell of dry weather all contributed to what he described as one of the worst years the course had been through in his memory.A number of key fixtures were cancelled and profits fell.In December, four horses died during one day of racing at the course but a subsequent review by the British Horseracing Authority ruled that the course and race organisers were not at fault.Councillor Gordon Mackett asked Mr Farnsworththe racecourse had been affected by animal welfare concerns.The course manager said: ldquoWe did have a horrible day when there were four fatalities however, these were all completely separate incidents.ldquoIn a sport like this you will get injuries and fatalities from time to time. It is horric for the people involved.Mr Farnsworth said that the public were becoming more aware of incidents like these through social media which, he said, ldquofuelled the debate around animal welfare.However, he said there had been no indication that it had had an impact on events at Musselburgh, which saw record crowds at its Easter Day racing this year and another sell-out Ladies Day.His report to the committee revealed that the racecourse had reported a loss over the last financial year after it paid over pound, of legal costs relating to the ongoing process by East Lothian Council to find new third-party operators to run the course.Councillor Kenny McLeod questioned why the costs were being met by the course and not the council itself.However, depute chief executive of the council Alex McCrorie told the councillor that the costs were charged to the racecourse because when the new operator was procured it would be the racecourse that benefitted.He conceded to Mr McLeod that, without the legal costs being taken from the coursersquos funds, it would have been in profit last year.East Lothian Council replaced the previous governance committee which oversaw the running of the course with a new committee last year after relations between members of the old committee badly deteriorated and the British Horseracing Authoritythreatening to suspend its racing licence.The new Musselburgh Racing Associated Committeendash which is made up of four elected councillors and two representatives of the racing industry, currently members of Lothians Racing Syndicate ndash has been overseeing the hunt for a new operator.However, the BHA has only granted temporary licences and extensions under the new committee as it continues to monitor its performance.Mr Farnsworth said that the introduction of the new interim committee had caused some problems too.

Edinburgh was full of colour and noise, and there was a real sense of hope and expectation. Donald Dewar’s speech in the parliament’s first chamber was one of those moments where the hair stood up on the back of your neck. In my view – as someone in a dferent party to Donald, with very dferent views on the ultimate destination for Scotland – that speech was one of the finest speeches in modern Scottish history.How much of a privilege is it to run the country and how dficult is the top job There’s no doubt that being First Minister of Scotland has been the privilege of my le.

And like many people in senior positions, particularly women, I have had moments of self-doubt but I believe it’s important to be open about that and to be a role model to young people. But more than anything, I am grateful to have the opportunity to help make Scotland a better place to live.What is the Parliament’s biggest achievement in the last  years  Twenty years on there are so many achievements that we can be proud of, and that have made Scotland a better place to live, work, study and grow up in. From free personal care to the abolition of tuition fees, the ban on smoking in public places, a minimum pricing for alcohol and the introduction of equal marriage. There’s a long, long list of these inidual policies that wouldn’t have happenedwe hadn’t had a Scottish Parliament.Across the world there are other countries now looking to Scotland to learn from the globally ground-breaking things we’ve done on public health, on tackling climate change, and on the work we’re doing around renewable energy.But above any inidual policy, there is a much more fundamental achievement, and that is that,  years on, the parliament has reinvigorated Scottish democracy and become an accepted, established part of Scottish le. We should all take great pride in that.What has been the most dficult challenge the Parliament has faced and you personally The sad and unexpected death in  of Donald Dewar – the man who had driven through the Scotland Act and then become the first First Minister – was no doubt a moment of great uncertainty for all MSPs in the early days of the Parliament.On a personal level, I’d have to say assuming the office of First Minister was my biggest challenge. Despite having spent  years in frontline politics, and seven as Deputy First Minister, nothing can prepare you for the moment where suddenly you are the last word, where there is no longer anyone above you to seek a second opinion on somethingyou want it – everyone is looking to you.What is your most memorable moment There have been many memorable moments. The passage of the Equal Marriage Act and the Minimum Pricing legislation are two key ones for me. I also think the referendum campaign has to be one of them. It not only saw Parliament at its best – with robust debates and intense scrutiny – but also sparked an enormous outpouring of democratic engagement across the country. Although the result didn’t go the way I wanted, the legacy of a more politically involved country is one we should all cherish.I have a lot of memorable moments. It’s not the famous names or the big events, but the stories I hear from iniduals around the country that inspire me. I’ve spent a lot of time lately listening to the le experiences of Scotland’s care experienced young people. Their stories will stay with me forever and drive me to improve their lives and opportunities.In  years’ time, how do you hope the Parliament will have evolved It should evolve in line with the way people in Scotland want it to. The Parliament was established in large part because of the democratic deficit that opened up during  years of a Tory government which became more and more unpopular in Scotland. Despite devolution, Brexit in particular has demonstrated that Westminster is willing to ignore the views of people in Scotland and disregard votes of the Parliament. I have absolutely no doubt that by  we will have completed the powers of the Parliament and become an independent country. That means we will have established a genuine partnership of equals with the rest of the UK and will have ensured that people in Scotland always get the governments they vote for.Are there any people you would like to thank We should never ever forget those who campaigned for decades to see a Scottish Parliament – many of whom never lived to see it become a reality.Then there are those who have worked tirelessly behind the scenes. We couldn’t do our job without the work of the parliament staff, led by the Parliament’s chief executive, Sir Paul Grice, who recently announced he was moving on to a new job after  years. He might not be well-known by the wider public but, as someone who was there from the very beginning, all MSPs and staff owe him an enormous debt of gratitude.For me personally, I certainly would not be where I am today without the support of my mum and dad and my husband Peter.Everyone is invited to join the partySaturday, June ,  is gearing up to be a great day.From am to noon, the Queen will address Parliament and each of the party leaders will speak in response.

Parliament always does these events well and brings in so many people from across Scotland. “I hope we spend the day not just looking back on what has been achieved, but focused on the work the parliament still has to do.“The public are often sceptical of politicians, but I hope people across the country will reflect on how far we’ve come with the parliament and the dference it has already made to so many people’s lives.”"},{"url":null,"title":"nicola sturgeon the scottish parliament s greatest achievements","story":"The Scottish Parliament will celebrate its th anniversary today .Her Majesty the Queen will take part in the th anniversary celebrations today, with the iconic Parliament building in Edinburgh being open from pm to pm for visitors to join in the birthday celebrations.And in an exclusive QA, Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told us what she believes the Parliament’s top  greatest achievements are.The country’s top politician also shared her thoughts on Brexit and the future, sounding a note of caution for the UK’s next Prime Minister.Here, in her own words, Nicola walks us through the Parliament’s success story...Right from its earliest years, the Scottish Parliament showed that it was ready to take policy decisions substantially dferent to those at Westminster to help build a better country.A clear early example of this was the introduction of free personal care for the elderly. This was a substantial commitment but was vital for Scotland’s long term interests, preparing ourselves for the challenges of an ageing population. We’ve recently extended free personal care to cover all those who are assessed as needing it, no matter their age.MSPs also charted a dferent course when, following a change of administration in , parliament voted to scrap tuition fees in Scotland, restoring Scotland’s long and proud tradition of free education.Similarly, the decision to abolish prescription charges brought to an end what was little more than a tax on ill health. The NHS of course is the greatest, and most valued, example of a universal service where care is provided on the basis of need and not ability to pay. Our health service, like others across the world, faces challenges. But it is a real achievement of the Scottish Parliament that we have resisted the marketization moves south of the border while ensuring that under the current government Scotland’s AE departments are the best performing in theUK.On other occasions, the Parliament has led the UK in making bold policy choices, such as the ban on smoking in public places. Our Climate Change Act includedthe most ambitious emissions reduction targets of any legislature in the world and, as Health Secretary, I was heavily involved in the campaign to introduce a minimum unit price for alcohol, which we knew would play a key role in tackling Scotland’s unhealthy relationship with drink – another world leading measure.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.glasgowsouthandeastwoodextra webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"As the Scottish Parliament prepares to celebrate its th anniversary, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reflects on both its journey and her own.\"  First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reflects on  years of the Scottish Parliament viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"GLAS | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"GLAS | Article Teaser\"It took a decade of hard work to make this policy a reality and I am personally very proud of the campaign, working with stakeholders, to persuade MSPs to back minimum pricing, as well as overcoming a legal challenge that went all the way to the Supreme Court.I am personally committed to making sure every child and young person in Scotland gets the best possible start in le. We have already delivered an increase in free, high quality childcare for all three and four year olds and extending entitlement to eligible two year olds and will increase it further before the end of this parliament.Scotland has also become a much safer society under devolution. Recorded crime has fallen to some of the lowest levels seen since the s. In particular, non-sexual violent crime has fallen substantially, thanks in no small part to the excellent work of the Violence Reduction Unit, which was established over a decade ago with cross-party support and is now being copied across the UK.In recent years, new powers have come to the Scottish Parliament and with those powers come increased responsibilities for MSPs to deliver for the people ofScotland.Income tax policy is now a key feature of the annual Scottish budget. We’ve used these new powers to introduce a fairer income tax policy, with most people paying less tax than they would south of the border – while continuing to raise revenue to support investment in the economy and public services.Last year Parliament passed the wide-ranging Social Security Act, paving the way for devolution of a number of benefits, as well as creating a number of newbenefits such as increased carers’ support allowance and best start grants for families with young children – and a new social security agency to deliver them. This new agency has a culture of dignity and respect at its heart and early feedback from service users has been overwhelmingly positive.I also appointed the first gender balanced Scottish cabinet and we are encouraging more women to stand for parliament, and bring a better balance to ourpublic le.Over the course of the Scottish Parliament consistent action has been taken to ensure communities have the opportunity to own the land they live and work on.Many communities have benefited from the right to buy that now covers rural and urban communities.Of course, the foundation of our country is a strong and resilient economy. That’s why we have slashed or abolished business rates for , premises –saving almost £. billion for our small businesses.We have invested in our infrastructure with all governments building new schools and hospitals and, of course, the iconic Queensferry Crossing.And, to help make sure we have the workforce we need for years to come, we have delivered just over a quarter of a million Modern Apprenticeships in the lastdecade.In April this year, new legislation to tackle controlling and coercive behaviour came into effect, giving Scotland some of the most robust domesticabuse legislation in the world.I’m also proud of the many steps we’ve taken to make Scotland a fairer society, including the introduction of equal marriage rights – attending one of the first same-sex weddings in Scotland is a memory that will stay with me for a long time.And we all worked together over many years to help Glasgow successfully host the  Commonwealth Games. This helped to inspire Scots to get more active,delivered new facilities and put Scotland on the world stage. It was a sight to behold.My final achievement is perhaps harder to quanty. There is no doubt that the re-establishment of Scotland’s parliament has profoundly changed our political culture for the better, with our nation’s lawmakers much more accessible to those they represent. It has also enabled us to have conversations we wouldn’t have had and to debate our own future, with the  independence referendum generating an increase in democratic engagement.Looking ahead, we now face the signicant challenges posed by Brexit which, of course, Scotland’s people and parliament overwhelmingly oppose. Given the long-term damage that Brexit will cause to Scotland, and the material change in circumstances this represents, I believe it is only fair that people are given the choice of whether to become an independent country. Indeed, the current SNP Government was elected on a clear manesto commitment that people should be offered that choice should Scotland be taken out of the EU against its will. Polls consistently show that people living here believe the decision on whether to hold a referendum should be a matter for Holyrood and not Westminster. Twenty years after it came into being, that is an important measure of the way people in Scotland view the Parliament and one that the new UK Prime Minister would do well to heed."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"June ,  at : pmA power-cut, which affected the whole of Orkney earlier this evening, was caused by a lightning strike, according to Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks .

This year local Scottish Fire and Rescue team will once again have a fire engine at the clinic to help draw attention to the clinic.Councillor Drever added: #The safety checks are carried out by a specially trained Good Egg Safety expert, not police officers # so people should not feel they are at risk of getting into trouble.“Rather it#s an opportunity to get some reassurance that your car seat is compatible with your vehicle, and to get tips and advice on any adjustments that would improve the car seat’s performance.

They want to hear from the owners of all kinds of properties, from urban studio flats to historic country piles.

It isn’t just about showing off million-pound properties – it’s about truly celebrating what people have done to turn their house into a home, expressing their iniduality through their design, flair and imagination. We saw some cracking houses over the course of series one and there are far more gems to uncover for series two.”The first series of Scotland’s Home of the Year was broadcast on the new BBC Scotland channel in April and May this year.The series has since seen its audience continue to grow on iPlayer with requests to view so far hitting more than a quarter of a million – ,.The format saw three judges – architect Michael Angus, interior designer Anna Campbell-Jones and lestyle blogger Kate Spiers – travel theand breadth of Scotland to discover architectural gems and unearth some stunning interiors. Both traditional and contemporary properties were put under the microscope and judges considered everything from a one-bedroom apartment to a centuries-old country castle … and everything in between.Each home was scored on ality, distinctiveness and clever design and from seven finalists, one clear winner of series one was chosen – the White House in Kirkcudbright, Dumfries and Galloway, created by proud owner Lesley Smith and her late husband Mike.Series two will have a slightly longer run than series one with nine -minute heats, each featuring three properties from a specic part of the country. The  houses featured will then be whittled down to a final nine which will go under the spotlight in an hour-long final episode.Gerard Costello, executive producer, IWC Media said: “We are thrilled that Scotland’s Home of the Year is ing to the BBC Scotland channel.

One of the new measures is a study looking at how the birds# numbers could be brought down to .SNH have committed to supporting egg oiling and corralling activities, with an expert in corralling geese to visit the county to advise farmers on how this could be used and training for egg oiling being made available.Contractors will also be funded to carry out egg oiling at specic areas next season.As mentioned, a study will also be carried out to create an Orkney-wide plan to reduce geese numbers. According to SNH, this study will consider the practicalities, cost and location for a number of possible measures bring the birds# population down.SNH also elaborated on a previous announcement of an expansion to the licence to shoot the birds, with a new Orkney-specic licence to cover the period from February  to June  — outside the open shooting season and the time covered by the General Licence, which allows Greylag geese to be shot from July  to August  and during the open season from September  to January .This means farmers will no longer be required to apply to the SNH Licensing team for an out-of-season licence but can make a quick call to the Kirkwall office for permission.The new measures include volunteer shooters being available again this year in August and September to undertake goose control on farms which are experiencing issues with geese.SNH is considering further changes to licences, in particular, a mechanism to increase bag limits, and a possible extension to the General Licence, currently available in July and August, to include May and June.Finally, volunteer shooters will be available again this year in August and September to undertake goose control on farms which are experiencing issues with geese.Graham Neville, SNH’s Northern Isles and North Highland area manager, said: “We understand increases in greylag goose numbers have seriously impacted on farmers and crofters on Orkney. Working closely with the local goose management group, we have committed to measures that will help protect crops, while still maintaining the balance between conservation, farming and hunting.”News of support for these measures also followed an announcement earlier in the week that the sale of goose meat and funding have been extended in Orkney and the Western Isles, until the end of .copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The concern is that, although resurfacing and general maintenance continues to be done, this may not fix the issue in the long-term.OIC has now engaged a specialist team to look at the issue, who#ll be deploying state of the art equipment to take radar readings through the causeway down to sea level, providing valuable information on its deep make-up.This data will then be used to come up with options for short and long-term maintenance of the road, with general inspections and periodic minor repairs continuing until the results of the survey are fully considered.Due to the nature of the work, there will unfortunately be road closures and a convoy system in place on the evening of Monday  July. The work has been scheduled for between .pm and .pm to minimise disruption, by ensuring that traffic from the last Pentland Ferries arrival has passed through. Delays of up to  minutes are possible.The work will begin with coring taking place, which sees four small cylindrical sections of the road removed, analysed and then replaced. This allows the contractors to identy the make-up of the top layers of the road and calibrate their equipment accordingly.The second stage of the work sees a specialist vehicle driven at usual traffic speed across the barrier a number of times, taking video and radar footage as it moves.The third and final stage sees a piece of hand-pushed equipment moved across the barrier at walking speed taking Ground Penetrating Radardata of the full depth of the structure as it goes. The GPR system emits short duration pulses of electromagnetic energy. These pulses or scans are transmitted into the road and reflections from material boundaries or embedded featuresare detected by a receiver. Through analysis of the reflected signals a continuous D model of the Barrier can then be provided, determining material thickness and construction changes.  This should therefore determine what,any, underlying defects there are within the matrix of the causeway. The survey allows data to be taken down to depths of five metres.The video survey will provide a high resolution and spatially referenced video to enable the visual condition of the surface to be assessed to sub-metre accuracy. This will be matched with the GPR survey to produce a visual model to pinpoint anomalies in the surfacing.John Wrigley, OIC roads and environmental services manager said: #As a key element of Orkney#s travel network, we keep a keen eye on the state of this road.#Our ongoing monitoring has shown that the surface continues to deteriorate despite previous interventions — which would suggest that resurfacing is not going to fix the problem in the long-term.#We now need to carry out this important piece of work to seethere could be a more deep-rooted reason for the issues — which should lead us to an appropriate and cost-effective solution.##Previous survey work has given us detailed information on the top layers of the road, but this new survey will look deep into the construction for voids or other potential failures.  We apologise for the delays that this survey will cause on the night of  July # but we#re sure that local road users will understand that this is necessary as part of finding a long term solution to improving the structure of the road.  We#d ask that road users take their time in the vicinity on the night and would also take the opportunity to remind people of the mph advisory speed limit that already exists on the first Barrier.#East Mainland, South Ronaldsay and Burray councillor, Andrew Drever added: “I accept the concerns that have been raised over a period of time, particularly by motorcyclists, and I am pleased to see this piece of work getting underway.#Once we have the survey results, we’ll be able to look at options and hopefully find a way forward in a short a timescale as possible.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The aim of the pilots was to reduce goose impacts by managing their numbers and by selling goose meat locally.SNH has said the studies confirmed that resident greylag goose populations can absorb substantial losses without any effect on their conservation status.The sale of the meat and funding have also been extended for the Western Isles.Sally Thomas, SNH’s Director of People  Nature, said: “Wild geese are an important part of Scotland’s nature, but their rapid rise in numbers has been challenging for farmers and crofters. We understand it’s still an issue in some areas, with a dficult balance between conservation, farming and hunting.“Our goal is to give farmers and crofters the tools they need to safeguard their crops, by giving them the control to manage goose numbers sustainably through sport shooting, other control, or selling goose meat for profit.”The pilots are now being extended until the end of . The  transitional Challenge Fund will help local goose groups develop business models to generate income from the sale of resident greylag goose meat in the long term.SNH has also said that they and local goose management groups are also exploring other options together, such as more flexible licences when necessary, a review of bag limits in some areas, and egg-oiling.The pilot studies cost about £, over five years to March  and an additional £, to March .

If he becomes Prime Minister, Boris Johnson must not join the growing club of illiberal world leaders.Liberalism is “obsolete”, Donald Trump is a “talented person”, “traitors must be punished” and one of the benefits of the war in Syria is Russia now has battle-hardened soldiers.For those in any doubt about the true nature of Vladimir Putin and the growing threat to liberal democracy posed by the despotic Russian president and his fellow travellers around the world, then his interview with the Financial Times must surely be a wake-up call.As world leaders gathered for the G meeting in Japan, Putin had good reason to feel confident in making the claim that liberalism is dying out.Russia’s annexation of Crimea, its military support for rebels in eastern Ukraine, including the missile that shot down a Malaysia Airlines passenger plane, the use of nerve agents in Salisbury, resulting in the death of local woman Dawn Sturgess but not the intended target, former Russian spy Sergei Skripal, and other affronts to democracy, human rights and the rule of law have been met with little more than a few sanctions and meek acquiescence by the world’s democratic states. Appeasement is another word, heavy with history, that could be used.And so, in the manner of a naughty schoolboy who thinks he’s being clever, Putin, speaking about about Skripal’s attempted murder, told the FT that “traitors must be punished. I am not saying that the Salisbury incident is the way to do it ... but traitors must be punished”.: Russia is creating a new Cold War – leader comment: A denunciation of Donald Trump – leader comment: The UK needs Brexit rebels with a cause – leader commentTreating the situation as a joke is a sign Putin knows he will not face any real consequences, despite Theresa May’s weak call yesterday for Russia to end its “irresponsible and destabilising activity”. Fat chance.As expected, the meeting of Putin and Trump sparked an outbreak of bonhomie. “Don’t meddle in the election, please,” the US President said as he wagged a comedy finger at the grinning Putin. Perhaps still inwardly glowing from the praise for him in the FT interview, Trump said it was a “great honour” to be with Putin, adding that they had a “very, very good relationship”.Other people Trump has a good relationship with include Conservative leadership candidate Boris Johnson and Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage. Given the latter’s regular attacks on the “liberal elite”, it’s pretty clear he’s a member of the “illiberal elite”.Johnson’s position, however, is less certain. He was a liberal internationalist when it was prudent to be one as London mayor, now he plays the hardcore Brexiteer.When casting their vote for party leader and therefore Prime Minister, Conservative members will need to guess what Johnson’s values actually are. Are they willing to take the chance that the leader of this country might soon, like Trump, be striking up the friendliest of relations with Putin If Brexit Britain joins the growing illiberal alliance around the world, it will only increase the isolation of the European Union as one of the last globally powerful bastions of liberal democracy, weakened from within as it is by far-right leaders like Hungary’s Viktor Orban.And it was the EU’s President, Donald Tusk, who gave one of the strongest responses to Putin’s declaration of ideological victory.“Whoever claims that liberal democracy is obsolete also claims that freedoms are obsolete, that the rule of law is obsolete and that human rights are obsolete,” he said. “What I find really obsolete are authoritarianism, personality cults, the rule of oligarchs ...” But sadly, Tusk still felt the need to add, “... evensometimes they may seem effective”.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"why teachers really do deserve their long summer holiday kevan christie","story":"Teachers often work beyond their stated hours in a job many of us would not want to do, so we shouldn#t begrudge them time off during the summer break, writes Kevan Christie.“What’s the best thing about teaching ”“July and August!” – so the old joke goes.But as the schools split up and many teachers prepare to spend time with their own kids, busman’s holiday style, while catching up on their drinking, the time has come to ask: do they really deserve such a long break I’ll put you out your misery – a resounding yes is the answer. Andyou don’t agree, try standing up in front of  children, all wearing circulation restricitng black Superdry clothes, chewing gum and clutching their phones like a Catholic nun holding her rosary beads.Five days a week. Not many of us could handle it – having to perform to that level day in, day out. No scanning social media, no nipping out for a quick coffee and you can’t even go to the loo when you want. At this point, I must confess to knowing next to nothing about education as regular readers will attest, although I have a we and sister who are teachers and a dad who was a headmaster. I think you call them “Principals” now.: Cameron Wyllie: Face the facts, some kids are just smarter than others: Cameron Wyllie: Teachers now are better than the past’s ‘real characters’This was of mixed benefit to me growing up. On the plus side, it was great when faither brought home the school video recorder for six weeks or more in the summer holidays allowing my -year-old self and nine-year-old brother to catch up on classic slasher horror movies like The Hills of Eyes and Last House on the Left.And his school belt, the Lochgelly Tawse, was a handy weapon to threaten my brother with during our daily battles, while acting as a deterent against setting fire to the garden hut as I went through my childhood arsonist phase. As you do, boys will be boys.But he disappeared each Saturday morning to take his school football team and the regional Lothian Schools select team on a Sunday, all in the name of extracurricular activities.Then there were the endless hours he spent ‘timetabling’ classes for the whole school, before computers a seemingly impossible Krypton Factor-style pursuit that definitely helped him gain promotion.This week alone my we has spent two nights in a tent taking pupils on a camping trip and when I phoned my sister to ask her about teaching she was in France on a school excursion to the killing fields of World War One. This led to me phoning social services to complain about neglect but all I got was the engaged tone.Other teachers I have spoken to say that the working time agreement – setting aside  hours for collegiate activities like parents meetings and preparing course work over the  weeks of the school term – is nowhere near enough and they never get everything done. The reality is that hard-working teachers do a lot more than these hours and need time to have a le.Teachers often have to assume the role of social worker, police officer, doctor and de facto parents for children with troubled home lives. But who is looking after the growing number of teachers experiencing severe stress that impacts on their mental health and wellbeing All of this while under extreme scrutiny from the Scottish Government who have made education their number one focus, although their report card to date is certainly of the ‘must try harder’ iety.They certainly haven’t made the lives of teachers any easier with their Curriculum for Excellence and the ongoing recruitment crisis, reduction in subject choice and increase in multi-level classes in senior secondary schools.All of this against the backdrop of a poverty-related attainment gap that makes Nicola Sturgeon’s claims about making education a priority ring hollow.The recent hard-fought pay rise that works out at  per cent over three years – but needs a teacher to explain it to you properly – was a decent result.But too many Bright Young Things are choosing well-paid jobs in the private sector and someone with a much-valued maths degree will quickly go on to make a six-figure salary in the financial industry rather than -odd grand as a teacher in their first few years.“Aye, but they get loads of holidays” doesn’t really cut it and no-one goes into teaching for the money.The job seems like more of a vocation, an increasingly old-fashioned concept that harks back to gentler times when teachers were genuinely held in high-esteem.They were pillars of society, valued in the community and listened to by parents who accepted the teachers word over that of their kids. Not so now where the prevailing culture is to blame the teacherthe pupil doesn’t get straight As. We’ve come a long way from the ‘help the jannie class’ I remember from my school days at Leith Academy, where a single file of kids deemed to have ‘learning dficulties’ helped the janitor pick up litter from the playground.Either that or they got sent to something called ‘Theatre Arts’ that sounded way better than conventional lessons. Yip, that’s how we dealt with complex mental health issues back in the s.Outdoor pursuits for us was caneoing in Leith Docks – not the Water of Leith may I add – the actual docks, where we were up to our necks in sh***.Teachers are now called upon to cater for a wide-iety of pupils, many of whom require additional support in overcrowded classrooms all in the name of inclusion. There’s no punting them onto the janitor these days.Looking in from the outside, teaching unfortunately seems like one of those vital jobs like nursing and caring where the people who chose to do them because they want to help others are often treated shabbily.“They do it, so you don’t have to” is a mantra that could be applied to teaching.And, with this in mind, we shouldn’t begrudge them a single day of their holidays.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"patrick harvie says scots people are sovereign in address to queen","story":"The Glasgow MSP, a committed republican, also declined to formally address the Monarch as \"Your majesty\" as he spoke in Parliament during a ceremony to mark  years of devolution.Interview: Patrick Harvie, leader of the Scottish Green Party\"As we look ahead, we must again grow into the role thats needed of a modern Parliament in exploring new participative forms of debate like the planned Citizens Assembly, bringing the voices of the sovereign people of Scotland into their Parliament - actively part of the decision making progress.\"Read more: MSPs vote to keep Queen as head of stateScotland splits from UKIn the UK constitution, the Queen is the Sovereign and Head of State, although it isWestminster and the devolved parliaments which make and pass legislation.The Greens co-leader has made his republican beliefs clear in the past and took his affirmation when being sworn in as an MSP in  by stating that his party \"supports the principle of an elected head of state.\"©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"queen calls on scottish parliament to honour opponents views","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...The Queen has called for tolerance among Scotland#s politicians with an appeal to #honour# the views of those they disagree with.The monarch spoke out as she addressed MSPs at Holyrood yesterday to mark the th anniversary of devolution, at a time of constitutional upheaval over Brexit and plans for a fresh referendum on Scottish independence.As the SNP Government seeks to hold a vote on leaving the UK next year, the Queen called for the Scottish Parliament to “strengthen the bonds of partnership” at home and abroad.: Patrick Harvie says Scots people are sovereign in address to Queen\u2028The ceremony in the Scottish Parliament’s main Holyrood debating chamber was also addressed by Nicola Sturgeon, who suggested further constitutional change is on the way, while Labour’s Richard Leonard pledged to “defend devolution”.The Queen told MSPs that Holyrood is at the “centre of public le” as a home for “passionate debate and discussion”.: Queen says MSPs at Holyrood must honour \"dfering views\"\u2028She said: “It is perhaps worth reflecting that at the heart of the word ‘Parliament’ lies its original meaning – a place to talk. I have no doubt that for most of these last  years this striking chamber has provided exactly that, a place to talk. But of course it must also be a place to listen – a place to hear views that inevitably may dfer quite considerably, one from another – and a place to honour those views.”The Queen, accompanied by her son the Prince of Wales, who is known in Scotland as the Duke of Rothesay, said she had “watched Scotland grow and prosper” over the past two decades.She added: “As we look to the future, it is my sincere hope that this parliament, and all those who come to serve in it, will use the power of this chamber to celebrate those invisible pillars of our communities, and follow their example by working tirelessly to improve people’s lives, and strengthen the bonds of friendship and partnership both at home and abroad.”Almost a quarter of Scotland’s  MSPs stayed away from the event. The  absentees included Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie, who was on a family holiday. Tavish Scott was forced to stand in, which saw the Shetland MP instead give the traditional “leader’s address” to the Parliament. However, it was a better turnout than the tenth anniversary celebration, when  MSPs snubbed the event.Sturgeon insisted the Scottish Parliament was now the “centre of our nation’s public le”.“We have become the democratic institution that people look to reflect their priorities, their values, hopes and dreams,” she said.“And now we look forward to a new decade in which this parliament will build new institutions and I’m sure seek further change and development.”She added “As we do that, in times of course when politics has been more isive and confrontational than ever, I hope we will maintain our commitment to working together in the common good.”The event yesterday saw musical performances from musician Phil Cunningham and singer Karen Matheson, while Scots Makar Jackie Kay recited a new poem written for the occasion entitled The Long View.The royal party was met at Holyrood by presiding officer Ken Macintosh, with the Queen then going on to greet the First Minister and other party leaders.Current and former MSPs were present, including ex-presiding officers George Reid and Tricia Marwick, as well as Scottish Secretary David Mundell. Some of the Scots who were born on  July  – the day the Scottish Parliament was officially opened – also attended.Macintosh said that over the past  years Holyrood had “grown into a self-confident institution”. And he noted some of the parliament’s achievements, including “the smoking ban and the minimum pricing of alcohol, free personal care and the abolition of tuition fees, the removal of Section  and the introduction of equal marriage”.Macintosh added: “I am proud of that legislative record, but just as important is that the parliament itself has evolved to reflect the needs of the people we serve.”Tory leader Ruth Davidson said Holyrood has become a fixture of Scotland’s “civic and political le”.“This chamber has proved itself adept at both reactive legislation and with leading the national debate,” she said.“There is consensus that, as a process, devolution has made our country stronger.”Leonard said it was his party that delivered devolution for Scotland. And he added: “I stand proudly as the leader of the party, which in opposition defends devolution because it is an unassailable truth that each generation has to win the same battles over again.”Mundell said: “We have made Holyrood one of the most powerful devolved parliaments in the world.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"div","story":"A DIVE vessel with  women on board was escorted into port after she began taking in water off Shetland on Sunday. issued a mayday call in bad weather soon after midday when she was approximately eight miles east of Sumburgh Head.

We came here to compete at a higher level away from our domestic season, our domestic league and we#ve experienced some great highs and we were almost there to get into that final.#On how hard it would be to get his players up for the bronze match on Friday, Main said it would be #tough#.He added: #The guys are hurting but I#ve asked them to pick themselves up – and pick themselves up quickly, this is just part of character rolling.#There#s a lot of positive to take away.

It is an increasing trend in UK and one we should surely reject.So, instead we should indoctrinate them in the ways of continued, pointless consumerism that is managing to waste resources and destroy the environment  Why is this behaviour any more #normal#  These are intelligent young people who know their own minds, ones who can be bothered to get up and make their voices heard.I didn#t advocate consumerism though.

Daily Mail!! grow up. Ask yourself the following question, how does today#s GlobalWarming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age  Anyone who cannot answer that question is too ignorant to hold an informed opinion on today#s climate change.Stops PC Plod and the band of merry men, from going in with batons to quell the grown-ups waffling on about, why their leader Comrade Corbyn inspires them with his words.How about giving them a half decent education concentrating on sciencesubjects. Then they would have an informed and considered opinion, not just the usual Greenwash so popular with the ignorant. If gted they may even go on to contribute with useful research and technological ideas so unlike are present green, ignorant and wholly ill-informed flock in thecouncil chamberAn area of industry which has not been looked into with any proper statistical information is thisof Agriculture. This industry produces more green house gases than the all of transportation. In fact, it is several times greater than transportation. The catch  scenario is this industry has had no regulation or legislation is regard to reducing greenhouse gases, infact, due to population growth, the pollution created by agriculture is vastly on the increase. Technology has played its part, but it is a situation where reducing pollution is very, very dficult to achieve given the nature of the industry itself. As the population increases, this will become more relevant in terms of the overall pollution created, and no doubt, something will have to be done. Whether sea based farming of certain foods may reduce the pollution, but much of agriculture is still based on land and the production of meat will still create problems related to greenhouse gases in terms of land used for meat production and or crop production as well. It is a dilemma which will become more relevant as the population increases.I can assure you these bairns weren#t pushed into anything. They were toldthey wanted to go they had to complete a form. One of mine wanted to go, the other didn#t.

The courage comes from not following the crowd herd and forming an independent and educated view. Jumping headlong onto the bandwagon is easy, understanding the science and striving to do something about it the hard bit. Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid.Especially a meaningless strike from school, what child would not love a day off among mates  No doubt the pig ignorant and stupid will be so impressed.

Lavishly staged by a professional creative team, this stirring Grand Opera House Summer Youth Production is the most ambitious to date, bringing together  of Northern Ireland’s creatives. Supported by a -piece orchestra, the impressive score will feature all the big numbers including I Still Believe, The Movie in my Mind and the iconic The American Dream.-year-old Aquinas pupil Lára Mulgrew will perform the role of Ellen in the stage show. No stranger to the Grand Opera House stage, Lára performed aged nine the role of Molly in their production of Annie. Lára described the audition process “as very straight forward” and how it will be “wonderful” to portray the role of Ellen come July.“I hadn’t seen the production before but was able to watch it on Youtube. It’s going to be a total of six performances and it’s a very mature role,” she said. “It’s definitely the most challenging role I’ve ever had to perform and it will be a great challenge to take on her maturity.”Methody College’s Louis Fitzpatrick will take on the role of American GI John Thomas, part of the battalion deployed in Saigon during the Vietnam War.“I heard about the auditions for Miss Saigon through a friend, I went for one audition and did well enough to get a call back. I was really ecstatic to learn I had got the part as I was performing Footloose at the time as part of the Belfast Youth and Drama Society, I joined in April  and the first production I did was Les Misérables.“I hadn’t watched the stage version before but was able to watch it on Amazon Prime.”The -year-old has just completed his A’levels in Moving Image, Politics and Drama and told the South Belfast News how he hopes to go on to study film at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland in Glasgow.Grand Opera House Chief Executive Ian Wilson added: “This is the ninth year that the Grand Opera House has staged its Summer Youth Production, and Miss Saigon® School Edition will be the biggest so far. It’s very rare for a theatre the size of the Grand Opera House to be granted the rights to the youth version, so it really is a brilliant opportunity to see the best up-and-coming musical theatre stars in one of the most popular musicals of all time.”For ticket information visit: www.goh"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"how divine mercy is local turning lives around","story":"FOUNDED in , the Divine Mercy group continues to go from strength to strength.Four years on, the group attracts weekly attendances of up to  people every Friday afternoon at Sacred Heart church in Glenview Street.The worship group helps those suffering with suicidalthoughts and addictions, using faith as a form of help.Thomas Stewart, who helped set up the group, explained more about the work the group does.“I set up the group with a friend, who  years ago lost his brother who took his own le through suicide,” he said.“It was a total shock to his family and he felt he needed to do something to help others with similar problems.“We started the Divine Mercy group up in  and it was just three of us. It is a time to reflect on le, listen to beautul songs, and a prayer session is also available afterwards for those who wish to get involved in that.“I think with the issues of addictions with drugs and alcohol becoming more of an issue in North Belfast, the Divine Mercy group offers something dferent to anyone who is seeking help.“Whatever is going on in your own le or your family’s le,your son or daughter is suicidal or has addiction problems, I would encourage you to come along to the Divine Mercy group.“There is help available, which is why people come back. It’s an outlet for people also and a comfort zone for them. The Divine Mercy gives these people hope.“There are young lads coming here who are broken in their lives. The reason we can draw them in is because we are all from dferent backgrounds and we are able to reach out to them.”One of the great successes of the Divine Mercy group has been the regular Cursillo residential weekends in Benburb.The Cursillo runs from a Thursday evening to a Sunday afternoon with participants able to meet people and explore their faith further in a serene and spiritual environment.Hugh Byrne, another key figure in the Divine Mercy group, said the Cursillo is a le-changing experience for those involved.“After three days, they are dferent people. It is truly a le-changing experience and I have seen that with people over the years.”Hugh is also responsible for talking to anyone who comes to the Divine Mercy group in order to offer help and advice.“I sit and have a chat with the lads every week,” he added.“If I get them to listen, that is the start. If we help turn one person’s le around, that is better than none.“I ask them how far they are in their addiction whether it would be alcohol or drugs.“Some people have fallen away but there have been a lot of successes. Relationships and marriages have been fixed and people have turned their lives around.“We also have good links with rehabilitation services and other helplines to point people towards further help.”At last Friday’s meeting, the group were joined by some American visitors who ed to Belfast a year on from experiencing the Divine Mercy group for the first time.Thomas says the success of the group has been extremely encouraging and a sign that they are on the right path.“It was great to see the visitors from the USA who were here last year and wanted to come back over again,” continued.“They are going back to spread the word about the work the group does.“The group can only get better. We started with just three people so we have come a long away in quite a short time.“People are coming back so we must be doing something right.“We have the prayers and so on and then we come out and sit and have tea, coffee and biscuits. It is great to see everyone bonding and talking to each other.“People don’t realise how powerful the Divine Mercy is. It doesn’t matter what is going on in your le. Ask for help and reach out to the Divine Mercy.”The Divine Mercy group meets every Friday at pm at Sacred Heart church in Glenview Street and all are welcome to come along."},{"url":null,"title":"brexits impact on many crossborder initiatives finally revealed in report","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

However, the -page mapping exercise gives an insight into the extent we could be impacted.The scope of areas highlighted is broad and includes everything from health, travel, waterways, animal movement and organised crime and drugs to benefit fraud, schooling, library provision and teacher and doctor qualications.For each of the  sectors, the document species the extent to which it is underpinned by the Good Friday Agreement as well as by existing EU legal and policy frameworks.In the case of the North West Cancer Centre, the report points out that the initiative was based on an intergovernmental agreement between Health Ministers from both jurisdictions.It says the centre at Altnagelvin Area Hospital, which opened in November , \"offers radiotherapy services closer to home for many patients from the north west, reducing their travel time signicantly\".Similarly, the All-Island Congenital Heart Disease Network is identied as ensuring that \"vulnerable children\" receive treatment on the island of Ireland. The network has a single surgical centre in Dublin and a specialist childrens cardiology centre in Belfast, supported by cardiology expertise in local hospitals. There is also cross-border cooperation on organ and tissues transplants. Nineteen areas are linked to the avoiding a hard border objective and include everything from customs and physical checks on live animals crossing the border to rules on movement of national treasures.Current EU rules \"stop national treasures from leaving the country and prevent illicit trafficking and looting\". Other less obvious areas mentioned in the report include the operation of cross-border taxis repatriation of waste and cross-border movement of waste, and even the management of Lough Erne eel stocks.It also species areas such as invasive alien species, chemicals regulation and wildfire initiatives.DUP MEP Diane Dodds said that in the majority of areas ongoing cross-border cooperation would be addressed by retaining the common travel area and pursuing an agreement on free trade and customs. \"In many cases, where frameworks are highly integrated, the circumstances are not unique to our province,\" she said.\"For instance the conditions required to operate both the Enterprise service between Dublin and Belfast and the Channel Tunnel will require a very similar technical agreement with Brussels. Genuine concerns in areas like agri-food and healthcare must be taken seriously.\"Sinn Fein MP Chris Hazzard said an expert  is not needed to show how disastrous a no-deal Brexit will be. He said: \"The British Government has now convened a  of experts to determine the impact of a no-deal Brexit on the North. \"It neednt have bothered as a range of experts have already given dire warnings of the disastrous impact a no-deal Brexit will have on the Norths economy, our rights and the Good Friday Agreement.\" Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington said the documents were part of \"initial scoping work\" by the Government, supported by the Civil Service here, the European Commission and the Republic.Mr Lidington said they were intended to form the basis of discussion and not final products.

No formal or transparent selection process was used in her selection for appointment nor was she given a written contract of employment, statement of main terms and conditions or job description.During , following several years of signicant growth, the firm decided to consider promotions from associate solicitor grade to salaried partner. Mrs Mercer and two other colleagues were promoted to salaried partner later that year.However, the following year, when she applied for promotion to the role of an equity partner, she was told she did not meet the eligibility criteria. Mrs Mercer did not find out about the promotions of her comparators at the time they took effect on June , , because they had not been announced internally. Instead she learned about them around  through what she described as the \"office rumour mill\". When she enquired about applying for promotion to the next stage, she was informed that there would be no more movement in the firm for the foreseeable future.Mrs Mercer flagged ious issues about her pay during  and  and the fact that promotions were taking place without any formal or transparent selection process.In June  she informed one of firms partners that she wanted to be paid the same salary as her male comparators and to have her bonus calculated on the same terms as theirs. Mrs Mercer was later told that the firm had decided to defer the issue of her salary and bonus until the end of the financial year as part of a wider review of business and salaries. Following this she lodged an internal grievance, seeking equal pay with her comparators on the ground that she was performing like work with them. Her grievance was rejected as the firm was of the view that her work as a salaried partner was \"not as demanding as that of a salaried partner benefiting from a profit share arrangement\". The legal practice accepted that Mrs Mercer was receiving less remuneration than her male colleagues but did not accept that she was undertaking like work with them. It contended that, although she and her male counterparts were all qualied solicitors, there were signicant dferences in the work they and Mrs Mercer were undertaking both in respect of legal work and other responsibilities.In addition, the respondent contended that,Mrs Mercer proved that she was undertaking like work with her comparators, there were genuine material factors which were not the dference of sex and which explained and justied any dferences in pay.The tribunal found that Mrs Mercer was employed on like work with all her comparators going back six years to June .The firm was ordered to pay her £, in respect of the dference between her gross annual salary of £, and the modied amount of £, going forward. She will also receive £, arrears of annual salary falling six years before the date of her claim in June  along with interest of £, on arrears."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38254594.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/press_1-_Read-Only_.jpg","title":"paisley faces holiday claims backlash sf and sdlp demand answers as dup to consider serious issues raised","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It is for democratic politicians in the democratic world to do so,” he said.The chairman of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee Damian Collins said Sir Nick was wrong to say there was no evidence that Russia used Facebook to interfere in the referendum.“He is technically wrong on that point which he should know,” he told BBC Radio ’s Today programme.“We asked Facebook whether there was any evidence of Russians buying ads during the referendum. There was – which they shared with us – on a very small scale, but nevertheless it was there.”He added: “There has been no proper audit done during the referendum. There is certainly evidence of suspicious Russian activity during the referendum and where.”"},{"url":null,"title":"watch argentina footballer dribbles over pigeon in copa america","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He quickly became a prominent figure in that movement and its campaign for equality as the s drew towards a close.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshIn , he resigned from the NILP and helped found the Derry Citizen’s Action Committee. One of his first major public pronouncements came in the summer of that year and characterised the fundamental principles of the entire movement.At a protest meeting in the foyer of the Guildhall he said that Protestants and Catholics should stand up for their rights together “as the blacks in America were fighting.”The unication of people away from their religious denominations would remain the dominant feature of Ivan Cooper’s political activism throughout his  years. He was convinced that both communities in Northern Ireland could work together for common goals. However, some within the Protestant and unionist community viewed this stance as nationalist in outlook and tainted him as a traitor.Nevertheless, Ivan Cooper continued his agitation based on the Civil Rights  and after the RUC attack on the October  march in , he ignored a month-long Stormont government ban on parades in Derry.However, following violence after a number of marches in the city, Cooper called for an end to spontaneous demonstrations. As confrontations between demonstrators and the RUC continued to escalate in early  after a People’s Democracy march was attacked at Burntollet, residents of the Bogside cordoned the area off with barricades.Whilst Ivan Cooper managed to persuade locals to dismantle the barriers, the chances of redeeming an already tense political situation had probably already gone. As the sectarianism he had fought so hard to keep at bay crept steadily back into the issues at hand, most Protestant people who had supported NICRA backed away from the movement.At the Northern Ireland general election of , Cooper was elected as an Independent MP for Mid-Derry and in doing so unseated the sitting Nationalist Party representative Paddy Gormley.The Battle of the Bogside began on August ,  after violence erupted following the annual Relief of Derry parade by the Apprentice Boys.As the first of three days of fighting grew increasingly heavy, Cooper attempted to restrain rioters by linking arms with Eddie McAteer and John Hume. As the trio were swept aside by the advancing crowd, Cooper was knocked unconscious by a brick.In August , Ivan Cooper became one of the founding members of the SDLP with John Hume, Paddy Devlin and Gerry Fitt. After Stormont was prorogued in , he was again elected as one of the representatives from Mid Ulster to the Northern Ireland Assembly in . After the power sharing administration tumbled in the face of the Ulster Workers Council Strike in , Cooper was again elected to the Northern Ireland Constitutional Convention in .He was also the SDLP candidate for the constituency at both Westminster elections in . In the first one in February that year, he succeeded in splitting the nationalist vote and as a result caused the defeat of Independent MP Bernadette McAliskey.After boundary changes created the Foyle constituency in , Cooper stood aside to let John Hume have a clear run at claiming the seat. After this point, the overall political situation characterised as it was by ever increasing levels of violence, saw Ivan Cooper gradually withdraw from politics and concentrate more on his accountancy work."},{"url":null,"title":"temperatures sore ensure pets stay cool","story":"With temperatures predicted to go as high as  degrees today, dog owners are being urged to pay extra attention to their pets.The RSPCA says it receives many enquiries and reports about the welfare of animals over the summer months, particularly when its very hot.

Secondly, the high level of sectarianism in the area.ldquoInequalities still exist between and within communities and they need to be tackledwe are going to improve the lives of everyone and help them fulfil their true potential, said Dr Cross.ldquoWhen you empower people, you transform their lives and you transform society. The David Cross Foundation for Peace and Reconciliation was set up with a commitment to improving community relations and continuing the journey towards a more united and shared society.Dr Cross said The Edge was a beacon in the community, allowing people to become part of a network of support and care, irrespective of age.He continued: ldquoThe charity treats people like they are family. The centrersquos vision is about empowering young people and the wider community to achieve their full potential spiritually, mentally and physically. Itrsquos a vision that resonates with the ethos of The David Cross Foundation for Peace and Reconciliation.The Edge chairwoman, Trisha Brown, explained that staff and volunteers had seen an increase in mental health issues affecting all ages.ldquoPeople are feeling lonely and lost. There has also been a growth in the number of young people self-harming as they feel they donrsquot have a future. So, we still have a lot to do and we run a wide range of initiatives to build community capacity and to support those who are feeling isolated, she continued.ldquoThe Edge is firmly positioned as a space for people to come and feel safe and to share whatrsquos happening in their lives. We bring people together in a cross-community setting and we welcome people of all ages.

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them. This has been carried out in towns and cities across the UK to protect the local heritage.The petition can be found at www.change.org p vale-of-glamorgan-council-save-the-victorian-heritage-of-penarth u .I will continue to work with your local Labour councillors on these issues.

I will challenge other councillors to back it.Earlier on Wednesday, Cllr Gray made a statement to Vale of Glamorgan Councilrsquos Conservative group to say he was resigning.In his statement, he said he had ldquoabsolutely no issue with the manner in which Cllr Bailey was elected as the new leader of the Conservative Group,But he said he is ldquoat least partially at odds with Cllr Bailey on three issues ndash the proposed lsquoclosurersquo of Llancarfan Primary School, the Dinas Powys Bypass and the incinerator in Barry.On the Llancarfan School proposal, which would see the primary moved to a new building in Rhoose, he said: ldquoI seconded a motion to have the executive reopen the issue consultation and this was ignored by the then cabinet but now that this dficult decision has been made I fear that any attempt to articially prop up Llancarfan School will take funding away from the budgets of Penarth schools which is something I will not tolerate.Cllr Gray said heremained ldquounconvinced that the proposed bypass around Dinas Powys, linking Cardf to Barry, ldquois an issue with a large base of support in my ward, and the efforts to give it even more prominence and funding would I believe be to the detriment of the residents of my ward.Vale council has been waiting for more than a year for Welsh Government to decide whether the Barry incinerator needs to carry out an environmental impact assessment before it can operate.Cllr Gray said any efforts to ramp up the councilrsquos rhetoric on the incinerator ldquowould do a disservice to those residents who are passionate about the subject.ldquoRaising  hope for headlines is not the reason I stood for local government and I donrsquot want to mark my success by how many column inches we are able to achieve on a wedge issue, he said.       ,params: .pushHe added:ldquoThe structures around the group that Vince is proposing seemed to be geared up to act as an opposition party and not to focus on the work of delivering core services for the benefit of the most vulnerable members of our society.ldquoI donrsquot expect everyone to agree with my decision and I donrsquot take this decision lightly ndash I am sure that there will be a great number of people who have an opinion on whether I have done the right thing or not.ldquoI need to remain true to myself and my belief in acting as a positive advocate for the residents in my ward ndash the issues that get me out of bed every morning to work hard for the residents in my ward are not the way the press views me but how I can make a positive dference to peoplersquos lives. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

And under my leadership, a Conservative administration will proudly put the people of the Vale of Glamorgan first.ldquoNaturally, we are open to working with other councillors who share those ideals.ldquoOthers - including those who resigned from the Conservative party - will have to explain to voters where they stand on these issues - and I would urge them to back us, rather than propping up a Labour administration that was rejected by the Vale at the last election.Cllr Bailey said he had a six-point plan for the Vale.He pledged to deliver the Dinas Powys bypass stop inflation-busting council tax rises scrap proposed parking charges review the local development planto curb inappropriate development protect rural schools and oppose the Barry Biomass plant.Cllr Bailey said that he was also keen to improve engagement with the public, after a series of hugely unpopular decisions taken by the existing cabinet.He said: ldquoDuring the elections in , we promised to build a stronger relationship with local residents by consulting them on key decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, too many people feel that their views are simply being ignored and that Vale consultations are just tick box exercises.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John. He really made an impact on our wards and with our patients who listened to his shows.ldquoItrsquos such a lovely way to mark not only Johnrsquos birthday but also to mark the contribution he made as a volunteer during Volunteersrsquo Week. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people. If there are issues we will try to work through those issues.ldquoSometimes we will have to make decisions that not everyone is going to be happy with.ldquoWe have to be honest with people.

The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Abandoned - BlissThe first dog to arrive at the centre was -year-old Spaniel Grace, found by a member of the public at the side of the road. She was taken to the vet immediately, but after an owner didn’t come forward, she was brought to Dogs Trust.Two weeks ago, another Spaniel - aged eight and nicknamed Bliss by the team - was found tied to a fence not far from the rehoming centre. Like Grace, the Spaniel has not been microchipped, which has been a legal requirement for all dogs since  and the easiest way to identy a dog who has become separated from their owner. Shockingly just one week later, a Cairn Terrier - less than a year old, was found by a rehoming centre staff member at the very same spot where Bliss was left. Terrier Rizzo was lucky to be found as she is quite small and it would have been easy to miss her in the long grass.The most recent addition to the ranks of abandoned pooches is Sally, an eight-year-old Collie cross, who was found as a stray by a member of the public and brought to the rehoming centre.Abandoned - RizzoOonagh Philips, Rehoming Centre Manager said: “We want to remind anyone who no longer feels that they can care for their dog to contact their local rescue organisation for support. When a dog is abandoned on the road side, it not only puts them in danger, but also drivers. We are so thankful that all four of these dogs were found when they were.“Grace and Bliss were very shaken up by their ordeal when they came into our care and it took them a couple of days to build trust around people again. We could tell Rizzo hadn’t eaten in a while, which could have resulted in a deterioration of her physical health. Sally is incredibly sweet natured, and just like the others, will make a wonderful addition to the right home.“We are not sure why there has been a recent influx in dogs being abandoned. We always remind people that ‘A Dog is for Le®’ but we understand that le happens, and places like Dogs Trust are there to support any dog owner who experiences a bump in the road and needs our help. Sometimes the most responsible thing we can do as a dog owner is admit that we aren’t coping with our pets, but it is important to ensure they are kept safe and not left to fend for themselves.”If you

Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/bbobb.jpg","title":"coffee chain bob and berts creating  new jobs","story":"Posted on Monday  June  by John Mulgrew A Northern Ireland coffee shop chain is creating  new jobs as its expands it reach across the UK with eight new stores, it has emerged.
