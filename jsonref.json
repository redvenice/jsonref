While some decisions had to be made at speed, balancing horrific risks against appalling costs, at no point did this reality apply to how public money was spent. When billions of pounds gushed from Rishi Sunak’s Treasury last year, the scope for abuses of the system was obvious. There was no case for neglecting normal procurement checks and accounting rules. Yet that is precisely what happened. In the case involving Cameron, an Australian entrepreneur, Lex Greensill, built a multibillion-pound business offering a controversial product – supply chain financing, which allows suppliers to big businesses to be paid earlier for a fee. Greensill’s rapid rise opened political doors in the UK, and while Cameron was still prime minister he appointed Greensill as an adviser to help the coalition government cut spending. After leaving government, Cameron joined Greensill’s company, Greensill Capital, as an adviser. Cameron, who was probably hired by Greensill for just such a crisis, reportedly sent multiple texts to Sunak in April 2020 and furiously lobbied senior officials at the Treasury to give Greensill Capital special access to the CCFF. Cameron did nothing illegal and, to their belated credit, Treasury officials turned him down. Greensill has since filed for bankruptcy. Cameron was perhaps unlucky. The catalogue of payments, fees and strange contracts surrounding the pandemic emerges by the day. When it came to creating a test-and-trace infrastructure, Whitehall cosied up to Deloitte, Serco and the Boston Consulting Group (as of January this year, the Department of Health and Social Care had spent £375m on private consultants to work on the test-and-trace system since the start of the pandemic, which equates to an average of £163,000 a consultant). The National Audit Office revealed that “VIP contracts” were raced through for companies with “political” connections, which were around 10 times more likely to obtain contracts for personal protective equipment than suppliers that came through the ordinary lane. The owner of a luxury dog food company took a cut of a PPE deal worth £258m, and was likely paid £1m. A former investment banker said their company made £17m after it supplied masks that were deemed unsuitable by the NHS. Dominic Cummings was instrumental in the process of awarding a contract worth half a million pounds to a company run by his “friends” to conduct research into the public’s understanding of coronavirus. A staggering £23bn has already been blown on Boris Johnson’s “world-beating” test-and-trace system, which the Treasury mandarin Lord Macpherson recently dubbed “the most wasteful and inept public spending of all time”. By anyone’s account, this has been a financial outrage. It is a racing certainty that Johnson will dismiss it as trivial given the triumph of the vaccination programme. Yet one right does not excuse a hundred wrongs. As the unemployed head for the food banks, friends of this government know they have done very well. Those who assisted them must be held accountable. That means Johnson and Sunak. They have risen to popularity largely through their readiness to spend and squander stupefying amounts of public money. Sunak is now struggling to find that money other than by merely printing it, which means the taxpayer will be hit again. As a certain prime minister once said, this was a scandal waiting to happen. It should be first in the queue for a future inquiry. "},{"url":null,"title":"future britain young people rishi sunak covid economic","story":"Search through Sunak’s budget speech, and you’ll find not one word related to “children”, “graduates” or even “teenagers”. And while “young” did appear in relation to the touted “kickstart scheme”, it’s clear that the chancellor has little interest in the generations below him. Statistics from the Centre for Economic Performance at LSE show those aged 16 to 25 will experience worse labour market outcomes in terms of job loss, not working and earnings losses during and after lockdown. They were more than twice as likely as older employees to have suffered job losses, with six in 10 seeing their earnings fall.  Coronavirus has brought poverty, inequality, work and housing into the foreground. Amid the noise of budget-related policy change – debated by two political parties that many young people have little time for – I think of my cousin, aged 12, whose teenage years will become a baptism of fire. “I’ve learned more watching YouTube and TikTok than I ever did at school,” she quips over Zoom. I asked her how she felt being back in an educational setting after quite a stop-start school year: “Not happy. I like learning, but I never liked school anyway. It’s a waste of time.” Harsh, but fair, and not exactly a revelation. I remember spending much of my teenage years sulking around parks and drinking far too much. The only difference between her supposed delinquency and mine is that I had the privilege of making my dumb decisions at a youth club or at a friend’s house. The latter was snatched away for a year by the pandemic the former by austerity politics. This means that young people, in particular, are entering a period of “ambient austerity”. Without decent youth services, they are forced to hang around shabby town centres, aspirations are dampened and self-esteem is hollowed out. This negligence has been simmering for years. There was, for example, the 2015 budget, which ruled that anyone aged between 18 and 21 could no longer claim housing benefit and the fact that, while higher education was free or relatively cheap for much of the political class, graduates are now left to pay a significantly higher tax rate than non-graduates (and that’s without mentioning the interest rates graduates are charged on their loans).  So what would a forward-thinking, imaginative government do to help young people? The chaos in schools in England during the pandemic should prompt us to rethink the very nature of education, which is highly quantified and dependent on exams – the perfect conditions for creating mental health crises among young people. How many schoolchildren are forced to keep their head down and pass taxing exams, only to realise in adulthood that exam grades are no longer seen as the benchmark in the workplace or in life? Schooling could be reimagined with a focus on a broader curriculum, skilful use of creativity and a greater focus on wellbeing. When I ask my cousin what she wants for the future she replies to me plainly: “I don’t know. Why did we get here in the first place?” And that is the point: why, again and again, do we choose to draw up the ladder for the generations after us?

That series threw up plenty of questions for England, not least the debate about how best to utilise Stokes in the shortest format. Batting at No 6 – where he faced just 56 balls for his 84 runs – and sharing duties as a fifth bowler, the 29-year-old felt a curiously underused resource given his obvious pedigree. In 50-over cricket the canvas for a batting all-rounder is far greater, however. And so while two T20 World Cups in two years mean the format is relegated to third place in importance, Stokes has the chance to end what has been a quietish trip with a flourish before he and others join their Indian Premier League franchises. “It is great to have him back,” said Eoin Morgan. “He really enjoys his white-ball cricket and it is important to keep him engaged in that. If you don’t play a format for a long time, it can show neglect in certain parts of the game. We know how demanding the other formats are on his body and mind, so it is great to have him around.” Morgan did not confirm Stokes’s promotion to first-drop – a position the all-rounder last occupied in 2014 – beyond saying he had “plenty of options”. But it is understood an initial plan to use Sam Billings here is likely to be flipped, with the Kent man now moving down the order, while Dawid Malan, who bats at No3 in the T20 side, is only a reserve player for this series. While the tour’s denouement counts towards qualification for the 2023 World Cup through the ODI Super League, Morgan chiefly hopes it will be an opportunity for fringe players to put their hands up for both white-ball formats, not least with Jofra Archer also missing due to his elbow injury and Chris Woakes not asked to return to India after eight (unused) weeks in the Test bubble. “It has been an extremely productive tour so far. The biggest picture is always the World Cup in both white-ball formats. You don’t always have to win every series in order to win a World Cup. You continuously need to get better, need to be tested as a side, need to fail in order to learn. That involves losing, which isn’t fun but it is part of the journey.” As well as Billings, who made his maiden ODI century against Australia last summer from No 6, the left-armer Reece Topley and Lancashire’s Liam Livingstone and Matt Parkinson should be the chief beneficiaries in this series. The latter finally steps up from the reserves’ bench he has occupied since the start of the Sri Lanka tour in January, the only player to go the distance. Given England’s reliance on Adil Rashid, his fellow leg-spinner, Parkinson is certainly worth blooding at some stage in the series. Moeen Ali is another who may finally get a chance on tour, having missed the last two India Tests for his scheduled break only to return and find himself overlooked for the entire T20 series. Virat Kohli was among those baffled by this – doubtless Root has a few opinions here too – but Morgan was unrepentant. “I know he has not played but that’s been circumstantial,” said England’s white-ball captain. “The pitches we played on just haven’t turned and that obviously limits the contribution a finger-spinner might make.” Morgan declined to say whether Moeen will start on Tuesday. As was the case in Ahmedabad, the captain is not expecting much turn and noted the ground in Pune has smaller dimensions. Nevertheless, it would be strange if England had only one spinner among their six bowling options for a 50-over match in India. They face a formidable task either way, with Kohli back at No 3 behind the established opening partnership of Shikhar Dhawan and Rohit Sharma, before a middle order where Suryakumar Yadav could make his debut after explosive scores of 57 and 32 were key to India’s stirring comeback in the T20s. Another factor was Hardik Pandya’s return to bowling after injury. Stokes may be back in England’s powder-blue ODI shirt for the first time since that heady day at Lord’s, but he is not the only match-winning, tattooed all-rounder on show this week."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a401e1b482d277de5a41d7f1c8fcc1d53e79a606/0_308_5148_3089/master/5148.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=2010888b88f86f4cf08baf26232ba1f0","title":"what a year of change has taught me retailers five top tips and mistakes revealed","story":"Keep communicatingIf one thing has been necessary (and not always forthcoming) in this tumultuous year it’s good communication. With shops closed, staff furloughed and orders upended, customers needed clear explanations like never before. When the artisan cheesemaker the Bath Soft Cheese Company lost more than half of its business after the pandemic closed restaurants and cafes, the team looked to quickly grow its online home delivery sales, meaning that direct communication with customers was more important than ever. “Letting customers know how they could still get our cheese, reassuring them it was safe, selecting courier companies that could text and email customers to tell them when deliveries were due, and learning how to use online advertising to get our offering known was crucial,” says Hugh Padfield, the managing director. Cover all the basesAltering customer habits isn’t always easy, as the Dorset-based store Coconut \u0026amp Cotton – which sells plastic-free goods and sustainable home, beauty and health products – found out. One of its plastic-free services was to provide refills of products such as shampoos and conditioners to customers who supplied their own containers. But as lockdown went on and Coconut \u0026amp Cotton’s online business grew, it decided to transfer the refill business to another shop nearby, says founding director Lucy Barfoot. “Even three months after the change we still had people coming in with bags full of bottles to be filled. It’s difficult when people have made the effort to come and what they want isn’t there any more.” The shop learned a valuable lesson about reaching out to its customers. “I realised that updates on services needed to be displayed and delivered on every possible platform, from the shop door to mass emails, social media, Google My Business, on our website in multiple places and pages, and on local radio,” says Barfoot. “It was so hard to make sure our customers knew what we were changing as the year went on.” Transparency mattersIn “normal” times a business might try to fix a problem before even informing the customer there is one. But the past year has often called for a different approach. For shoe designer Sargasso \u0026amp Grey, transparency about difficulties helped build customer support. The company’s bread-and-butter business is occasion shoes but, says owner Katie Owen, “given there have been no occasions this year, it hasn’t been easy and we have had to think on our feet”. The company did this by introducing a range of casual shoes, which included flats and trainers. Even then, with supply chains impacted and stock delayed, customers had to wait longer than expected for shoes to be delivered, says Owen. “But we were very open that we were experiencing challenging times, and we kept communicating with both new and repeat customers.” The company sent personal emails to all customers to thank them for their support and patience, and to offer them the opportunity to cancel their orders. “As soon as the shoes arrived we mailed them via express shipping,” says Owen. “All of our customers were amazingly supportive. Covid has certainly made people feel that we are ‘in it together’.” Go the extra mileWith consumers spending more time communicating online, word of mouth is proving vital – offering opportunities for businesses that are able to step up and give customers exactly what they want. Sargasso \u0026amp Grey found that an above-and-beyond approach to customer service made all the difference to repeat business. “When Covid first hit, there was so much uncertainty about whether weddings and parties would go ahead,” says Owen. “We immediately extended our returns policy to 90 days and backdated it to include customers who’d purchased shoes in the previous month.” This meant that customers who’d already bought shoes were able to return them. While this initially hurt the company financially, many customers subsequently bought again and many others said they would do so. “We also got new customers who were more confident to purchase shoes for an event that might not happen,” says Owen, who has decided to keep the policy in place. Low price can be high-costIn the scramble to retain customers, businesses have ended up making pricing errors. Initially, the Bath Soft Cheese Company offered a low price-point for free delivery, which led to it running out of cheese. To address this, the company increased the minimum order for free delivery to £25. Padfield says: “It’s only a small change, and still represents great value for the customer, but it means we are making some money.” The strategy ultimately paid off – online sales went from being a tiny part of the business to being a quarter of all sales.

Speaking to reporters during a visit to Lancashire, Johnson said he was in regular touch with EU leaders. “We’re all facing the same pandemic, we all have the same problems,” the prime minister. “If there is one thing that is worth stressing is that on the continent right now you can see sadly there is a third wave under way. People in this country should be under no illusions that previous experience has taught us that when a wave hits our friends, it washes up on our shores as well. I expect that we will feel those effects in due course. “That’s why we’re getting on with our vaccination programme as fast as we can but a vaccination campaign and developing vaccines, rolling them out – these are international projects and they require international cooperation.” His comments were echoed by Ireland’s taoiseach, Micheál Martin, who told his fellow EU leaders ahead of a summit on Thursday that he is vehemently opposed to the suggestion that the EU could impose an export ban on vaccines going to the UK, describing it as a “retrograde step”. He told RTÉ radio: “I am very much against it. I think it would be a very retrograde step. I met all the companies and I think it is absolutely vital that we keep supply chains open. “If you take the Pfizer vaccine 280 materials go into making the Pfizer vaccine, they are supplied by 86 suppliers from 19 countries around the world. “You start putting up barriers other countries may follow suit in terms of those vital raw materials. “If we start that we are in trouble. We are looking forward to a much better quarter two – the key is production and manufacture. We take lipids in from other countries to enable us to do Pfizer vaccine in Europe.”  Johnson’s comments come as a Downing Street source said the prime minister had held phone talks on Sunday with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the French president, Emmanuel Macron. No 10 normally announces such calls formally, but has not done so amid the vaccine negotiations, which have been taking place because of continuing disagreement about competing contracts for supplies, primarily of the OxfordAstraZeneca version. Eddie Lister, one of Johnson’s most senior aides, was in India on Monday as part of what Downing Street said were scheduled talks before the prime minister’s visit to the country next month. However, it is understood that Lister will also discuss vaccine production, notably continued UK supplies from the Serum Institute of India, the world’s largest vaccine manufacturer. India’s government faces political pressure to retain more of does of the domestically made vaccine in order to inoculate its own population. The Financial Times said Lister was expected to travel from Delhi to Pune, the western Indian city where the institute is based, to try to help solve a political deadlock over the issue. Downing Street has repeatedly refused to say what it will do if the EU does impose an export ban. Asked the UK might retaliate, Johnson’s spokesman said: “I’m obviously not going to get into hypotheticals, but we’ve been clear that the vaccination programme is an international effort.” Speaking earlier on Monday, Helen Whately, the care minister, also refused to say if the UK would hit back. “I don’t think it’s very helpful to speculate at the moment,” Whately told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “What is clear – and the prime minister has made it clear – is that we expect the European Union to stand by their commitments.” The European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, has raised the possibility of an export ban amid claims in Brussels that while both the UK and EU have signed contracts with AstraZeneca for millions of vaccine doses, the British-Swedish manufacturer is favouring supplies to the UK. The disagreement appears to be around supplies made by an AstraZeneca subcontractor, Halix, at a plant at Leiden in the Netherlands. EU officials told Reuters that consignments manufactured there must remain in the EU and not be sent to the UK. Johnson spoke to Von der Leyen last week, along with the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, and the Belgian PM, Alexander De Croo, and is expected to hold more calls in the coming days. Whately said: “We expect the European Union to stick by their commitments, and I’m sure the prime minister will be in touch with European counterparts regularly. But I don’t think this debate is helpful for anyone.” According to an analysis for the  by the data analytics company Airfinity, an EU export ban could delay the UK’s vaccine rollout by two months, while not providing much of a boost to EU member states’ troubled programmes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c949c4f0b239568aede6768868ade99f28ecf924/0_246_2666_1600/master/2666.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=8d827b22322c6e3b7a975ab074a4555f","title":"coronavirus vaccine optimism","story":"So when she received her second dose of the Pfizer vaccine earlier this month, Fulcher, a 28-year-old commerce editor, felt an immediate sense of relief. “It was like a weight had been lifted from my shoulders. I still have to be careful – not to be dramatic, but now knowing that I most likely won’t die after going to the grocery store or nail salon is reassuring.” For her, the vaccine is not a free pass, but at least a light at the end of the tunnel – after a pretty bleak winter, which meant weeks of staying indoors, no dating, working from home and only socializing with friends over FaceTime. New York’s cold and dark weather only made things worse for Fulcher, who has seasonal depression. With the socializing limits brought on by Covid, and an ADHD diagnosis that had previously been masked by the structure of office life, she was left feeling overwhelmed. That celebration has perhaps come earlier than at first imagined: at the beginning of the pandemic, the received wisdom was that it would take years to get a vaccine – as has previously been the case. With the rising death toll, mass unemployment and the political polarization over basic safety measures like wearing masks, the fact that the vaccine has been made available more quickly than any in US history has perhaps been overshadowed. Ginger Goral, 66, a retired mother in Oconomowoc, Wisconsin, is channeling a shared hopefulness that better days are on the horizon. As the mother of a 10-year-old, Goral has had to transform her house into a classroom while her son attends school online. The transition has been challenging, but Goral has employed a tutor to help monitor her son’s schoolwork, which has had positive effects on his performance. She is grateful for the extra help but still pines for a more child-friendly environment for him. “He misses his friends, and children need to be able to run around outside,” says Goral – whose fully vaccinated ex-husband allows their son to visit with one family friend every other weekend. “If I lived in an area where people believed in Covid, I would have felt way more comfortable going into stores with my mask,” she adds. Goral, who has been limiting her interactions with people, ordering food at curbside restaurants, and only going to stores to pick up packages outside, will receive her second dose of the Moderna vaccine at the end of March and is excited to browse through shops again without fearing that she’ll head home sick. “Of course I’ll still be masked and everything, but I’ll just feel more free,” she says. After friends died from Covid complications, and witnessing her town’s lack of precaution toward the virus, Goral has considered moving. Multiple incidents of negligence, including an interaction with an unmasked police officer at her doorstep and a canvasser at her local vaccine clinic who also refused to wear a mask, provided Goral with clarity. “It’s just not a place I’m sure I want to be any more. This pandemic has given me a new perspective of where I’m living,” she says. For those who moved to new cities during or right before lockdown, adjusting to a new location has been equally difficult. Making friends and exploring local spots isn’t nearly as simple when there’s a risk associated with it, but Matthew Wettig is looking forward to seeing more of Portland now he is fully vaccinated. “Having only lived here for six months before Covid, it has definitely slowed the ability to solidify new connections in somewhere that I already am not the most familiar with,” he says. The 25-year-old medical data analyst was eligible for the Pfizer vaccine after a brain aneurysm stroke 12 years ago and developing an auto-immune disease. Falling under the high-risk category, Wettig has spent most of the pandemic alone, aside from some visits with his partner, who lives with her high-risk mother. Even with antibodies, Wettig remains cautious about Covid, and doesn’t predict his daily life will change much until there’s more concrete data on rates of transmission to other people who are unvaccinated, and protection against new variants and strains. “I am kind of a bit skeptical surrounding the newness of everything,” says Wettig. Staying indoors a bit longer isn’t too much of a social issue for Wettig, who classifies himself as an introvert who is OK with isolation, but the fear of contracting Covid has subsided a bit. “The moment I got that second dose, it felt like a weight was lifted off my shoulders. To some extent it provides a little bit more peace of mind,” he explains. Like Fulcher and Goral, Wettig is optimistic, and feeling relieved about his newly vaccinated status, but continued uncertainty has caused the three to turn safety precautions into routine practices. Earlier in the pandemic, talk about a potential vaccine rarely involved speed – but nearly a year after the virus resulted in close to 538,000 American deaths, three separate authorized vaccines have allowed the US to take a lead in controlling the spread. The long and complex process of research, development and testing for 10 to 15 years was quickly dismantled after the Pfizer vaccine received authorization for emergency use just 336 days after the coronavirus’s genetic blueprint was shared online by Chinese scientists. It’s the quickest a vaccine has ever been developed and distributed – and with such speed and newness comes valid uncertainty. As Fulcher laid out so candidly: “We all now know how easy it is to contract something. I don’t see the majority of us just returning to our old ways that easily. It’s more so that we don’t want some other virus to hit us this hard again in the future.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b2dd9715ed089b6d406cdf2eabe7f93fa94d51e/0_135_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=8498b642b4efca58d1d3d965b7dc9a67","title":"lockdowns return extended third wave covid europe","story":"Critics say the further restrictions have come too late, with politicians eager to start easing measures for pandemic-weary populations after a second series of lockdowns late last year leading to a surge in infections and health services stretched to breaking point. The variant first found in Britain is spreading significantly in at least 27 European countries and is now dominant in Denmark, Italy, Ireland, Germany, France, the Netherlands, Spain and Portugal, according to the World Health Organization. After reopening schools in late February and allowing hairdressers and some shops to resume business in March, Germany is to prolong its partial lockdown into April as new cases surge to more than 13,000 a day on a rolling seven-day average. Chancellor Angela Merkel met leaders of the country’s 16 states on Monday for what were supposed to be talks about a further easing of restrictions, but instead agreed a pause to the planned reopening of bars, restaurants, leisure and cultural venues. Some hard-hit areas may have to reimpose strict measures again, with shops and some schools very likely to close. Staff who can work from home will be asked to continue doing so until 18 April rather than return to the workplace on 28 March. Private gatherings are again expected to be limited to no more than one person from outside the household, excluding children under 14. Discussions about the closure of schools and nurseries, as well as a possible lifting of restrictions over Easter, continued. The weekly infection rate has increased to 107 per 100,000, up from the mid-60s three weeks ago, prompting authorities for the first time to consider overnight curfews in highly infected areas, as well as quarantine for people returning to Germany. “Without significant restrictions, the number of new infections will increase to the point that the health system risks being overwhelmed by April,” a draft document read. “Given the current infection dynamics, forceful action is still required.” France’s labour minister, Elisabeth Borne, became the fifth member of Emmanuel Macron’s cabinet – besides the president – to test positive for Covid-19 as the seven-day average of new daily cases exceeded 30,000, up from 10,000 in December. The prime minister, Jean Castex, last week reimposed a partial “lockdown lite” on 16 départements – including the greater Paris region – that are home to roughly a third of the country’s population, closing non-essential shops are and banning inter-regional travel. There are more people in intensive care in the Paris region than during the second wave in November, with hospital capacity now saturated. Lasting for at least four weeks, the measures are less strict than previous lockdowns and some experts have questioned whether they will be sufficient. Hairdressers, bookshops and florists can stay open and people are allowed to exercise outdoors as often as they like during the day within 10km (6 miles) of their home. France’s night-time curfew now begins at 7pm rather than 6pm, schools remain open (although senior high-school education revert to a hybrid half-at-home, half-at-school schedule) and all employees who can work at home are required to do so. New daily cases in Italy have surged from a weekly average of just over 12,000 in January to more than 22,000 this week as a result of new variants, prompting the prime minister, Mario Draghi, to impose tough new restrictions from 15 March. More than half the country – including Milan and Rome – – is already under the new regime, which placed any region with more than 250 cases per 100,000 automatically in the “red” category, meaning bars, restaurants and schools must close. The whole country will be categorised as red during the Easter holiday weekend from 3 to 5 April, with people required to stay at home except for work, health or other essential reasons. Parents, children and teachers have protested the closures. Italy has registered more than 105,000 coronavirus deaths since last February, the second-highest toll in Europe after Britain and the seventh-highest in the world. There 27,500 people with Covid-19 in Italy’s hospital at the weekend of which 3,500 were in intensive care. Greece’s health minister has requisitioned private-sector doctors from certain specialties in and around Athens to help fight the latest surge in infections that is straining public hospitals to their limits. Vassilis Kikilias said appeals for private doctors to volunteer to help in the public sector had not produced results, so he was ordering specialists in pathology, pneumonology and general medicine to help. Greece has experiencing a major surge in infections despite strict measures being in force since early November, but nonetheless lifted some restrictions last week as part of a plan to gradually reopen the economy and relieve national fatigue. Hair and beauty salons and archaeological sites opened on Monday and a nationwide night-time curfew will start two hours later, at 9pm, during weekends. Non-essential shops, restaurants and schools remain closed, however. Athens accounts for roughly half of new Covid cases detected in Greece each day, which have soared to a weekly average of about 2,400 from 450 in late January. The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, a fortnight ago extended the country’s tough coronavirus lockdown until the end of the month as its seven-day average of daily new cases continued to surge, nearly doubling to about 6,400 from just over 3,000 in January. Rutte, whose VVD party finished a comfortable first in national elections last week, has suggested a “tipping point is coming when more will be possible” – but local media reports suggest no further relaxation will be until at least the middle of next month. A 9pm to 4.30am curfew remains in force, people are asked to avoid all but unavoidable foreign travel. Secondary schools may now open for at least one day a week and hairdressers and other “contact professions” are back at work. People with an advance appointment are also now allowed to visit non-essential shops, which were closed since mid-December – but only with an advance appointment. Bars and restaurants remain shut. Poland closed most public venues this weekend for at least three weeks as infections continued to climb rapidly, nearly quadrupling to an average of about 21,000 new cases a day from just over 5,000 in early February. The health minister, Adam Niedzielski, said last week the main reasons for the surge was “the British mutation of the coronavirus”. The country began tightening restrictions two weeks ago, starting with just two regions, as its third wave increased. But nationwide measures were unavoidable to stop the health system from being overwhelmed, Niedzielski said. Shopping malls are now closed except for essential stores like groceries or pharmacies. Cinemas, theatres and other cultural venues are also shut, as are hotels, ski slopes, fitness centres and swimming pools, while the country’s entire education system has returned to online learning and home working is strongly recommended. The government has said further restrictions, such as curfews, could become necessary if the measures do not prove enough. “The next steps will be a typical lockdown, where we will close everything completely,” Niedzielski said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3bf07648207df4787a4621c2712e9f8146db7a0c/0_0_5460_3276/master/5460.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=1a5db727cf993068b0dc14427305de9f","title":"vesuvius wiped out all life pompeii 15 minutes study pyroclastic flow cloud gases ash","story":"The estimated 2,000 people who died in the ancient Roman city when they could not escape were not overwhelmed by the lava, but rather asphyxiated by the gases and ashes and later covered in volcanic debris to leave a mark of their physical presence millennia later. The study by researchers from the Department of Earth and Geo-environmental Sciences of the University of Bari, in collaboration with the National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology (INGV) and the British Geological Survey in Edinburgh, has revealed the duration of the so-called pyroclastic flow, a dense, fast-moving flow of solidified lava pieces, volcanic ash and hot gases that hit the ancient Roman city minutes after the volcano erupted. The study confirms that the inhabitants had no escape, and most of those who died suffocated in their homes and beds, or in the streets and squares of the city. Isaia’s model estimates the gases, ash and volcanic particles would have engulfed the city for between 10 and 20 minutes. “It is probable that dozens of people died due to the rain of lapilli that fell on Pompeii after the eruption, but most of them died of asphyxiation,” Isaia said, adding the pyroclastic flow would have reached Pompeii a few minutes after the explosion. “Those 15 minutes inside that infernal cloud must have been interminable. The inhabitants could not have imagined what was happening. The Pompeiians lived with earthquakes, but not with eruptions, so they were taken by surprise and swept away by that incandescent cloud of ash.” The INGV research described pyroclastic flows as “the most devastating impact” of explosive eruptions. “Comparable to avalanches, they are generated by the collapse of the eruptive column. The resulting volcanic ashes run along the slopes of the volcano at speeds of hundreds of kilometres per hour, at high temperatures and with a high concentration of particles.” Today, the ruins of Pompeii are Italy’s second-most visited archaeological site, after the Colosseum in Rome and, last year, attracted about a million tourists. “It is very important to be able to reconstruct what happened during Vesuvius’s past eruptions, starting from the geological record, in order to trace the characteristics of the pyroclastic currents and the impact on population,” said Prof Pierfrancesco Dellino of the University of Bari. “The adopted scientific approach in this study reveals information that is contained in the pyroclastic deposits and that clarifies new aspects of the eruption of Pompeii and provides valuable insights for interpreting the behaviour of Vesuvius, also in terms of civil protection.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c5682ddb09e128902e9d93d75c040bf7594a0ba/0_202_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=300\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a23b291984b507daf51655e4ef77d4a8","title":"coronavirus live news global covid updates germany lockdown chile record daily cases","story":"Aviation minister Hadi Sirika told a news conference that the airline had demanded passengers from Nigeria undertake three tests within 24 hours, leading the government to suspend its operations, with the exemption of cargo and humanitarian flights. “To make us go through three tests within 24 hours does not make sense. Since they insist, their operations remain suspended,” Sirika said.  In addition to requiring a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test before flying from Nigeria, the airline added an extra requirement of having a rapid test four hours before departure.  Dutch airline KLM commenced flights in and out of Nigeria this month, the minister added. Health ministry data showed the cumulative number of cases stood at 3,035,338, data also showed, while the death toll rose by 117 to 30,178. Daily cases have roughly doubled since the beginning of March, when Turkey eased restrictions against the pandemic.The rules says no one may “leave England to travel to a destination outside the United Kingdom, or travel to, or be present at, an embarkation point for the purpose of travelling from there to a destination outside the United Kingdom” without a reasonable excuse. It suggests anyone who breaks such rules could face a £5,000 fine.  There is also a £200 fixed penalty notice for failing to fill in a travel declaration form – giving person details and reason for travel – for those planning to leave the UK. The travel ban does not apply to those going to the common travel area of the Channel Islands, Isle of Man and the Republic of Ireland unless that is not the final destination. Exemptions also apply including for those needing to travel for work, study, for legal obligations, or to vote, if they are moving, selling or renting property, for some childcare reasons or to be present at a birth, to visit a dying relative or close friend, to attend a funeral, for those getting married or to attend the wedding of a close relative, for medical appointments or to escape a risk of harm.The preliminary data was from phase 1 and 2 clinical trials involving over 500 people aged between three and 17 who received two shots of either medium or low dosage of vaccine, or a placebo. Most adverse reactions were mild, Zeng Gang, a researcher with the company, told an academic conference in Beijing.  Two children who received the lower dose were reported to have experienced higher fever, categorised as grade 3, he said, without providing details or specific temperature.  The antibody levels triggered by Sinovac’s CoronaVac were higher than those seen in adults aged 18 to 59 and in older people in earlier clinical trials, Zeng said in the presentation.  For children three to 11 years old, the lower dose could induce favourable antibody responses, and the medium dose worked well for those aged 12 to 17, he said.“This data is further evidence that the AstraZeneca vaccine is safe and effective,” Tedros told a news conference. The government is preparing for regions to adapt restrictions locally. Infections have been increasing steadily since Austria loosened its third lockdown on 8 February by letting non-essential shops reopen despite high case rates. A night-time curfew replaced all-day restrictions on movement. The number of new infections reported rose above 3,500 on Friday, the highest level since early December. The government met with the governors of its nine provinces on Monday to review its plan to let terraces reopen next weekend in all but one of them, after the small Alpine province of Vorarlberg got a head start earlier this month. “The experts have advised us not to carry out any more loosening of restrictions here, unfortunately,” Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said of most provinces, adding three hard-hit eastern ones including Vienna would work on extra measures.The ministry also reported 9,269 new confirmed coronavirus cases in the past 24 hours, taking the cumulative total to 544,724 cases. The government, which says there are 3,277 patients being treated in hospitals, is facing a crisis with some hospitals reaching capacity, especially in the capital where over four million people live.The number of people in intensive care with the virus rose by 142 to a new 2021 high of 4,548, health ministry data showed.  The country has reported 3.4m cases to date. Patients in hospital with Covid-19 - not including those in intensive care - stood at 28,049 on Monday, up from 27,484 a day earlier.

We are pretty much stuck and we could be looking at another surge,” he told RTÉ Radio 1’s Morning Ireland.“The more we come together, the more the virus spreads. The new strain spreads faster,” he added.The public needed to look at which situations were most important and to prioritise them, Prof Cormican suggested. Coming together for occasions such as wakes and birthday parties was a “huge risk” to everybody. This was evidenced by the spread of Covid in certain workplaces and other settings where people come together.Prof Cormican said that everything had to be done in proportion and that included mandatory quarantine which was under constant review. The main concern about travel was that people might bring a variant to Ireland that might be vaccine resistant, he said.It was all about managing the risk, he said, adding: “Everything that we do has to be about balancing risk.” There was a balance between people being able to live their lives and controlling the virus with the lowest possible level of risk, he said.Contact tracingOn Monday morning, infectious diseases expert Professor Sam McConkey called for “huge investment” in public health, including retraining unemployed people to help with detailed contact tracing.Speaking on RTÉ radio’s Today with Claire Byrne show, Prof McConkey also warned that opening up the hospitality sector and multi-generational mixing could lead to a surge in cases and thousands of deaths.The current Level 5 restrictions have not led to the same responses as were achieved in the first and second lockdowns, he said.People were getting tired of the restrictions, which meant the country was in “a really tight spot”. He warned that if the country opened up “things will get rapidly worse.”It could be September to November before the widespread vaccination programme was completed, he said, because of vaccine supply issues.If there was a “huge investment” in populationpublic health it could mean thousands of people becoming involved in local outbreak management teams. With more staff, better IT, along with processes and governance, outbreaks could be better managed.Volunteers and retrained unemployed people could assist with tracing and help the current staff who were struggling, he said.There was also a role for employers, such as in providing access to GPs and sick pay. “There’s a lot that could be done better, that should have been done a year ago.”The arrival of several new vaccines will ease the situation, he said. But it will take a little while. “When it goes from three to 12 we will be able to vaccinate the majority.”Mandatory quarantine was important, but the majority of Covid cases were as a result of domestic contacts. Such quarantine measures were just one part of a 20-piece jigsaw, he said.Cause for hopeMeanwhile, the HSE’s chief clinical officer Dr Colm Henry said there was a need to focus on the positive.“We’re not seeing the dip we’d hoped for, but we’re not back to square one,” he told Newstalk Breakfast, adding that the current level of Covid-19 cases was “disheartening”.Nursing home residents and staff were almost completely vaccinated as were acute frontline workers, where numbers had decreased from 1,000 in one week in February to 14 in one week recently.The vaccination programme will reduce illness, hospitalisations and deaths in vulnerable groups which was a cause for considerable hope, he said. Vaccination enhances public-health measures, but “we cannot rely purely on vaccination alone”, he warned, as it will not lead to an immediately improved situation.“The lower we get figures down, the more choices we will have. There are still a lot of cases out there.”Dr Henry said he is concerned that the continuing high level of cases will lead to more hospitalisations.When asked about the introduction of mandatory quarantine in hotels this week, he said the country was ready for it, but any public-health measures needed the support of the population. “We’ve swallowed more bitter pills in the last year,” he said.Dr Henry said he would encourage people to “hold tight” to help protect the old and vulnerable. As the vaccination programme progresses, case numbers will come down and choices will increase, he added.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4517032.1616437547!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"covid 19 public urged to limit contacts after 520 more cases","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDr Ronan Glynn, Deputy Chief Medical Officer, Department of Health.

We are pretty much stuck and we could be looking at another surge,” the Health Service Executive’s clinical lead on infection control, Prof Martin Cormican, said on Monday morning.“The more we come together, the more the virus spreads. The new strain spreads faster.” Referring to this new strain, Dr Cillian de Gascun, medical virologist and director of the National Virus Reference Laboratory, said: “The B117 variant, Ireland’s most dominant variant of Covid-19 accounts for more than 90 per cent of our cases and is extremely transmissible. Public health advice aims to limit the opportunities this virus has to spread, and it should be noted that B117 does not need much opportunity to do so. “The most effective way to stop the spread of this variant and all variants of Covid-19 is to limit your social contacts and follow public health advice.”Dr Ronan Glynn, Deputy Chief Medical Officer, Department of Health, said: “People have worked exceptionally hard over the past three months to reduce transmission in our communities. We have shown time and again that we can act collectively to protect one another. Please keep this going over the coming weeks.”GatheringsCommenting on the jump in figures on Sunday, when 769 cases were reported, Prof Cormican told RTÉ Radio 1’s Morning Ireland the public needed to look at which situations were most important and to prioritise them. Coming together for occasions such as wakes and birthday parties was a “huge risk” to everybody. This was evidenced by the spread of Covid in certain workplaces and other settings where people come together.Infectious diseases expert Professor Sam McConkey called for “huge investment” in public health, including retraining unemployed people to help with detailed contact tracing.Speaking on RTÉ radio’s Today with Claire Byrne show, Prof McConkey also warned that opening up the hospitality sector and multi-generational mixing could lead to a surge in cases and thousands of deaths.The current Level 5 restrictions had not led to the same responses as were achieved in the first and second lockdowns, he said. People were getting tired of the restrictions, which meant the country was in “a really tight spot”. He warned that if the country opened up “things will get rapidly worse.”It could be September to November before the widespread vaccination programme was completed, he said, because of vaccine supply issues.Mandatory quarantine was important, but the majority of Covid cases were as a result of domestic contacts. Such quarantine measures were just one part of a 20-piece jigsaw, he said.Meanwhile, the HSE’s chief clinical officer Dr Colm Henry said there was a need to focus on the positive.“We’re not seeing the dip we’d hoped for, but we’re not back to square one,” he told Newstalk Breakfast, adding that the current level of Covid-19 cases was “disheartening”.He said: “The lower we get figures down, the more choices we will have. There are still a lot of cases out there.”In Northern Ireland, the death of one more person with Covid-19 was announced on Monday, bringing the total number of deaths to 2,105. A further 87 people tested positive for the virus.In the North’s hospitals 160 people with Covid-19 are receiving treatment, with 15 in intensive care."},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 vaccine tracker what s available in the republic of ireland and what else is coming","story":"It has been almost a year since the first case of Covid-19 was confirmed in the Republic of Ireland. Since then, over 200,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and more than 4,000 people have died.Globally, over 100 million people have been diagnosed and over 2.5\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.NEWS AND UPDATES: - How many have been vaccinated here?Scientists have been racing to develop a vaccine that would bring an end to the pandemic, and there are now 64 different vaccines in clinical development, with another 173 in preclinical development, according to the World Health Organisation.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Jannsen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspis also in talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva. 181,063 had received their second dose.Some 183,550 of these vaccines had gone to people in long term residential care facilities, while 294,861 had gone to frontline healthcare workers and 184,593 had gone to people over the age of 70. Some\u0026nbsp5,022 people in Cohort 4 - those\u0026nbspaged between 16 and 69 at very high risk of severe Covid-19 disease - received a dose.\u0026nbspGlobally, over 448 million doses of a Covid-19 vaccine have been administered.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 5.4 million doses by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.EMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc. While talks continue on how to increase production, the company has now committed to a total of 40 million doses for the EU in the first quarter of 2021.While the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab, resulting in a significant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.On March 11th Norwegian health authorities said three health workers in Norway who had recently received the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine were being treated in hospital for bleeding, blood clots and a low count of blood platelets.Norway halted the rollout of the AstraZeneca vaccine, following a similar move by Denmark. Iceland later followed suit.On Thursday, March 18th, the EMA announced it had found\u0026nbspno causal link between the vaccine and blood-clotting events and use of the vaccine\u0026nbspresumed on Saturday March 20th in Ireland.How many will Ireland get? 190,000 doses in February and a further 95,000 in early March - supply after this is not confirmed.Storage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2–8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st .On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2–8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and expects to have its first results by April 2021. On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?In December the HSE published the provisional order in which people in Ireland will be vaccinated against Covid-19. After over-65s in care homes and frontline health workers, people aged 70 and older and other healthcare workers are next in line to receive the vaccine.\u0026nbspPeople aged 16-69 with very high risk conditions will then be\u0026nbspthe fourth cohort to be vaccinated.The next categories are: people aged 65-69 years an ill-defined group referred to as “key workers” and people aged 18-64 with certain medical conditions. Next up will be: those living or working in crowded conditions people working in education those aged 55-64 workers in other occupations important to the functioning of society people aged between 18 and 54 and, finally, pregnant women and those under 18.The vaccination of people aged over 85 began on Monday, February 15th. Those in the 70-84 age bracket should begin to receive their first dose by March 8th, alongside people aged 16-69 with very high risk conditions.The HSE has said everyone over the age of 70 should have received their second dose by mid-May.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4516237.1616358699!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"gp suspended by medical council over refusal to give covid 19 vaccine","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDr Gerard Waters, a GP at the Whitethorn Clinic in Celbridge, said  he would not administer the Covid-19 vaccine on the basis he believed it was untrustworthy and unnecessary. Photograph: Alan BetsonA Co Kildare GP who refused to administer Covid-19 vaccines to his patients has been suspended by the Medical Council.The council, which regulates medical doctors in the State, confirmed that Dr Gerard Waters had been suspended “until further steps are taken”.Dr Waters, a GP at the Whitethorn Clinic in Celbridge, last month told RTÉ Radio One’s Liveline programme that he was a “conscientious objector” to the Covid-19 vaccine and would not be recommending it to his patients.He later told The  he would not administer the vaccine on the basis that he believed it was untrustworthy and unnecessary. Following his comments, the Medical Council used its powers under the Medical Practitioners Act 2007 to make an ex parte application to the High Court for his suspension.Postmortems pointThe hearing was heard in camera, in keeping with the legislative provision that the application can be heard “otherwise than in public” unless the court determines differently.In playing down the severity of the virus last month, Dr Waters said questions remained as to why children did not die and that he did not know anyone who had died from it. He said postmortems should have been carried out on everyone whose death was linked to Covid-19.He also confirmed he did not refer patients for Covid-19 tests. “I have decided not to get involved with the whole thing from the beginning,” he said. A Medical Council spokesman said it has written to “a number” of inidual doctors directly, reminding them of their ethical duty on matters relating to Covid-19.“There is also a number of matters being investigated by the council as part of a regulatory process.”The Medical Council takes issues relating to doctors not following public health guidelines or spreading misinformation in relation to Covid-19 and vaccines very seriously, the spokesman said. Ethics guide“Doctors must continue to advocate for their patients by actively promoting the public health guidance.”The ethics guide governing doctors’ practice included a duty to ensure compliance with all laws and regulations relating to this practice, the spokesman said.“This also includes ensuring doctors promote a culture of patient safety within the context of the wider health system. Doctors also have responsibilities when it comes to posting on social media.”Health Service Executive chief executive Paul Reid last month suggested that healthcare workers who refused to take the vaccine could be removed from their posts. He said everyone had a right to refuse a vaccine if they wished, but the Health and Safety Act allowed for workers to be removed if they were regarded as a threat to other people.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside politics interview derek scally author of the best catholics in the world","story":"In today’s episode  Berlin correspondent Derek Scally joins Hugh to speak about his brand new book: The Best Catholics in the World.

Photograph:  Julien Behal PhotographyPA WireThe “eyes and interest” of the United States continue to “make a difference at a delicate time” for post-Brexit Northern Ireland, Taoiseach Micheál Martin has said.Speaking at a virtual meeting of the traditional Friends of Ireland St Patrick’s Day event, Mr Martin told Irish-American politicians that there has been “deep appreciation of the importance of the balances and nuances” of Northern Ireland’s Belfast Agreement in Washington since Brexit.This was “an appreciation that we do not take for granted”, the Taoiseach said in an address that touched on the tensions caused by Brexit in the North and between the EU and UK.Mr Martin said the Government always knew that the UK’s departure from the EU would “create strains and complications, especially in Northern Ireland”, and that the “voices” of Irish-American politicians within the caucus “helped pave the way” for the Brexit withdrawal deal.The Northern Ireland protocol within that agreement was “an agreed, balanced compromise” and was “the only way” to manage complexities in Northern Ireland and to avoid a hard border.“Implementing the protocol involves change and sometimes it takes time for people to adjust to new ways of doing things. The protocol has only been in operation since the start of the year,” Mr Martin said.“I have always known that there would inevitably be bumps and wrinkles along the way. That is why the agreement itself contains mechanisms through which any difficulties can be resolved.” For the protocol to succeed and deliver benefits for the people of Northern Ireland, there has to be a relationship between the UK and the EU “based on trust and good faith”, he said, in a reference to the tensions over the UK government’s decision to delay border checks for British businesses.Proud memberIn a video address, US president Joe Biden said that he was a proud member of the Friends of Ireland caucus when he was a US senator and paid tribute to his former colleagues who “tended to the flame of Irish-American relationships – a flame that glows ever brighter every single day”.Democratic congressman Richie Neal, a co-chair of the Friends of Ireland group, said in his online remarks that the 1998 Belfast Agreement underpinning the Northern Ireland peace process “remains the only way forward on the island of Ireland – there is simply no plan B”. Mr Biden quoted his favourite poet Seamus Heaney and his poem The Cure at Troy, which he has quoted in public for years, saying: “We have a chance to make hope and history rhyme.” The Friends of Ireland caucus of Irish-American politicians marks its 40th anniversary this year. Normally the Taoiseach would attend the Friends of Ireland St Patrick’s Day lunch alongside the president at the US Capitol – one of only two occasions in Washington’s political calendar when the president travels to Capitol Hill – but the Covid-19 pandemic forced the event online.

Photograph:  PA WireThe US, EU, UK and Canada have imposed sanctions on China over its treatment of Uighur Muslims in a co-ordinated move that sparked an immediate retaliation from Beijing. Travel bans and asset freezes have now been imposed on four officials and a security organisation over persecution and mass internments of Uighurs in the Xinjiang region. The moves came ahead of the arrival of US secretary of state Antony Blinken in Brussels on Monday.The sanctions from the western powers cover high-level officials and entities in Xinjiang with direct connections to the internment camp system. These include the public security bureau and Wang Junzheng, the Communist Party boss of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, a paramilitary organisation that plays a central role in the region’s economy and security.Mr Blinken said the sanctions demonstrated “our ongoing commitment to working multilaterally to advance respect for human rights”.The EU was the first western power to announce the sanctions and was hit with immediate retaliation from China’s foreign ministry, which imposed travel bans on 10 EU iniduals and four entities. This included MEPs that have criticised Beijing’s policy, such as French MEP Raphaël Glucksmann, German scholar Adrian Zenz and Swedish analyst Björn Jerdén.‘Lies and disinformation’Beijing said the EU measures were “based on nothing but lies and disinformation”, adding that they “severely” undermined its ties with the European bloc.European Parliament president David Sassoli said the counter-sanctions were “unacceptable” and would have “consequences”.Another target of the western sanctions is Zhu Hailun, head of Xinjiang’s powerful Legal and Political Affairs commission from 2016 to 2019. He signed off on internal party documents, later leaked to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, that described how the “vocational and educational training centres” were designed like prisons.Abuses against Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang represented “one of the worst human rights crises of our time”, said British foreign secretary Dominic Raab, adding that “human rights violations on this scale” could not be ignored. A growing body of evidence including survivor testimony and visits by British diplomats pointed to a “highly disturbing programme of oppression”.‘Blind eye’“The international community will not turn a blind eye to such serious and systematic violations of human rights,” he said.The EU, UK and Canadian lists do not include Chen Quanguo, Xinjiang’s Communist Party leader, the highest-ranking official in the region. Mr Chen, often considered the primary enforcer of hardline policies there, was targeted by US sanctions last July.The new Xinjiang sanctions come on the heels of the first high-level meeting between the US and China since Joe Biden became president. Mr Blinken and Jake Sullivan, US national security adviser, met their Chinese counterparts in Alaska last week in a meeting that erupted into an extraordinary public spat.The co-ordinated move also comes less than a week after the Biden administration imposed measures on 24 Chinese and Hong Kong officials over a Chinese law that further erodes democracy in the former British territory.It also highlights the European bloc’s uncomfortable efforts to maintain political and economic ties with Beijing while confronting it in other areas, such as its human rights record. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2021Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4516136.1616345181!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"moral victory of moderates set to shape next government of netherlands","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tD66 leader Sigrid Kaag speaks to journalists in the House of Representatives in The Hague. Photographer: Peter BoerBloomberg It can take months to form a coalition government in the Netherlands, so it was surprising to see Mark Rutte and his new “best friend”, Sigrid Kaag, get down to some serious post-election arm wrestling last Friday – just 24 hours after being thrown together by the electorate.With all the ease of a leader who has served three terms as premier, Rutte had already stepped into his familiar role as ringmaster, urging the parties to expedite talks so that a new government could focus on the coronavirus pandemic and on rebuilding the economy.Yet as the leaders of the seven largest parties met with commendable speed on Thursday afternoon with two “sherpas” whose job will be to inch them towards a workable coalition deal, the dynamic was already somehow different.Why? Because although Rutte’s Liberal Party had easily topped the poll as predicted, it was their coalition partners, D66, who had staged a last-minute sprint, forcing Geert Wilders’s far-right Freedom Party into third place – thereby winning what one editorial called “the moral victory” of the election.That term “moral victory” is an interesting one because what it suggests is that D66 and Kaag, their leader for just over six months, deserve some form of recognition disproportionate to the size of their win, at 24 seats in the 150-seat parliament already a creditable gain of five on 2017.Might it be, for instance, that that moral victory entitles D66 to be treated as equals with the Liberals in the coalition talks, despite Rutte’s own shiny new mandate of 35 seats? That’s quite a radical idea to those who still see politics as a zero-sum game. But then radical ideas used to be the stock in trade of D66, a party founded by a group of young intellectuals in the revolutionary 1960s with the aim of “democratising” Dutch politics and modernising policymaking – a progressive agenda it has since pursued in a long list of coalitions.That’s also why it was interesting to see Kaag, an Oxford-educated former diplomat, with, as another observer put it, “a wardrobe full of iron fists and velvet gloves”, put some of the former on show, however briefly, as she stamped her personal authority on her win.There were many live domestic issues on which she could have challenged Rutte in the first hours of their new working relationship, but she chose the one on which public opinion has been most positive towards the caretaker prime minister: his management of the pandemic.Straight in she went, warning that the overnight curfew – which sparked three nights of nationwide rioting when it was imposed in January and which cost Rutte more than a little political capital to stand over – should be “removed, very quickly”.With the arrival of daylight saving time, she warned, it would become increasingly difficult to enforce. So now was the time for the government to “broaden its approach” to the pandemic in pursuit of a better balance between economic wellbeing and public health.If the Liberals and D66 do form a fourth Rutte coalition, and if Kaag is positioning D66 to take credit for any easing of restrictions she believes will inevitably come with increased vaccination, then nobody, one imagines, will be more impressed at her tactical skills than Rutte.Coronavirus figuresEvents, however, have a habit of confounding even the most skilful tacticians. Despite what the majority of the population undoubtedly wants, the coronavirus figures are going the wrong way.In the 24 hours to Friday there were 7,425 new cases, the highest since January 8th. With AstraZeneca vaccinations delayed and the B117 coronavirus variant fuelling a third wave, the balance is delicate – and dicing with expectations has got to be a bad idea in principle.Perhaps the hours after a famous moral victory are a time for strategy rather than tactics. In the case of a resurgent D66, having campaigned on a strongly pro-Europe agenda and then unceremoniously displaced the Netherlands’ most notorious far-right Europhobe, the significance was abundantly clear.But whereas Rutte has always “managed” Wilders by burnishing his own right-wing credentials in response, Kaag instinctively did the opposite. She dismissed him completely.Climbing down from a table after a brief jig as the results flashed on screen, she turned to the cameras, declaring simply and rather breathlessly, in almost Bideneqsue fashion: “This result is proof that Dutch people are not extremists. We are moderates.”In that moment, whatever the coalition talks bring, Sigrid Kaag stole a march on Mark Rutte.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4516879.1616439113!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"sturgeon did not breach ministerial code inquiry finds","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Scotland’s first minister Nicola Sturgeon leaves her home in Glasgow on Monday ahead of publication of the inquiry report. Photograph: Jeff J MitchellGetty ImagesNicola Sturgeon did not breach the Scottish government’s ministerial code in her handling of sexual harassment complaints against Alex Salmond, an independent investigation has found. Ireland’s former director of public prosecutions James Hamilton concluded that Ms Sturgeon did not deliberately mislead the Scottish parliament or breach the code in a number of other ways alleged by Mr Salmond. The first minister welcomed the report as a vindication of her conduct as the Scottish government dealt with complaints against Mr Salmond in 2018. “I sought at every stage in this issue to act with integrity and in the public interest. As I have previously made clear, I did not consider that I had broken the code, but these findings are official, definitive and independent adjudication of that,” she said. “Prior to its publication, opposition politicians stressed the importance of respecting and accepting the outcome of Mr Hamilton’s independent inquiry, and I committed wholeheartedly to doing so. Now that he has reported, it is incumbent on them to do likewise.” The Scottish government appointed Mr Hamilton as an independent adviser in 2011, when Mr Salmond was first minister, and he holds the same role for the Welsh government. A judicial review found that the Scottish government’s handling of the complaints against Mr Salmond was biased and unlawful and the exercise cost the authorities more than £500,000 (€583,000) in legal bills. Mr Salmond was subsequently charged with 13 sexual offences and was acquitted on all counts after a criminal trial. The former first minister told a Scottish parliament committee investigating the government’s handling of the allegations that figures around Ms Sturgeon were part of a malicious effort to destroy his reputation. He said that during a meeting at her home on April 2nd, 2018, the first minister had offered to intervene on his behalf, something she has repeatedly denied. Judicial reviewThe parliamentary committee will publish its report on Tuesday and is expected to conclude that Ms Sturgeon misled parliament by not mentioning a meeting with Mr Salmond’s former chief of staff on March 29th 2018 and by denying that she offered to intervene in the complaints process. Mr Hamilton said it was for parliament to decide if it had been misled but that Ms Sturgeon did not do so deliberately. “I accept that this omission was the result of a genuine failure of recollection and was not deliberate. That failure did not therefore in my opinion amount to a breach of the ministerial code,” his report says. Mr Hamilton also found that Ms Sturgeon’s decision to continue to fight the judicial review of her government’s handling of the allegations after external lawyers said it was hopeless did not breach the code. “There is undoubtedly scope for political criticism of the manner in which Scottish government handled Mr Salmond’s proceedings.

While Norway and Finland, which locked down a week before the UK, have both had small first and second wave death tolls, these are exceptions, he said.What happened in many other countries in Europe who also locked down and closed their borders at the same time is that they did have very small first waves in spring 2020 but this was followed by much larger second waves in autumnwinter 2021 and now into spring 2021 too,” he wrote.And this has happened despite second and third lockdowns in many of these countries as people understandably struggled to maintain compliance with restrictions for months on end.But based on current trends it seems likely that many of these countries that we thought were doing well due to their early lockdowns and small first waves will end up having higher excess mortality than the UK, including Czech Republic, Poland, Portugal, and many others.Dr Ali also argued that closing borders has emerged to be a key intervention in controlling the virus, pointing out that the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) opposed the policy last year.However, he concluded that even if ministers had ignored the body\u0027s advice and closed the borders last March, it would have been too late.The point is that getting the timing of lockdowns right is not straightforward, especially when you have to balance their very significant harms against their benefit, and there really is not good evidence that an earlier lockdown would have saved lives, he said.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"clive myrie named new mastermind host","story":"Clive Myrie is to become the new host of Mastermind after the BBC passed up the opportunity to appoint the show\u0027s first female presenter.Samira Ahmed, a former winner of Celebrity Mastermind, had been favourite to take over from John Humphrys.During the series currently being broadcast by BBC Two, Ahmed was booked as a stand-in for Humphrys in case he was unable to work due to lockdown or self-isolation.However, she lost out at the final stage to Myrie, a regular presenter of the BBC News at Six and News at Ten bulletins.Myrie, 56, has previously worked as a BBC correspondent for Asia, Africa, Washington, Paris and Brussels, and recently won the Royal Television Society award for best journalism presenter with the judges praising his versatile, measured, compelling, relaxed but reassuring and empathetic style.The corporation said Myrie also has a track record in entertainment, having appeared as a guest on Have I Got News For You and Would I Lie To You. He will be the fifth host in the show\u0027s 49-year history, following Humphrys, Clive Anderson, Peter Snow and Magnus Magnusson.Kate Phillips, the BBC\u0027s director of entertainment, said: Clive will be a superb host – witty, wise and with a wicked sense of humour. He\u0027s a consummate interrogator who also understands the fear involved when facing a barrage of questions in the spotlight.Myrie said the new role was a privilege and described himself as a lifelong fan of the show, adding: Mastermind with Magnus Magnusson formed the backdrop to my youth, and now to be at the helm is a dream come true. I\u0027m excited and can\u0027t wait to get stuck in.Humphrys\u0027 final episodes will be broadcast in April and Myrie will begin filming the new series in July, with the show returning to screens later this year.The programme is made by two separate production companies. Both said Myrie was always at the top of our list to step into the host\u0027s shoes and we couldn\u0027t be more thrilled that he is going to lead us into a new era of this iconic show.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"course jews ethnic minority","story":"Are Jews an ethnic minority? Surely it\u0027s a question for Jewish people – and only Jewish people – to decide.The Government, however, thinks differently, having removed the \u0027Jewish\u0027 option from the ethnicity question on the 2021 Census. For Jews, the omission hurts and hinders in equal measure.Tick-box analysts would argue that the move was well-intended. Such an option, they say, could be perceived as a monstrous echo of the discrimination and persecution suffered by Jews under the Nazis. The sensitivity is appreciated but entirely misplaced. The notion of \u0027showing your papers\u0027 is the last thing that should be used to frame this particular argument (and I speak as one who confidently applied for an identity card when they were briefly introduced back in 2009). Every libertarian could baulk at filling in the census on such grounds, and in any case, we probably surrender more personal details through our supermarket loyalty cards than in a Government survey. As Jews, our ethnicity should be manifestly obvious – cemented by history, tradition, genetics and culture. That\u0027s not to say that within our community we don\u0027t split hairs over our labeling as an ethnic group. As the old Jewish joke goes, when you get two Jews you get three opinions. Certainly it could explain why the late chief rabbi, Lord Jonathan Sacks, famously called Jewishness a “bricolage of multiple ethnicities.”Yet we endure as a homogenous group. Indeed our status is rubber-stamped as both an ethnic and a religious minority, since we are protected under the Race Relations Act. (Don\u0027t Census officials use Google?)This, above all, is why the fallout from the Census omission should not be taken lightly. It has meant that those Jews who identify as Jewish through heritage and birth yet prefer to remain non-denominational or atheist have no way of being counted. As a result, how are both the Government, as well as our own community, to know how many we are in number?Accurate figures are critical to satisfy educational and welfare needs as well as issues such as understanding antisemitism. For this reason, many Jewish organisations – rightly – took to social media exhorting the Jewish population of this country to declare themselves as such under the ethnic option on the Census.The exclusion of Jewishness also points to a deeper concern, that somehow, to paraphrase the title of David Baddiel\u0027s new book, \u0027Jews Don\u0027t Count\u0027. Aren\u0027t we just a bunch of white, middle class accountants, some will say? How can we be a proper ethnic minority? In fact, there is chronic poverty in the community – as reflected in the demand on Jewish and non-Jewish welfare organisations. Yet the notion that we are somehow different persists. Indeed, it was recently aired on the BBC. The debate show Politics Live posed the question \u0027Are Jews An Ethnic Minority\u0027. It was bad enough to ask this of a panel of four non-Jews – just imagine the outcry if they\u0027d replaced the word \u0027Jews\u0027 with \u0027Blacks\u0027 and debated the issue with a predominantly white panel. But perhaps playing devil\u0027s advocate, the host Jo Coburn, who is herself Jewish, posited the view that Jews have succeeded in reaching high political office and therefore shouldn\u0027t be seen as a group needing recognition. In other words, we eradicate all traces of Jewish ethnicity because Grant Shapps is Transport Minister.Jews are an ethnic minority. One which, because of the Census, could shrink further in the official figures. On this sorrowful point we remain united as one.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"eu fishermen can plunder oceans no at sea government inspections","story":"EU fishermen have been allowed to plunder our seas after Brexit, campaigners have warned, as no at-sea inspections took place in the first two months of this year.Despite promises to tighten regulation on European boats, and a clampdown on supertrawlers, government ministers have confirmed that no checks were done at sea in January or February.These checks take place to make sure boats are using the correct fishing gear, and catching the fish they are licenced for. Usually there are between 10 and 20 random on-board checks a month.Fish stocks could be being decimated, with endangered species killed unbeknownst to our government, campaigners have warned. UK fishermen are reportedly increasingly concerned about the quantities of sea bass being sold in European markets despite it being a closed season in British waters. Chris Thorne, an oceans campaigner at Greenpeace UK, said: “Our government is letting some of the most destructive fishing vessels plunder our seas without any oversight or inspection, including supertrawlers all of which are EU owned. Without proper oversight, these vast industrial vessels could be decimating fish stocks, catching and discarding vast quantities of non-target species and causing untold damage to the marine environment, even in our so-called ‘protected areas’.This is not good enough for a government which aims to be a world leader in marine protection. They need to step up and properly protect our seas from destructive industrial fishing. A good first step would be banning supertrawlers and bottom trawlers from all of our protected areas at sea, regardless of their country of origin. This would deliver an almost immediate green Brexit idend. Failing to do so would squander the opportunity of Brexit, and undermine our government’s ambition to be a global ocean champion.On board inspections have previously caused a supertrawler to be sanctioned for illegally catching 600,000kg of mackerel and caused another to be detained for suspected fishery offences in 2019.Victoria Prentis, fishing minister, explained to Parliament that inspections had fallen due to Covid-19.She said:  “COVID-19 safety measures introduced in response to high rates of infection impacted the ability to conduct physical inspections of vessels both at sea and on shore during January and February 2021. However, inspections were carried out on quaysides with social distancing measures in place and an increased at-sea enforcement presence remained in place for January and February 2021 to deter illegal activity.”The government recently admitted that EU countries will be free to use controversial supertrawlers, with giant nets that scoop up marine life indiscriminately. Government sources said that they cannot exclude these boats altogether, and can only currently legislate in terms of the type of fishing they do.Shadow Fisheries Minister and Labour MP Luke Pollard said: “The government currently has no idea what is being caught in British waters or how. It is extraordinary to see the Government throwing so much extra money at surveillance at sea, and seemingly not using it.“Having betrayed fishing communities so comprehensively over new costly red tape and border delays the fact that the Government has stopped enforcing our borders at sea will further anger fishers nationwide. The government needs to get a grip and urgently restart fisheries patrols at sea.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"grim vaccine nationalism shattering eus founding myths","story":"The Men Who Stare At Goats was a dark comedy, based on real-life efforts by the US Army to harness magical psychic powers as a weapon. Were a film to be made about the EU Commission’s attempts to harness the power of vaccines to combat covid-19, it would surely need to be called \u0027The People Who Stare At Fridges\u0027.Because that’s where millions of doses of the brilliant Oxford Astra-Zeneca vaccine – which has just posted rave reviews for safety and efficacy in its large-scale US trials – seem destined to remain.More than 1.3 million doses sit in fridges in Germany and a similar number in France, while other EU member states also have hundreds of thousands of doses each stored unused in their chiller cabinets.Our own deputy chief medical officer Jonathan Van Tam last week set out the rather obvious point that “vaccines don’t save lives if they are in fridges, they only save lives if they are in arms”. But that is to overlook the magical thinking of the Commission and major national leaders in the EU.Via multiple stupid or petulant interventions – including Angela Merkel stating she will not have the AZ vaccine herself, Emmanuel Macron falsely branding it “quasi-ineffective” among older people and the suspension of its roll-out in many EU countries, despite contradictory advice from the European Medicines Agency – public confidence in the jab has been shot to pieces.A new poll by YouGov of 8,000 people across seven European countries shows more people now consider the AZ jab unsafe than safe. That includes 55 per cent of Germans and 61 per cent of French people. Trust in the jab has also plunged by around 20 points in Spain and Italy.A less arrogant political elite might detect that now would be a good time to crawl away in shame, but the Commission and its allies in major EU capitals are doing just the opposite. Not only are they demanding that millions more doses of the Oxford-AZ vaccine are delivered to their refrigeration facilities, but they are even proposing to impose a blockade on exports of it from a factory in the Netherlands to the UK, where Brits are snapping it up with alacrity.As we “jab for victory” – posting new record numbers for inoculations on two days running over the weekend – and see Covid cases, hospitalisations and deaths plummet, the EU finds itself in the early stages of a deadly third wave.Now there is dark talk within the Commission of legal patents being ripped up and even of factories being commandeered as once cast-iron property rights upon which advanced economies depend are suddenly rendered insecure.With no apparent awareness of irony given her institution’s tardy approach, Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has declared the war against Covid to be “the crisis of the century” and said no measure against it can be ruled out.The British Government’s response has, so far, been calm and measured. The fact that vital ingredients for the Pfizer vaccine upon which the EU is heavily dependent are manufactured in the UK has been noted. But ministers say that to envisage retaliatory measures on the back of an as yet hypothetical threat to our own supplies would be “unhelpful”.Instead they are gently reminding the EU about the importance of permitting legally-binding contracts to be fulfilled.The preferred typography of the European Union, which sees its own leaders as assured and mature statesmen and British ones as clowns and outlaws, has been turned on its head. It is the European governing class which is flailing and failing, while the British one is smoothly rolling out a triumphant programme of public protection.This is not good for the self-image of the Commission. The finance commissioner, Mairead McGuinness, found it hard to handle yesterday when Andrew Marr confronted her on his programme with the assessment of our own eminent immunologist Professor Sir John Bell about the EU’s approach: “Crackers.”“Frankly, none of us has had a great Covid,” was the best she could come up with, before repeatedly name-checking the threat posed by “the UK variant, which is harder to treat” – as if Britons should feel guilty for exporting death to the EU. In fact our scientists just detected the variant first, because we are better at that kind of stuff too.Our pivoting to a “first doses first” policy has also been vindicated by subsequent data about the high proportion of overall protection conferred by the first dose, leaving EU countries which have generally concentrated on double-dosing a far narrower cohort of people again looking flat-footed by comparison.One question now hangs above all others over the EU’s illogicality: Why are they now apparently determined to implement “Operation Dog In The Manger”, to ensure more Oxford-AZ doses are sent to countries where they won’t be used rather than being shipped as per contract to the UK where they would be?The answer, I fear, is that this is now the only way in which the European Commission can demonstrate an advantage of EU membership to those still in the club. That advantage is that a country can avoid being beaten-up.“Look how big and strong we are, that we can punish an economy and society as powerful as the UK and think what we could do to you were you to follow in their footsteps,” is hardly the most noble exposition of the cause of European political integration.

It describes a loner, an eccentric. It’s an equally fitting description for someone like Christopher Jefferies. The drama is using the term to refer to the Dando case, not to learning difficulties.“We work with numerous police advisers. Line of Duty portrays policing with some of its failings. The officer in question doesn’t work with vulnerable people and hadn’t met the suspect. The ones dealing with the suspect used different, more appropriate language.“I’m not sure if you’re saying no police officer would use that term (some would, and way, way worse) or that TV drama can’t use a term that, for the reasons I’ve explained, just doesn’t have the intended connotation you’ve subjectively attributed.”Mr Gamble continued, saying that usage of the term “was foolish to say the least and shows an utter lack of understanding. If you’re saying the head of professional standards would say that, you need new police advisers.”A spokesperson for the Down’s Syndrome Association said: “The most important part of Line of Duty was that one of the main characters in the drama has Down’s syndrome.Tommy Jessop, who played the part of Terry Boyle, has a very impressive CV and has been recognised by BAFTA for his skills as an actor. To have a main character who has Down’s syndrome in such a primetime programme is fantastic to see.“Some people have contacted us who were concerned about the language used by another character in the drama. The reality is that people who have Down’s syndrome sometimes do experience hurtful language and we all have a responsibility to speak up when we witness this. It’s important that we all continue our efforts for greater inclusion and acceptance.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"heres what can do bristol","story":"NewsopinionHeres what you can doyoure angry about the government, without smashing up BristolRiots lose the argument and make the authorities crack down harder, says Fleet Street Fox.

Most of the police realise that, but the government consists of people who are stupid, and populist, which means giving them a riot is like offering Dreamies to the Downing Street cat. Theyaposll bite your arm right off.Every single person who demonstrated peacefully against the new law, which is aimed at curbing proteststhey raise even a risk of noise disturbance or inconvenience, did a grand job, and it was utterly nullied by the far smaller number of people who went out after dark looking for a fight with the bizzies.  Riots almost always happen after dark, because the people that usually start them tend to be nocturnal, and drunk. Any government can survive them. The main reason the poll tax riots of  led to Margaret Thatcheraposs downfall was because they happened in daylight, and sobriety. Thataposs the sort of anger governments cannot ignore.One of the most terrying things I saw while reporting on riots  was in  when a woman of about  in Trafalgar Square set light to a copy of Margaret Thatcheraposs autobiography as a crowd cheered. The refusal to learn, and the urge to destroy, were precisely Thatcheraposs problem, and that young woman had no idea she was doing exactly the same. Burning books spreads ignorance, and sometimes it doesnapost need to go that far.Thinking, on the other hand, is always instructive. And there are several brilliant, far more effective ways of protesting a government whose policies you despise. . Vote in local elections  In just over  weeks time, every adult over the age of  who isnapost in jail will have the right to select local councillors, city mayors, and perhaps most importantly, Police and Crime Commissioners.Only about half of those who vote in general elections bother to express an opinion in local ones. So this one third of law-abiding adults gets to choose, for all of us, how often the roads are resurfaced, where new houses are built, how often the bins are emptied, and whether your elderly mum gets social care visits in her own home.The PCCs are supposed to be the voice of the people, and hold Chief Constables to account. Soyouaposre angry about what the police have been up to, vote for a dferent PCC, rather than kick a cop car. This is only the third time their roles have been up for election, and it was postponed from last May because of the pandemic. If any elected official feels safe in their job, democracy suffers, so go and shake their tree. Not voting is not an option. . Be more Gandhi  In  Mohandas Gandhi led  people on a -day, -mile march to protest the Salt Tax. It was levied by the British government on any Indian who collected or made salt, and produced % of the Rajaposs tax revenue. Gandhi said salt was vital for le, and with a hand-picked band of supporters walked from village to village, making salt as he went. It sparked copycat peaceful protests across the sub-continent, with many women finding their voices for the first time. Soldiers were ordered to open fire on non-violent protesters, but they refused and were jailed instead. Gandhiaposs simple act of civil disobedience provoked a response that could not be stopped. The government was confused by protesters who would not fight, and had no way to tackle them.  Tank Man did more to show up the Chinese government in Tiananmen Square than any other protester. The Berlin Wall was toppled, eventually, by people armed with garden spades and holding candles. And when the peasants revolted in , sacking the Savoy, burning the Temple and breaking open prisons, Richard II had no qualms - and no problems - having Wat Tyler slaughtered and rioters hanged across half of England.One person, doing one peaceful thing, has more power than any army. And think how flummoxed Pratty Patel would be,just one person told her, calmly, that she was wrong. . Spread the word  You might be angry about the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill. But you have almost certainly not read it, and most people in your family probably have even less of a clue whataposs in it. It not only outlaws a protest by one person with a megaphone on the basis of noise nuisance, but imposes a maximum -year jail sentence for damaging a statue. Whether they would apply that as firmly to an effigy of Emmeline Pankhurst as they would to one of Winston Churchill, who as Home Secretary oversaw violent police crackdowns on suffragettes, no-one yet knows. But it also increases sentences for child murderers, gives more community sentences for less serious crimes, and has measures to tackle sex abusers who work in positions of trust, like teachers or sports coaches. You wonapost win support to kill the bill, when most reasonable people will like bits of it. Which is probably why theyaposve done it.Talk instead about the march from Selma, the Arab Spring, the Womenaposs March, even the pro and anti-Brexit protests. They would all have been illegal under this law, along with suffragettes chaining themselves to railings, or the Jarrow Marchers who just wanted a job.One of the most dystopian clauses is that a person commits a crimethey do not follow rules they have not been told about. Tell people about that, and then ask themthey know what all the rules are.

Mum-of-two Hayley Box, , was headed to Ibiza to commemorate a friend who died on the Spanish party island. Box, who runs a business which gives out beauty treatments plus anti wrinkle injection injections, had been due to arrive in Ibiza to comfort loved ones following the death of a friend from a drug overdose. But she was arrested after she repeatedly tried to board the Ryanair flight having earlier consumed more than a bottle of white wine ahead of her journey. Cabin crew alerted officers after she rebuffed requests to wear her face covering as she boarded the aircraft and also failed to produce her passport - instead sitting in her seat and fastening her seatbelt to await takeoff. She became abusive with officers as she was taken off the plane and escorted to a waiting police van, a court heard. She later claimed she was so drunk she could not remember trying to get on the aircraft. At Manchester Magistrates Court Box who lives in Shnal, near Telford, Shropshire admitted being drunk on a plane and was fined £. The incident occurred on September  last year after Box checked into the Clayton Hotel at Manchester Airport having dropping her children with a babysitter. She then began drinking wine in her room ahead of her getting on board flight FR. Prosecutor Rachel Dixon said: aposaposHer flight was due to depart shortly after am. She boarded the plane. She was approached by the cabin manager. The cabin manager asked her to put on her face mask, but the defendant was non-compliant.  aposaposThe cabin manager said the defendant was slow to respond and hear the instructions. The defendant was also asked several times for her passport but she did not comply with these requests. aposaposThe cabin manager then made the decision to remove her from the plane and he asked her to leave. She did not comply and he told her that she could leave voluntarily or leave with the police. She then decided to fasten her seatbelt and the police were contacted. aposaposAs the police arrived, the defendant stood up and became quite aggressive.  She started crying, claiming that her friend had died and that she needed to go to Ibiza. As the police started climbing the steps, she removed herself. aposaposBut then the defendant then tried toto the plane, and they took her off again. She was abusive towards officers. They took her to a terminal building in order to be put into a police van but when she was approaching the van, she was abusive again. She was swearing at the officers. When she got to the van, she pushed away. Once inside, she was subdued. The prosecutor continued: “In the interview, she said she had consumed a bottle of wine during the early hours of the day. She said she had gone to bed at am and slept for one hour.  She had then consumed a large glass of wine at the airport. She didn’t remember boarding the plane. aposaposShe said she had no recollection of the incident at all. She has no recollection of the conversation with the cabin manager or departing with the police. She said her actions resulted from a lack of sleep, eating no food and consuming wine too quickly. It was quite a prolonged incident.aposapos In mitigation for Box, defence lawyer Jane Shaw said: aposaposShe is mortied and ashamed by the fact that she is in court today. She explains that she lost a friend in Ibiza to an overdose in August  and the reason for her going to Ibiza was to console her friends. aposaposShe was very, very raw and had not expected the death of her close friend. She stayed overnight at the Clayton Hotel and drank a bottle of wine.

Kelly Powney, , and husband Nathan, , from Herefordshire, first purchased their home in July  for £,. The house had dated furnishings and was in desperate need of an update, a challenge the Powneyaposs were more than up for. The property features three double bedrooms, one bathroom, one downstairs toilet, a living room and an open plan kitchen-diner. The couple have spent £, on renovations over the last five years, half of which was spent on a costly bathroom makeover. Nathan, a graphic designer, and Kelly, an administrator, kept costs low by doing all the work themselves, with no professional support from builders or plumbers. They also scoured the web for second-hand and upcycling goods where possible and had no professional help. They gave the kitchen a refresh by changing the layout - removing a breakfast bar to leave space for an open plan kitchen-diner - painting the kitchen cupboards with a £ can of paint, and using leftover countertops that they got for free from Nathanaposs parents.Kelly also bought a range cooker from Facebook Marketplace for £ and a sink from eBay for £.She estimates the couple saved around £, by not investing in a completely new kitchen. Some rooms required extensive renovation, while the rest of the house needed a lick of paint and a drastic change in d cor. Luckily, the bedrooms were in decent shape and didnapost require much work, barring fresh carpets and paint. They had the house revalued recently and were told it is now worth £, more than they originally paid for it.  Every room has been completely changed since we moved in, Kelly said. I love the house now and am really happy with it - it turned out better than we could ever have imagined. Weaposve finally settled on a style we both love. We managed to keep the costs down with the kitchen, which would have probably cost around £,. We had a horrible breakfast bar that cut the kitchen and dining room in half, so we pushed this back to go on the wall, which opened up the space.

Worried, he told his mum and together with a neighbour they broke into the property - finding the severely dehydrated woman lying inside with a serious wound to her leg. Thanks to his intervention, she is now recovering in hospital. Liam, who one day hopes to be a paramedic or policeman, said: When I was on my paper round before school I got to the door and saw that the papers from the last three days were stacked up on her doormat. I didnapost really think anything of it but after school I asked mumwe could check. We asked her neighbours for help and then went round the back of the house and knocked on the window. At first we had no response but then there was a voice that shouted they couldnapost get off the floor. Liam dialled  and asked for an ambulance while his mum, Katie, and the neighbours broke down the back door. He added: At first we couldnapost see where she was but after going inside we saw her laying down in the corner.  It looked like sheaposd fallen over, she had a big cut on her leg and although I couldnapost see any other injuries she had a pressure sore on her back because sheaposd been laying down at an angle for a couple of days. Liam, who had been delivering papers to the woman on a daily basis since , said the last time he spoke to her was just before Christmas when she gave him a tip as a gt. He said: The elderly lady said it hadnapost been night time while she had been on the floor which I thought was strange, but, she was probably confused and dehydrated.

With thick layers of black mould and water dripping through the ceiling, residents in the -floor building in Croydon, South London, say they feel they are not even human. Both the chief executive of housing charity Shelter and a former head of the UK Health and Safety Executive have said they have never seen worse living conditions.Fransoy Hewitt, who lives on the ground floor of the Croydon Council-owned in South Norwood, told ITV News the way she has been treated makes me feel like I am not even human.She said: Iaposm not coping. There is only so much I can get angry about and pull my hair out - I just feel like Iaposm going to kill myselfI continue like that. The mum-of-two said floors are soaking wet, and sheaposs had to unplug the fridge to prevent electrocution after mould took over the kitchen. Do you live in similar housing misery  Email webnews@mirror On top of that she has no light in the bathroom, her sofa has been destroyed along with many of her childrenaposs shoes and toys. As a result, the family-of-three are forced to cook, eat, play and sleep in just one room, despite contacting the council at least  times.Fransoy believes the mould and damp in the flat is making her whole family sick, as she suffers constant headaches and has to put vapour rub on her youngest sonaposs chest to help him breathe at night.Leroy McNally, who lives on the floor above, said he has been forced to put buckets in the living room to collect dripping water, telling ITV: Every night I go to bed at twelve, and I wake up at am to empty the buckets.  One man, who didnapost want to be identied, said the dripping in his home got so bad in his flat that he had to sleep in a tent in his living room. Dame Judith Hackitt, former Chair of the UK Health and Safety Executive, said the flats were the worst housing conditions she had ever seen. Dame Judith - who led the government’s independent inquiry into building safety and regulation following the Grenfell Tower fire - said: When I talked to residents in the wake of Grenfell, when I talked to residents in other tower blocks as part of my review, one of the common complaints from residents was aposnobody listens to us - we express our concerns and nobody acts on it. That, Iaposm afraid, is typical. That is one of the fundamental cultural issues weaposve got to get over - where someone actually feels responsible and takes responsibility for fixing things. Polly Neate, chief executive of housing charity Shelter, said: “This is really bad. It’s definitely the worst Iaposve seen, just in terms of the sheer unlivability of it. I mean, there really isnapost any possible way, that those properties are fit for human habitation. “Can you even imagine having to live like that... in lockdown  There’s absolutely no excuse for it at all.” And Jeff Charlton, an independent environmental hygienist, said: “This is the kind of property I would expect to see in a run-down area in the s. It’s hard to believe this is Britain in .  In a statement Croydon Council admitted conditions were not acceptable. It said: “We were very concerned to learn of these issues at these properties, and the photographs we have seen show conditions that are clearly not acceptable.

He used to send her birthday cards calling her his little princess, which she always thought was weird as she didnapost know him. But as she grew up she discovered more about the case, and learnt that her dadaposs brother, Robert Maudsley, is actually Britain’s most notorious serial killer. He has been in solitary confinement in a glass cell since , making him Britainaposs longest serving prisoner, having been caged for  years for the murder of four men in the s. Maudsley was locked up for the murder of John Farrell, age , in March . Whilst serving a le sentence, he then embarked on a sickening wave of vigilante violence murdering three men, earning himself the nickname aposHannibal the Cannibalapos. He killed David Francis, a convicted child molester, Salney Darwood, who was serving le for the manslaughter of his we Blanche and William Roberts, who was serving seven years for sexual assault of a seven-year-old girl. And his niece Claire, from Liverpool, believes the connection to her sick uncle has ruined her love le as sheaposs had a succession of boyfriends attracted to evil. The -year-old thinks she attracts the wrong sort of partner and says their fascination with her murderous uncle has led to a long line of dficult and abusive relationships. Sheaposs spoken out now after her obsessed ex-boyfriend, Ronnie Whitby, was sentenced to  months in prison for a sickening assault in a hotel room.  He accused her of sleeping with other guests at the hotel and battered her in a booze filled rage leaving her with a broken jaw and two black eyes. Terried Claire told how her jealous ex, who had previously forced her to have his own name tattooed on her private parts, held her in the locked hotel room fearing for her le. But she eventually managed to persuade Whitby to let her go to a shop at Lime Street Station in Liverpool city centre, where she locked herself in a toilet before running off and alerting police. Claire said: “I just seem to attract the worst sort of psychos. I often wonderit is something to do with my Uncle Bob. “Ronnie Whitby seemed genuinely interested in my uncle’s case, at first. After what’s happened, I realise he was a sicko, attracted to violence and crime.”  Known as aposHannibal the Cannibal,apos Robert Maudsley, who was born and grew up in Liverpool, was alleged to have eaten part of the brain of one of his victims in prison, earning himself a reputation as one of Britainaposs most dangerous criminals. Claire said: “When I mention my uncle it seems to get people going. It seems Ronnie Whitby was no dferent. “Bob is my dad Billy’s older brother. Growing up, I knew he was in prison, but I didn’t know what for. It was over the years as people began to ask me about him that it dawned on me what he was and what happened. “I was told my Nan Jean and Grandad George, never treated him the same as the rest of their  kids. He was dferent.  “Bob was always in scrapes and was a real wild character. “He ran off to London and became tangled up in male prostitution. It was then that he murdered his first victim, John Farrell. “I must admit I became fascinated with Uncle Bob, myself, who wouldn’t be  It’s not everyone who has a serial killer in the family.” Claire told how she learned the full truth about Maudsley as the internet came into everyday use. She added: “I was gobsmacked when I read the details about him. “My dad would always say that the stories about Bob were exaggerated. But eventhey were, the facts are he was a rent boy who murdered a man in London then killed three others whilst in prison and has been solitary confinement since .  “I was two years old when he was placed into solitary. He hasn’t had proper human contact for the whole of my le. “When I was little, he used to send me birthday cards and he called me his ‘Little Princess’. I thought was odd that this man I’d never met and didn’t know would think of me as princess.” Claire told how the shadow of her serial killer uncle has hovered over her and it seemed to draw in Whitby, who she met in . “Ronnie Whitby was nice when I first met him. Really kind and with a great sense of humour,” she explains. “He was very much a social justice warrior and hated any sort of prejudice. I thought he was dferent.  “We had a lot of laughs together and he really seemed to care. But then he started getting jealous. He stopped me from seeing my friends and controlled everything that I did. “He even made me have his name tattooed on my private parts. He said he owned me. “When we went out, I had to look at the ground so that other men didn’t see me. I was starting to think of a way out of the relationship. “But then he booked a hotel room. I thought we were going to have a few nights out and some fun. But as soon as we got there, he locked the door and refused to let me leave. “He had a wild look in his eyes, and I got really scared. I thought he was going to kill me.”  Liverpool Crown Court heard how Whitby went on the run and wasnapost arrested until over a month later. Whitby failed to attend court in December and a warrant was made for his arrest, before he was caught in the Midlands in January. He appeared in court in February this year via video link from HMP Preston after admitting assault causing actual bodily harm and failing to surrender. The court heard Whitby has convictions dating back to , including robbery and assault when he was a juvenile. He was sent to a young offenders institution for assault causing actual bodily harm in  and convicted of assaults in  and .  Whitby was convicted of harassment and battery both in  and again in , including an attack on an ex-partner. In June  he was jailed for affray, after he hurled eggs and water bottles at neo-Nazis hiding in Liverpool Lime Street Stationaposs left luggage room during a aposWhite Man Marchapos. The court heard he was also convicted of two counts of battery in June , which were also against Miss Mawdsley. Cheryl Mottram, defending, said Whitby accepted he would be sent to prison and his behaviour to his victim was completely unacceptable. She said: As your honour may have anticipated alcohol played its part in relation to this particular offence, that combined with the defendantaposs mental health dficulties and the toxicity of the relationship that he had with Miss Mawdsley all played its role.  Ms Mottram said afterwards Whitby tried to put some distance between himself and Miss Mawdsleyaposapos, moved to Coventry and got a job as a handyman. She said: He has struggled for many years with his mental health, He has paranoid schizophrenia, he suffers with ADHD and PTSD, brought on by witnessing his fatheraposs murder some years ago. Ms Mottram said her client also had heart problems, requiring medication, which had made his time in custody dficult especially during the pandemic. Judge Robert Trevor-Jones said Whitby and Miss Mawdsley had been staying in the hotel for some time when he launched the sustained assault. He said: It seems the motivation for the assault was that you in drink suspected her of having seen some other man, itaposs understood within the hotel.

Add Iran and North Korea and the UK and its allies are clearly hurtling towards a possible confrontation. The UK needs a military strong enough to stop war happening, whilst being strong enough to fight oneneeded. And all the time there is the constant background threat of terrorism exported from abroad or home-grown which may require a very swt military response in the coming years. Clearly something had to be done to make the military agile enough to cope with complex and multiple missions to smash the dangers facing the country.What do you think of the new plans  Let us know in the comments belowAs the defence secretary makes clear, war is no longer a binary state where it is declared and then fought to conclusion. Aggressive countries are already acting just under the threshold of open war, launching cyber attacks, stealing research, spreading misinformation, constantly testing the UKaposs defences. The Russian ambassador to Britain admitted over the weekend Moscowaposs relationship with London is almost “dead,” meaning diplomatic solutions to future flashpoints may be impossible. What is needed is a military system that is capable of constantly leveraging against foreign threats, whilst at high-readiness to escalate to war-fightingneeded.  And enemy states have to be aware of the ultimate deterrent – the UKaposs ability and political will to act this out. Todayaposs announcement marks the biggest shake-up of the British military system since the Cold War, with a massive boost in the use of technology and less “boots on the ground.” Defence chiefs hope that its so-called “leaner and meaner” three services, with the Army bearing the brunt of the cuts in terms of numbers, will be able to combat these problems. Experts have been warning for weeks that new technology cannot replace “mass” as troops are always needed on the ground to be seen and fight on Britainaposs behalf.

In tonight’s hour-long BBC Panorama special ‘Covid: Who Got it Right ’ reporter Jane Corbin investigates the policies pursued by governments around the world and tries to discover whether anyone got it right, and what lessons might be learned for the future. South Korean Prime Minister, Chung Sye-kyun, told BBC Panorama : “It might be possible to see it [Britain] as not successful. Perhaps early on, they underestimated Covid-. The Korean government took proactive actions, they put a lot of effort in earning people’s trust, so that people can trust the government and fully participate in these measures.” In February , Professor Dale Fisher, an expert in infectious diseases and Chair of the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Networkwas part of a team of experts sent to the epicentre of the outbreak, in Wuhan, China, by the World Health Organisation. Professor Fisher told Panorama that countries in the Far East had respected the virus from the start, were prepared and acted quickly. They had had two outbreaks of similar viruses in the recent past, SARSand MERSand had learnt valuable lessons from them.  He said: “The countries by and large on this side of the world were acting quickly, were building their surge capacity for large numbers of cases, how they would communicate, how they would develop their laboratories, how they would establish the contact tracing teams to be able to scale that up. So this is how countries should have been preparing, getting ready and then responding.” In contrast, speaking about Europe’s reaction to the outbreak, Dale Fisher told Panorama “they simply didn’t have a concept of the enormity of the problem that was coming. He continued: Even when Italy was involved early, it was like every country had to experience the problem before they would believe how big the problem was.” The Mirroraposs newsletter brings you the latest news, exciting showbiz and TV stories, sport updates and essential political information.The newsletter is emailed out first thing every morning, at noon and every evening. Never miss a moment by signing up to our newsletter here.  Germany has a federal system of government. In the town of Tubingen, it is Mayor Boris Palmer who has made many of the major decisions about protecting people from the impact and spread of Covid-. Speaking to Panorama, the Mayor said he believes responding quickly at a local level was effective in preventing the spread in his town. Whilst cases quadrupled in Germany during the second wave last autumn, there were fewer cases in Tubingen than during last Spring. When asked by Panorama about what he thought about the death rate in Britain, Mayor Boris Palmer said: “From the perspective I have here, I suggest that it is a problem to be late in a pandemic. So,you respond and react in an early stage, you have much better effects, and it seems that UK has often reacted late.”  Panorama also spoke to Dr Anders Tegnell of Sweden’s public health agency, who was seen as one of the architects of the country’s Covid- response. While many other European countries were under strict lockdowns, the law in Sweden which protects people’s freedom of movement meant there was advice – not strict rules. Schools, cafes and restaurants remained open and groups of up to  were allowed – with social distancing. Free from harsh restrictions, the virus spread, and it was the elderly living in care homes who were most vulnerable. Almost half of Sweden’s Covid- deaths have been in care homes.  Asked by Panoramahe had any regrets in the way he had run the policy in Sweden, Dr Anders Tegnell told the team: “Of course, we can all improve. It’s true for Sweden, it’s true for all countries. We are learning as we are going.” Panorama also asked Dr Anders Tegnell whether he had expected a second wave, during which deaths doubled in Sweden and hospitals struggled to cope. He said: “No, we did not really expect it at this level. I mean, we did dferent scenarios, but we really thought that it was going to develop like it did in many countries in the beginning with a number of huge clusters, um, spreading and that we will deal with those clusters.” "},{"url":null,"title":"owners eccentric decorating home sale","story":"NewsOwners eccentric decorating in home for sale is bringing people instant joyA \"colourful\" six-bedroom home that has gone on the market in St. Louis, US, features a rather unique interior - and people loved the vibrant look when the listing was shared on social mediamirrorShareCommentsByLuke MatthewsSenior Audience Writer:,  MAR NewsIts on sale for more than £.m \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Details of many of them are set to be released in a report by Pentagon bosses in June, he said. Ratclfe told Fox News: There are a lot more sightings than have been made public. Some of those have been declassied. And when we talk about sightings, we are talking about objects that have seen by Navy or Air Force pilots, or have been picked up by satellite imagery that frankly engage in actions that are dficult to explain. Movements that are hard to replicate that we donapost have the technology for. Or traveling at speeds that exceed the sound barrier without a sonic boom. And he continued in an interview with host Maria Bartiromo: When we talk about sightings, the other thing I will tell you is, itaposs not just a pilot or just a satellite, or some intelligence collection. Usually we have multiple sensors that are picking up these things, and some of these are unexplained phenomenon, and there is actually quite a few more than have been made public.  The aposX Filesapos report will be released under the Senate Intelligence Committeeaposs Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year . This will include a section addressing unidentied aerial phenomena - and will be required to highlight threats, and whether they are linked to foreign adversaries.

Now imagine the reason youaposre getting a hard time is that no one wants to work on Sunday - following a long hard week, during a global pandemic no less.In an ill-advised group message shared on Twitter, one boss appeared to do exactly that.One woman shared the message and explained: My boss put a message in my workgroup chat askinganyone could cover a full day sht tomorrow - when all the staff said they couldn’t she replied with this. Just a small example of how Covid is being used to justy poor working practices. The text said: Not quite sure what everyone is doing tomorrow when we are still in lockdown !  Thank you for the offer. Clearly, the fact that the staff might need some time to de-stress or relax, or even have a number of legitimate tasks to do didnapost occur to the boss. And as the government website states, some workers in certain industries donapost actually have to work on Sundays - and can opt-outthey so choose.Crucially, a person can’t be made to work on Sundays unless they agreed on it with their employer and it was put in writing - check out more here.The message sparked a discussion on Twitter, with lots of people outraged by the bosses demands.

As many of us have spent a lot more time at home since March last year, neighbourly relationships have become more important. You may have become best buddies or hoped theyaposll move out after they once again start an impromptu karaoke sesh on a Saturday night. In some cases, your neighbour might not be aware that you can hear everything theyaposre doing . One woman was left in stitches after she received a brilliant response from her neighbour after she requested they tone it down. The woman shared the exchange on TikTok in a viral video that has been viewed more than , times. In it, she explained that sheaposd been hearing noises from her neighbouraposs bedroom for the last four days before deciding to take action. Her note said: Hey, I would greatly appreciate ityou guys would separate Yianaposs bed from the wall. Itaposs becoming an everyday thing and itaposs very hard for me to sleep with that noise, thx, your neighbour xx.  And just in case she hadnapost made it clear, she claried: Noise  moaning, hitting and banging bed to the wall. Thanks hehe. Luckily, the recipient had a good sense of humour and happily took it in their stride. They sent back a card with a  dollar gt card for Starbucks - presumably to help the neighbour after a rough nightaposs sleep.

Eventhings are going against you the attitude still needs to be there.“I can never question the players for work-rate and attitude and I was proud of them because they had something about them.“It should be a given – competing from the word go. Most games we do. But sometimes we have a knock and something goes against us and we go under.“But Alloa are a good team. At times they had chances but that team in previous weeks might have buckled.“They have a lot about them and I am pleased for them.”Big questions were raised over McPake’s future at the club and their chances of winning promotion through the playoffs after the loss to Ayr.However, the Dundee boss points to the performance at the Indodrill as proof there is enough at Dens Park to get the job done.“There is enough spirit and more than enough quality,” he added.“There is never a question about that. It doesn’t get much harder than coming here and I really mean that.“Alloa make it hard and Peter Grant has them playing well. But we stood tall and won the game and deserved the win.“The last time we were here we were behind and Charlie Adam pulled us out a hole.“I’ll have a better sleep than I had after the Ayr game, that’s for sure. I have barely slept since Tuesday night.“I am delighted with the win. It puts those around us under pressure.“It is all in our hands but we need consistency and belief and that kind of performance.”A Dundee ‘miracle’ #  years since Bob Shankly#s Dark Blues roared to the European Cup semi-final\" title\"#A Dundee ‘miracle’ #  years since Bob Shankly#s Dark Blues roared to the European Cup semi-final# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp a-dundee-miracle--years-since-bob-shanklys-dark-blues-roared-to-the-european-cup-semi-final embed # secretTUoCmE\" data-secret\"TUoCmE\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\" vw, px\"  Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/syndicatenews/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/03/20083855-575x372.jpg ","title":"dundee defender lee ashcroft jokes charlie adam short corner left him raging as he chased hat trick at alloa","story":".dct-cta@-webkit-keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate@keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate.dct-cta__title.dct-cta__content p.dct-cta__content p:not.dct-cta__content p:last-child.dct-cta__label.dct-cta__input.dct-cta__input::-webkit-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::-moz-placeholder.dct-cta__input:-ms-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::placeholder.dct-cta__label:hover.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__label:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__input:hover,.dct-cta__input:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__btn .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn.dct-cta__btn:disabled.dct-cta__btn:not.dct-cta__btn:not:hover.dct-cta__btn:not:hover,.dct-cta__btn:not:focus.dct-cta__btn-text.dct-cta__btn:before .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn-loadingborder-top:px solid #fffborder-radius:%width:pxheight:pxbox-sizing:border-box-webkit-animation:dctSpinner .s linear infiniteanimation:dctSpinner .s linear infinite.dct-cta--signup.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--signup__dialogs.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--success.dct-cta--signup__dialog--error.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__grid.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and @media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap+.dct-cta__content@supports or.dct-cta__flex:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--js-active.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and @supports or.dct-cta__grid:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label,.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__gridgrid-template-columns:fr minmaxgrid-gap:.rem .remDundee defender Lee Ashcroft joked he was “raging” with Charlie Adam for denying him the chance to grab a hat-trick in Friday’s - win over Alloa.The Dark Blues skipper chose to play short to Paul McMullan rather than send an nd-minute corner into the area.That was much to the annoyance of Ashcroft, who had dominated the home defence from a number of corner kicks and had two headed goals to his name already.However, the -year-old admits he was more than happy to settle for just the brace as well as a clean sheet in Clackmannanshire.After scoring his first two league goals for the club, Ashcroft said: “I was raging at the end when Charlie never put the ball in for me because with the confidence up I felt that I could have got a hat-trick!“But I’m delighted with the two goals and a clean sheet is massive for us.“I had a chance earlier on in the game and it was probably the easiest of them all.“It felt good to get one after that and put it right. I was frustrated because I’ve missed a few this season so it was good to get a couple.“After Tuesday we knew we had to start the game well. Alloa came into it so I felt we got the goal just before half-time at the right time.“It was good to be able to go and get the Ayr defeat out of our system right away.“To go to Alloa with a bit of pressure on us, it’s a good feeling to come away with the win.”The victory was Dundee’s third in their last five games. Since beating Inverness at the start of the month, the Dark Blues have gone win, loss, win, loss, win – a pattern Ashcroft says they have to get out of quickly.After results over the weekend, they sit level with both Dunfermline and Raith Rovers on  points.With seven matches to go – and a trip to Ashcroft’s former club next at East End Park – it’s now or never for James McPake’s side.“We know ourselves we need to be a bit more consistent,” Ashcroft added.“We seem to win one, lose win and we know that we need to be better than that.“There are a lot of big games coming up against the teams round about us – Dunfermline and Raith Rovers – and it really is seven massive games for us between now and the end of the season.“We need to win themwe want to try and get that second spot.”Dundee boss James McPake hails attitude of Dark Blues players after -

I#ve got some competition in my position so I just want to try and fight to get back into the team.#I#d like to just try and get back in the team and finish off that successful, but frustrating, season.#Despite not needing surgery for his injury, Chalmers admits that he was frustrated during his spell injured.#It was tough three and a bit months,” he conceded.“Especially the time that it came, it wasn#t really ideal with the way I was playing in and around the team, but it#s part of football and I just have to get over it.#I went to see a few specialists across Scotland and just hearing someone at the top like that explaining that it#s normal for you to still be this sore and it will be normal soon, you just have to keep doing what you#re doing.#The most frustrating thing at the time was the fact that I didn#t know how long it was going to be until I got a scan.#I#m the kind of player that wants to push too much and I didn#t like being out of the side for too long.“It was frustrating but I#m just happy to be back now.”Aberdeen#s visit to Tannadice on Saturday is United#s final game before the split, with a poor run of form between late December and early February meaning they will almost certainly be in the bottom six.United will need to defeat Aberdeen and hope that St. Mirren lose against Hamilton, along with an eight goal swing, to have any chance of playing top six football. They will also have to rely on St. Johnstone not picking up three points against Ross County.#We know now that top six probably can#t happen but we just have to make sure that we take each game and try and finish the season as strongly as we can for building up going into next season,” said Chalmers. vw, px\"  Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/syndicatenews/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/03/20-May-Scottish-Ensemble-Classical-Series-no-1-846x564.jpg ","title":"perth festival online arts","story":".dct-cta@-webkit-keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate@keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate.dct-cta__title.dct-cta__content p.dct-cta__content p:not.dct-cta__content p:last-child.dct-cta__label.dct-cta__input.dct-cta__input::-webkit-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::-moz-placeholder.dct-cta__input:-ms-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::placeholder.dct-cta__label:hover.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__label:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__input:hover,.dct-cta__input:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__btn .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn.dct-cta__btn:disabled.dct-cta__btn:not.dct-cta__btn:not:hover.dct-cta__btn:not:hover,.dct-cta__btn:not:focus.dct-cta__btn-text.dct-cta__btn:before .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn-loadingborder-top:px solid #fffborder-radius:%width:pxheight:pxbox-sizing:border-box-webkit-animation:dctSpinner .s linear infiniteanimation:dctSpinner .s linear infinite.dct-cta--signup.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--signup__dialogs.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--success.dct-cta--signup__dialog--error.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__grid.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and @media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap+.dct-cta__content@supports or.dct-cta__flex:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--js-active.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and @supports or.dct-cta__grid:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label,.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__gridgrid-template-columns:fr minmaxgrid-gap:.rem .remPerth Festival of the Arts will stay online for , with an addition to the -day event that could see popcorn sales soar in the area.In what should have been the year when Perth welcomed visitors to the city for the festival’s th anniversary celebrations, the programme will be once again broadcast online.Between Thursday May , and Monday May , venues including the Concert Hall and Theatre, Perth Museum  Art Gallery, and The Byre at Inchyra will stage performances.With a strong classical theme there are concerts from the Scottish Ensemble, The Sixteen , and The Gesualdo Six.The Sitkovetsky-Trio, pianist Isata Kanneh-Mason, and saxophonist Manu Brazo are also on the bill.There will also be jazz, folk, literature, drama, and exclusive artist QAs and interviews.The full programme is now online, with tickets on sale on Monday April .Festival Chairman David Brand said: “We are excited to be preparing for as full a festival as ever and working creatively to make the online experience special and unique to Perth.“We’re looking forward to opening the doors to the city’s fantastic cultural venues and hope that audiences will enjoy the new arts experiences and online connections that the festival will offer.”Organisers have made a major addition to this year’s programme # a Festival Drive-in Cinema in the grounds of Scone Palace.The m screen will show eight movies over three days from Friday May  to Sunday, May .There are family-friendly favourites such as Back to the Future, Frozen, The Lion King, and the original Star Wars movie.

drive forward its plans for a new outdoor exhibition after the proposals were approved.Aberdeenshire Council have backed Grampian Transport Museum’s blueprints for a display looking at a recently acquired hydrogen bus from Aberdeen.The popular Alford attraction applied for permission for the scheme last month with drawings showing that the bus would be surrounded by a covered walkway.Grampian Transport Museum also launched an online crowdfunder to secure the cash for the project and they managed to reach their £, target.A report by Aberdeenshire Council said: “The remaining part of the proposal relates to the hydrogen bus exhibit and its associated walkway and covered viewing area.“This will add to and expand the existing tourist offering on site, which is generally welcomed.“The siting of all parts is very much contained within the outdoor space associated with the museum, and is in a discreet location in terms of wider landscape or adjacent locations visibility.“The applicant noted on their form that the exhibit was to be a temporary installation, however in planning terms the scale, siting and design of the walkway, covered area and the exhibit itself pose no concern.“The overall proposal is therefore considered to fully comply with the relevant policies of the Aberdeenshire Local Development Plan  and the application is recommended for approval.”Earlier this year Grampian Transport Museum curator Mike Ward said the Covid- pandemic has made bosses at the attraction realise they should make better use of the space surrounding the museum.He said: “This whole thing has been caused by Covid-. One of the positive things to come out of the crisis is we learned we are not making the full use of our -acre site.“We have all this outdoor space that never used while other museums were able to use their outdoor areas.“So we decided to move the museum out and nudge it in the direction of a more outdoor museum.“We are determined to improve the visitor experience.“The first outdoor exhibition will be one of the hydrogen buses from Aberdeen City Council.“We want to have a video theatre telling its story and the bus will sit outside. But we want to make sure visitors have good access to it with a new entrance which will be covered.”North-east museum launches crowdfunding bid for new outdoor space\" title\"#North-east museum launches crowdfunding bid for new outdoor space# #

from planning the session, to printing and delivering their wall portraits or albums.#And of course everything in between including advice on how to prepare for the session, what to wear, guidance during the session, professional editing of the images, and more.#The dferent genres of photography I offer clients help them in many ways.#Personal brand photography helps business owners and entrepreneurs be more visible online and stand out from the crowd, with beautul on-brand images that show their personality and tell their brand story.#Wedding photography # my tag line for wedding photography is # capturing moments from today, creating memories for a letime# # and that sums it up really well.#I love creating beautul images, capturing emotions and all the little moments and details so that my couples can relive their special day again and again.#And last but not least, dog and equine photography # I love getting to know my animal clients, getting cuddles from them, and at the same time capturing their personality and character in beautul images for their owners.#And providing them with a choice of stunning wall portraits and albums to show off their animal in their home.#The outbreak of coronavirus left Iska contemplating which direction to take her business in order to survive. She decided collaborations were the way forward.#I’ll start with Colour and Image,# Iska said. #This is a collaboration between myself and The Image Whisperer, Rosee Elliott, who is based in Banchory.#Colour and Image is all about helping business owners make a lasting impression through photographs, without the need for words.#Our clients start their experience with a colour and style consultation with Rosee at her studio in Banchory # once we are allowed to do so again. Once they have a chance to put Rosee’s advice into practice, they will then have a strategy call with myself at which we plan their personal brand photo session.#We will then arrange a date and time with our makeup artist followed by the photo session with me.#My other project is called the Aberdeen Pet Collective. This is a Facebook group for businesses in the pet industry # such as dog groomers, walkers and trainers # in our local area.#We have many dferent networking groups in our area, but none of them seem to have any pet-related businesses in them. So I thought it’d be a great idea to start a networking group solely for Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire pet businesses.#It is a place to ask for advice, share ideas, bounce ideas off each other, make new friends in the industry and form collaborations. Essentially, it will involve finding a new kind of community spirit in our local pet industry.#Iska says that there has been a great deal of interest in both projects. She added: #I am happy to say that both have been very successful.#Colour and Image was officially launched early February  # although we can’t actually start working with clients yet, the interest in our new personal brand package has been amazing.#We already have two clients booked on and are just waiting for lockdown restrictions to lt before we can get hands-on with them.#I started the Aberdeen Pet Collective in the third quarter last year. We now have over  members.#It’s a very supportive group, all about community and helping each other. Being self-employed can be a lonely place at times, so having the group is giving businesses in the local pet industry another like-minded business owner to speak to and shows us all that we are not alone.#Speaking for myself, I can say that I’ve made new friends in the industry through the group and am looking forward to seeing where it takes us.# vw, px\"  Due to the success of her collaborations, the photographer is thankful for those that are backing the drive to support local during the pandemic.This is something that Aberdeen  Grampian Chamber of Commerce#s North East Now campaign # supported by creative agency Hampton and Aberdeen Journals # is encouraging people to do.Speaking on the initiative, Iska says she #loves the way North East Now is shining a spotlight on local businesses and their stories#.#Since I just launched a new service offering in collaboration with another local business, I thought it might be interesting for the campaign#s readers, but also great publicity for our new collaboration.#The website looks great and I think it’s definitely a welcome addition to the local area, especially as it links through to other websites that support local businesses.#It’s very clearly laid out and easy to navigate # and I love the shopping list!#With regards to my business# future, I#m looking forward to helping other business owners and entrepreneurs be more visible online, attract their ideal clients and standing out from the crowd, with images that they love and tell their story.#Going into spring once lockdown lts, I can#t wait to get back to photographing more dogs and horses.

#confident# of winning a no confidence vote in the Scottish Parliament on Tuesday, after an independent inquiry found she had not breached the ministerial code.Nicola Sturgeon told the BBC #some pretty grim allegations# have been levelled at her over the past few months in relation to the Alex Salmond inquiry, which #had not been easy and had been dficult to contend with#.Her remarks follow the release of a long-anticipated report by Ireland#s former director of public prosecutions, James Hamilton, which found that Nicola Sturgeon did not breach the ministerial code of conduct.The independent inquiry findings come just one day before the publication of a Holyrood inquiry report on the government#s handling of the harassment complaints.The first minister said: #I#ve made peace with my own conscience on all of these matters and I have been very clear in my mind that I acted appropriately and did not breach the ministerial code.#It#s important to the Scottish people that they have independent verication and adjudication of that and that is what they now have.##I believe I acted appropriately in a dficult situation.#Ms Sturgeon referred herself to the independent adviser on the ministerial code following Mr Salmond#s successful legal challenge of the Scottish Government#s unlawful investigation, which led to him winning more than £, in court.Speaking following the release of Mr Hamilton#s ruling, she said she #looks forward# to the publication on Tuesday of the report from the parliamentary committee into the Scottish Government#s handling of complaints about Mr Salmond.Ms Sturgeon said: #But I cannot escape the conclusion that there are some members of that committee # because their public utterances show this # that decided before a single word of evidence has been taken that I was guilty of something and nothing was going to remove them from that view.#She added she was #confident# of winning a no confidence vote in her leadership due to be held in the Scottish Parliament on Tuesday.She said: #Let#s remember here the Tories said they would have a vote of no confidence in me before I#d uttered a single word of evidence before the parliamentary inquiry.#They have decided this issue a long time ago so that#s a political stunt being brought forward by the Tories.#Mr Hamilton#s -page report considered four key allegations against Ms Sturgeon including that she had breached the code by failing to record her meetings and telephone calls with Mr Salmond and others on March , April  and , June  and  and July .It was also alleged Ms Sturgeon misled the Scottish Parliament relating to these meetings.However, Mr Hamilton said the first minister#s failure to disclose the March  meeting with Mr Salmond#s former chief of staff, Geoff Aberdein, was the #result of a genuine failure of recollection and was not deliberate#.In accepting the first minister#s account, the qualied barrister said he found it #dficult to think of any convincing reason whyshehad in fact recalled the meeting she would have deliberately concealed it while disclosing all the conversations she had had with Mr Salmond#.Mr Hamilton also probed allegations the first minister may have tried to influence the conduct of the investigation overseen by the top civil servant, Leslie Evans, into harassment allegations against Mr Salmond.The report#s author said #such a unilateral move# would #undoubtedly have been seen as a partisan and political interference in a process which was then under way#.Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross insisted he could not agree with Mr Hamilton#s assessment.The Conservative MP said: #The First Minister has been given a pass because it has been judged her ‘failure of recollection’ was ‘not deliberate’.“I respect Mr Hamilton and his judgment but we cannot agree with that assessment.“Nicola Sturgeon did not suddenly turn forgetful.”He added: #As James Hamilton says, it is up to the Scottish Parliament to decidethe First Minister has been misleading.#For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. vw, px\"

believe they can finish third this season – despite falling further behind Hibs.The Dons lost - to Dundee United at Tannadice on Saturday with Hibs’ - draw at Livingston taking them seven points clear in third place.Having won just once in their last  matches and with only five Premiership fixtures left, it appears unlikely the Reds will be able to secure a top three finish.But, despite their poor form, Pittodrie veteran Considine insists the players still believe they can overhaul Hibs.The defender, , said: #It#s going to be very hard to finish third now, but anything can happen in football.#We#ve still got Hibs to play and I feel we need to win pretty much every game we have left to make sure of third.#That#s going to be a tough ask, but we all believe we can still do it, there is definite believe in the dressing room.#We were all angry that we couldn#t find the back of the net on Saturday, but there was some good football.#It#s going to be a big ask, but strange things can happen in football.”A lack of goals has crippled Aberdeen’s bid to finish third, having scored just once in  matches.Considine says everyone – and not just the attackers – need to take responsibility for the problems in front of goal.The player, who is part of Steve Clarke’s Scotland squad for the World Cup qualiers this week and next, added: #We need something to fall for us because we got into many good positions.#Ross #s header kind of epitomised what is going on at the moment, a free header from six yards and not hitting the back of the net.#We#ve all got to take responsibility # it#s not just the forward players # we got a good number of corners so it#s up to ourselves from the back to try to get our heads on something as well.#It will come, we just need to keep going. The most positive thing was the way we played, our intensity and it was more entertaining stuff.”The interim management team of Paul Sheerin, Barry Robson and Neil Simpson took charge of Aberdeen for the first time at Tannadice after the sacking of Derek McInnes and Tony Docherty.Considine feels the Dons squad have bought into what the interim management team want.He said: #I thought we played well, we#ve been working for the last two weeks on our pressing game and building from the back through the thirds.#I thought every one of us bought into it and we beat their press many a time.#I thought it was good football and we got into some great positions, but it just wasn#t falling for us and it#s tough one to take having seen other results, because I thought we could have caught up on Hibs.#The past two weeks have been good and the way we played I felt was more like it.#I was sorry to see and hear the gaffergo.#But we move on and Paul, Barry, Simmy and Scott Anderson have been outstanding with us for the past two weeks.#We#ve worked hard as you could see building out from the back and through the thirds and all the boys have bought into it and we played some good stuff.#We couldn#t find the back of the net, but I know that will come, but training has been really good.#One positive for the Dons was Jack MacKenzie. The -year-old was handed a start at left-back, while -year-old right-back Calvin Ramsay made his debut off the bench in the closing stages.#I thought hewas brilliant. I#ve felt Jack has been ready for a while,” Considine said.#I#ve seen enough of him in training and he#s been out on loan at Forfar as well and the reports I#ve heard have been very good and I though he slotted in really well and didn#t look out of place at all.#I hope this can be the start of him playing left-back for Aberdeen and it was very encouraging.#Calvin Ramsay came on as well and made his debut, we#ve got a really good crop of young lads at Aberdeen and it#s just giving them a chance.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. vw, px\"  "},{"url":null,"title":"crinan puffer goes virtual for 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

It therefore has a special responsibility to do all it can to advance the peace process.So, while calling for an end to violence, it is simultaneously supplying the weapons necessary to prolong the conflict.The shameful neglect of this leadership role and continued licensing of arms to facilitate Saudi-led offensives is unsustainable. It is a stance that leaves the UK increasingly isolated on the global stage, with countries including Germany, Italy and the Netherlands already banning the export of arms to Saudi Arabia.The UK government now faces a choice: to join President Biden and live up to its obligations as UN penholder by ending the UK’s involvement in the Saudi campaign, or to continue to act as both peacekeeper and warmonger, undermining any moral leadership it might claim.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,The SNP has voted to conceal Alex Salmond#s evidence to the parliamentary inquiry.The Scottish Conservatives brought a vote to the Salmond inquiry demanding that Salmond’s evidence, much of which is already in the public domain, be published.This would allow Salmond to give crucial evidence in person about the SNP#s botched handling of this case. All the SNP MSPs on the committee, however, voted against its publication, meaning it will not be released.The Scottish public deserves to know the truth of what happened and why £, of public money had to be paid to Salmond.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward.Sir,The personal testimony of the men and boys in the final independent report into non-recent sexual abuse in Scottish football # who have shown incredible courage # demonstrates how needed this independent review has been.The abuse young players have suffered in football is inexcusable and heart-breaking. By bravely speaking up, they provided the catalyst for the review and the changes that will come from it are thanks to them.We welcome the ongoing work the Scottish Football Associationhas carried out in light of the report’s recommendations and encourage them to continue their progress.The SFA is showing it is willing to listen and implement changes that ensure no more children suffer the experiences described in the report.We are pleased to see children and young people’s involvement in the process, including the consultation with the Scottish Children’s Parliament. The voices of children and young people are crucial to developing improvements for their own wellbeing and safety and to change a culture where children can be frightened to speak up.Safeguarding in Sport, a partnership between Children st and sportscotland, has developed the Standards for Child Wellbeing and Protection in Sport, which state children have a right to express their views and have their voice taken into account.

Well done to everyone involved for getting the project to this stage.A broken record we might be, but we make no apology for it.As we have said before, the Scottish Government and Transport Scotland have never taken seriously, really seriously, the issue of the Rest and wider Argyll connectivity. If they had, we wouldn#t be talking about it today.Yes, a lot of work has gone into mitigation. But that is all it has ever been # mitigation and nothing like a solution. And a constant drain on public money.We need new, fresh thinking on keeping Argyll connected.

Options! There is only one possible and that should be obvious.When I first moved to Argyll, driving through Glen Croe was a beautul feeling that I had left the urban areas behind and come out into fresh country. No longer # it is a disaster zone and will remain so for a number of years, and possibly decades,a new  safe road is not built.With the elections in May for the Scottish Government, we should be calling on our  politicians to deliver a suitable road through Glen Croe and to do it soon, not  years  away with no firm plans to do it even then. Our politicians are in hiding and it is time they should deliver.The option should be for a new safe road well away from any landslide so that we, the inhabitants of Argyll, can get back to some normal le.Derrick Anstee, InveraraySir,The neglect of the A is a disgrace.It’s not just the long detour via Crianlarich when it rains heavily, it’s the potholes and ruts when we get a spell of cold weather.Three years ago we had a cold winter and the A became a dirt track. Emergency repairs had to be carried out. The Scottish Government said they’d solved the problem. Now we have another cold winter, and again emergency repairs are needed.Other trunk roads in Scotland don’t get closed when it rains or get all these ruts and potholes in a cold winter.We need serious money invested now to solve the A problems. Yet all we get from the Scottish Government is waffle about y public inquiries.We need money and action now to make the A as reliable as Scotland’s other trunk roads, not more cheap solutions.Councillor Alan Reid, Cowal wardMr Reid is the LibDem candidate for May#s Scottish parliamentary electionSir,With reference to theto school, I do hope that the pupils in Lochgilphead Joint Campus are kept in at lunchtime instead of being allowed to roam the streets like herds of wildebeast, with absolutely no social distancing or the wearing of masks.There is a perfectly good ing canteen restaurant in the school and or packed lunches.There is no need, at this time, for them all to be out and crowding supermarkets, fast food shops, cafes and chippies.This needs to be addressed by the Argyll and Bute education department as soon as possible.Name and address suppliedSir,In a leaflet delivered to every home in the Argyll and Bute constituency, Conservative MSP Donald Cameron claims that the #UK Governmentannounced the Argyll and Bute Rural Growth Deal worth £ million# and goes on to say that he is working with local councillors #including Alastair Redman# to #see what further action is needed#.The Rural Growth Deal, however, is a joint project involving £ million from the Scottish Government and a matched sum from the UK Government as well as more than £ million from other sources.In addition the deal has its origins in discussions between the Argyll and Bute MSP Michael Russell, then Scottish Government Finance Secretary John Swinney and the former leader of Argyll and Bute Council, Dick Walsh, in February . The UK Government only became involved some years later.This would be a very serious attempt at disinformation were it not so ludicrously self-defeating. Mr Cameron is standing to be a member of the Scottish Parliament yet he is trying to airbrush out anything Scottish about the largest investment ever in Argyll and Bute and its future.I hope it is merely ignorance of what has happened here that has led him to so severely misrepresent the truth of the issue, becauseit is political spin then he needs to apologise and withdraw the leaflet.Being pictured next to Alastair Redman won#t help him either, given that Mr Redman is best known for his regular letters to local papers attacking the very Scottish Government that is putting an extra £ million into this area.The Scottish Tories need to decide who they are working for # Boris Johnson in London, or the people of Scotland.Until Mr Cameron sorts his loyalties out, then he can#t be regarded as any sort of contender for the privilege of representing the people of Argyll and Bute.Michael Russell MSPSir,The SNP has committed £, to prepare for a second referendum within the next year.Instead of being focused on Scotland’s vaccination programme and protecting people’s jobs, the SNP’s priority is holding another isive referendum as early as this year.Setting aside this vast sum of money to help preparations for a referendum shows the SNP’s commitment toScotland to the politics of ision all over again.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward"},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast episode 20 the final tee","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Not before time.I was supportive of the mitigation plan, using nets and catch pits, as the simplest and least expensive approach. It was certainly worth a try, but it is abundantly clear now # with reputedly £ million spent # that it is not working.The , tonnes or more poised to come down on the road may well be an underestimate, and recent closures of the OMR, despite the new bund, doesn’t say very much for the efficacy of the protection. So we need an alternative, and we need it soon, not  years away.Talk of #alternative traffic corridors# is just a distraction.There may well be a case for a bridge-and-tunnel approach. Such has been successful in Norway and # notably # both in Iceland and Faroe Islands, which have much smaller resource bases than Norway. But these would be long-term schemes, each requiring the completion of several major interlinked crossings, for the like of which Scotland’s roads authority has hitherto shown neither interest nor aptitude.The problem at the Rest is a local one which requires a local solution. It’s only a mile or so of road which is at issue there.The alternatives, realistically, boil down to three:Overhead protection might well be required over quite a long distance, as it’s not just the bit at the catch pits which is threatened. The slopes of the Cobbler have experienced slides too. Since the hillside ies it might not be possible to use standard prefabricated modules, and in any case installation work would close the A for some time.A tunnel through to Butterbridge could be driven quite quickly # particularlythe Norwegians did it # but the approach in upper Glen Croe would require protection just like the OMR. Sir William Lithgow’s proposal mentions this, but construction would also almost certainly close the OMR, leaving no ersion for that period.The construction of a new alignment up the south west side of the glen, however, either on or roughly parallel to the existing forestry road, would avoid interference with through traffic.Both the gradient and the transverse slope would be substantially similar to those of the existing A, though thewould be marginally greater, which is probably why the north east side was chosen when the #new# A was built.The core of the case for the third option, however, is that the south west side of the glen has experienced far less erosion, both historically and in recent years, than the north east one.Stand at the upper viewpoint, or better still a little way along the Lochgoilhead road, and look around. The slopes of Ben Luibhean on which the A runs show far more watercourses and gullies than any of the others in the vicinity.This indicates a lot more rainfall impacting that slope, probably by the prevailing weather being funnelled on to it through the pass at the top of Glen More. And that weather is becoming worse.There have been no major slips over the forestry road in recent years, despite a spate of them on the opposite slope. It may just be the trees. I don’t think so, but in any case the trees are there, while it would take some years for tree cover to established above the A.Going back a lot further in time, the pattern is the same. The burn in the floor of upper Glen Croe has been pushed, over the centuries, by slip debris coming down from the north east slope, and the depth of that debris can easily be seen in the gullies recently carved in it behind the new bund.There is also a fair number of impressively-sized boulders on the lower slopes on that side, which at some point rolled down the hillside. Some of these came from the Cobbler, and although most are below the road a few are not. There is nothing to say that more will not arrive.A further point is that while the lower slopes on each side of the upper glen are similar, those on the south west side ease off towards the top, while those on the NE slope do not.It is on these upper slopes that the small slips develop which can pick up more and more water and debris on their way down, hence the fan shape of the typical slip. There is, in other words, a lot less potential for the initiation of slips on the south west side.I think that this all points to the need for a serious look at the forestry road, and I fail to understand why the investigations a few years ago dismissed it as a viable alternative.It’s the existing A which isn’t viable. And why any of these solutions would take  years to complete also beats me. Local objections  There is only one house in upper Glen Croe, and in the rest of Argyll I have yet to meet anyone who doesn’t want a permanent solution.My suspicion is that the biggest dficulty is that Transport Scotland can’t yet find a way to explain how £ million could be spent to such little effect. I might, of course, be wrong in all this, but I wait to be convinced of it.Arthur Blue, ArdrishaigSir,Since the temporary repairs to the Rest are clearly getting nowhere and costing money into the bargain, I would like to suggest a radical solution to the problem, and that is to build a viaduct right down the centre of the valley, based on the design of the MillauFor those not familiar with this structure, it is well worth an internet search. I believe this is still the world#s tallest bridge and is a really beautul structure.Seen from a distance, the white deck and piers look quite unreal # moreBefore anyone asks where that sum of money is to be found, I would point out that Boris Johnson#s proposed tunnel to Northern Ireland may cost between £ billion and £ billion # nobody knows because it hasn#t been designed yet. Nevertheless, Alister Jack is extremely enthusiastic about the proposal, so clearly money is not a problem.Not only would this new viaduct solve the problem once and for all, I suspect that, like the Millau Viaduct, it would become a much-photographed tourist attraction.John McCall, LochgilpheadSir,In last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser, Councillor Alastair Redman criticises the SNP for setting aside £, of its own money to campaign for an independent Scotland.Not surprisingly, he fails to enlighten us as to the costs of  the Tory party#s #Union Unit# set up by the Prime Minister at the taxpayers# expense.David Hay, MinardSir,Due to the speed with which the NHS is carrying out its vaccination programme, there is hope that we can soon all get out again andto normal.We still, however, face huge challenges. The economy has suffered. The NHS faces a big backlog of cancelled operations. Our young people have a lot of schooling to catch up on. We don’t have much time left to stop our climate changing before it is too late.Here in Argyll the Scottish Government must rise to the challenge of building a permanent solution at the Rest and Be Thankful.These must be our priorities. We can’t afford to spend the next few years arguing over independence. That’s an unnecessary distraction.We need a needle-sharp focus on the recovery without the distraction of another isive referendum.Put recovery first.Councillor Alan Reid, Cowal wardMr Reid is the Argyll and Bute LibDem candidate for May#s Scottish parliamentary election"},{"url":null,"title":"look out for nuthatches in argyll this spring","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The vaccination process carried out with great economy and efficiency # and entirely painlessly so that we really will have to stop calling it #the jag#.The real bonus was the warmth and good humour from everyone involved that made the whole process welcoming, so that you left with a smile on your face. Only after the event do you realise what a tremendous team effort it was from everyone involved and all of them deserve our thanks.I hope very much that the Mid Argyll area makes a near  per cent response to the vaccination invitation, because that is what this effort deserves and will demonstrate to those involved the very real, genuine appreciation we have for their work during the pandemic.Norman Rea, Kintallen, TayvallichSir,The rank hypocrisy of the Scottish Tories knows no bounds.While they are frothing at the mouth that the first minister should resign over allegedly misleading the Scottish Parliament, at the same time Prime Minister Johnson was proven to have deliberately misled the Westminster parliament.Standing up in the House of Commons, Mr Johnson stated that all Covid-related contracts were #on the record#.This was three days after the High Court ruled the government had acted unlawfully by failing to publish hundreds of such contracts, which somehow seemed to find their way to those with Tory party connections.Two weeks prior to this, the Health Minister Matt Hancock was found guilty of illegal activity by the High Court, refusing to resign or even apologise when the extent of illegal awarding of PPE contracts was revealed.Last year Tory Home Secretary Priti Patel was found guilty of breaching the ministerial code by being a bully and shouting and swearing at civil servant employees in the Home Office, recently reaching a £, settlement with the former Home Office Permanent Secretary.Compare and contrast that with north of the border, where the Tory party has demanded the resignation of the first minister even before the outcome of the enquiries into the handling of the Alex Salmond case by the Scottish Government has been published.Not a cheep from them demanding an apology, let alone a resignation, for the flagrant abuses by their Westminster colleagues. What hypocrites.Alex Orr, EdinburghSir,This Mother’s Day, school feeding charity Mary’s Meals would like to pay tribute to incredible women around the world.From the mums in the UK whose food has nourished us throughout our childhoods, including those who volunteer and fundraise for Mary’s Meals, to the women who cook and serve our daily meals for children in some of the world’s poorest countries, we celebrate them all.Mary’s Meals feeds more than . million hungry children in  countries every school day.That’s why I am asking your readers to send a Mary’s Meals gt card to the special women in their lives this Mother’s Day.

Thanks to the amazing commitment of some truly dedicated people working in the NHS and in social care, lives have been saved and people have been cared for. Stroke teams up and down the country have in many areas managed to continue to offer specialist care and treatment to patients throughout the pandemic. We cannot thank them enough.But the fallout from Covid- is going to pose challenges for everyone in health and social care. Our Recoveries at Risk report last autumn highlighted the real le impact of the pandemic on people recovering from a stroke.Emerging evidence of links between Covid- and stroke means that now, more than ever, a renewed national focus on stroke is needed in Scotland.Health officials have been working during the pandemic to review evidence and define what #a progressive stroke service for Scotland# should look like.This will include improved stroke care bundle figures, improved stroke prevention measures, a national thrombectomy service and stroke-specic, person-centred rehabilitation.The charity is pleased that people affected by stroke will be included in the development of this work.A draft paper will be with the Scottish Government in the next few weeks. Whatever the outcome of May’s election, the Stroke Association in Scotland expects the next government to push this work on, and for a new, improved, progressive stroke service to be implemented.Colin Oliver, public affairs officer, the Stroke Association in Scotland"},{"url":null,"title":"argylls abigail releases debut single","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Keith also co-wrote and produced the single at his studio on the Isle of Lewis.Abigail said: #The single is about encouraging women to follow their passions and carve out a le that they can enjoy and be proud of.#The music video that we created doesn’t have me in it, I wanted it to showcase powerful women who are following their dreams in whatever field their passions and talents lie.#The ambition behind the single is for it to be inspiring and help others to find the courage and drive to fight for their goals, no matter what those are.#I have always recorded with my band Heron Valley, who are a traditional folk band, so recording something for myself has been really dferent. Firstly, due to the obvious genre dferences but also because I’ve always had the support of five other people to make key choices, so it’s been a big change making decisions by myself on how I want the music to sound.#I have really enjoyed the process and the musical independence recording the single has given me.#Originally from rural Argyll, Abigail grew up with music very much at the heart of her family learning fiddle from a young age, also being taught guitar and vocal stylings at home with her father. She joined Heron Valley in its infancy while also studying at Royal Conservatoire of Scotland Junior School.As well as touring extensively with Heron Valley, Abigail went on to graduate from The Royal Conservatoire of Scotland where she studied Scots Song and classical violin.

The detailed assessment will also consider construction risk, cost and environmental impact of the options and a Statutory Environmental Assessment will be published in April.#Mitigation works at the Rest and be Thankful will carry on meantime, with a new debris cage, catchpit, debris fencing and flood mitigation planned.Medium term improvements are also being considered to improve the route through Glen Croe, including  the forestry track, old military road and other options on public land.Cabinet Secretary for Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity, Michael Matheson MSP said: #Following the disruption caused by landslips at the A Rest and be Thankful, I understand the frustration and disruption that these bring for local communities and road users.#We are progressing substantial short term investment in the existing A including installing a debris cage and new culvert, construction of an additional catchpit, debris fencing and flood mitigation measures at the River Croe crossing.#I can also announce today that I have asked Transport Scotland to progress work to look at a medium term resilient route through Glen Croe including consideration of the forestry track, the old military road and other options on land already owned by Scottish Ministers. Depending on the statutory consents required, this work will seek to develop finalised proposals within  months.#Along with this work on the existing A, we are working in parallel to identy a permanent solution to the road at the Rest and be Thankful. Following the conclusion of the preliminary assessment of the corridor options under consideration the preferred corridor has been identied as the Glen Croe corridor, Option .#Identying the preferred route corridor is a major step forward for this vital work and we are now pushing forward to look at five alternative options within that online corridor and starting the process shortly to appoint design consultants for this work.#As I made clear at the Rural Economy and Connectivity Committee last week, I have asked Transport Scotland to accelerate the preparation and delivery of the scheme where possible given the importance of the route to local communities and road users.#However, we are required to follow the correct statutory process to ensure a fair and transparent assessment of options and impacts on local communities and road users.#From today the new Story Map portal will provide regular updates on the design work as we look at alternative options within the preferred route corridor. We are also encouraging those with an interest to provide feedback on the preferred route corridor and possible route options between now and the end of May.#All of this work underlines the Scottish Government’s commitment to continued work with key stakeholders and local communities to ensure that Argyll and Bute remains open for business.#John Gurr, chairperson of The Rest and be Thankful Campaign chairperson, gave the news a lukewarm reception.#Whilst we welcome today’s announcement and the preferred option of Glen Croe, said Mr Gurr, #we are still no further forward in terms of timescales.#As we move into day  of the Rest and be Thankful being closed or disrupted, we urge Mr Matheson to put deliverable dates against this project.#Our request of a completion date of May  has once again fallen on deaf ears and without any mention of any dates it feels very much like a fluffy pre-election promise.#"},{"url":null,"title":"creative youngsters invited to showcase visual artwork","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

As many examples as possible will then also be published in the Campbeltown Courier, Argyllshire Advertiser and Oban Times newspapers.The artwork, which must be created specically for this showcase, can be on any surface # as long as it can be photographed and submitted # but it is limited to one image per person. It is not a competition and none of artwork will be judged.Gigha-based youth work facilitator Kenny Wilson, one of the project#s organisers, explained: #As youth workers, we kept hearing the same phrases from young people, phrases like #My bedroom has become my classroom# and #I feel like the walls are closing in on me#. Young people were asking questions like #Where can we go # Nowhere. #Who we can meet # No-one. #What are we allowed to do # During lockdown, very little at all.#The idea is to give artistic young people something to do that#s not prescribed by the Curriculum for Excellence [Scotland#s education framework] or by the government to give them the freedom to choose what they want to do, to design whatever they want to design.#The reward will be seeing their artwork published online and in the newspapers. The purpose of the whole thing is to increase the wellbeing of young people, to give them a boost # it#s as simple as that.#He added: #It could well be that something catches the eye of someone in the wider artistic community and they could be put in touch with the young creator of the piece in question # but that would have to be arranged through the youth workers, subject to careful child protection measures, and with parents# consent.#Kenny explained that safeguarding is an essential part of all that youth workers do and, as such, the organisers have created a GDPR statement which reads: #We will ensure that all personal data that we collect will only be held until all the images have been showcased, and will be processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner and only collected for the legitimate purposes of the showcase, and will never be passed on to any other organisation or third party without your explicit permission.#Those who would like to register an interest in taking part, can email ayelovetomake@gmail providing their first name and location. They are not required to submit their surname, full address or age, as long as they are within the  to  age range.When the project officially launches on Friday March , they can then send photographs of their artwork to the same email address so it can be uploaded to the project#s Instagram account, where it will be made visible to the public after the Sunday April  closing date.Kenny added: #If you are a young person with a desire to create, then go for it!#"},{"url":null,"title":"heathers treks renaissance ruins and ancient rock art","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

She has travelled and trekked throughout the world, walked across Scotland numerous times, climbed many of its peaks and now lives in Argyll amongst the scenery she loves.Lovely Kilmartin Glen is host to many wonderful historic sites and ancient monuments.Overlooking its northern reaches the renaissance remains of Master John Carswell’s Carnasserie Castle stand proud, its ruins eerily dramatic despite now being more home to crow than human.There are many ways in which to explore the area. This circular takes you through time from Carnasserie Castle in the east to the prehistoric rock art at Ormaig in the west, before wending southwards on the path used in bygone days to reach Old Poltalloch. Then, turning east, you come to Lady’s Seat, which offers lovely views down the glen, a brief respite before turning northwards toto the castle’s realm. Glimpses over to Loch Craignish and down Kilmartin Glen give one time to ponder the geology of the area swept by the glaciers of the last ice age.At the car park you will see a small path exiting the NE corner by the information boards. Turn left and head up the track towards the castle. You initially come to a turning left, you will take this shortly. Meanwhile the castle lies just ahead, through a gate and up a steep path to your left. Currently you can but admire its grandeur from the outside, either from here or the next section of the walk .Return to the track and take the turn on your right SW up through the trees and to a gate. Ahead you will cross the field for m, with the castle to your right, before re-joining the farm track. Follow it to a T-junction .Turn right and continue up the field and through a gate. A young forestry plantation lies to your left, pretty and convoluted little hills and glens to your right. Effectively the valley floor is the line of a dyke with the lumps, bumps and ides a mixture of limestone, igneous rock intrusions, sandstones, gritstones, conglomerates and folding doing much to create the complex NE SW flow seen in the shape of the hills and lochs all carved out by glaciers.Follow the track over the col past a gnarly old plantation on a knoll. The route descends for km towards Loch Craignish before veering sharply right to cross the Eas Mor burn at its western end. Note the main track you come on to. For those wishing to miss the path to Old Poltalloch you will need toto this point and keep following it south east to join up with the rest of the route.Cross the bridge over the Eas Mor. Ignore the small path to your right with a barrier and continue for m look out for the new track signposted up to the prehistoric rock art of Ormaig. After ascending m you will see the little paths to your right leading to the stones, a good place to pause and wonder at those who carved them.Return to the track below and south over the Eas Mor. At the sharp left-hand bend turn immediately right towards the sea. After just m, opposite a ruined croft, an easily missed path slips down to a wall. As soon as you are on it, it is obvious and now wends its way southwards towards Old Poltalloch through the ‘Big Wood’.The path is boggy in places with the odd fallen tree. After .km it reaches a forestry road turn left and follow this for m to a sharp left-hand bend. The path goes straight ahead at the bottom of the bend just below a turning point, again it is not obvious until you are on it. Continue to follow this all the way until you reach the road at Old Poltalloch, passing farmstead ruins and the old walled garden on your right. The house itself has now been renovated.Turn left. The track, which also leads to a jetty below, climbs upwards for nearly km before reaching the col leading to Kilmartin Glen. Ignore the two tracks you pass on your left .Descend for m and take the grassy forestry track to your right. After m a path leads upwards on your right to Lady’s Seat, a worthy detour for a grand view over the glen.Return to the track and turn right to descend to the main track below . Cross straight over, through a gate to the right of some sheep pens. Passing a track from your right after mzigzag down through the woods to a gate. The track does a sharp -degree turn right and, a little after, turn left to follow the tracks back to Carnasserie and your earlier outward route.Please note: Historic and Environment Scotland properties and sites remain closed due to Covid the castle can only be viewed from the outside at this time.

How could they turn so quickly  Where was their integrity Some just followed the crowd others feared Jesus was challenging the accepted order, so better get rid of him for the greater good.If we face betrayal, injustice, double standards, how do we react  Revenge, get our own back  That is a very natural reaction, but the consequence is to prolong the bitterness, perhaps ramp up the situation.Jesus asks us to step back, to #turn the other cheek# , to suck up the injustice, the double standards, and let peace rule.Impossible  Well, that is what He did at the cross, and because of Him, I think it is possible.I don#t always get it right in my le, but #don#t do as I do , do as He tells you#.

MSPs wanted to know when the Scottish Government was advised it would likely lose the challenge raised by Mr Salmond, but ministers said handing over the advice would breach the ministerial code.On two occasions, MSPs voted for the evidence to be released, with a deal eventually being struck in December to reveal the advice only to MSPs on the committee.Following a vote of no confidence threat in the Deputy First Minister, the Scottish Government released ldquokey legal advice, but the Scottish Tories were not satisfied and continued in their bid to oust John Swinney, which ultimately failed.Mr Salmond and Ms Sturgeon separately sat for mammoth sessions in front of the committee, taking questions from MSPs over several hours.Didnrsquot Mr Salmond face trial on sexual misconduct charges Yes. The former first minister was cleared of  charges at the High Court in Edinburgh in March last year after being arrested in January .What were the issues with Mr Salmondrsquos evidence to the committee Mr Salmond and the committee have been caught in repeated legal wrangles over evidence published by the inquiry.Last month, the former first minister said he would not appear before the committee after it decided not to publish his submission to a separate investigation into whether Ms Sturgeon breached the ministerial code over fears it may identy some of the complainers in Mr Salmondrsquos criminal trial last year.However, an alteration made to a court order by Judge Lady Dorrian meant the evidence could potentially be made public.While the committee voted against publication, the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Bodymade the decision to publish anyway.The evidence was online for less than  hours before the Crown Office raised concerns with Holyrood about it, asking for redactions to be made.In his submission, the former first minister accused some in the Scottish Government and SNP of a ldquomalicious and concerted attempt to damage my reputation and remove me from public le in Scotland.But Ms Sturgeon said her predecessor did not have ldquoa shred of evidence to support his claims.The submission was later re-released, with a number of paragraphs relating to the set-up of a meeting between Mr Salmond and his successor redacted.Is the committee inquiry the only investigation into the matter No. Ms Sturgeon is currently under investigation by James Hamilton QC to establishshe breached the ministerial code.Ms Sturgeon referred herself after being accused of misleading Parliament over when she knew of the complaints against Mr Salmond.She previously said she had been told about the allegations by Mr Salmond himself during a meeting in her home on April , .However, it was later found that Mr Salmondrsquos former chief of staff Geoff Aberdein had met with the First Minister in her Holyrood office four days prior to that, where she was told of the complaints.Scotlandrsquos first minister @NicolaSturgeonresponds to @SkyNewsexclusive the harassment committee has ruled she misled Parliament in her evidence.ldquoThe opposition members of this committee made their minds up about me before I uttered a single word of evidence. pic UNeUJsmdash Fraser KnightMarch , What has the committee concluded A leak on Thursday evening from inside the committee revealed it has concluded the First Minister misled the inquiry over whether she had offered to intervene in the case ndash which Ms Sturgeon denies doing.Two other witnesses, one of whom is Mr Salmondrsquos lawyer and former SNP MSP Duncan Hamilton and who was at the meeting in question, contradicted the First Ministerrsquos statement.The conclusion was arrived at following a - party line vote, with the four SNP members of the committee, including convener Linda Fabiani, supporting the First Ministerrsquos assertion.What happens next The decision is likely to increase pressure on Ms Sturgeon to stand down before Mayrsquos election, although it is unclear whether the act was deemed a resignation-worthy offence.Last night, Scottish Conservatives leader Douglas Ross called for her to quit.He said: ldquoThe committee will publish its findings in the coming days and we will wait for that report.ldquoBut we have already detailed that Nicola Sturgeon lied to the Scottish Parliament and for that, she must resign.

To potentially add to this level of unemployment for no apparent good reason is baffling.KRL not only provides an efficient and cost effective service but worthwhile jobs to people who may otherwise struggle to find employment and are no doubt very concerned about their futures right now.This decision should be reconsidered."},{"url":null,"title":"letters march 5 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

I immediately hung up # wondering which of my frailties had been discovered # and phoned  which tells you the last number that called.I twice noted the number given by  and ventured to phone it. On dialling this number, the phone company advised me that there was #no such number#.Over a week, adopting identical procedures, five dferent #no such numbers# were found. The job of answering morning calls was then delegated to the message answering machine and only once did it receive a call which was terminated speedily by the caller without a message.Is there a flaw in our phone companies# systems with consequent loss of income  If this flaw could be eradicated, phone scammers might be less numerous and consequently afford a little more protection for the vulnerable.Going by theof John Newall#s reply to my letter on England#s disastrous Brexit, forced upon Scotland against our democratic wishes, I had expected better than the mishmash of worn out tropes and John Bull exceptionalism trotted out by Mr Newall.Mr Newall makes great play of the successful roll-out of the Covid vaccine in Scotland and the UK. He is absolutely right, it has been a fantastic achievement, but to then go on to use this success to denigrate the EU#s vaccine programme is crass and over simplistic.Our success is an illusion until both doses of vaccine are administered, crowing about vaccines when only . per cent of the UK population has had the vital second jag, compared, for example, to . per cent in Denmark, is both presumptuous and inappropriate.Mr Newall goes on to assert that Scotland has a deficit that will prevent Scotland re-entering the EU, without of course mentioning the elephant in the room, the UK#s ruinous £ trillion # and increasing # debt. Unionists need to get their own house in order before lecturing anyone .Of course, legally, Scotland has no #deficit# or #debt#. How can a country with virtually no borrowing ability have a debt  What Scotland does have is a notional #debt#, the price of Westminster failure within the UK, where spending outwith Scotland#s control is assigned to Scotland, such as Trident, HS and London’s Crossrail. Spending that Scots taxpayers cough up for.Indeed,Courier readers start counting now at the rate of one a second, they#ll reach the number of pounds spent on Boris Johnson’s failed Track and Trace system at about .am on April  in the year . Readers may well wonder where the money went and why this is being loaded on to Scotland#s ledger.Straight from the #Better Together# playbook, Mr Newall brings up the hoary old #Spanish veto# myth. The truth is that Spain has no issue with an independent Scotland in the EU so long as this is within the framework of the UK constitution # which it is.Unlike Catalonia#s predicament, Scotland is not a #region# of the UK, there is no constitutional prohibition on independence votes or indeed of Scotland abrogating the  Treaty of Union with England.This is why successive prime ministers, from Margaret Thatcher to David Cameron, have repeatedly recognised the right of the Scottish people to independence # and why Boris Johnson#s oafish #No# will run into the sand.Mr Newall and I will never agree but that is the essence of democracy, and the right to choose in a free country.Scotland can either remain, semi-detached and impotent, as part of an increasingly insular Little Englander Tory Britain, bringing in its wake further austerity and diminished le chances for our young people, or Scots can vote for independence, just like our neighbours.Yes, there will be dficult choices, yes, there will be mistakes, but they will be our decisions to get right as we work for the prosperous, open and internationalist country that is within our grasp.I am delighted that our council will be investing nearly £. million to help keep Argyll and Bute going and growing.After relentless campaigning from myself and others it#s great to see, at long last, some substantial investment in our crumbling infrastructure.Building on investments made in previous years, an additional £. million will be invested to drive forward improvements and repairs to Argyll and Bute#s network of roads in rural, remote, island and urban communities, bringing the overall roads reconstruction budget to £ million for  .We are also investing more in active travel, in line with the council#s agreed priorities.

I’m not alone in this: stroke strikes every five minutes in the UK, and around . million survivors are living with its devastating effects.Despite this, research into stroke is severely underfunded. Just one per cent of the total UK public and third sector health research spend goes towards stroke research.The Stroke Association has launched a unique opportunity for stroke survivors and those who care for stroke survivors to have our say on the future of stroke research. Partnered with the James Lind Alliance, the charity will find out what matters to us most so research can make the biggest dference to our lives.With such limited funds for stroke research, worsened by the Covid- pandemic, it#s vital that we come together and make our voices heard.If you#re a stroke survivor, or you care for or work with someone affected by stroke, join me and speak up for stroke.Visit www.stroke.org.uk jla by March ."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week march 5 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The dinghy was then taken to Tayinloan.Fears that the flare signalled the ers were in serious trouble meant Islay leboat was launched and a rescue helicopter from Prestwick was scrambled.FIFTY YEARS AGOMarines scare: contact made with #missing# commandosCarradale was buzzing with excitement this week when it was discovered four Marine commandos had been missing for days in the hills of Kintyre.The Marines, who were taking part in an exercise, were to have reported back to a vessel berthed at Carradale harbour, to be taken back to the barracks.The original number of #missing# men had been , but eight gradually found their way back to the boat, an Admiralty MFV.Villagers were concerned about the safety of the Marines who were not accounted for.A Marine spokesman told the Courier at Carradale on Tuesday evening that four men were still #missing#. Minutes later, the MFV steamed away from the village, minus the men.A Land Rover had earlier searched a wide area in vain for them.On Tuesday morning, three Marines called at the village bar and asked for sandwiches. An employee said they were obviously very tired and had just come from the hills.Contact was established with the missing men in the early hours of yesterday. They had been in the hills and were discovered by a Land Rover which had been searching for them.The men were yesterday trying to make their way back to the base at Plymouth. It is understood they have not been seen since the weekend.The men had, in fact, being separated for a time but had managed to meet up with each other, too late to catch the boat at a pre-arranged rendezvous.Council brevitiesThe cost of converting council-controlled coin-operated locks to take decimal currency was to be £.

Mr Wilson is trying to muddy the waters there.Whilst Mr Wilson is correct that Scotland cannot have debt , Scotland does have deficit, and the reason we know this is because the SNP-run Scottish Government tells us so in the annual Government Revenue and Expenditure, Scotlandbut Mr Wilson contradicts himself by going on to say that Scotland has a #notional debt# . Scotland has no debt. Scotland cannot have debt. Mr Wilson needs to realise that debt and deficit are two dferent things.With regard to HS, yes, Scotland pays a two per cent share of the total cost but will receive approximately . per cent back in Barnett consequentials. THAT is a very good deal for Scotland. London#s Crossrail  Not a single penny for that will be paid for by Scotland.Mr Wilson goes on to say that there is no #prohibition on independence votes#. Another error from him. Section  of The Scotland Act , the act which allowed us to have a devolved assembly and to which the then Scottish Office signed up, lays down the exact process required. We need permission from HMGov.Oh, and the notion that Scotland can abrogate the Treaty Of Union is also wrong. Whilst Westminster is a parliament of equals, it cannot of itself dissolve the Treaty of Union of which it was not itself a progenitor. That is the prerogative of the suspended national parliaments of England and Scotland, which will require to be recalled from suspension #in abeyance ad interim# where they legitimately reside at the present time. Only the recalled national parliaments of Scotland and England may re-negotiate the  Treaty of Union.I would take this opportunity to remind Mr Wilson of two things: we had a referendum in  and voted to stay in the UK, and he should really learn to live with that and in no election ever, General or Scottish, has the SNP garnered more than  per cent of the vote.The decision by Argyll and Bute Council to stop funding Kintyre Recycling Limited is perverse to say the least.No thought seems to have been given to the level and cost of the future support for the employees who will be thrown on the scrap-heap. Will that go to the social work department and will they get the same level of support as they do now No thought seems to have been given to the effect on the mental health of the employees # what support will be available and what budget will it come from How can the expenditure of a quarter of a million pounds be justied when the council is struggling for money and how long will it take to save this amount compared with the partial funding for Kintyre Recycling Limited It is shameful that only two of our local councillors are against vulnerable people being thrown on the scrap-heap when all three should be supporting their constituents.I am pleased to support the new business group set up to campaign for a quick and permanent solution for the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A.It’s now seven months since the landslide closed the A last summer. That should have been a wake-up call for the SNP Government, but all we#ve had since then is a failed attempt to protect the Old Military Road from landslides and talk of taking  years to solve the problem.This is just not good enough. We need urgent action now.Last week#s Courier letters page didn#t offer much hope. The SNP only wrote about independence, not the real issues facing us, such as the Rest and Be Thankful.The SNP Government should be concentrating on fixing the Rest and Be Thankful and recovering from the Covid pandemic, not spending its time plotting about independence.This Mother#s Day, school feeding charity Mary#s Meals would like to pay tribute to incredible women around the world.From the mums in the UK whose food has nourished us throughout our childhoods, including those who volunteer and fundraise for Mary#s Meals, to the women who cook and serve our daily meals for children in some of the world#s poorest countries, we celebrate them all.Mary#s Meals feeds more than . million hungry children in  countries every school day.That#s why I am asking your readers to send a Mary#s Meals gt card to the special women in their lives this Mother#s Day.

That is a tough place to be in.The first occasion, He told them to go out again into deeper water , on the second occasion,it was to cast the net on the right side of the boat. In both accounts, these fishermen caught so many fish the nets were at breaking point.Oh, that it could always be as straightforward as that!Right now, fishermen and their families are facing such a dficult time and feeling that their voices are not being heard. These Bible stories remind us that their need and cry is heard by Jesus, the one who chose fishermen as His companions whilst on earth.We too must not forget them and this important industry in our west coast communities. I hope you will join me in praying for them, not only for their daily safety but also for provision and wisdom.In these stories, there is a lesson for us all to think about. What obstacle do you face this week that could be overcome by changing our actions or by thinking dferently  We resist change particularly when something has worked for us in the past, but sometimes we need a dferent approach.Sometimes, like the disciples, we too can find that calling on Jesus gets us through."},{"url":null,"title":"council leader defends recycling decision","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

In rural areas, this is likely to result in considerable additional costs, accompanied by very stringent targets to meet.#All of this means we have to find ways of providing these services in as sustainable a way as possible.#It is vital to address that as soon as possible – we have no choice but to comply with the requirements of that new legislation when it comes into force. Similarly, any other organisation responsible for the delivery of recycling services would also have to bear these additional pressures and signicant costs which could potentially be prohibitive for smaller organisations.#That is the context of this particularly challenging decision, and it is a context which councillors absolutely had to bear in mind when considering the future delivery of recycling services in Kintyre.#Therefore we took the decision to agree a six-month extension to KRL#s contract, to work towards the longer-term sustainable delivery of recycling services for households in Kintyre, but also to give time to work with KRL in relation to the scope for transfer of their employees when the service is brought in-house.#Our officers made contact with KRL as soon as they possibly could following the budget to put those discussions and arrangements in motion. Every effort will be made to mitigate the impact of the decision to transfer the service back to the council.#Kintyre and the Islands# third councillor, Anne Horn, who voted against the decision, said: #When council officers suggested bringing recycling in-house on Islay it proved much more dficult than envisaged and over the anticipated budget. This is another reason I objected as the precedent proved to be a cost burden rather than the proposed saving.#The employees from KRL are inspirational in their attitude to their job and want only to work to the best of their ability.#There must be some replacement for the support the employees have while at the workplace and this will reflect on resources from the Health and Social Care Partnership.#Only time will tellthe potential savings materialise over future years and, for me, this is such a huge uncertainty I could not support this proposal.#"},{"url":null,"title":"creative youngsters invited to showcase visual artwork","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

As many examples as possible will then also be published in the Campbeltown Courier, Argyllshire Advertiser and Oban Times newspapers.The artwork, which must be created specically for this showcase, can be on any surface # as long as it can be photographed and submitted # but it is limited to one image per person. It is not a competition and none of artwork will be judged.Gigha-based youth work facilitator Kenny Wilson, one of the project#s organisers, explained: #As youth workers, we kept hearing the same phrases from young people, phrases like #My bedroom has become my classroom# and #I feel like the walls are closing in on me#. Young people were asking questions like #Where can we go # Nowhere. #Who we can meet # No-one. #What are we allowed to do # During lockdown, very little at all.#The idea is to give artistic young people something to do that#s not prescribed by the Curriculum for Excellence [Scotland#s education framework] or by the government to give them the freedom to choose what they want to do, to design whatever they want to design.#The reward will be seeing their artwork published online and in the newspapers. The purpose of the whole thing is to increase the wellbeing of young people, to give them a boost # it#s as simple as that.#He added: #It could well be that something catches the eye of someone in the wider artistic community and they could be put in touch with the young creator of the piece in question # but that would have to be arranged through the youth workers, subject to careful child protection measures, and with parents# consent.#Kenny explained that safeguarding is an essential part of all that youth workers do and, as such, the organisers have created a GDPR statement which reads: #We will ensure that all personal data that we collect will only be held until all the images have been showcased, and will be processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner and only collected for the legitimate purposes of the showcase, and will never be passed on to any other organisation or third party without your explicit permission.#Those who would like to register an interest in taking part, can email ayelovetomake@gmail providing their first name and location. They are not required to submit their surname, full address or age, as long as they are within the  to  age range.When the project officially launches on Friday March , they can then send photographs of their artwork to the same email address so it can be uploaded to the project#s Instagram account, where it will be made visible to the public after the Sunday April  closing date.Kenny added: #If you are a young person with a desire to create, then go for it!#"},{"url":null,"title":"district news march 19 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

While he was gutting and cleaning a large cod at sea, something fell onto the deck.When the deck was cleared and washed down, Mr Colville examined his find# the honeycomb from a bee#s hive!How on earth it ever managed to find its way to the murky depths and into a cod#s stomach we will never discover.It is just #one of those things#.Councillors call for removal of #eyesore#Campbeltown councillors are up in arms about a #rusting eyesore# which is lying on the shores of Campbeltown Loch.The ex-Admiralty tug Empire Ace ran aground at Southend nearly two years ago and was towed to the loch, where it was beached. It has lain at the Rocky Burn area ever since.The vessel caused a row between the Town Council and the firm who owned it, George Hood and Company of Helensburgh.At a meeting last September, it was suggested that the firm be charged dues.Councillor Harry Moffat was quoted as saying: #If people are allowed to dump boats in the loch, I can go and dump a car and nobody can do anything about it.#The council discussed the question of taking legal action against the firm. A considerable number of people have since remarked on the unsightliness of the vessel, which has started to rust.Fishermen ing from the grounds were using the Empire Ace as a mooring stage while they cleaned and washed their catches.But a spokesman for the Helensburgh firm said that it had sold the vessel some months ago. The spokesman refused to reveal the identity of the buyers, but after inquiries, we ascertained that it was purchased by McFadyen’s, the local contracting firm.A spokesman for Archibald McFadyen and Sons said that the Empire Ace was purchased by the firm about two weeks ago.He added that breaking up work was to start on the vessel #within the next few days#.Tobacco firm expands furtherThe well-known Campbeltown firm of Richard Daniels Ltd, tobacco wholesalers and distributors, has opened a depot in Peebles, to meet an increased demand from customers on the east coast.The firm, whose custom stretches from Aberdeen to Middlesborough in England, has just been awarded a #very large# contract from a brewing firm to supply its retail outlet # public houses.Askedthe Peebles opening would create redundancies locally, Mr James Daniels told the Courier that staff in Campbeltown would be unaffected.#It is merely a new phase being added to the business,# he said.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOCastlehill Church Sunday SchoolThe children of the Kinloch Church Sunday School had a highly enjoyable social evening on Friday last.

I care about mankind in general and the plight of its citizens, particularly where there is a prevalence of political ineptitude affecting their lives.To reiterate, the EU purchasing system regarding vaccines was and still is chaotic, with the bureaucratic executive in Brussels initially lashing out, and currently certain members within the group are endeavouring to purchase supplies of vaccines for their citizens.In addition, we now have a ban by some countries of vaccine exports from EU manufacturers to non-EU countries. An action which has angered the World Health Organization and upset Australia and other countries.Regarding the comment that the vaccine success is an illusion, perhaps the perusal of some scientic pronouncements in relation to the efficacy would be appropriate.To accuse me of crowing is not only resented but additionally hurtful. I have an extended family in France.My daughter is married to a now retired French army captain and she is an environmental scientist and director of a laboratory in the IRD , a French public research institution. While her mother-in-law has had her first vaccination and in the last week so has her husband, she does not know when she will get an appointment.Currently, in certain areas of France, the virus is very active and part of her remit involves travel to some of these hot-spots when working from home is not practicable. A situation which is very concerning to me.I also do not know when I will be permitted to see them, either in France or in Scotland.Crowing, indeed, I think not.Amidst the miscellany of economic disaster claims awaiting an independent Scotland thrown up by Michael McGeachy in last week#s Courier, I am gratied that Mr McGeachy does, at the very least, accept that Scotland has no debt at the point of independence. This is progress.Unfortunately, Mr McGeachy then goes on to hold up Scotland#s putative deficit as an ace card in the unionist case to #prove# that Scotland is an economic basket-case surviving on English largesse. In reality, it demonstrates the opposite.Scotland#s #deficit#, created within the UK, with our overall budget set by another government # that#s  per cent of Scotland#s revenues and  per cent of our spending # is a damning indictment of Westminster#s reckless economic vandalism. It is the cost of Westminster Tory rule and the union#s failure.Indeed,being part of the UK was such an advantage, Scotland would have a stronger economy than our northern independent competitors.That they are all considerably more successful, with fewer economic resources than Scotland, makes the case for Scotland to have control of all the sovereign economic levers required to succeed in the global economy.Mr McGeachy concludes with the familiar splenetic, #you had your referendum# in . In this time we have had three Prime Ministers, two Westminster elections and one Holyrood election, not forgetting England#s Brexit imposed upon Scotland.Democracy is not pick and mix, Mr McGeachy. The #Better Together# parties can huff and puff about #taking back control# to London, but Scotland is not their possession.We still live in a free country andScots vote this May for an SNP government focused on Scottish priorities, including the right to ensure that Scotland#s future is Scotland#s choice, not Boris Johnson#s, democracy, as we saw with the election of President Biden, will prevail.The fact that the SNP has produced a new digital strategy document will come as little consolation to residents of the Highlands and Islands, who would struggle to download it eventhey wanted to.The SNP has left the Highlands and Islands in the digital dark ages.The  SNP manesto committed to deliver superfast broadbandto every home and business by . This has comprehensively failed, with ministers refusing to discuss completion dates. A December  report logged an average download speed of .Mbps in Glen Shiel. That is  times slower than Scotland’s fastest street.The pandemic has exposed the glaring digital ide that exists between rural and urban parts of Scotland.Scottish Liberal Democrats want our remote and rural communities to be great places to live, work and study.That#s why we are setting out new proposals to put power in the hands of local community managers and prioritise investment in catch-up zones to ensure that everyone has access to the digital services they need to prosper.Cancer continues to claim lives regardless of the pandemic.As resources within the NHS are stretched to their limits, charities like Target Oian Cancer need your help more than ever before. Please help us raise awareness and raise funds. Whilst we are all fighting coronavirus, Target Oian Cancer is putting the needs of women with oian cancer before all .In , my mother, the actress Marjie Lawrence, was diagnosed with oian cancer just three weeks before she died.Had we and her doctors been aware of the symptoms, Marjie might be alive today.

It also offers golfers a virtual golf simulator where they will be able to play some of the best courses in the world.In line with the focus on reducing the club#s carbon footprint and the ambition to become more environmentally friendly, the new clubhouse boasts the latest air source heating technology providing the most efficient renewable heating.Aligned to this bright future, the number of junior members at the golf club continues to boom despite the recent lack of clubhouse facilities # there are now  members under the age of , making up  per cent of the total membership.Club captain William Livingston said: #This truly is a momentous moment in the club#s history.

His aunt would have surely pointed it out to him. Then he read the information board and realised it was a recent reconstruction. The name of the nearby cafe now made sense to him.On the path that followed the old railway line, Finn stopped. There it was, hersquod found it: the oak tree. It still looked young, standing guard over the pebbly beach with multiple spreading branches and the magisterial presence Finn remembered.His daughter headed immediately to the waterrsquos edge. It was a much busier place now, with frequent walkers on the nearby path.There was a suspension footbridge spanning the river which Finn couldnrsquot recall. A couple walking by paused for a moment but didnrsquot come to the beach. Perhaps social distancing had some benefits, thought Finn.While his daughter played, he tried to identy the spot he had spent that first night of storytelling with his aunt.ldquoHere, right here, he whispered to himself.Time and space fused together as he imagined going back to the past to explain to his -year-old self what that evening of tales around the fire had really meant.But he would not have been able to listen, not even to his older self. His world then was a broken mirror with vital pieces missing in which he could see only part of himself those pieces lost to him forever. Guilt and anger clawed at Finnrsquos gut, rousing his depression from its slumber.He felt the dark creature trying to pull him down, pain taking over. No, not now, he thought, not in the presence of his daughter.He would not submit to it, refused to feed it with more ruminations.He wonderedhe should have taken Eilidh on this pilgrimage of healing. But yes, her presence with him, and his love for her, was the light in his soul that kept the dark creature at bay.He would be present for her and walk with her to the summit of the faerie hill. She wanted to leave the faeries a gt and a wish. Finn did too.ldquoYou ready for that walk up the faerie hill  he called out to his daughter. She nodded excitedly with a joyful smile.September Finnrsquos phone call to his mum before they left Strathyre suggested he was coping with the temporary separation. He hadnrsquot wanted to climb the faerie hill, but Izzy hoped hersquod be up for a walk up to the rock of the boar when they got to Balquhidder.It was still early morning as they crossed the old Stron Bridge and a stunning view of Loch Voil greeted them.Mist spiralled from the water and swirled around the trees on the steep braes either side. But it was already warm, with more blue sky than grey above the mist. It was set to be one of those glorious September sunny days, the kind you appreciate all the more because you know it may be the last for a long time. They stood awhile watching the mist play above the loch, as the mountains slowly revealed themselves. The Highlands wake slowly in the morning.Izzyrsquos soul tingled as she soaked in the beauty of the moment and breathed in the sweet air.ldquoCan you smell that Finn, the scent of the Highlands  she said.Finn raised his head and snfed: ldquoSmells like cow dung.He was right, it did now. A waft of it came from a nearby field where cattle grazed. Izzy laughed.ldquoAye, well, thatrsquos the historic smell of the Highlands too!She led Finn back to the old bridge they had just driven over. Its three arches spanned the river with historic elegance.They sat on the walls looking down at the water and Izzy took it as an opportunity to tell Finn about the drovers, how in days of old they would come this way, driving hundreds of cows to markets in the south, crossing rivers and traversing through glens.Theyrsquod often sleep outside with the cattle, or sometimes in droversrsquo inns. They were the cowboys of the old Highlands, who knew the land and the dferent hazards of each route, but didnrsquot wear Stetsons of course, and rarely had a horse.She pointed towards the hills to the north: ldquoOver there was a droversrsquo route, bringing the cattle this way. The drovers could veer round and steer the cattle east of the river, but with this bridge theyrsquod have been able to cross here, then again at Strathyre downriver. There were lots of dferent ways, and the drovers had detailed maps inside their heads drawn by experience. Cattle were so valuable they would often be lted by one clan from another.Finn looked bemused.ldquoLted  Like carried on their shoulders  Izzy burst out laughing at the image and Finn looked hurt.ldquoAw, sorry Finn, I wasnrsquot laughing at you, I was laughing at the image you painted in my imagination. Lted means, well, stolen. But people called it lting because it was seen as a tradition rather than a crime. At least by those doing the lting!Finn looked around, still feeling a bit raw by his auntrsquos reaction to his question.ldquoI havenrsquot watched TV for a whole day now, he said, realising hersquod missed his breakfast TV programme. He picked up a pebble and dropped it into the water below, then watched the circles expand.ldquoWhere we going today  he asked.ldquoWell, letrsquos see how far we get, but right now we are heading for Balquhidder Kirk!ldquoWhere the minister who wrote the book on faeries was ldquoAye, but there is much more to its story.Izzy took her rucksack from the roof box.ldquoSo we are walking there ldquoYep, itrsquos really not far, his aunt replied.But Finn was wary. Her rucksack seemed suspiciously full for a short walk.They set off along the quiet single track road. The air buzzed with le and mooing from the cattle had replaced the sound of traffic. Soon they had crossed a small old bridge and were heading into a wood. They were at the base of Kirton Glen and the sound of a waterfall touched Finnrsquos senses.Izzy paused only briefly at the falls but Finn wanted to linger.ldquoWersquoll come back this way, and then we can spend some time here, she said.She pointed ahead of her: ldquoJust there, through the trees, is where we are headed. I always think this is the best way to approach this ancient place to emerge from a wood after being doused with the sound of running water, rather than just arrive from a car park and... well, yoursquoll see.The path opened up onto a gravel drive and a Victorian church. He followed Izzy round the corner of the church and found himself standing on the edge of an ancient graveyard.Old gravestones littered the ground, which was uneven. A gravestone in the form of an ancient Celtic cross stood out against the blue sky.Generation upon generation lay beneath his feet. The graves surrounded the ruins of a th-century kirk. The historic site was framed by distant mountains. His aunt was right about the approach Finn felt like Indiana Jones emerging from the jungle to discover a long-lost ruined temple.Izzy led Finn carefully past the graves and into the ruins, then through the open doorway of the old kirk. Before them were three old recumbent gravestones lying side by side, surrounded by a low metal railing.A modern-looking gravestone above the graves had an inscription: ldquoMacGregor Despite them.Finn read the smaller inscriptions. They told that these were the graves of Rob Roy, his we and two of his sons. Someone had laid flowers at the foot of the graves.ldquoHe was a legendary outlaw, explained Izzy, ldquoa member of the MacGregor clan, who were hunted like the wolf.ldquoWhy ldquoThe whole clan was outlawed, which is why there is that inscription, which means despite their persecution they survived. Rob Roy lived part of his le as a hunted man, some say he was the enemy of the rich and a defender of the poor. Irsquove heard him called Scotlandrsquos Robin Hood.ldquoSo he was a hero.ldquoWell, he is to some. But to others he was a villain, a thief and a nasty killer.ldquoWhich is true, was he a goodie or a baddie ldquoPerhaps a bit of both, depending on who you are and what you believe.ldquoWhat do you believe aunty  asked Finn. Izzy pursed her lips in thought.ldquoWell, I love the romantic stories about him, like how he gave the minister here a sheep and cow each year infor him not increasing his fees to the local people.ldquo The fact the animals were probably lted didnrsquot seem to bother the minister. People want these stories to be true because we want our heroes to be always heroic and good, and not disappoint us. But other stories show him in a very ugly light.ldquo I want him to be a hero, said Finn, ldquobut now I donrsquot know what to believe.ldquoPerhaps we can admit to ourselves that even our heroes arenrsquot always perfect and have flaws, and so sometimes they do the wrong things.Finn shrugged his shoulders: ldquoWhatrsquos flaws ldquoErm, an imperfection, or fault.Finn looked down and scuffed the ground with his boots. Izzy knew this was a challenge to how he saw the world.ldquoI want to show you something , she said.She led him to the edge of the graveyard, then pointed up at a rocky ridge which emerged from a wood on a steep brae above them.ldquoCan you see, up there, the clf face with the ledge above  Thatrsquos called Creag an Tuirc, which means the rock of the boar. It looks out over the glen and was the clan rallying point for the MacLarens who lived here. Itrsquos a special place, Irsquom hoping you will chum me up to it. I have snacks we can have when we get there.Finn looked unsure. It seemed a steep uphill walk.ldquoItrsquos a place that knows the secrets of this glen because itrsquos quietly seen everything.ldquoSecrets ldquoAye, like the mystery of Rob Royrsquos grave, and what really happened when those Buchanan clansmen arrived here looking for a fight.ldquoWhat mystery Izzy just gave Finn a teasing smile.ldquoAnd it gives you amazing views. she added.ldquoAs good as from that Celtic fort and the giantrsquos stone yesterday  asked Finn, who was wavering.ldquoIrsquod say even better.Finn ed her smile with a cheeky one: ldquoCan I have a snack now to give me energy Izzy chuckled: ldquoSure!She put her rucksack down, and took out a chocolate bar: ldquoHow about this Izzy pulled on her rucksack and started to walk out the graveyard. Finn followed while enjoying the bar.They walked together up the path that leads to Creag an Tuirc.Here are the links to chapters one, two, three, four and five."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-peeps-past-march-15-19-1996-1971-1921","story":"THE sea was ldquolashing buildings in Dunbar, reported the East Lothian Courier on March , .Dunbarrsquos pound. million improved sewerage system is blamed for a catalogue of disasters along the coastline.In , the regional council cut through four metres of rock to lay two new sets of pipes and, according to residents, the sea has been ldquolashing the buildings ndash causing considerable damage ndash ever since.They claim that the natural defences were never properly replaced after the construction work, leaving their homes exposed to the mercy of the high tides.Owner of The Courtyard Hotel and Restaurant, Peter Bramley, has made repeated complaints to the council since .ldquoSomethingrsquos got to be done, he said. ldquoItrsquos seriously affecting peoplersquos business and health.

MSPs wanted to know when the Scottish Government was advised it would likely lose the challenge raised by Mr Salmond, but ministers said handing over the advice would breach the ministerial code.On two occasions, MSPs voted for the evidence to be released, with a deal eventually being struck in December to reveal the advice only to MSPs on the committee.Following a vote of no confidence threat in the Deputy First Minister, the Scottish Government released ldquokey legal advice, but the Scottish Tories were not satisfied and continued in their bid to oust John Swinney, which ultimately failed.Mr Salmond and Ms Sturgeon separately sat for mammoth sessions in front of the committee, taking questions from MSPs over several hours.Didnrsquot Mr Salmond face trial on sexual misconduct charges Yes. The former first minister was cleared of  charges at the High Court in Edinburgh in March last year after being arrested in January .What were the issues with Mr Salmondrsquos evidence to the committee Mr Salmond and the committee have been caught in repeated legal wrangles over evidence published by the inquiry.Last month, the former first minister said he would not appear before the committee after it decided not to publish his submission to a separate investigation into whether Ms Sturgeon breached the ministerial code over fears it may identy some of the complainers in Mr Salmondrsquos criminal trial last year.However, an alteration made to a court order by Judge Lady Dorrian meant the evidence could potentially be made public.While the committee voted against publication, the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Bodymade the decision to publish anyway.The evidence was online for less than  hours before the Crown Office raised concerns with Holyrood about it, asking for redactions to be made.In his submission, the former first minister accused some in the Scottish Government and SNP of a ldquomalicious and concerted attempt to damage my reputation and remove me from public le in Scotland.But Ms Sturgeon said her predecessor did not have ldquoa shred of evidence to support his claims.The submission was later re-released, with a number of paragraphs relating to the set-up of a meeting between Mr Salmond and his successor redacted.Is the committee inquiry the only investigation into the matter No. Ms Sturgeon is currently under investigation by James Hamilton QC to establishshe breached the ministerial code.Ms Sturgeon referred herself after being accused of misleading Parliament over when she knew of the complaints against Mr Salmond.She previously said she had been told about the allegations by Mr Salmond himself during a meeting in her home on April , .However, it was later found that Mr Salmondrsquos former chief of staff Geoff Aberdein had met with the First Minister in her Holyrood office four days prior to that, where she was told of the complaints.Scotlandrsquos first minister @NicolaSturgeon responds to @SkyNews exclusive the harassment committee has ruled she misled Parliament in her evidence.ldquoThe opposition members of this committee made their minds up about me before I uttered a single word of evidence. pic UNeUJsWhat has the committee concluded A leak on Thursday evening from inside the committee revealed it has concluded the First Minister misled the inquiry over whether she had offered to intervene in the case ndash which Ms Sturgeon denies doing.Two other witnesses, one of whom is Mr Salmondrsquos lawyer and former SNP MSP Duncan Hamilton and who was at the meeting in question, contradicted the First Ministerrsquos statement.The conclusion was arrived at following a - party line vote, with the four SNP members of the committee, including convener Linda Fabiani, supporting the First Ministerrsquos assertion.What happens next The decision is likely to increase pressure on Ms Sturgeon to stand down before Mayrsquos election, although it is unclear whether the act was deemed a resignation-worthy offence.Last night, Scottish Conservatives leader Douglas Ross called for her to quit.He said: ldquoThe committee will publish its findings in the coming days and we will wait for that report.ldquoBut we have already detailed that Nicola Sturgeon lied to the Scottish Parliament and for that, she must resign.

There will be no further comment on the report ahead of its publication.It is expected to be published on Tuesday.What has Nicola Sturgeon said Nicola Sturgeon has said a ldquovery partisan leak from the Alex Salmond inquiry is ldquonot that surprising as the committee is understood to have deemed she misled parliament.She told Sky News last night: ldquoI stand by all of the evidence I gave to the committee, all eight hoursrsquo worth of evidence.ldquoWhatrsquos been clear is that opposition members of this committee made their minds up about me before I muttered a single word of evidence, their public comments have made that clear.ldquoSo this leak from the committee ndash very partisan leak ndash tonight before theyrsquove finalised the report is not that surprising.She added that she is awaiting the result of the James Hamilton QC investigation into whether she broke the ministerial code.A spokesman for the First Minister previously added: ldquoThe First Minister told the truth to the committee in eight hours of evidence, and stands by that evidence.ldquoIt is clear from past public statements that opposition members of this committee had prejudged the First Minister at the outset of the inquiry and before hearing a word of her evidence, so this partisan and selective briefing ndash before the committee has actually published its final report ndash is hardly surprising.ldquoThe question of the First Ministerrsquos adherence to the ministerial code is being considered independently by James Hamilton, and we expect to receive and publish his report soon."},{"url":null,"title":"musselburgh-sea-cadets-virtual-walk-london-back","story":"Along with family members, they are logging their steps or kilometres, completed daily during March, via an online tracker which calculates the distance walked for each day.They had originally planned to walk km, from Musselburgh to London, but smashed their target distance and started thejourney back to the Honest Toun ndash a total of ,km.They have already raised nearly pound,.Chief Officer Mark Tfin , from Gorebridge, is supporting the unit ndash TS Indefatigable ndash by taking part in the virtual sponsored walk while on his Maersk Line Hamburg Sud ship off Chinarsquos coast, covering more than km.Funds raised will be used to provide training when the cadetsto their newly refurbished unit building on South Street after Covid- restrictions are eased.The property has undergone a full upgrade costing pound, to include new toilet and shower facilities, offices and classroom space.

receiving the AstraZeneca vaccine comes as a host of European countries announced they would begin using the jab once again following new safety assurances.A number of countries including Germany and France have reversed their decision to temporarily pause the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine over blood clot concerns after the European Medicines Agencycalled the vaccine ldquosafe and effective.France, Italy and Germany, along with Cyprus, Latvia and Lithuania, have confirmed they will resume rollout of the Oxford shot on Friday.While Spain, Portugal and the Netherlands said they will follow suit next week, although Spain said it could exclude certain groups.But do you have a choice in the matter  Can you pick and choose which of the currently approved vaccines you are injected withyou have worries about a particular one Here is everything you need to know about it:No.The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation has not advised a preference between the Pfizer-BioNTech, the Oxford-AstraZeneca or any other vaccines in the UKpopulation, stating that \"both give very high protection against severe disease... and both vaccines have good safety profiles\".The UKrsquos vaccine programme is offering vaccines in line with the supply of vaccines, and so the option to choose is not availablesay the NHS.In certain circumstances, you may be advised to have a certain vaccine by a medical professional, but this is not common, and will be discussed with you fully before hand you cannot request a certain vaccine for yourself.Earlier this week, Northern Irelandrsquos Health Minister made clear people cannot pick and choose what type of Covid- vaccine they receive as he moved to provide reassurance on the safety of the AstraZeneca jab.Robin Swann highlighted that the UKrsquos Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agencyhad found no evidence of a link between the vaccine and reported cases of blood clots in some European countries.Asked whether people who had concerns about the AstraZeneca jab could select a dferent type of vaccine, Swann said, ldquotherersquos no opportunity to pick and choose vaccines within our current programme.You will have to have two doses of the same vaccine.The MHRA has concluded that any link between the jab and clots is unproven The World Health Organisationis urging countries to continue using the AstraZeneca Covid- vaccine as global medical leaders meet to discuss reports of blood clots.Dr Soumya Swaminathan, WHOrsquos chief scientist, told a media briefing ldquowe do not want people to panic, as she said no association has been found so far between blood clots and Covid- vaccines.She said the rates at which blood clots have occurred in people who received the AstraZeneca vaccine ldquoare in fact less than what you would expect in the general population.Professor Anthony Harnden, deputy chairman of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, said there was ldquono demonstrable dference in the number of blood clots seen between the general population and the  million who have so far received the Oxford AstraZeneca jab to date.He told BBC Breakfast ldquobecause wersquore immunising so many people, we are bound to see blood clots at the same time as the vaccination.ldquoThatrsquos not because they are due to the vaccination. Thatrsquos because they occur naturally in the population. We have to remember that there are , blood clots a month on average in the general population.ldquoOne ought to also remember that Covid causes blood clots, added Prof Harnden. ldquoSo, the risks of not having the Covid vaccination far outweigh the risks from the vaccinations.The EMA has concluded there is no overall increase in the risk of blood clots with the vaccine Of course, taking up the offer of a Covid- vaccine remains voluntary, and there are currently no plans to make being immunised.But members of the public are being urged to accept offers of a jab as soon as they can, and being reassured that all vaccines available are safe, and have been developed under the usual strict, regulatory practices.Peter Openshaw, professor of experimental medicine at Imperial College London, said the decision to pause rollout of the Oxford AstraZeneca jab could be a ldquodisaster for Covid- vaccine uptake in Europe.Asked what he would say to those in the UK who are booked to receive an Oxford jab, Prof Openshaw told BBC Radio rsquos Today programme: ldquoI really wouldnrsquot be worried at the present time.ldquoI think it is very clear that the benefits of being vaccinated at the moment so far outweigh the possible concern over this rather rare type of blood clot, he added. ldquoI think it is a disaster for the vaccination uptake in Europe, which is already on slightly unsteady ground in some countries."},{"url":null,"title":"aldi-lidl-middle-aisles-available-sunday-march-21","story":"Weve rounded-up some of the highlights to look out for in each supermarket.AldiThis week, Aldi are looking ahead to Easterwith themed products and decorations offered at discount prices.These include:This inflatable bunny is available to spruce up your home in time for Easter.

That problem continues to pose concerns, not least over whether the sizeable gatherings outside Ibrox and in Glasgowrsquos George Square might be repeated, perhaps at the upcoming Old Firm match.I watched Celtic draw with Dundee United last weekend, a result which guaranteed the Premiership for Rangers. Football fans will perhaps understand that my first thought was that my team, United, now had virtually no chance of securing a top six place in the league, and thus avoiding a possible relegation battle. BRIAN TAYLOR:This is not a civil war in the SNP. This is more vicious and more visceralHowever, the wider consequences soon emerged as Rangers fans mustered to celebrate their teamrsquos success, in clear breach of rules prohibiting mass gatherings.Condemnation was swt from the First Minister, Opposition leaders and the police. While praising Rangersrsquo sporting achievement, they declared that the supportersrsquo actions were unacceptable and dangerous. They reminded us bluntly that closely packed crowds had the potential to spread disease and even death.Let us be clear. Parliament has the democratic power to prescribe rules. Within those rules, the police have a duty to proscribe behaviour which threatens the peace and, in this case, the health of citizens. Law and order must be maintained.The question is how. What is the truly effective way to prevent repetition  To do that, we need to understand the motivations underlying the behaviour we all witnessed.Otherwise, we risk making matters worse, we risk reinforcing a negative stereotype. To say this is in no way ndash I stress, in no way whatsoever ndash to condone the behaviour on display. It was dangerous and, potentially, deadly.Nicola Sturgeon has warned the Old FirmFirstly, I would broadly exculpate the police. You will hear it said either that they over-reacted or that they should have made far more arrests.The police did not create the situation. The fans gathered instinctively, emotively, no doubt prompted by social media. The police had to deal with events as they found them.An over-zealous response would have risked provoking the crowd, amplying the challenge to public order. Precisely the opposite of what the police were seeking to achieve.Secondly, consider the intrinsic nature of football support. We are dealing here with fans, or fanatics. For many, their le is defined by their vigorous adherence to their team. They exult in victory, they despair at defeat.This particular triumph for Rangers followed a decade without winning the league title a decade in which they had to rise from the lowest rank in Scottish football. In winning, they thwarted their greatest rivals.More generally, many fans regard their support for their team in an antithetical fashion to rival clubs, or even to society more generally. It is no accident that many supporters sing ldquonobody likes us, we donrsquot care. Their contrived self-image is as a beleaguered tribe, standing together against an external foe or an uncaring world.That is true of the most fervent of fans generally but it is particularly true of the Old Firm. Their adherents will often define themselves in contradistinction to the other side. Which can present a challenge for neutral observers or, indeed, for politicians seeking to intervene.Grimacing wryly, Nicola Sturgeon told MSPs this week that half of Glasgow presumed she was partisan for one side of the Old Firm while the other half presumed exactly the contrary. She was, she stressed, unconcerned about the colour of the shirt.It was also notable in Rangersrsquo official statement that they immediately drew attention to what they regarded as ldquoan unbalanced approach adopted towards their half of the Old Firm.In that same statement, Rangers insisted they had taken every step to pre-empt and deter such behaviour. It might be pertinent to note here that broader support for that analysis is distinctly limited. Further, eventhey were doing all they could, then those efforts demonstrably failed.Crucially, however, Rangers supporters will agree with their club. They will discern bias against them which others do not spot. Such a standpoint is not entirely unknown on the other side of the Glasgow sporting ide, nor indeed in football more generally. They are not known as fans for nothing. Once again, that does not remotely exonerate the behaviour we witnessed.However, it is also the case that there are many Rangers fans who will regret the scenes witnessed, who will seek to dispel any bad odour lingering around their clubrsquos remarkable success. As The Herald reported, supportersrsquo groups have raised thousands of pounds to repair damaged benches in George Square.Equally, though, those of us who are football fans need to reflect that many, perhaps most, people in Scotland are not. BRIAN TAYLOR:Sturgeonrsquos inquiry performance was thorough, respectful, controlled and capableRemember Brenda from Bristol  On being told that a further General Election was pending, she replied: ldquoYoursquore joking! What, another one !Translate that from Brendarsquos broad Bristol accent into Scots, and you have it pat. For many in Scotland, their reaction to another controversy in football is ennui. They find it weary, stale and flat full of sound and fury and signying nothing.In that light, we now need action which will be effective, rather than simply voluble. Perhaps a promise of substantial celebrations deferred, linked to the warning that the Old Firm game may have to be cancelled. Perhaps a reminder of possible sanctions by the European football authority.It will not be sufficient for that message to be delivered solely by politicians. Still less, by the police. That will not work with the truly zealous.Football leaders must douse their instinctive indignation and urge compliance. Consistently and without equivocation. In tandem with politicians and the police. It may be exasperating that such effort is required but anything  risks further failure.

He has talked of an RAF Space Command, National Cyber Force, the new RAF Stealth Tempest aircraft and unmanned drones. How then to make ends meet given no Conservative PM will jettison the eye-watering poundbn Dreadnought programme  Indeed he has reaffirmed his commitment to it with the unexpected announcement of an increase to  nuclear warheads. The question is pertinent. The UK already has the most sophisticated submarines in the world with the seven Astute-class boats with Tomahawk Cruise missiles weapons this country could actually use.The answer is staring us in the face.We have long known that the UK could not afford to operate the two super aircraft carriers, HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince Of Wales, which left Rosyth in  and .To some they were a vanity project, holed below the waterline and a relic of a bygone age. They were useless against terrorism, or cyber warfare or attack by a swathe of small fast attack boats with anti ship missiles.With little public scrutiny or knowledge, the first has effectively been integrated with the US Navy accompanied by US warships and with mainly US Fbs on deck.These aircraft which have cost the UK pound million each have a myriad problems worth googling.The fact they are not stealth at supersonic speed, lose in dogfights with s Fs and are inferior to the RAF Typhoon is all rather disconcerting. It is clear, and not before time, that the UK is to cancel the order for the , leaving the  we are committed to.HMS Prince Of Wales will get \"Cats And Traps\"to facilitate the use of unmanned drones and the new RAF Tempest in time. There are other options. The French want a replacement for the Charles De Gaulle and the Germans want a European aircraft carrier but those , do not signy a global reach.The Queens Speech talked of forging stronger ties of European security.Will these straitened times even yet impose realpolitik on our defence policy John V Lloyd, Inverkeithing.TRANS-PACIFIC PLAN REEKS OF FANTASYLEWIS Carroll would have made hay with the new topsy-turvy future envisaged for us in the Prime Ministers recent presentation.His vision of a Trans-Pacic partnership reeks of a fantasy world where agreements can be reached at the drop of a hat or a scurry down a rabbit hole, their conditions meaning whatever you want them to mean.Our geographical locale harnesses us conveniently to the nearest land mass on our doorstep and yet we have ventured to cut those ties to pursue a cavalier Brexit. Trade with our closest neighbours still looks far more advantageous with the convenience of the supply lines to guarantee the smooth flow of goods rather than throwing our hands in with emerging economies so remote in geographical terms.Militarily we are small fry in global terms, our armed services being in steep decline numerically and in ing equipment from all accounts, and we appear to be throwing in our lot with distant powers such as Japan, India, Australia and Uncle Tom Cobley and all with a Trans-Pacic partnership. Would we expect them to ride to our rescue , we were threatened by Russia Common sense tells us that our security rests upon close collaboration with our nearby neighbours with the added support which stems from our historic relationship with the United States, which is best placed to protect the interests of all allies in the Pacic region against the intrusions of China.We belong to the peashooter brigade in any likely confrontation with the might of China.Britains prosperity and security are both tied up with, and dependent upon, a harmonious relationship with our next-door neighbours from whom we have chosen to estrange ourselves.Boris Through The Looking Glass is an oeuvre worthy of the imagination of the man who immortalised Alice for our entertainment.Dennis Bruce, Bishopbriggs.WHY FRIENDSHIP WITH CHINA IT has just been revealed, after a freedom of information request, that Cabinet Secretary Roseanna Cunningham contacted China over the cost of the giant pandas at Edinburgh Zoo and the lack of income caused by the coronavirus lockdown. The annual fee for these giant pandas is about pound,. Ms Cunningham said the pandas were \"a great symbol of the friendship between Scotland and China\".\"Friendship\"  So her SNP Government condones violence in Hong Kong and the detention of millions of Uighurs in \"re-education centres\" in Xinjiang region  China recently warned Taiwan that any attempt to seek independence \"means war\". What would she saythe UK Government told the Scottish Government that any attempt to seek independence \"means war\" Clark Cross, Linlithgow.SNP MERELY A MEANS TO AN ENDWHAT a relief it was to read Willie Macleanrsquos responseto Dr Gerald Edwards . I too have often wondered how so many of your correspondents can be so easily conned into believing that the government of an independent Scotland would be an SNP one, and how someone with a doctorate can be so unable to apply the simplest of logic to disprove this assumption.At the moment, there are many folk in the independence movement who are not SNP supporters, quite a number of Labour ones, dissatisfied with their natural partyrsquos stance, and even a few Tories. So when independence comes, as it certainly will, these people will vote for the party they want to hold power and whose policies they want implemented.One point therefore, which Mr Maclean could have added, is that when the SNP has helped us achieve our goal, it may actually have signed its own death warrant as a party.Independence is not about any one party, either in power or opposition at the moment, but about ensuring that when the majority of Scots vote, they get the government they voted for.L McGregor, Falkirk.A DOOM-LADEN NARRATIVEIN response to Douglas Cowe , why does he ignore achievements like free tuition, elderly care, female sanitary products, prescriptions, the mitigation of the bedroom tax, a better, fairer social security system with the powers we have, the Scots child poverty payment scheme, the Queensferry Crossing, new hospitals, free tolls and much more.He mentioned BiFab and Prestwick Airport, but unlike the Tories, the SNP chose to retain jobs rather than shrug their shoulders and show indference to them. We have record low crime, more GPs per head, more and better paid nurses and care staff per head and better spending on our NHS than any of the four nations. And far better waiting and appointment target success.The SNP is solely determined to improve our lot ndash a Scottish peoples party ndash and the alternatives are Scottish Labour party, a hollow branch of a twitching-corpse London opposition and an incompetent, law-breaking, anti-society Tory Party which foisted Brexit on us against our national will destroying businesses and exports. The Tories are also determined to see our Parliament crippled, by-passed, even done away with altogether.The Scots public are not stupid and can see through the unionist medias howling,  and hysterical doom-laden narrative.Gavin Ferguson, Coatbridge.TIME FOR MALES TO MAN UPI WRITE this on International Womens Day, and the tragedy of Sarah Everards murder led me think deeply once more about the weight of feelings that so many women must live with, occasionally, or on a daily basis.Hers was by no means a singular devastating event, and the apparent escalation of such is testament to the need for men to stop the pain.It is of course a Utopian concept, that men should be caring partners to all women, and protective fathers to all children, but is this too much to aspire to I feel so saddened, and not a little ashamed by the behaviour of so many men who create so much pain, ugliness and desolation in this world, despite knowing that there are so many more men who do love and care for our women folk.Woman gives Le, she creates, nourishes, and nurture and deserves so much more from us men, .A profound redefinition of what masculinity really means must be faced and embraced, not the the \"sensitive-new-age-guys\" but men with real courage to face their own problems, and to be able to admit it is us that are the problem for women. This is not an abnegation of manhood, rather it is a celebration. The lack of love in its greater and wider sense is a manestation of current events, and has no place in the hearts and minds of self-aware, questing, progressive st century men.Women should never under any circumstances live under the shroud of fear of any sort, but feel cared for, respected, and safe.So come on men, time to man up, rethink, grow, and bring some peace and love to our world, or at least to our own small corner of it.Peter Ryan, Moffat."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-must-different-rule-scotland","story":"Sir Keir Starmer joins in the witch hunt, calling for Ms Sturgeon to goshe has misled parliament .

I make two points from this: first, like myself, Mr Cowe appears to be beyond middle age but unfortunately his powers of recollection are decidedly rose-tinted as I will demonstrate below, and secondly, in an independent Scotland he will be able to vote for a party of his own choice and get the government Scotland chooses ndash a new democratic experience for all of us.It is here I must apologise, for there is simply insufficient space to record the peace-loving harmonious existence of the people living in the homogenous United Kingdom of Mr Cowersquos memory. From  onwards we have had many protests, some very violent ndash CND, the Winter of Discontent, the minersrsquo strike, Greenham Common, Toxteth riots, dockers strikes, London riots with civil unrest, Northern Ireland troubles, fuel protests, the poll tax, anti-Iraq War demonstrations and so on. What is it Mr Cowe yearns for Some would of course wish to argue that the Scottish independence referendum of  was a nasty, violent affair but the bald fact is, one politician got hit by a single egg much to the chagrin of Better Together, who likened it to something altogether more unpleasant, although no one was injured and no one died in the entire two-year violence-free campaign.Clearly a British nationalist and nothing wrong with that, Mr Cowe and his fellow nationalists are quite withering about Scotland, yet seldom stop to think that in accusing others of xenophobia, the removal of the UK from the EU is in itself an act of narrow-minded isolationism. Loosely quoting from the Queenrsquos comments at Balmoral during the  campaign, Mr Cowe concludes: ldquoVoters need to think very carefully where to put the X in May and I could not agree more.

Perhaps, more than any other manager, Moyes has benefited from their absence. At one time chucking away a three-goal lead, as his side did yesterday against Arsenal, would have had the boo-boys spitting out their larynxes, the ire would have spilled over to the next game and there would have been a predictable self-perpetuating run of defeats to follow. Instead, shorn of the London Stadiums poisonous atmosphere, West Ham boast the second best home record in the league this season.There was a bit more clarity over the identity of which team will suffer relegationIts fairly safe to assume that Sheffield United are gone, West Brom too, but Fulhams fate looks less well defined. Meanwhile, Newcastles abject defeat at the hands of Brighton on Saturday brought up their sixth successive game without a win under Steve Bruce and have won just twice since the turn of the year.That form would be risible enough in isolation but compounding fears that relegation is inevitable comes from a study of Newcastles opponents in their run in. Tottenham ndash admittedly with problems of their own ndash are up next but then comes a series of fixtures which will have Newcastle fans suffering heart palpitations. West Ham, Liverpool, Arsenal, Leicester and Manchester City are all on the calendar in the weeks.Should it come to pass this would be Newcastles third relegation under Mike Ashley. In , club revenue dropped by poundm, seven years later that figure had leapt to poundm ndash it promises to be higher this time arounds. They have bounced back before there seems much less likelihood of it happening a third time.Nothing stopping CityNo team has completed the domestic treble in England before. Manchester United managed to secure a famous hat-trick of trophies in  when they won the league title, FA Cup and Champions League but were knocked out of the League Cup by eventual winners Tottenham in the quarter-finals.Spurs finished mid-table that season attesting to just how dficult it is to fight on three fronts let alone four. Since then, of course, United have ceded their status as Englands dominant team to Manchester City.It would be another slap in the face for the Old Trafford club were their neighbours to become the first English club to not just equal their record of winning a treble but go one better by claiming the first ever quadruple. The Premier League is theirs, they face a mutinous Spurs in next months Carabao Cup final and were paired with a beatable Borussia Dortmund in Fridays Champions League draw.Chuck in a dogged - win over Everton on Saturday to reach the FA Cup semi-final and its definitely on. At odds of   you wouldnt be raiding the le savings for a punt but the price reflects just how live bookies think their chances are of achieving the feat.A bit of a balls upDion Dublin carried out the FA Cup semi-final draw on his own during half-time in Leicester Citys win over Manchester United. He extolled the virtues of the tournament as the best in the world and one that had lost none of its lustre, despite staggered kick-off times and Premier League matches also running this weekend.It was a claim that lost the rest of its credibility the minute he started to pluck balls out of a bag to pair teams up in the midst of a match in which that games winners knew who they would play next ndash unlike the other quarter-final winners Cha, Southampton and Man City.Gilmour deserves a call-upThomas Tuchel was almost apologetic to Billy Gilmour in his pre-match press conference prior to Chas FA Cup quarter-final win over Sheffield United, saying that he kept him at Stamford Bridge in January for selfish reasons.The decision closed the door on loan offers from others almost certainly cost Gilmour his place in Steve Clarkes squad for the forthcoming World Cup qualiers against Austria, Israel and Faroe Islands.The Cha manager urged Clarke to pick him anyway saying that the only reason he wasnt making his starting line-up was because of the presence of Ngolo Kante, Mateo Kovacic and Jorginho ndash three players whom Tuchel says are never injured - in his squad. Debates about the respective merits of at least one of that trio vis-a-vis Gilmours ability aside, he had a general point.Gilmour is already worthy of inclusion in the Scotland squad as evidenced by his general performance yesterday and one little cameo where he won a - ball against John Fleck, a midfielder whohasbeen included in Clarkes selection."},{"url":null,"title":"alex-salmond-inquiry-women-make-complaint-parliament-salmond-evidence-leaks","story":"In a statement released through Rape Crisis Scotland on Sunday, the two women who made complaints of harassment against former first minister Alex Salmond said they would be making a formal complaint over the leak.A story in The Sunday Times claims the women, giving evidence in private last Monday, painted a picture of a demeaning environment for women, with one saying it was ldquolike the Wild West.We are issuing a statement on behalf of the two complainers whose evidence to the inquiry has been leaked: https:t.co RmgsMHYgcu pic HwxiVFcleomdash Rape Crisis ScotlandMarch , The statement said the leak was a breach of the MSP code of conduct, as well as ldquoa violation of the trust we placed in the committee, and raised concerns about the accuracy of the leak.It added: ldquoThe reporting of our evidence has included inaccuracies and distortions, which appear to be intended to serve a political agenda.ldquoComplainers in this case have been subject to regular attacks and misrepresentations on social media, and have found their experiences repeatedly exploited for political purposes during the inquiry.ldquoFor a committee members to perpetuate this is indefensible and an abuse of their position.ldquoWe will be making a formal complaint.The inquiry is expected to come to a head this week, with the Committee on the Scottish Government Handling of Harassment Complaints due to publish its final report.Portions of the report, where MSPs voted - to conclude that First Minister Nicola Sturgeon misled the committee over a meeting with Mr Salmond, were leaked last week.The First Minister described the leak as ldquopartisan, while the committeersquos convener Linda Fabiani said she was ldquodismayed the information had been disclosed before the final report was published.The independent investigation into the ministerial code, being conducted by James Hamilton, is also expected to report this week and could prove more dangerous for the current First Ministershe was found to have knowingly breached the code.Nicola Sturgeon referred herself for investigation after she was accused of misleading parliament over when she knew about allegations against Mr Salmond.The Scottish Tories have given Ms Sturgeon until Tuesday to resign, or she will face a vote of no confidence on Wednesday, due to what the party says is ldquooverwhelming proof she broke the ministerial code."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/11581402.jpg?type=article-full","title":"finding-jack-charlton---watch-time-bbc","story":"The film is set to be aired on the BBC this month - heres everything you need to know.When can I watch Finding Jack Charlton Finding Jack Charlton will air on BBC Two on March  at pm.# A special feature- film, Finding Jack Charlton will air on the BBC at the end of March.It explores the le of an English World Cup-winning legend who became an Irish hero.The film also details Jackrsquos previously undocumented le with dementia. pic YOBYWzvTZWhat is Finding Jack Charlton about The film tells the story of the le of Jack Charlton who won the World Cup with England in  who then went on to apply for the England managers job.

However, its % share of the list vote is in line with its January average.These BMG figures for SNP support are exactly in line with those of five other polls conducted since Mr Salmond and Ms Sturgeon made their appearances before the Holyrood inquiry into the handling of harassment complaints against Mr Salmond.: The Heralds exclusive poll reveals SNP set for kne-edge majority in Holyrood voteThis suggests that whatever damage was done to the SNPrsquos popularity when the Salmond vs. Sturgeon row first hit the headlines in February has been limited to an initial hit rather than a continual erosion.However, most of the interviewing for the poll was conducted before leaks of some of the findings of the parliamentary inquiry, including the accusation that the First Minister misled the committee.And the SNP cannot afford to lose any more supportthe party is to win an overall majority in May ndash and thereby make it more dficult for the UK government simply to say No to another referendum.Meanwhile, the poll puts support for independence at % - still somewhat lower than in some polls last year, but no lower than the average of the polls in January.This matters because it appears that, for most voters, whether or not they are willing to back the SNP depends on whether they support independence or not.No less than % of those who say they would vote Yes in a second independence referendum say they will back the SNP on the constituency ballot.

former first minister Alex Salmond.ndash How did the investigation start Following Mr Salmondrsquos successful legal challenge of the Scottish Governmentrsquos procedure, which led to him being awarded pound, for legal costs, Ms Sturgeon referred herself to the independent adviser on the ministerial code.That adviser, Mr Hamilton, is a former director of public prosecutions in Ireland.His

breaking ministerial code over Alex Salmond affairMr Salmond was acquitted of  charges, including sexual assault, indecent assault and attempted rape, in March  following a High Court trial.ndash What has the inquiry been looking at A key part of the investigation is the timing of when Ms Sturgeon knew about the complaints made against Mr Salmond andparliament was properly informed.Mr Salmond said his successor made ldquo and manestly untrue statements to MSPs several times.Ms Sturgeon initially told Holyrood she first heard of the sexual misconduct complaints against her predecessor when they met at her home on April  .But it later emerged she discussed the allegations with Mr Salmondrsquos chief of staff, Geoff Aberdein, in her Holyrood office four days earlier.Ms Sturgeon said she had forgotten the contents of her discussion with Mr Aberdein and it was her meeting with Mr Salmond which was ldquoseared on her memory.Mr Hamilton examined the allegation that parliament was misled and found there was no breach of the ministerial code.He also said that her failure to record meetings and telephone conversations with Mr Salmond and others did not amount to a breach of the code.ndash What could the implications be A vote of no confidence in the First Minister, tabled by the Conservatives, is due to go ahead in the Scottish Parliament on Tuesday.However, it is likely to fail as the Scottish Greens have said they will vote with the SNP.Scottish Greens co-leader Patrick Harvie said some of the committee members had ldquoshown utter contempt for the women involved, and for the rules of the Scottish Parliament, by leaking confidential evidence and their own conclusions.He said: ldquoIf anyonersquos resignation is still needed, it is these MSPs who should step down now, and

The first of these is now under way. #This involves work to construct a new entrance vestibule, with essential maintenance work on the front elevation of the cathedral being carried out at the same time.“The second part of the project — to improve access to the Cathedral — is currently the subject of a design review after listed building consent was turned down for the current plans.”Recently, approval was sought by OIC to develop the exterior of the west entrance — by installing a ramp, handrails, and raising the flagstones to become level with the entrance. However, the proposed developments were rejected by councillors at a meeting of the planning committee on Wednesday, March .The spokeswoman added: “The project will take several months, with a projected completion date of late August.“During this time, access to the cathedral will continue to be through the south nave side door — there are signs directing the public through the side gate.“Please be aware that there may be restricted access and some noise disruption, whilst the work is carried out.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The same is not true for our island communities, which have been left in limbo.“A fortnight ago, in response to my question, Nicola Sturgeon insisted that Orkney would move to Level Two when the rest of the country moved to Level Three. Now, this seems to be up in the air and subject to further discussions.“I have no dficulty with the government wanting to take account of the views of islanders in these decisions. However, there is no reason why this could not have happened prior to today’s statement.“Across Scotland, preparations will now be underway for what happens at the end of April. Meantime, people and businesses in Orkney are still in the dark.“We need urgent clarication from Ministers about who is to be consulted and when a decision can be expected. If travel is indeed the main factor holding up a decision, the government should step up efforts to put in place testing at entry points.“Nicola Sturgeon’s previous statement made no mention of islands at all.

It was then that the first serious air-raid of World War II began, as The Orcadian reported on the following Thursday.#The thunder of the heavy anti-aircraft guns shook Kirkwall houses, rattled windows and domestic utensils. The blast in some cases blew open the wooden shutters of windows, the sashes of which had been opened to avoid being broken by the concussion. The ground quivered when bombs fell considerable distances off.#At least  German aircraft attacked Scapa Flow and HMS Sparrowhawk, the airfield on the outskirts of Kirkwall, but the worst effects of the raid were felt in Stenness. The German claim that airfields at Kirkwall and Stromness were attacked lends weight to the theory that the civilian airfield on the Stromness side of the Bridge of Waithe, used by Gandar Dower before the war, was mistaken for a military target.The eye-witness accounts published in The Orcadian and Orkney Herald, although clearly reworded by the journalists, gives a vivid picture of the evening when everyday surroundings became so terryingly strange.The Bridge of Waithe, which carries the Stromness-Kirkwall road over the sea entrance to the Stenness Loch, gave its name to the little cluster of buildings around the nearby junction with the Orphir Road. The building on the corner became famous after the war as Orkney’s night-club, the Golden Slipper, but in  it was Willie Farquhar’s cobbler’s shop. Like many cobbler’s shops in Orkney, it was a place where men would gather in the evening so Willie and his mother Ellen had begun to sell lemonade, cigarettes and sweets. A young family lived at the other end of the little row: James and Lily Isbister with their three-month old son Neil. Another young family, Alfie and Cathy Linklater with ten-month old Freddie, lived in the house just behind them, at right angles to the road. Isa McLeod was in the house on the other side of the road.The Orcadian interviewed Mrs Ellen Farquhar just a few days after the bombing . . .For the rest of this story, see the current edition of this week#s The Orcadian, or visit Patrica’s website, www.aboutorkneyPatricia Long is a tourist guide based in Stenness, with a particular interest in social history. copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We’re not complaining about that — the ferry pays its dues — but we have to find a way of reconciling the effect that has on Ullapool#s tourist trade because the place where visitors congregate to admire the loch and the view is Shore Street.In addition, the -year-old sea wall will be replaced with a higher structure to protect the village from rising sea levels.As part of the pre-application consultation, an online Zoom meeting will be held tonight at pm when the proposals will be presented for the first time and as many people as possible are being urged to take part.To join the meeting people can visit the website: http:www.ullapool-harbour or phone    and enter meeting ID:  to listen in.Anyone who wishes to make representations can do so by contacting Fiona Henderson, Affric Limited, Lochview Office, Loch Duntelchaig, Farr, IV AW, or by email: consultation@affriclimited, by th March ."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ARCHIVE-CENT-ANGUS-OG-6.jpg","title":"chust lovely angus og finds a new home in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe collection of the comic strips were handed over to the Skye and Lochalsh Archive Centre in Portree, in recognition of Angus Òg creator Ewen Bain and his family links to Skye.Ewen was brought up in Maryhill, Glasgow but his father John hailed from Waternish and his mother Flora from Staffin.

Angus Òg ran six days a week in the Record and Sunday Mail until Ewen died in , a victim of a flu epidemic which struck that year.has also been set up to allow people to see the cartoon creations."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/KYLEAKIN-PLAYPARK-1-scaled.jpg","title":"new playpark in kyleakin after community reach fundraising","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe new playpark will be sited on land donated by Kyleakin Feus near to the village hall and local primary school.A mixture of community fundraising, grants and contributions linked to the building of new housing in the village has helped complete the funding package and parent Maddie Newsome, who has chaired the fundraising group, said she was delighted to see all the local efforts bearing fruit.She said: “The committee are delighted to be able to bring the project into reality in such a short time and want to thank all the donors for theirgenerosity.“The new play park will provide a fun, creative and social outdoor play area for the young children of Kyleakin and surrounding villages, and the support from local groups, businesses and the local council has been overwhelming.”Funding was made possible thanks to National Lottery players as the lottery’s community fund gave £,.The National Lottery Community Fund Scotland Chair Kate Still said: “In these uncertain times our priority is to ensure that National Lottery money continues to flow to charities, voluntary sector organisations and grassroots groups. I would like to congratulate Kyleakin Playpark project on their award, theirs is an important project and will support people now and in the future when they can physically come back together to make great things happen in their community.”The final piece in the funding jigsaw came from a Highland Council ward discretionary grant of £,.Local councillor John Finlayson said: “Myself and fellow members were really impressed by the fundraising drive to date and the fact that through ious channels, almost £, of the funding was secured before the ward discretionary was turned to.“The fundraising to date made the decision to support the final piece in the jigsaw very easy and members were keen to point out that this project highlights how community drive and partnership working, that includes a clear strategic vision, can achieve positive outcomes.”James MacQueen Building Contractor’s Limited gave £, and a developers’ contribution from Lochalsh and Skye Housing Association of £, was made linked to the construction of the new houses.A further £, came through the Kyleakin Gala MOWI Scotland donated £, Kyleakin and Kylerhea Community Council gave £, online crowdfunding brought in £, while £ was raised through the Balmacara SPAR.It is hoped that the park will be completed by late summertime."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/LAMB-SALES-19-2.jpg","title":"the responsibility of a crofter is not to do as you","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineIt is far from a new problem and one that very much sits hand in hand with a long-standing wider issue in relation to crofting development and productivity – lack of use and neglect.You don’t need to go far to come across overgrown and rank crofts, where fences have rotted away and the ground has been covered in a blanket of coarse, dead vegetation. It is a depressingly all-too familiar sight.“Stagnation” was the term Mr MacKinnon used, and he was spot on.As lives become ever more disconnected from the land, it’s quite understandable why people no longer have the inclination, or time, particularly when there is no great financial . But how it must frustrate those desperate to work the land to see all these crofts going to waste.Survey after survey has demonstrated a huge interest from people wanting to get a foot on the ladder, but they can’t because the traditional avenue of family inheritance is not open to them.The croft tenancies that do come on the market go for astronomical sums, way beyond the reach of young families and completely out of kilter with agricultural potential.And this is the problem, the reason that so many people hold onto non-working crofts is because they can see the pound signs they can see what it might fetch in terms of its housing potential, with estate agents only too happy to downplay the fact that every croft tenancy sale and every de-crofting application has to be approved by the Crofting Commission. It’s not proved too much of an impediment in the past.In fairness to the commission, they have made improvements. As much as the law enables, they do now try and prevent housing speculation – although one recent case in Lochalsh suggests there may be still some way to go. And they have at least made the right noises about dealing with neglect, which has prompted an increase in formal sub-leases and tenancy transfers.But as Mr MacKinnon noted, it is dficult for them to really stamp their authority without the proper resources.So an impasse remains, young families are unable to get access to land while countless crofts go to waste.But there is a solution, evenit will make for an uncomfortable journey: remove the ability to trade tenancies on the open market and at the same time get rid of the right to buy a croft. At a stroke, those motivated purely for monetarywill disappear their incentive gone. Then arm the commission with the necessary resources to properly tackle neglect —rather than the current practice of gentle encouragement without force — and those who have crofts but can’t do the work will have to quickly find a solution. Step forward new entrants.Granted, the opposition to such an approach will likely be signicant. Denying people the opportunity to do with an asset what they please will be seen as anti-libertarian, a curb on personal freedom, and you can easily predict the outrage.But the responsibility of a crofter is not to do as you please. You are part of a unique system of land tenure which was established nearly  years ago to keep people and communities alive. That is still very much of relevance today. Denying those fortunate enough to have crofts from lining their own pockets and ensuring everyone lives up to their duties doesn’t seem an unreasonable expectation in that context.It is expected that, Covid recovery depending, the new term of the Scottish Parliament willto the matter of crofting reformand there is an opportunity here for a proper radical approach which addresses the needs of crofting today but, crucially, with the principles of old at its heart.It will require politicians and leaders of strength and conviction who are able to make a compelling case in the face of undoubted opposition, who can the see the vision that a new, radical approach will bring and who can reject pressure from all sorts of vested interests. The trouble is: there is precious little evidence of that calibre of inidual in Scotland’s political landscape of today.IT SEEMS like only yesterday I was talking about preparing for the winter and here we are with spring on the horizon. Soon the digital clock in the van will be at the right time again. I have more reason than usual to hope for a good lambing. The scanning results were on the disappointing side,  empty out of  and  sets of twins giving an overall percentage of around . Not a disaster by any means, particularly in this part of the world, but my own lowest tally ever, as usually I’m looking at somewhere around the  to  per cent mark.I suspect an underlying issue with fluke at tupping time. Fasciola hepaticais a tiny mud snail which is ingested through grazing and attacks the liver. It thrives in wet conditions and is re in Scotland.There are routine treatments, but it’s now recognised that the parasite is developing a resistance to some of the products on the market. As a result of that, the advice is to constantly use dferent ones and I probably wasn’t as meticulous in this as I should have been, although I know that others too have had increased problems with fluke in the early part of the winter – and it was horrendously wet in November through to December.So the dry, hard frost of a couple of weeks ago was a godsend and it was on such a bracing but beautul morning that we gathered for the scanning, the ground underfoot like uneven concrete. You could have gotten away with your trainers.Once the work was completeI linked up my iPhone with the scanner and a detailed breakdown of the results popped up on the screen. A couple of pings later and it was out in the ether, all the way out to the North Sea where it was downloaded by someone not able to be in attendance to view his own results almost instantaneously.It was a lovely symbiosis of tradition and technology, though goodness knows what the bodachs of yesteryear would have made of it all."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/John_Purser-202030713-edited.jpg","title":"tobar and dualchais pure escapism among the fenian","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThat may explain why story-telling and mythology were so highly prized.

You could say she was pursuing the romantic Celtic dream, but with Father Allan and the people of Eriskay she found it, and it was no more a dream than was she herself.We should be immensely grateful to her. Her style of writing may seem slightly arch to some today, but none other than Padraic Colum was happy to write the foreword to her book, full of praise for her writing skills.She was a kind of predecessor of Margaret Fay Shaw, that most redoubtable of ladies, made of Pittsburgh steel, chain-smoking and with a bourbon to hand and her beloved piano just across the room.

Phase , after the Easter break, will expand the programme to include all staff in primary schoolsThe third phase will add nursery, pre-school and, at least initially, pre-school education providers participating in the Pre-School Education Programme.Department of Education advice said that the LFD test was not “% perfect but the speed and convenience of LFD tests means they are very successful in identying asymptomatic iniduals”.“A small proportion of people may receive a  positive result but in NI anyone testing positive must immediately book a PCR test to confirm the result.“It is also possible to get a  negativean inidual is in the early stages of infection,” the Department said.“This is why everyone will be tested regularly so that no cases will be missed.”\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland ebe .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_fdb-cb--ab-aeb_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland ebe .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_fdb-cb--ab-aeb_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland ebe .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_fdb-cb--ab-aeb_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland ebe .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_fdb-cb--ab-aeb_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"A lateral flow immunoassay diagnostic device  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueA lateral flow immunoassay diagnostic device The LFD programme aims for two tests to be carried out before Easter, and one prior toto school as an additional mitigation to reduce asymptomatic cases in school.Iniduals who receive a positive result from an LFD test will have to isolate along with members of their households from the time of their positive LFD result.A confirmation PCR test will be required for everyone who tests positive on LFD.If the PCR test result is negative, the inidual and their household can leave isolation and no further action is required.If the PCR test result is positive the inidual and their household and all other close contacts must complete a full ten days of self-isolation.Is it compulsory No. Consent forms will have to be signed and initially that is where the responsibility of teachers ends. Whether pupils take the test is left up to inidual families.Pupils in Years - and staff in post primary schools will be offered the tests twice weekly from next week, and teaching union the NASUWT said that schools “have not been given the time necessary to ensure the delivery of a competent testing system that will be robust and effective”.After the Easter holidays, all staff in primary and pre-schools will also be offered regular testing and the Department of Education plans to make the tests available for all pupils “at a later date”.The Lateral Flow Devicetests, which give a result in  minutes, will be offered to the oldest pupils and staff in post primary schools.Read MoreNI special schools to receive rapid Covid testingNI schools plan another failure by #ineffectual# Education Minister, claims teachers# unionUnions say that no guidance has been issued and training will consist of a webinar for principalsfollowed up by a series of frequently asked questions.School leaders have now been told they will have to issue consent forms and record who has received kits, but tests will not be taken in school.“Once pupils have received kits you should arrange a demonstration for them of how to use the kit the first time,” a document issued by the PHA and the Education Authority said on Thursday night.“The pupils then take their kit home to conduct their first test.”Schools were only notied last Monday, March , that they would organise testing for staff and pupils in Years - from theirto school on Monday March .What are the teaching unions saying about it The last minute rushing through of the testing procedure has angered teaching unions.“The Department of Education must work with unions and schools on a sensible timescale for the roll out of testing which is backed with the necessary practical and financial support,” said NASUWT General Secretary Dr Patrick Roach.“We all want pupils and school staff to be as safe as possible in school but an unplanned, uncoordinated and unworkable approach to mass testing without the provision of adequate resources and additional trained personnel risks undermining, rather than enhancing Covid safety.”\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland bab .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_fc-dd--bcbc-eefffb_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland bab .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_fc-dd--bcbc-eefffb_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland bab .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_fc-dd--bcbc-eefffb_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland bab .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_fc-dd--bcbc-eefffb_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Nasuwt’s Dr Patrick Roach.

Teachers and principals in grant aided schools in Northern cannot be instructed to undertake medical procedures.”What role will the teachers take in the programme now Teachers will not now carry out the tests, but there has to be a supervisory role. What happens when the tests are introduced at a later date for the youngest pupils, as the authorities have indicated, might be a dferent matter.The Association of School and College Leadersin Northern Ireland said teachers had no idea the testing programme would be rolled out before the announcement and had not been consulted about what would be expected.“Teachers do not want to see ato a revolving door of schools opening and then having to close again,” said Robert Wilson, Regional Officer.“The announcement that all pupils in Years  to  will face lateral flow tests on theirto the classroom has come as a total surprise to school leaders and comes on the back of a pilot scheme, the success of which they know very little about.“Schools have not been consulted about testing and communication on this matter from the Education Minister has been woefully poor and extremely short on detail. Teachers have been given precious little time to make arrangements for a major logistical operation they had not been previously warned about and have no experience of organising.“Unlike schools in England, which were given weeks to prepare for testing, their counterparts in Northern Ireland now have days to learn how to become medical professionals and act as an authority to their pupils on how to use lateral flow tests,” he added.“Testing may ultimately help our pupils to safelyto the classroom but we are concerned that rushing it may create more problems than it solves.”\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland c .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_fdb-cb--ab-aeb_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland c .ece AUTOCROP w

Minister Peter Weir PA FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueNorthern Ireland Education Minister Peter Weir The Education Minister, Peter Weir, admitted he had read some reports concerning the effectiveness of the lateral-flow test and the possibility of “ positives”.“No test is completely accurate, but studies indicate a very high degree of effectiveness at detecting those who are infectious,” he said.“When infection levels are low in the community, a positive LFD test indicates that the inidual may have Covid,” he added.The Northern Ireland Teachers’ Councilsaid that while the organisation supports the further mitigation, there are concerns about ‘assisting’ students to take the test in a classroom school environment.“NITC remain keen to engage with the Department to discuss what support will be needed for the roll-out of lateral flow testing in schools to be successful – but in a way that does not compromise safety in school – or add to the already unacceptably high workload demands on school leaders,” NITC said.“Any member who comes under any unreasonable pressure with regard to any aspect of LFD testing is advised to contact their union immediately.”NITC added: “The Education Authority has indicated that additional resourcing to cover the administrative burden will be assuredrecorded under Covid costs.“The role of teachers is purely to facilitate familiarisation of the LFD test and the teaching unions advise that testing is safest carried out at home for privacy and to ensure no potential positive cases come into school.“School staff cannot be compelled to supervise or support pupils to conduct self-testing in schools,” they added.What has the Education Minister said Education Minister Peter Weir said the testing will provide a signicant level of reassurance to education settings.“All settings will be reminded of the need for stringent adherence to good practice and additional signage will be provided to all schools to encourage people to comply with public health messaging,” he said.“While it is for each family to decidethey wish for their child to participate in the testing, it will be of benefit to all those in schools for us to be able to break the chain of transmission of the virus by identying all those who may be asymptomatic.”Read MoreMark Bain:OpinionAs schools are set to , there’s a mixture of joy tinged with frustrationThe first batch of tests were scheduled to be delivered to post-primary schools this week, meaning all post-primaries will have enough tests to conduct at least one supervised test in school, and for pupils to be able to conduct a test at home before theyafter the Easter break.Jacquie White, General Secretary of the Ulster Teachers’ Union, said there are still too many unknown for teachers to be convinced of the long term sustainably of Covid-safe environments.“The Lateral Flow Testing is as yet an unknown and while the Minister admits it will be ‘challenging’ I think that is an understatement,” she added.“This is even before one considers the efficacy of the test which won’t detect asymptomatic carriers of Covid and is also known to give  positives.”Belfast Most ReadNewtownabbey murder-suicide: Victim#s nine-year-old daughter wasn#t at home and spared horror of murderous attack#I#m dying, I#m dying... it#s my son#: Mum Karen McClean

Clergy started streaming liturgies through newly installed webcams and social media, and held virtual parish meetings on online s that heretofore had only been the realm of computer experts and technical wizards.Now with Holy Week and Easter approaching, Fr McGee says there is a profound sense of consolation, hope and joy that accompanies theagain to public worship.There is also a flurry of activity within our parishes to carry out risk assessments, reactivate the measures already put in place to keep parishioners safe and to mobilise again the volunteers who have sanitised churches and facilitated public liturgies.Fr McGee says the last year has brought much suffering and pain and there is a need for healing and reconnection as we emerge as a society from the hold of the pandemic.The greatest cross has been carried by those who have lost loved ones as they have been unable to observe the rites and rituals associated with mourning that are so much part of our faith and culture, he added.The pandemic has also had a profound impact on education, business and brought economic hardship and insecurity to families. It will take time for us all to recover and heal the wounds of the pandemic but we will recover and we approach the future together with the Easter hope of resurrection.Rev Joanne Smith was just getting into her stride as a first-time minister at Caledon and Minterburn Presbyterian Churches in Co Tyrone when everything changed.I now have a large file on my computer called #Coronatide#, she reflects.It#s full of hastily pulled together Sunday sermons and talks for our online mid-week services from those early lockdown weeks a year ago, when many of us honestly had no idea what we were doing, or how to do it.We started recording services on our phones and we are still doing that! Teenagers and teachers edited them, and like everyone , we got very used to Zoom - and distance.A year later, Rev Joanne says everything is the same, but also dferent.Everything is the same in that we are still zooming and recording services, though we now record in the church which is much better, she explains.We still have no in-person meetings and while there are things that can be done on Zoom, like our prayer meetings, so many things can#t - like mums and tots groups, which have just stopped.I really want to be with people, but as time has gone on, simple staying in contact has also got harder, but we are getting there.Thankfully, everything is also dferent. People are now being vaccinated, some of our more senior members are about to get their second, and we have heard this week that we will be able toto church for Easter, she said.And looking ahead to her third Easter as a minister, Rev Joanne added: It will be dferent from last year - but in a good way - as we will be able to meet, and we will be able to celebrate together that on the third day Jesus rose again and the hope that brings - especially in these tired days.Rev Gareth Harron, rector of St Philip and St James Church of Ireland in Holywood, Co Down, feels that we took a great deal for granted before last March.It#s a cliché, but we have learned to appreciate something of what church is really about, he said. As we moved our services online, we weren#t caught completely cold. We had been recording services for distribution on DVD for some years, but we needed to get up to speed with live streaming.While we know that not everyone has access to technology, going online with things like our bible studies, prayer meetings, fellowship groups, select vestry meetings, book-groups etc. has opened up engagement beyond our parish boundaries. We have been joined by people from around the globe.For Rev Gareth, the main challenges to pastoral ministry were having to grieve with families faced with limiting the numbers attending funeral services and being unable to visit hospitals and nursing homes.I am hopeful that the lessons we have learned will make us better equipped to support people - that church might not just go back to #normal# but might actually feel better, he adds.I am looking forward to meeting around the Lord#s table this Easter - no outdoor dawn service, no breakfast afterwards - but blessed by the opportunity to give thanks with the church family, whether in person or online, united by the good news of hope in Christ which transcends lockdowns and social distancing.Rev Dr Heather Morris, general secretary of the Methodist Church in Ireland, says the past year has been as challenging for churches as it has been for the whole of society.The grief of those who have lost loved ones through these months has been heightened by the necessary restrictions on visiting and funerals, but ministers have been #on the frontline# of support for these families, Dr Morris said.Churches have run and been part of community helplines, to support those who can#t get out, whether that was delivering prescriptions or groceries, simply being available on the phone for a chat, or offering prayer.She adds: There was undoubtedly initial shock and re-adjustment to this new landscape but Methodist churches responded with imagination and creativity, asking #what can we do, rather than focussing on the things that couldn#t be done in the circumstances - a community choir in South Belfast met online and churches have been able, restrictions allowing, to keep foodbanks running.When buildings were closed for gathered worship most Methodist churches moved online for Sunday services and mid-week Bible Studies, prayer meetings and Alpha courses, and many found that they were being joined not just by the usual congregation but by others who were interested. Some congregations, in Enniskillen, Togherdoo, Lisbellaw and many others have run very popular drive-in services.Along with other churches, members of the Methodist church will be praying on Easter Sunday for recovery from the pandemic, healing, peace and renewed hope for the whole community.Belfast Most ReadNewtownabbey murder-suicide: Victim#s nine-year-old daughter wasn#t at home and spared horror of murderous attack#I#m dying, I#m dying... it#s my son#: Mum Karen McClean and girlfriend Stacey Knell stabbed to death in murder-suicide in Newtownabbey#Butch lesbian# Arlene Foster line in Fern Brady#s BBC comedy routine angers DUPNI hairdresser Nan Dunlop #kned woman  times# in Iceland car park, court toldPSNI investigating after crowds of Rangers fans gather in east BelfastTop VideosPlaySuspicious device found at Camlough Lake in Co ArmaghPlayMore Northern Ireland pupilsto classrooms \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news eea .ece AUTOCROP wh cbcacffddc.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news eea .ece AUTOCROP wh cbcacffddc.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news eea .ece AUTOCROP wh cbcacffddc.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayEmergency services at the scene of three overnight incidents in ArdoyneLatest CoronavirusHouse bound: NI firms considering remote working model beyond CovidCoronavirus Northern Ireland: One further death and  cases amid fears of new waveMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Confirmed Covid cases in your area and seven day rolling averageDUP MP questions NI vaccine supplies as UK hits record number of jabs Mental health impact of school disruption on parents laid bareLatest from Belfast Elderly man #badly shaken# after assault during Belfast distraction burglary Jamie Foxx to play Mike Tyson in TV series based on boxer’s leMay: ‘Slight judder’ in National Security Council confidence after Huawei leakEddie Jones to learn his England fate next week following RFU Six Nations reviewEFL remains hopeful Carabao Cup final will be played in front of fans,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

A big step forward for our young people.“The Executive has taken a cautious approach on the basis of trying to take steps that are not retrograde,” he said.“There’s a role for all of us, including parents, in ensuring we all play our part in making sure that we create an environment that not only allows schools to continue but also ensures we see a further reduction in the virus.“Today we’re seeing the actual joy of pupils being back in class.“That’s very positive, not just for our young people but for society as a whole.“This is a signicant milestone in theto a normalised educational environment. It has been a very challenging period for us all and given the signicant disruption to our children’s learning and mental health our focus now must be educational and wellbeing support.”Principal at St Anne’s Michael Keenan said he was delighted to hear the sounds of laughter from the playground again.“I haven’t heard that sound since December  and you can see from the smile on my face that it’s fantastic to have that noise in the playground back,” he said.“We had our P to P and nursery pupils back last week and there was a real buzz around that part of the school,” he said. “It’s wonderful to have the same buzz around today for the P to P group.“This week will be really about re-engaging with the pupils face to face,” he added. “And we’re giving them a chance to re-engage with each other. They haven’t, in many cases, seen each other since December so it’s a great day for the school community to have them all back together.“No matter how hard children work at home, no matter how hard parents work with them, no matter how hard teachers and staff work to provide home learning, nothing beats face to face teaching. That’s what teachers are all about.“The staff were delighted when we heard the children were going to be able to rejoin us in school this week.”Mr Weir said his focus was now on developing plans to help children catch up on what they had missed out on during lockdown.He said he would be bringing proposals to the Executive that included a wide range of summer school provision.At Wallace High School in Lisburn it was straight back into lessons for the year - students, who will all now face grading assessments from teachers to determine this summer’s A Level, AS Level and GCSE results.The A Level biology class was, ironically, catching up on contagious virus part of their course. But there was still time for the Minister to pose for selfies with some of the pupils, who had re-engaged with their friends over hot chocolate and ice-creams to start their first day back.Lateral Flow Covid tests have arrived at the school, with pupils to spend the next two days learning how to use them before those who have consented to take the tests receive their kits on Wednesday.Principal Deborah O’Hare said that despite the upheaval to the school year, it was great to finally have pupils back in the classroom.“We’re absolutely delighted to have the three years groups back in school,” she said.“Online learning has been successful, but there’s no replacement for the social, face to face learning for pupils.“They’re all in lessons with teachers today. It’s an opportunity for the young people to meet their friends, be with their teachers and ask those questions about assessment they may have about how grades are going to be awarded.“But today is about not worrying about anything, it’s about being happy and reassured.“Our goal this week is to have open and honest conversations,” she added. “There will be pressures. In any normal year there are pressures on examinations. But this is a dferent kind of pressure and not one they really understand.“The dficult part for them is that they would normally start a year with a goal at the end of it, but how that goal is being assessed has changed. We have to be really careful with how we’re explaining how that process is going to be managed,” she added.“We want to give every young person the opportunity to show their best work. That’s the important thing right across Northern Ireland. They must all have the opportunity to show their best work.“The right approach is just to take one day at a time. Things have been changing so quickly and often without notice. It’s not the right time to plan ahead. We need to take stock now and reflect on the lessons learned.”While primary schools will not be involved in the programme in Covid testing for pupils and staff until after Easter the Minister stressed it was vital that as many as possible consent to the tests which are not compulsory.“This week is largely a demonstration week, a trial week,” he said.“There is a level of flexibility built in. Schools can do the lateral flow tests or they can demonstrate them. These can be done pretty much at home.”Pupils in Years - are due toto school on April  after the two-week Easter break.Belfast Related ContentPlayEducation PremiumEverything you need to know about Covid testing in schools as more children As more childrento school on Monday, for many the first lesson they will learn is how to take a home Covid test.Northern IrelandMental health impact of school disruption on parents laid bareAs the majority of childrento school today, parents will breathe a sign of relief.Most ReadNewtownabbey murder-suicide: Victim#s nine-year-old daughter wasn#t at home and spared horror of murderous attack#I#m dying, I#m dying... it#s my son#: Mum Karen McClean and girlfriend Stacey Knell stabbed to death in murder-suicide in NewtownabbeyPSNI investigating after crowds of Rangers fans gather in east Belfast#Butch lesbian# Arlene Foster line in Fern Brady#s BBC comedy routine angers DUPNI hairdresser Nan Dunlop #kned woman  times# in Iceland car park, court toldTop VideosPlaySuspicious device found at Camlough Lake in Co ArmaghPlayMore Northern Ireland pupilsto classrooms \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news eea .ece AUTOCROP wh cbcacffddc.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news eea .ece AUTOCROP wh cbcacffddc.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news eea .ece AUTOCROP wh cbcacffddc.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayEmergency services at the scene of three overnight incidents in ArdoyneLatest Northern IrelandBill tabled at Stormont to set  target for net zero carbon emissionsSecurity alert closes Carrickfergus roadRobin Swann grilled in Stormont over commissioning of abortion servicesMallon denies acting like ‘little Irelander’ over Scotland bridge oppositionCall for ‘united and determined’ action over gender violence following murdersLatest from Belfast Jamie Foxx to play Mike Tyson in TV series based on boxer’s leMay: ‘Slight judder’ in National Security Council confidence after Huawei leakEddie Jones to learn his England fate next week following RFU Six Nations reviewEFL remains hopeful Carabao Cup final will be played in front of fansBill tabled at Stormont to set  target for net zero carbon emissions,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Children, parents and teachers in every part of the North will see positive, practical changes to limit vehicles speeding on the roads around their schools.At each of the schools new road signs will be erected in the form of standard fixed speed limit roundel signs with flashing amber lights set to come on at the times the reduced speed limit applies. This follows trials at a number of schools in  to determine the effectiveness of this arrangement of signs and it was found they reduced the mean speed.The minister added: Road safety, especially around our schools, is a priority of mine and it is my intention that through future programmes many more schools will have a mph speed limit on the roads outside their gates.“My officials are working to complete the schemes, with the legislation now in place to enforce the new part-time mph speed limit measures at these schools.“This is another step forward in our efforts to make our roads safer for all users, however, I would reiterate that we all have a collective responsibility to take care using our roads.”Schools with mph speed limits imposed on surrounding roads:Abbey Primary School Movilla Road, NewtownardsAbercorn PS Newry Road, BanbridgeAndrews Memorial PS Ballygowan Road, ComberArmagh CBS Keady Road, ArmaghBanbridge Academy Edenderry PS Lurgan Road, BanbridgeCarrowdore PS Castle Place, CarrowdoreChrist The King PS Drumsnade Road, DrumanessDerryboye PS Manse Road, DownpatrickGrange Primary School Lurganconary Road, KilkeelKillyleagh PS Shirgley Road, KillyleaghKirkistown PS Main Road, Cloughey, NewtownardsLoughries PS Ballyblack Road, NewtownardsMilltown Primary School Lurgan Road, LenadergOrchard Primary School Blackisland Road, AnnaghmorePortadown College Killycomain Road, PortadownSt Josephs PS Carnacaville Road, NewcastleSt Josephs PS Ballynahinch Road, CrossgarSt Marys Aughisnafin PS Closkelt Road, CastlewellanSt Marys PS Strangford Road, DunsfordSt Patricks PS Ballygalget Lane, PortaferrySt Patricks PS Burrenreagh Road, CastlewellanSt Patricks PS Ballynoe Road, DownpatrickSt. Louis# Grammar School Newry Road, KilkeelSt. Paul#s High School Camlough Road, BessbrookTandragee Jnr High School Armagh Road, TandrageeUpper Ballyboley Primary School  Braepark Road, Ballyclare BT UWIslandmagee Primary School Brown’s Bay Rd, Islandmagee, LarneBT TQCarrickfergus Grammar School  North Road, Carrickfergus BT RACarrickfergus Academy  North Road, Carrickfergus BT QXBallymena Academy  Galgorm Rd, Ballymena BT AJThe Diamond Primary School  Dreen Rd, Cullybackey, Ballymena BT EESt Paul#s Primary School  Ballynafie Rd, Ahoghill, Ballymena BT LFMoorfields Primary School  Moorfields Rd, Moorfields Ballymena BT EFBallyclare High School  Rashee Rd, Ballyclare BT HJDuneane PS  Church Rd, Toome BT RDAquinas Grammar School B Ravenhill Road, BelfastSt Joseph’s College B Ravenhill Road, BelfastSt Michael’s Primary School B Ravenhill Road, BelfastBallysillan Primary School Ballysillian Park, BelfastBelfast Boy#s Model school A Ballysillan Road, BelfastBelfast Royal Academy Cltonville Road, BefastBunscoil BheannMhadagain Cltonville Road, BelfastCltonville Int Primary School Cltonville Road, BelfastBen Madigan Prep school A Antrim Road, BelfastOur Lady of Lourdes Primary A Antrim Road, BelfastCarr#s Glen Primary School Oldpark Road, BelfastCurrie Primary School Limestone Road, BelfastHoly Family Primary School Limestone Road, BelfastDominican College Fortwilliam Park, BelfastKnocknagoney Primary School Knocknagoney Road, BelfastLoughview Integrated Church Road, BelfastLeadhill Primary School Church Road, BelfastAnnahilt Primary School Ballynahinch Rd, AnnahiltMaghaberry Primary School Maghaberry Road, MaghaberryMeadowbridge Primary School Lany Road, HillsboroughRiverdale Primary School Ballynahinch Road, LegacurryRowandale Primary School Clarehill Road, MoiraSt Aloysuis Primary School Ballinderry Road, LisburnSt Patrick#s Academy Ballinderry Road, LisburnLagan College Manse Road, CastlereaghMoneynick Primary School  Moneynick Rd, Randalstown BT HSGroggan Primary School  Portglenone Rd, Randalstown BT EUEdmund Rice College -

Ireland Minister for Infrastructure Nichola Mallon The review’s interim report also recommended a series of other infrastructure schemes that would potentially benefit Northern Ireland.Ms Mallon has criticised the exercise, characterising it as the Government interfering in matters that have been devolved to regional administrations.She told the Assembly that Prime Minister Boris Johnson would be better spending the billions of pounds on an existing projects in Northern Ireland rather than a “vanity project” of creating a fixed link with Scotland.The SDLP minister highlighted that several funding commitments made by the Government in the  New Decade, New Approach deal to restore powersharing in Northern Ireland had not yet been honoured.“I believe that a fixed link between Scotland and Northern Ireland whether a bridge or tunnel is a vanity project,” she said.“The enormous costs of construction could be much better spent to improve infrastructure right across the north.“We already suffer a substantial infrastructure deficit, especially in the northwest, and the Executive and the British government have given many promises to deliver schemes to address this deficit, not least in the New Decade, New Approach agreement.“I do not think a single member here would agree that it would be in the interest of any citizens here to prioritise what appears to be a multi-billion pound bridge or tunnel when we can see that our own transport and water infrastructure networks are crumbling before our eyes, with previous funding commitments made by the Prime Minister still not

down and the people of Northern Ireland by the pejorative, contemptuous and ill-considered response that she made before the ink was dry on the interim report,” he said.“I do suggest to the minister it’s time she took off her nationalist blinkers and was something more than a little Irelander.”Ms Mallon insisted it was not a unionist or nationalist issue. She said the bridge tunnel proposal was more about a “political game” Mr Johnson was trying to play with the SNP.“This is typical Tory distraction and deflections from their failings in government and they have failed in government to honour financial commitments that they’ve made to the people of Northern Ireland through New Decade, New Approach.“This is as much about using Northern Ireland in a game, in an electoral game with the SNP that Boris Johnson is obsessed with more than anything .“One thing we know right across this house, regardless of our political position, is that we cannot trust Boris Johnson.“Boris Johnson does not care about the people of Northern Ireland, he will not put our interests first.”At the close of question time, Mr Durkan raised concerns about Mr Allister’s remarks to deputy speaker Patsy McGlone.“The members should apologise, withdraw it and wise up,” said Mr Durkan.Mr McGlone said while he personally considered the remark “rather juvenile and inappropriate behaviour” he would refer it to Assembly Speaker Alex Maskey for a formal ruling.PAMost ReadNewtownabbey murder-suicide: Victim#s nine-year-old daughter wasn#t at home and spared horror of murderous attack#I#m dying, I#m dying... it#s my son#: Mum Karen McClean and girlfriend Stacey Knell stabbed to death in murder-suicide in NewtownabbeyPSNI investigating after crowds of Rangers fans gather in east Belfast#Butch lesbian# Arlene Foster line in Fern Brady#s BBC comedy routine angers DUPNI hairdresser Nan Dunlop #kned woman  times# in Iceland car park, court toldTop VideosPlaySuspicious device found at Camlough Lake in Co ArmaghPlayMore Northern Ireland pupilsto classrooms \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news eea .ece AUTOCROP wh cbcacffddc.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news eea .ece AUTOCROP wh cbcacffddc.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news eea .ece AUTOCROP wh cbcacffddc.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayEmergency services at the scene of three overnight incidents in ArdoyneLatest Northern IrelandElderly man #badly shaken# after assault during Belfast distraction burglary Bill tabled at Stormont to set  target for net zero carbon emissionsSecurity alert closes Carrickfergus roadRobin Swann grilled in Stormont over commissioning of abortion servicesLatest from Belfast Elderly man #badly shaken# after assault during Belfast distraction burglary Jamie Foxx to play Mike Tyson in TV series based on boxer’s leMay: ‘Slight judder’ in National Security Council confidence after Huawei leakEddie Jones to learn his England fate next week following RFU Six Nations reviewEFL remains hopeful Carabao Cup final will be played in front of fans,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It#s an Olympic sport now so I#m still waiting for the call...Emma is an accomplished, multi-instrument musician, a very strong swimmer and a dab hand at both football and rugby.In fact, virtually nothing about the -year-old Southampton native is quite what you would expect.Viewers see her serious side on TV - which is perhaps unsurprising given that most reports involve the effects of Covid- or Brexit.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseEmma Vardy  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueEmma Vardy But it#s never long before the fun-loving Emma breaks through to the surface, both literally and figuratively.She worked as a surf instructor to pay the bills when striving to make her way as a freelance reporter.In those early days at Sky she was making tea, printing scripts and running around rather than filming pieces to camera.But then the indefatigable Emma took a Masters degree in journalism at Falmouth University in surfing hotspot Cornwall.I was working as a surf instructor when I started getting freelance shts with BBC Radio Cornwall, she said.Quite often I would be coaching surf lessons in the morning and then going to a reporting sht... with salt and sand still in my hair.Ultimately TV work and current affairs took precedence - which is rather ironic considering her upbringing.I actually grew up without a television in the house so I didn#t watch a lot of news in the s, she revealed.My parents didn#t believe in having a TV, and I actually think that that helped me become very creative.The flip side was that I hadn#t a clue what was going on in popular culture, couldn#t connect with anything that the other kids were chatting about at school.In the end, however, it helped me develop my own mind, my own curiosity about things.The gted pianist remembers her dad bringing home a video camera that you had to record onto cassette tape when I was a kid and she started making little comedy reports in the back garden.I think it started there, she said. I didn#t know I was going to be a journalist but there was something in me that loved telling a story to camera.The former BBC South Home Affairs Correspondent and Daily Politics Programme regular was working as a political journalist in Westminster when the Ireland job came up in .The Irish border got very little attention during the referendum campaign, and yet it became the biggest conundrum and basically brought down a government, she said.I wanted to explain why Brexit had potentially such big implications here.It was a time when people didn#t really understand Northern Ireland yet it was playing this central role in the biggest news story at the time that was consuming everything.It#s fair to suggest that, back then Emma#s mother Cary, who grew up in Australia and is now in her s, knew more about Northern Ireland than the new BBC Ireland correspondent.Mum remembers the Northern Ireland of the s, s and s I have to remind her that I#m not in the thick of that, said Emma.Nevertheless, she was wary of stepping on any toes or ruffling feathers when she came here.When I got the job I was totally clear that I was coming to Northern Ireland with a lot to learn, she said. I was very much an outsider in a place full of talented and brave local journalists.Also some of the BBC#s finest correspondents had done the Ireland job before me so I knew I had very big shoes to fill.She added: Mark Devenport [former BBCNI Political Editor] helped me a lot in understanding the layers of politics here and how to explain it. He was brilliant, as were many others.There was something  Emma wasn#t fully prepared for: how much she#d come to love living here.I suddenly realised that Northern Ireland was this incredibly well kept secret, she said.People back home in England seem to associate Northern Ireland with the dangerous place they used to see on the news but I discovered that it#s an incredible place to live.Just a few minutes outside of Belfast you could be on a mountain, you could be in the sea the north coast is endlessly dramatic and stunning. I absolutely love living here.It didn#t take long, however, for Emma to witness a dark side of her new habitat.Lyra McKee#s murder [on April , ] will always stay with me, she said.What happened that night was absolutely tragic, it shocked the world.It reminded people who#d forgotten that an undercurrent of violence still exists here. Lyra#s death and funeral weren#t the end of the story.I felt this huge sense of anger and disgust from the public that a teenager had been sent out into the streets with a gun. The statements put out by the dissidents afterwards trying to justy the violence sickened people.Asking them a few questions with a microphone just showed what cowards they are.Emma said she was always really incensed by things that seemed unfair and always wanted to question things that other people turned a blind eye to.I remember starting a petition at school when I was  because the boys were able to play football across the majority of the school playground but the girls weren#t, she said.I even held this protest by playing netball in the school#s no-balls area to try to take a stand.I think that was my first experience of politics, and the first sign that I wanted to question things...On April , she will celebrate two years with partner Aaron Adams , an analyst for Translink, with whom she lives in Belfast. The couple met while playing mixed five-a-side football.I actually used to be more of a rugby player but now I play football a lot, she said.Aaron and I didn#t really do conventional dates at first. We went to the gym together. Our second date was a kick-about at the park! In the five-a-sides he#d set me up to score goals so that probably clinched it. Our first #real# date was April Fool#s Day .Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseEmma with her partner Aaron Adams and his late daughter Ellsa FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueEmma with her partner Aaron Adams and his late daughter EllsaAaron lost his daughter from a previous relationship, Ellsa Alexander Adams, on February . She was just six years old.Ellsa suffered from a rare condition called CDKL, which meant she had very complex needs and she suffered from lots of seizures. Another aspect of her condition was severe epilepsy.Ellsa had become a huge part of my le, said Emma.Aaron had been Ellsa#s full time carer for three years - hospital stays, seizures, there were endless challenges but Aaron was an incredible father and Ellsa battled all of that like the little superhero she was.She spent weekends with us. Aaron always told me that you had to treasure every minute with Ellsa and that#s what we did.We were never at home for long, whether it was swimming or ice skating or going to beaches or clf paths and on boats, Ellsa came with us and we were always taking her to the most beautul places.Even though she couldn#t move or communicate we just really wanted her to experience everything she could - the sounds of the beaches, the feel of us bumping her chair along clf tops, being on boats and the feeling of the wind. We did an awful lot with Ellsa in a short time.Despite Ellsa#s all-too-apparent condition, Emma and Aaron had no idea they were going to lose her so soon.It was a real shock when it happened, said Emma.Ellsa had battled so hard for so long, and in the end I think her little body couldn#t do it any more.Nothing can ever prepare you for that. I keep reminding Aaron what an amazing job he did as a father. I think Ellsa brought us closer that#s one of the many good things she#s left behind.Losing Ellsa - who has an older brother Jonah , with whom the couple spend lots of time with and have a lot of fun with - prompted a huge show of sympathy from the Northern Ireland public.When Ellsa passed away thousands of people sent us messages, Emma recalled.Aaron did a lot of fundraising for her so she was quite widely known. When I was out with Ellsa in shops people used to stop us and sometimes it wasn#t because they recognised me, it was because they recognised her.It is impossible to describe the pain that Aaron#s feeling but all that love and kindness from so many people in Northern Ireland just meant such a lot.I wasn#t expecting that many people to reach out and when they did it didn#t make the pain any less but it did make a terrible time a little bit less dark.Emma regrets not having been home to see her family in England over the last year because of the pandemic.Father Ron, a former professional musician is in his early s, and she has two brothers and a sister - Alastair , Davidand Joanne . Alastair, who is in pyrotechnics, worked on Game of Thrones, while her sister works with horses and David is in the IT industry.She would also like to see more of Laura Kuenssberg, the BBC#s high profile Political Editor.Laura has been a huge support to me behind the scenes, said Emma. When the DUP were kingmakers in Westminster, our briefs very much overlapped so we#d share info to keep ourselves ahead of the story.No doubting Emma Vardy will continue to lead from the front because at work or at play, it is clear that she#s on the crest of a wave.Belfast Most ReadNewtownabbey murder-suicide: Victim#s nine-year-old daughter wasn#t at home and spared horror of murderous attack#I#m dying, I#m dying... it#s my son#: Mum Karen McClean and girlfriend Stacey Knell stabbed to death in murder-suicide in Newtownabbey#Butch lesbian# Arlene Foster line in Fern Brady#s BBC comedy routine angers DUPNI hairdresser Nan Dunlop #kned woman  times# in Iceland car park, court toldPSNI investigating after crowds of Rangers fans gather in east BelfastTop VideosPlaySuspicious device found at Camlough Lake in Co ArmaghPlayMore Northern Ireland pupilsto classrooms \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news eea .ece AUTOCROP wh cbcacffddc.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news eea .ece AUTOCROP wh cbcacffddc.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news eea .ece AUTOCROP wh cbcacffddc.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayEmergency services at the scene of three overnight incidents in ArdoyneLatest Northern IrelandElderly man #badly shaken# after assault during Belfast distraction burglary Bill tabled at Stormont to set  target for net zero carbon emissionsSecurity alert closes Carrickfergus roadRobin Swann grilled in Stormont over commissioning of abortion servicesMallon denies acting like ‘little Irelander’ over Scotland bridge oppositionLatest from Belfast AJ Pritchard thanks fans for support following girlfriend’s injuryElderly man #badly shaken# after assault during Belfast distraction burglary Jamie Foxx to play Mike Tyson in TV series based on boxer’s leMay: ‘Slight judder’ in National Security Council confidence after Huawei leakEddie Jones to learn his England fate next week following RFU Six Nations review,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It is twelve months since Derry pubs took the tough decision to close because of the risks posed by Covid-. Pressure was mounting on the British and NI Governments to act when the first Coronavirus cases emerged in the UK in January and NI at the end of February, . Before the government issued any formal directive for businesses to shut, the owners of Peadar O’Donnell’s announced that they would shut its doors on March , . googletag.cmd.push Assessing the past year, joint-owner William McGuinness said: “It’s been a disaster for us, it’s been a disaster for everybody. “What can you say, it’s the same for everybody. Hospitality has been the worst hit. “A lot of people can work from home and people can go on furlough and get a big percentage of their wages. “But pub owners like ourselves who aren’t a limited company, our income has just stopped.” William McGuinness and his business partner Phil Nolan took the decision to close two days before the busiest date on the calendar for Irish bars - St Patrick’s Day. googletag.cmd.push They did so in the interests of public health.  The men also own The Gweedore and Fty Seven nightclub which sit next door to Peadar’s on Waterloo Street. Along with other publicans in the city, they took a ‘massive’ financial hit by closing. At the time British Prime Minister Boris Johnson stalled before announcing that all non-essential businesses would close on March  – his delayed response was viewed as a mistake. Speaking to the Derry News over the weekend, Mr McGuinness said he didn’t expect to be closed a full year later. “I don’t think anybody could have thought it would be like this a year down the line. We were hoping for some kind of resolution in the summer, whatever that would have been,” he added.     While open for a five-week period when restrictions were eased the atmosphere wasn’t the same. Mr McGuiness explained: “We’re used to big crowds of people enjoying the live music. “But when we had to put social distancing in place our capacity was slashed even more than other people because it was standing room only in Paedar’s for people at the weekend. “So people sitting two metres apart just wasn’t viable for us.” The Derry man previously said the business had taken a ‘massive hit’. Since then it has received ‘a bit more help’ in terms of financial support from the government and workers have been supported through the furlough scheme. “From a personal point of view, Phil and me are sole traders and we haven’t received anything but we’re a victim of our own success because that’s based on business up to ,” he said. SUMMER PINTS  Stormont ministers recently agreed additional funding to support businesses and jobs during the pandemic. Finance Minister Conor Murphy proposed extending rates relief for another  months for almost , businesses, in a package worth poundm. Mr McGuiness said pubs couldn’t be charged rates as it is based on the annual level of turnover and that amounts to ‘zero’ at present. He’s happy to put  in the rear-view mirror and hopes toto ‘some sort of normality’ in . The reopening of all businesses will be informed by the NI Executive’s five-step plan for easing the Covid- lockdown restrictions. In England some pubs could open as early as April  and hospitality venues in Scotland on April . NIs ‘pathway’ does not include a timetable but will depend on public health criteria being met. The Executive will review its restrictions each month starting tomorrow and continuing until June . Based on the easing of restrictions in the past it’s anticipated that pubs will be at the back of the queue. Mr McGuinness believes the ideal scenario is to see punters with a fresh pint of Guinness in their hands on Waterloo Street by early summer. “We’re hoping to get back to some sort of normality this year,” he said. “The vaccine programme seems to be going well but it’s a bit of an unknown quantity with these iants. “The government is being very careful about reopening because of the fear of another spike and that’s understandable.” He continued: “It’s likely that bars that don’t serve food will be the last to open again but the last time it was a bit of a fiasco, it just didn’t work because people were anxious to get out. “I have my eyes set on early summer. “The Council and City Centre Initiative are trying to come up with schemes to make outside drinking a bit more appealing so hopefully that will help.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

They say Creggan is being treated as a place apart where highly aggressive policing tactics are serving to alienate the community. It comes after the PSNI carried out a search and arrest operation in Creggan yesterday morning namedOperation Ledging - looking specically at the New IRA’s bomb making activities as well as the group’s storage of explosive devices and equipment. googletag.cmd.push This morning a court was told that around  police Land Rovers and many more officers arrived in the Ballymagowan area of Creggan just after am on March . A solicitor questioned the timing of the incident, directly after St. Patricks Day, and what he described as a heavy handed approach. That view was shared by Foyle MLA Karen Mullan who said the PSNI had questions to answer, particularly regarding heavy handed tactics on women. A Creggan motherwas handcuffed and pinned to the ground by police raiding a neighbour’s home. The woman concerned said she has been left with bruising to her arms and stomach. googletag.cmd.push She explained that the incident began when her daughter, who was in distress, was pushed against a jeep. Following the operation, one man was taken to Musgrave Serious Crime Suite for questioning and two other men were charged with assaulting police officers. Now, a spokesperson for CNP and CE has criticised the police operation, saying: It has become clear that the PSNI are treating Creggan as a place apart – a testing ground for highly aggressive, unnecessary and inappropriate policing tactics which only serve to alienate this community even further. Many who witnessed the outworking of this -hour operation, carried out in Creggan yesterday, have commented that police action was heavy-handed and disproportionate.     Certainly mobile phone footage of some of these incidents, circulating on social media, supports these claims. Police engagement with Creggan residents saw two local men and a number of young people injured and a woman thrown to the ground and knelt on by several officers. A heavily armed police presence remained in the area throughout the day into the evening and incited large crowds of young people, building tensions in the community. A small number of local youth workers and community workers were present throughout the day - observing the activity and helping to calm the situation. He added: CNP and CE are growing increasingly concerned at the nature of profiling which this community and its residents are facing. The politics of demonisation, criminalisation and felon-setting are failed policies of the past and are counterproductive to the notion of peacebuilding and conflict transformation. The end result of these tactics is the creation of a sub-class of people, an entire community profiled and its public image reputation blackened. A supposedly ‘end-justies-the-means’ approach to policing this community is alienating a new generation and disconnecting them completely from all systems of governance. This situation will not improve by itself – we need a comprehensive review of policing activity in this community, and we call for senior representatives of civic society and the community, to speak out and demand independent scrutiny.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Dr Tom Black, BMA Northern Ireland council chair said, “I think we are all probably amazed that one year later we are still battling Covid-. It has certainly been a year of ups and downs with many families facing illness and the loss of a loved one from a disease that we only learnt about just over a year ago. “Doctors have been firmly on the frontline of Covid- either in direct patient care in ICUs, or in maintaining other services in hospitals as best as they could. Some have been central to research to better understand Covid- and some have helped develop a vaccine and roll that out as quickly as possible. Our GP surgeries quickly pivoted to provide online consultations as well as covid assessment centres. That meant we could continue to see patients in surgery when necessary without the risk of coming into contact with Covid-. googletag.cmd.push He added: “Doctors did all of this because they saw the huge crisis that was unfolding and they wanted to do their part in tackling it. Many are now exhausted and there is no doubt that many doctors need time now to rest both physically and emotionally and to come to terms with what they have been through. I am proud to see how much the profession worked together, old silos and barriers quickly came down and we saw a lot of innovation and flexibility. We have also seen that in the long term our health service needs more more resources and more staff so we can expand, address the backlog and be ready for the huge surge in need we are now facing. googletag.cmd.push “This year has taken a toll on everyone as we have adapted and changed our whole way of living and working. We are in a much better place than we were this time last year as we now know much more about Covid- and how to treat it, and the vaccination programme is a real beacon of hope for everyone. I would urge everyone to take a moment today to reflect on how far we have come over the past year, remember all those we have lost and to come together in the hope for a better year ahead.”      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Dr Tom Black, BMA Northern Ireland council chair said, “I think we are all probably amazed that one year later we are still battling Covid-. It has certainly been a year of ups and downs with many families facing illness and the loss of a loved one from a disease that we only learnt about just over a year ago. “Doctors have been firmly on the frontline of Covid- either in direct patient care in ICUs, or in maintaining other services in hospitals as best as they could. Some have been central to research to better understand Covid- and some have helped develop a vaccine and roll that out as quickly as possible. Our GP surgeries quickly pivoted to provide online consultations as well as covid assessment centres. That meant we could continue to see patients in surgery when necessary without the risk of coming into contact with Covid-. googletag.cmd.push He added: “Doctors did all of this because they saw the huge crisis that was unfolding and they wanted to do their part in tackling it. Many are now exhausted and there is no doubt that many doctors need time now to rest both physically and emotionally and to come to terms with what they have been through. I am proud to see how much the profession worked together, old silos and barriers quickly came down and we saw a lot of innovation and flexibility. We have also seen that in the long term our health service needs more more resources and more staff so we can expand, address the backlog and be ready for the huge surge in need we are now facing. googletag.cmd.push “This year has taken a toll on everyone as we have adapted and changed our whole way of living and working. We are in a much better place than we were this time last year as we now know much more about Covid- and how to treat it, and the vaccination programme is a real beacon of hope for everyone. I would urge everyone to take a moment today to reflect on how far we have come over the past year, remember all those we have lost and to come together in the hope for a better year ahead.”      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Reporter: Liam Tunney::  Mar   addthis, With the county clinging to nostalgia as a coping mechanism, Liam Tunney spoke to Maghera psychologist Sarah Connell about the phenomenon. She sees a renewed hope at the end of what has been a busy year.Having a baby and moving house are well up the list of les most stressful activities, but doing both amid a pandemic adds an extra layer of challenge. “The last month or two has been very stressful between moving house and having the baby. Equally, Ive also really enjoyed it,” she told the County Derry Post. “Ive loved the home-schooling. I love working with my wee girl because she enjoys doing it and that makes it so much easier.” The increase in mental health problems related to the pandemic means Sarah has had an increase in enquiries. She feels part of the reason for the downturn in the countrys mental health is because, last March, no one had foreseen the situation dragging on to mark an anniversary. googletag.cmd.push Sarah is looking forward to meeting clients face-to-face again. “Its taken a lot of people by surprise and people are suffering because of the fact its still going on,” she said. “Theyre feeling disheartened and there is a lot of loneliness for people. Some are on their own, having to isolate by themselves and thats what Im seeing a lot of. “Everyone has been personally affected in some way, but I think its really important for us to take comfort from things that have happened in the past. “If you think about what people went through during World War One and World War Two, le does go on and good things do still happen.” googletag.cmd.push Last year, we discussed the outpouring of nostalgia that had emerged during the lockdown, as people reached for happy memories to stave off the misery. One year on, the phenomenon appears to have dissipated, with people now looking towards the future, something Sarah feels is the way to move forward. “If we can focus on the glimmers of hope and positivity, it can see us through,” she said. “There is a -year old Hungarian gymnast – Agnes Keleti - who escaped Nazi death camps during the war and went on to win Olympic medals. “She believed in looking to the present and the future. We can take comfort from people like that and it helps us know that we can get through this.”     As we follow the governments pathway out of lockdown, there could well be a period of adjustment for people while thingsto normal.  “Its going to be challenging, because you start to get used to things the way they are,” said Sarah. “As much as people are talking about the lack of enjoyment, there is still going to be an element of feeling like this is reality. “It seems crazy, because its such a long time since we had our old normal, readjusting to that is going to be dficult for people.” Sarah is casting hopeful eyes towards the future. “I miss seeing my clients face to face. Its online and that works well for most people, but that one-to-one interaction is something you cant beat,” she said. “I think its just important that people take comfort in knowing things will improve. Im also really looking forward to being able to go out for a meal again!”  Related: COVID ONE YEAR ON: A week of fear, uncertainty and panic-buying COVID ONE YEAR ON: Dancing community missing the buzz a year later COIVD ONE YEAR ON: Clear dference in NI and Italys Coronavirus response COVID ONE YEAR ON: Two steps forward and twenty steps backward COVID ONE YEAR ON:No honeymoon yet for last couple married before lockdown  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Their bread was delicious, especially fruit cake and their sodas were the best in the country.” However, fans of the bakery have been buoyed by news that a number of the bakerys staff will be continuing to work in the area. googletag.cmd.push Former Hyndmans staff Geoff Lee, Nigel Chambers and Sandra McDonald have linked up with Berties Bakery in Magherafelt, who announced the news the same day Hyndmans ceased production. “Hyndmans was an institution in its own right and we were sorry to hear of their closing,” they said. “Bertie’s is however delighted that we have been able to help three of their staff into key roles within our business and perhaps in some way we will be able to keep what was best about Hyndmans alive. “Sandra will be helping us with our new cake and traybake ranges, while Geoff and Nigel bring a wealth of experience particularly in Soda Breads.”     Former Hyndmans customers will be happy to see their favourite soda bread recipe live on.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

A new mph limit will apply on roads outside Culmore Primary School, Foyle College, Ebrington Primary School, St Pauls Primary School in Slievemore and Model Primary School at Northland Road. New signs will be erected outside the schools and flashing amber lights will indicate when the speed limit is in operation. Infrastructure Minister, Nichola Mallon today announced new speed limits on roads adjacent to  schools throughout Northern Ireland, including those in Derry. Minister Mallon said:“I made a commitment in September last year to bring forward legislation to introduce part-time mph speed limits at around  schools across Northern Ireland so that parents, children and staff will be safer as they go to and from school every day. googletag.cmd.push “I can today announce that part-time speed limits have now been set in legislation for  schools at  sites across Northern Ireland. Children, parents and teachers in every part of the North will see positive, practical changes to limit vehicles speeding on the roads around their schools.” The Minister said that road safety, especially around our schools, was a priority of hers. “It is my intention that through future programmes many more schools will have a mph speed limit on the roads outside their gates. “My officials are working to complete the schemes, with the legislation now in place to enforce the new part-time mph speed limit measures at these schools. googletag.cmd.push “This is another step forward in our efforts to make our roads safer for all users, however, I would reiterate that we all have a collective responsibility to take care using our roads.”       --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The -year-old has seen some dark days at Derry City, much worse then this in fact, so he is not going to panic over a poor performance and a poor result in the first game of a new season. That said, he still hates the feeling of losing and he admits that on this occasion, Derry City just weren’t good enough. “We started off slowly and gave away a few silly goals,” he reflected. “We knew that they were going to come out fast. They weren’t going to lie down to us and they got off to a really good start. I thought we had a few chances where we could have equalised but as the time went on, we weren’t making any clear-cut chances. It wasn’t to be today but hopefully it is in a few weeks’ time.” googletag.cmd.push This was Toal’s first game since being made permanent captain, and it did not go the way he had hoped in any sense.  “It wasn’t an ideal start but it isn’t about me,” he said. “It’s about the team, and we just need to stick together for the next game. “We want to win every game we play because we are playing for Derry City and it is a massive, massive club and I’ve said this before, but we don’t go anywhere to get beat. We just started off slowly and there were a few silly mistakes.” As an attacking force, City were almost non-existent against Longford, but Toal believes that luck did just not fall City’s way on a number of occasions, particularly from set-plays. googletag.cmd.push “We knew that maybe we could get a few goals from set-pieces because we’re a big enough side but it just didn’t fall for us tonight but on another night it just might,” he said. “I thought we went more direct after the second goal went in. I didn’t think the second goal was coming. I thought we had a few chances from set-pieces and maybe we could grab one. I thought we could grab one late on because we were on top but it wasn’t to be.” Looking ahead With this week’s game against Shamrock Rovers set to be postponed due to Nathan Gartside’s international call-up, Derry have a two-week break before their next game. Toal believes they can can use that time to understand what went wrong in Longford.     “I wouldn’t say that we have a lot to work on but we have time to reflect and analyse the game and analyse where we went wrong and look forward to the next game,” he continued. “We have two weeks before our next game so we have got to regroup and we have to stick together. The games are going to be coming thick and fast so we need to stick together. We know we are a new team and we’ll need time to come together but there are no real excuses – we started off slow and made two mistakes for the goals, and that should be better.” There were a number of surprise results on the first weekend of Airtricity League action, and Toal knows that the mood can sht quickly with victory in the next game.  “There’s no time to feel sorry for ourselves,” he agreed. “We’ll be back into training and we need to work together and stay together. There are going to be a lot of games coming up and the boys are going to be looking to get into the team and improve and that’s the main thing, to keep working hard.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

At this stage,  countries were affected, with , confirmed cases and more than , deaths.One year on, there have been  million confirmed cases globally and more than . million deaths from Covid-. In Northern Ireland, there have been , cases and over , deaths.Pandemic is not a word to use lightly or indeed carelessly, but when Prime Minister Boris Johnston mdash who himself who ended up in hospital with the virus mdash went on national television on March  last year, he appealed to people to stay at home to stop the spread of the virus.His appeal, broadcast by every major UK television and radio network, resulted in the immediate implementation of a series of unprecedented measures.Town centres across the district were locked down and deserted and people asked to act responsibly and do all they could to halt the spread of the disease by adhering to public health advice.In the wake of the Prime Ministerrsquos address, church leaders in Downpatrick and the surrounding area appealed for ldquoprayer, unity and calm as the coronavirus threat deepened.With public worship one of lockdownrsquos many casualties, a number of services moved on-line as churches embraced st century technology to provide people with much-needed hope at a time of need and reassurance.Newry, Mourne and Down Council, with the help of the Department for Communities, led from the front locally and was instrumental in helping distribute hundreds of food parcels to people across the area who were not allowed to leave home.The districtrsquos foodbanks had to respond to a major increase in demand, which was eased by the generosity of iniduals and groups across the district, with many sports clubs helping distribute food parcels.The pandemic united people like never before as the challenge of dealing with the global virus increased daily. Sadly, today, the UK has one of the highest per capita death rates from Covid in the world.As politicians prepare to slowly ease lockdown restrictions over the coming weeks, the district is bracing itself for ato normality, but exactly how normal le will be remains uncertain at this stage.The past  months have been le-changing, with people hoping that the light at the end of the tunnel will soon be shining like a beacon..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/17Mar2021-Dancers.jpg","title":"Dancers make the best of lockdown  ","story":"A CROSSGAR Irish dance school is trying to keep spirits raised during the lockdown.Owing to Covid restrictions, Irish dancers have not been allowed to attend classes in person since November last year.However this has not deterred Chris Owens, Bridget Madden and Brid McKinney, dance teachers at Scoil Rince an Chroiacute from motivating dancers who have continued to go from strength to strength.Briacuted said: ldquoIt has been extremely challenging times. Even when restrictions were eased in November we were not allowed toto our dance studio.ldquoHowever, rather than give into adversity, we have embraced as many aspects of digital technology as possible to teach our dancers.Consequently when Scoil Rince an Chroi were able to participate in a virtual online feis in March, they did so with resounding success.Chris explained: ldquoWhen the results came in, to say we are over the moon is an understatement.ldquoThe competition was open to dancers across Ulster across in all age groups. Our results were amazing including three championship wins,  top five championship places,  first places,  second places, nine third places. Overall we achieved  places in the top  per cent of competitions.Competing in an online feis is just the tip of the iceberg of the work Scoil Rince an Chroiacute have engaged with during lockdown.Using Zoom technology, dancers have continued to learn and perfect performances three times a week with their teachers.Through virtual learning forums and social s such as Google classroom and WhatsApp, daily challenges have been sent to dancers.Recognising the strain restrictions are having on young people, this forward thinking dance school implemented a lsquoMonday Mindfulnessrsquo programme during the February.A iety of activities were presented each Monday to keep spirits high including baking together and goal setting.The dance school also organised a class quiz for the whole family using Kahoot.

Council confirmed at a meeting last night that there were  reported fly-tipping incidents last year, compared to  in .Between  and  over , fly tipping incidents were reported to the local authority while, incredibly, during the first two months of this year, council officials have already received reports of  fly-tipping incidents across the district.During the height of the coronavirus pandemic between March and December last year, there were  illegal dumping incidents, compared to  over the same period in .The figures made public at last nightrsquos meeting of the councilrsquos Neighbourhood Services Committee revealed that the average number of fly tipping incidents across the district rose from  each week to  for a period last year, before dipping back to .News of the scale of the fly-tipping issue comes after a large consignment of tyres was dumped illegally last week outside Killyleagh.Around  tyres were found dumped at the Scaddy Road and Greystown Road, while, there was more fly-tipping at an illegal dumping hot spot at Ardilea, near Clough, where an old washing machine and other household debris was dumped.In a bid to call time on the illegal dumpers, the local council has employed additional enforcement officers and drawn up a new plan to deal with fly-tipping and dog fouling issues.In addition, two more seasonal enforcement staff are to be appointed next week as the local authority braces itself for a busy spring and summer.Council officials have also confirmed that they are exploring the possibility of using mobile CCTV to catch those who fly-tip which could include enforcement staff wearing body-cams as part of an evidence gathering initiative.In the summer, a new awareness programme to highlight fly-tipping and dog fouling issues across the district will be rolled out by the local authority, while consideration is being given to introducing a new community fund to support anti-littering and dog fouling initiatives across the district.During the last financial year the local authority issued  fixed penalty notices to litter louts, with  of the offenders paying up. Eight fixed penalty notices for dog fouling were issued over the same period.Rowallane area councillor Billy Walker, who was alerted to the dumped tyres outside Killyleagh, said there were people who viewed secluded rural areas as open air dumping grounds.ldquoThis behaviour must stop, he declared. ldquoThe tyres dumped outside Killyleagh had been left in three dferent areas and I hope that whoever was responsible for this illegal dumping incident will be caught and that the courts will impose a penalty which sends out a clear signal that this behaviour will not be tolerated and has no place in any civilised society.ldquoCouncil officers visited the Scaddy and Gregstown roads looking for evidence and the issue has also been reported to the Environment Agency. Incidents of this nature are happening all too often across the district.Cllr Walker says there have been recent reports of tyres dumped where in the Rowallane area including Ballynahinch and Saintfield.ldquoThe number of fly-tipping incidents reported across the district makes uncomfortable reading and the ironic thing is that those responsible for dumping waste end up paying for its removal through the rates and taxes, he said.ldquoIt is clear that a van or lorry was used to dump the tyres in Killyleagh and I would appeal to anyone who knows anything about this incident to contact the council or the police. This behaviour must not be allowed to continue.Cllr Walker said while local authority officials are doing their best to get on top of the fly-tipping issue, their efforts are being hindered by some in the community who have no respect for their own areas and communities.He added: ldquoFly-tipping and dog fouling issues are a scourge on our district and while additional enforcement officers have been recruited, the battle to address illegal dumping starts with those who engage in such behaviour.

Something for everyone.It is extremely hard work to organise, but seeing the smiles of those taking part and hearing the cheering onlookers makes it all worthwhile.Roll back to the same weekend in  and it was a bleak day in the history of the race. Just like yesterday the place was deserted.Jimmyrsquos K has been in the calendar since  and has taken place every year since with only two hitches ndash foot and mouth in  and an lsquoout of the bluersquo snow day in  caused postponement, but only by a short space of time.The pandemic that struck in  totally overshadowed these minor interruptions.Covid- had been appearing in the headlines for a few weeks by then, but initially it seemed to be a remote problem confined to China and other places overseas, yet suddenly it was on our doorstep and a very real threat.The powers that be were issuing bulletins to inform us all of what restrictions might be imposed and yet it still seemed asthe race would go ahead as there was no direct order to cease.The race committee met daily and then had almost hourly gatherings as the situation closed in.When schools and work places were told to prepare for closure and the government was using the word lockdown, it was decided that it was best to communicate to all that the race would not take place.After doing all the hard work, it was a bitter pill to swallow but taken in the context of what some had to face in their lives, it was just a fact of le and a line was drawn. We all hunkered down and waited for the storm to pass.Little did we know then that a year later that we would still be under orders to socially distance, to work from homepossible and to avoid unnecessary journeys, etc.We would have found it hard to envisage how work and home le would be impacted and that sport would be universally curtailed.Initially we had rolled over all the entries from the  race to the corresponding date in , but in December it was obvious that a race in March would not be feasible.We took a decision to push the date back in the hope that a race in  would still happen. At that time, we chose June  as the new date, but the recent lsquoRoadmap to Recoveryrsquo has caused a rethink.The good news is that with the uptake of the vaccine and the fall in numbers regarding infection rates and hospital cases, things are moving in the right direction, but by stalling for a couple more weeks, we feel that there will be further easing of limits.We are awaiting the next Executive update in the hope that club training might be able to take place in the not too distant future and that competition will follow. So we have rebooked a date for Jimmyrsquos  mdash Sunday, June .All  entrants have been carried over and East Down AC greatly appreciate the understanding of the runners and other clubs.We know that it is not ideal that changes are made and we all prefer certainty and being able to train for a set goal, but we are trying to make the best out of a dficult situation.Racing has been thin on the ground in the last  months so organisers and athletes are equally keen to get back in action. might seem distant now, but the photos in the archives remind us of the good times.That year was a bumper entry and the race was a huge success. We have to hold on to those memories for now and tell ourselves that we will enjoy it all the more for the long wait.The club is very excited at the prospect of hosting old friends and new and it will be a happy day for all concerned.Once all the deferrals are accounted for, It is hoped that extra places will also go on sale.These will be advertised in the Down Recorder, as well as at www.eastdownac and on the EDAC Facebook page, so keep an eye out..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/17Mar2021-Peace.jpg","title":"Peace maze among top worldwide attractions  ","story":"THERE will be no surprise locally that the stunning peace maze in the sweeping grounds of Castlewellan Forest Park has been included in a prestigious list of post-lockdown international attractions.Previously listed among ldquoonce famous world attractions, the maze commands stunning views towards the majestic Mourne Mountains sweeping down to the Irish Sea.Travel website Loveholidays has been looking into Guinness World Record books to discover previous record-holding places to visit.The site, which lists eight attractions across Europe, Asia and North America, features Castlewellan Forest Park, where the maze is considered to have one of the most outstanding tree and shrub collections in Europe.And it is in good company in the list, joined by the CN Tower in Toronto and the Stade de France in Paris among others.

All of this, of course, at a cost to the public purse.Republicans loudly demand special treatment for their culture to be celebrated and acknowledge across Northern Ireland. At the same time they refuse Unionists space for a monument, at zero cost to the public, commemorating the state they jointly govern.One can only hope that unionists remember how their modest request was treated when the Irish language legislation comes before the assembly. That will be the time at which unionism in showing a united front, as it did when requesting the monument, can deliver something of substance for their community.Samuel Morrison, TUV Dromore, Co Down• Leaked DUP minutes show dismay at party’s direction——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

And there is.The Line of Duty webinar, which was hosted by journalist Rebecca Nicholson, involved creator and writer Jed Mercurio, producer Simon Heath and stars Vicky McClure, Adrian Dunbar and Kelly Macdonald. All six of them occupied their own little box on my laptop screen at the same time.All of the journalists on the call were hidden from sightand able to ask questions by typing them via the QA tab.

That chronological order just wasn’t possible because we were bound by location and safety.”She added: “There was talk of us doing our own makeup, I was sad that didn’t happen, evenjust for one day to see how it would have panned out.”Adrian commented: “Because it’s taken so long to do it, when I saw the trailer the other day it was quite a shock to me.World Productions - Photographer: Steffan Hill\" \"\" width\"\" srcset\"https:www.newsletter webimg TUFZMTINTINjc.jpg width w, https:www.newsletter webimg TUFZMTINTINjc.jpg width w\" layout\"intrinsic\" class\"i-amphtml-layout-intrinsic i-amphtml-layout-size-defined\" i-amphtml-layout\"intrinsic\"\"World Productions - Photographer: Steffan Hill\" fallback layout\"responsive\" \"\" width\"\" src\" img placeholder.png\" class\"i-amphtml-layout-responsive i-amphtml-layout-size-defined\" i-amphtml-layout\"responsive\"Superintendent Ted Hastings World Productions - Photographer: Steffan Hill“Suddenly I saw the whole storyline compressed.

He obviously chilled out like we all did. “He had to self-isolate for two weeks because he was coming over from Vegas, production got him a bike for his flat and he just ate soup for two weeks.” This season’s guest star is Kelly Macdonald who plays DCI Joanne Davidson.She said: “I was completely aware of Line of Duty though I hadn’t watched it. It occurred to me the other day I spent a number of years in New York filming, and I missed a huge amount of British pop culture. “When I came back after I finished Boardwalk Empire, I missed a lot of TV, there was people I didn’t know, comedians I didn’t recognise that were really popular. Line of Duty happened while I was away as did Broadchurch.“When I got the offer I thought I should really sit down and see what [Line of Duty] is.”She admitted the technical dialogue has proven tricky: “I knew it was going to be great, dramatic, compelling. The shock really was when I was sent the first episode and I started reading it on a train up to Glasgow from London. I was happily reading then suddenly there was this massive long bit of dialogue about stuff I’d never heard of, then I turned the page and it kept going. It went on and on and on like that. “There was no doubt in my mind that I was going to say yes, but I did have to go over that obstacle in my mind. I did know it was going to be quite challenging.“We would be on set and we would go through a scene, there would be certain acronyms we would discuss at the time, also in hair and makeup there was a list pinned up that was quite helpful I found.“I’m not brilliant at it still but I sort of get by.”In terms of keeping storylines secret Kelly said: “People have been really excited from the get go and knew more about it than me. They were screaming in my face, ‘Am I H, Am I H ’ I didn’t know what it meant. I wear a chain with a K round my neck, I was thinking of getting one with an H just to mess with them.“Everybody asks, they’re desperate to know, but before you can even think how to respond they immediately say, ‘I don’t want to know’.”Line of Duty regular Vicky and this season’s guest star Kelly found they had a shared hobby which helped pass the time between shoots.Kelly said: “In the first few days we realised we shared the passion for jigsaws.“It’s so funny because lots of people got into jigsaws because of the worldwide pandemic, but we got into them before that.”“We’re so rock and roll,” said Vicky.She added: “Kelly brought in a jigsaw which will stress me out forever. It was the hardest jigsaw I’ve ever seen. We never got round to finishing it.”The girls described it as a mosaic of a woman on a balcony, mostly stonework, which was all the same colour.Kelly said: “That jigsaw was haunting my house forever. I kept bringing it out, I would attempt it, it would gather dust, I’d put it back in the box again.”Vicky said: “Sometimes in filming you’re standing round for half an hour waiting for something to be done, so it’s great we’ve got this jigsaw out on the table. “Literally there would be a piece that would be driving me nuts and they’d be, ‘Vicky, we need you on set’ and I’d be like ‘nooooooo’. It was consuming us. There were a few jigsaws we did, that was one we didn’t finish.”Some videos from the set of Vicky’s attempts to prank Martin have been shared.“I have handed a few of those over to the BBC for your delight,” said Vicky.“I love a blooper reel. I think it’s great that we’re quite open with the audience, going behind the curtain so to speak. “We have a laugh. With the phone that we’ve got now it’s impossible for me not to capture some of the funny things that go on on set.”Vicky also turned Adrian Dunbar into a TikTok sensation.Adrian said: “She just ambushes you. She says, ‘I’m doing this thing for charity, just say this, blah, blah, blah’. You do it because you trust her, sadly though on some occasions you shouldn’t. “On that occasion she just ran in and said, ‘I’m going to play this bit of music, dance along to it’. I thought what is this about... TikTok. Within three or four days a million people had watched it.”Discussing Ted Hasting’s idioms which have taken on a le of their own, Adrian said: “We do ask the audience, is there any you think Ted would say that’s a real Belfast idiom ”In the first episode of series six Ted orders Steve to ‘houl yer whist’. Adrian said: “They’ve taken on a le of their own, haven’t they “People are playing bingo games, drinking games, you can do all kinds of things with the ‘fellas’ and the ‘Mother of Gods’ and all that sort of stuff.“The ‘Mother of God’ comes from my dad, he used to say it all the time, it’s kind of a nod towards him.“The police always say they know someone like Ted, whether he’s originally from Edinburgh or Cardf, there was always someone who was a bit of a Ted and comes out with those idioms. Kind of like Sam Allardyce... DC Allardyce. All that kind of management stuff – Alex Ferguson, Bill Shankley – they all have their little sayings and phrases.”Given that the likes of Line of Duty, Bloodlands, Marcella, Hope Street have been filmed in NI, Jed was asked is there something about the Province that makes it the perfect place to film crime drama He said: “It’s a good place, definitely. You’ve got a choice of fantastic locations, great crews and great facilities. It’s brilliant to see that Northern Ireland is being represented so well on screen.”Jed did not rule out killing off one of the golden trio of Superintendent Hastings, DS Arnott and DI Fleming.The Line of Duty creator said: “It’s never far from my thoughts. We all get on brilliantly but everyone knows we’re serving something bigger than ourselves which is Line of Duty, and one of things about the show is that nobody is safe, it’s what keeps the audience on the edge of their seat. “I know it would be a sad day but all the main cast know that it’s possible. “We joke about it, it’s something no one would relish but everyone would understand.”Asked how he keeps track of a complex story that has spanned six series, he said: “We have a great team, we have the resources of the previous scripts and episodes, we all are very familiar with things that have happened in the past and the cast remember things the characters have done in previous seasons. “When we want to create a connection with the past, often the thing we don’t quite know straight away is the exact detail, then it’s just a case of going back into the script and we can see exactly what date something was meant to happen, and the locations where it was meant to happen. “Even betterwe’ve got some visual reference, an image that’s in the AC- files of the past, that’s something that we do in this season. “We do delve into past cases a little bit and the way that we do that, like any police unit they keep records, when we dig into those files, hey presto we see reminders of previous seasons.”One of the ways in which past events are recapped are via new member of AC- DC Chloe Bishop, played by Shalom Brune-Franklin. Adrian said: “Shalom is fantastic, she’s absolutely wonderful. Especially because her character was given a lot of the back story that our characters needed. She had to learn huge amounts of stuff and carry a lot of information into scenes. She was really contentious, really clear, and a really wonderful actress to work with.

In the first episode Terry Boyle, a character with Down’s Syndrome, played by Tommy Jessop is interviewed as a suspect. Later Supt Ted Hastings, played by NI actor Adrian Dunbar, refers to him as ‘the local oddball’.After last night’s show Mr Gamble, who runs an organisation focused on safeguarding children online, tweeted: “Especially on the day that it is but also on any day, the script writer of #LineOfDuty needs to reflect on the line referring to a suspect with special needs being referred to as the local odd ball.”Mr Mercurio defended the use of the term oddball saying it “has no connotation for learning dficulties”. He said: “It describes a loner, an eccentric. The drama is using the term to refer to the Dando case, not to learning dficulties.”Read More Read MoreLine of Duty cast and crew reveal behind the scenes secretsMr Gamble suggested that Mr Mercurio “speak to some people who’ve worked in policing and with vulnerable people and see what they think about connotation in this context”.Mr Mercurio said Line of Duty worked with numerous police advisers and the programme portrayed “policing with some of its failings.”Mr Gamble said the use of the term “was foolish to say the least and shows an utter lack of understanding”. He said: “If you’re saying the head of professional standards would say that you need new police advisors.”Mr Mercurio said: “OK, Jim, you keep up your rose-tinted view of policing. The events of the last week was clearly just a mass delusion.”Many on social media supported Mr Gamble’s assertion that the line was inappropriate while some said TV drama needed to reflect what people might say.NI actor Charlie Lawson said that “writing must be totally real and no rules applied”.He said: “I think that’s exactly what the character would say. Good writing shouldn’t offend in context.”A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Boris Johnson advised public buildings, including theatres, to close and mass gatherings to stop.This week,  months on, campaign group We Make Events Cymru, reflects on the impact of Covid- and how the lockdown restrictions has had a devastating effect on their industry.The impact of the announcement back in March last year meant that the UK event sector came to an outright standstill, resulting in events being cancelled, theatre and music shows could not be staged and thousands of Welsh event professionals could not work.We Make Events Cymru, , has spent the last  months lobbying the Welsh Government to highlight the need for continued sector support in order for the events organisers, iniduals and supply chain to survive Covid- restrictions.After a year of campaigning, We Make Events Cymru continues to push for opportunities to re-open the sector in light of the Welsh Government Coronavirus Control Plan , which does not allow gatherings of more than  people in Tier .As a result of many conversations with the Welsh Government, We Make Events Cymru has created a survey to gather the much needed data to evidence the number of people involved in the sector and the contribution they make to Wales and its economy.Stephen Burkitt-Harrington, Director of Production  one of Walesrsquo leading Creative Events Companies, said: ldquoThe Welsh Government has been saying all along that it could not reopen events of any kind without industry specic data. We were surprised to learn that they were not collecting this information though.\"This is why we have put together the biggest survey of our industry ever undertaken in Wales. Companies big and small, venues, events, and every inidual involved in even the smallest way can contribute now.\"By giving us as little or as much as people are prepared to contribute, we can then provide the government with the much talked about data they say they need to see how valuable our wide ranging industry is to the Welsh economy, and how important it is to get it open again as soon as it is safe to.Alongside the survey, the group have also recently launched their own website which gives sector colleagues access to wellbeing and financial advice, access to a database of Welsh event organisers, suppliers and iniduals, as well as a forum to chat and exchange ideas ndash resources that the team believe is vitally important during the pandemic.MORE NEWS:We Make Events Cymru is in regular dialogue with Welsh Government to lobby, and is part of the working party preparing for Covid-safe outdoor and indoor test events.

Within it, Wales plays a signicant role with its tremendous highly skilled workforce, many of whom have now had to ersy to work in other jobs.The impact of the lockdown will be felt within the Welsh events industry for many years to come.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe road would link Sycamore Cross on the A with Junction  of the M. A -week public consultation last year raised concerns about the impact on the environment and local communities.Responding to those concerns, the Vale of Glamorgan council has now said transport planners must analyse further how the road would fit in with the new context of Covid- and the climate emergency.In a report to the councilrsquos cabinet, which meets on Monday, March , detailed responses were given to the main concerns raised in the consultation. The cabinet will be asked to approve further analysis, before moving on to writing up a full business case for the road.The case for the road is to improve transport across the region, including to Cardf Airport, St Athanrsquos Enterprise Zone, and new housing developments. It would likely cost around pound million to build, and is dependent on funding from the Welsh Government.However, the proposals have drawn criticism from villagers in Pendoylan whose houses would be knocked down, cyclists using country lanes which could be blocked off, and Coed Cymru which has warned ancient woodland would be felled to make way for the road.Two options for the new road were consulted on: one to the east of Pendoylan and one to the west. The report revealed transport planners are edging towards the western route, as it is better value for money than the eastern one.As well as suggesting further analysis, the cabinet report addressed the main concerns including the impact on the climate, environment, walkers and cyclists, and uncertain future of the financially struggling Cardf Airport.On cycling, the new road would include a segregated lsquoactive travel routersquo for cyclists and walkers, the report said. Country lanes blocked off could have bridges or underpasses for walkers and cyclists to cross the new road.     MORE NEWS:The report said: ldquoThere is currently poor infrastructure and local connectivity by walking and cycling through the study area, and there is potential to implement new cycle connections. An active travel route is an integral component of the concept options.ldquoShould a preferred option progress to the next stage of assessment and a need to block the lanes confirmed, access for non-motorised users to safely cross under or over the bypass would be accommodated as part of the design.On climate change, campaigners raised concerns a new road would increase private car journeys and carbon emissions.Both the Welsh Government and the Vale council declared a climate emergency in , pledging to reduce carbon emissions in an effort to prevent catastrophic increases in global temperatures.A big part of the plan to reduce emissions in Wales is changing how people travel: fewer journeys in private cars and more by walking, cycling and in public transport.The report said further analysis would include a lsquocarbon assessment and climate resiliencersquo report, and would explore how to reduce the carbon impact of the road.It did not mention what these methods could include.Several areas of ancient woodland would have ldquovery large adverse impacts according to the report. But further assessment would examine the exact effects of the loss of that woodland.The report said: ldquoThe environmental assessment would examine the loss of woodland in terms of its use in flood retention, water quality, social value, carbon capture, landscape value and cultural heritage value, as well as its value to bioersity.If the ldquovery large adverse impacts canrsquot be avoided by redesigning the road, new trees could be planted where to compensate for the loss of ancient woodland.This would include moving and replanting some of the old trees and soil.The next stage would also include a wider, detailed environmental impact assessment, and recommendations on how to mitigate potential impacts on the environment surrounding the proposed road.Another concern raised has been the uncertain future of Cardf Airport, which was recently bailed out by the Welsh Government with a pound. million grant.But transport planners pointed to plans to make it easier to get to the airport on foot, by bike, bus, train, and in private motor vehicles.The cabinet report said: ldquoWhile recognising that the basis of future studies would increasingly need to consider the emerging trends and patterns resulting from Covid-, it is understood that the long-term vision of the airport remains at this present time.Responding to the report, campaigners have renewed calls for the Vale council to scrap the plans for the road altogether.A spokesperson for Vale Communities for Future Generations said: ldquoWhy the Vale of Glamorgan council is persisting in wasting public money on keeping this outdated road plan alive is hard to understand. The sheer volume of recent objections to the proposal clearly indicates the public has other priorities.ldquoThe original  Vale council assumption was that the road was needed for better vehicle access to Cardf Airport mdash which was denied by the airport management.ldquoSince then the airportrsquos passenger numbers have shrunk, millions of pounds of public money has been spent by the Welsh Government on propping it up financially and the future of air travel globally is uncertain post Covid  pandemic.ldquoThese are hardly the circumstances under which to continue promoting an expensive and environmentally destructive road building plan that was developed before the Vale of Glamorgan council and the Welsh Government declared a climate emergency in .ldquoIt is time for this plan to be recognised as a prime example of outdated thinking, and finally scrapped so that Vale of Glamorgan council can prioritise spending on environmentally sound projects. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.
