It breeds real devotion, I\u0027ve found.\u0027Titchmarsh said: \u0027It is always a privilege to spend time in the company of His Royal Highness and none more so than when it involves our mutual enjoyment of classical music.\u0027It is typically thoughtful of him to choose to highlight the plight of his many musical patronages, alongside the difficulties that all musicians face, during an unprecedented period when enjoyment of live music has been curtailed.\u0027 A Royal Appointment will be broadcast on Classic FM tonight at 8pm, with Charles presenting a show himself tomorrow at the same time. "},{"url":null,"title":"German state plans end coronavirus restrictions June 6 proposal received criticism","story":"Share this articleGerman state is first to abolish enforced lockdown restrictions | News | The Times"},{"url":null,"title":"Lance Armstrong bought entire tables dinner drinks screamed f him","story":"Share this articleLance Armstrong says in film that stepfather ¿beat the (expletive) out of me¿Lance Armstrong documentary gets off to quite the start"},{"url":null,"title":"Adorable moment tiny cygnets struggle climb kerb cross road","story":"Share this articleGeorge and Zelda introduce a magnificent seven new arrivals to Pittville Park lake - Gloucestershire Live"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ecb5b8afbb1197d37d96eeef53be51485a0c039/0_731_1413_847/master/1413.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fa2bcfd7797daa793c7c3f3ff6a70b99","title":"its brought home the value of these roles lockdowns private sector heroes","story":"When the UK population was told to stay indoors, one maintenance team in Chester refused to let people in need of vital supplies go without. Two months on, Qwest continues to support the local community, delivering food, medication and even treatsThe effects of the coronavirus crisis extend far beyond those who have contracted Covid-19, with lockdown taking its toll on at-risk groups in cities, towns and villages countrywide. The past eight weeks have seen volunteers and local authorities rally together to help those in need. Efforts to help include work by the private sector, which has played its own part in helping those people who need it most.For energy and services company Engie, the Covid-19 pandemic has seen its teams support councils and local communities in ways that move far beyond their normal duties. The company, which has 15 major local authority partnerships and is active on regeneration projects in more than 400 communities, has deployed staff to help deliver resources, such as welfare boxes, through several of its contracts, including Qwest – its joint-venture partnership with Cheshire west and Chester council.Qwest’s engineering team was the first to distribute these urgent boxes to residents in the area and has continued to do so, delivering non-perishable essential food items to people who are shielding from the virus. Team leader Leon Cooke and his colleagues have swapped their usual maintenance roles to help deliver the parcels, working until 10pm on the first night to make sure 69 people got the supplies they vitally needed.“We pick up the parcels from Ellesmere Port Sports Village and then deliver them around the county,” says Cooke. With support from elsewhere, the whole team isn’t always required to help, and Cooke finds his engineers vying to get involved. “We get a real sense of achievement. We’ve got nine engineers and some days we’re only asked for two, so the lads are really fighting as to who can go out. We have work on, but everyone’s working from home at the moment – only urgent jobs are getting carried out maintenance- wise – so they’re champing at the bit to help the community. We’ve developed a ‘wheel of fortune’, so if we get a phone call saying: ‘I need two engineers to help out volunteering’, I spin and pick an engineer.”Delivering parcels isn’t the only way the team has been involved, with staff driving to Manchester to collect donated supermarket food, including treats such as Easter eggs, for the council’s food hub, according to Qwest managing director Ben Cummins.Cooke and a colleague also helped one resident who had recently been discharged from hospital by carrying out vital adaptations to his home. “He was in need of some grab handles in the bathroom, so we went out and fitted them,” says Cooke.Cummins adds: “Although it’s not our normal job, Leon and his team said they’d go in and help.”Qwest has plenty of stories of staff going the extra mile to help members of the community. In one case, a team member working in the contact centre took a call from an elderly resident with a disabled son and a husband with terminal cancer who could only eat soft food. Concerned about how long they would have to wait for the right food, the employee walked to a nearby supermarket, queued up, bought the food and dropped it off, meaning the family got it within a few hours of calling.On another occasion, an employee received a call from a diabetic resident who was shielding and hadn’t eaten properly for days. He was struggling to control his blood sugar levels. The team member did the shopping and delivered the food to the man – and his dog. “Our staff know the right thing to do,” says Cummins. “They’re highly competent and caring iniduals. They don’t do the job just for the money – they do it because they care.”Delivering food parcels isn’t the only way Qwest has shifted its work to help the local community amid the coronavirus crisis. Staff have also collected medication for residents, delivered PPE, and distributed PCs to council staff working from home. Qwest has also introduced an AI chatbot for the council’s website, to direct concerned residents to external websites for advice, and is providing security staff at distribution centres and at hotels that are housing people who are homeless.The roles team members have taken up may differ from their usual jobs, but volunteering isn’t anything new for staff who devote hours to helping the community on a regular basis, says Cummins. They helped to put a roof on a community centre last year and also worked on gardens at a care home. That desire to help comes from recognising that those affected could be their own family and friends. “One of our members of staff is 78. He is shielding,” he says. “The reality is we’re helping our wider community who pay our wages. Ultimately this is our family as much as it is anybody else’s. It’s about doing the right thing and recognising that we’re all in this together,” he says.Cooke agrees, saying that while staff are aware that by volunteering to help on the frontline they may be putting themselves at risk, they have the right equipment to stay safe and ultimately want to help. “There’s a sense of pride. We have a really close team – we all look after each other. From day one everyone was volunteering and wanted to help. One of our engineers has underlying health issues, so there’s no chance of him going anywhere, but he’s concentrating on maintenance tasks. We’re really happy just to work with the community and keep everything going with regard to the parcels.”Cummins says: “The question we’ve asked ourselves several times is, if we don’t do it, who will? There’s risk in everything you do, but it’s about balancing that risk, otherwise we’d end up with people dying at home, or having to go out and get shopping and putting themselves at far greater risk than we would be. It’s proportional, it’s managed risk.“The one thing I’d say on behalf of Leon and the other staff, our cleaners for example, is sometimes these roles are undervalued and overlooked. I think what this has brought home is the importance of what they do, and the value that they bring every single day, even when people don’t notice it’s there. When it stops, suddenly everyone notices.”This type of work carried out by frontline staff such as Cooke and his team has already been recognised by Cabinet Office minister Lord Agnew, who said: “The way we have seen many large organisations and their staff move from their normal day-to-day work into projects to help tackle coronavirus has been remarkable. They have been able to turn around projects very quickly, such as delivering hundreds of new ventilators to the NHS and setting up systems to deliver much-needed resources, including food parcels and PPE equipment, to those who really need it. Their work is a tribute to their organisations and a wonderful example of their commitment to working on behalf of the public.”This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

In West and South Yorkshire, an academy trust executive and a food services boss stepped in to see how they could help A delivery of food arrives at a doorstep. Inside the hamper are bags of pasta, tins of tuna, tomatoes and baked beans. There are also blocks of cheese, yoghurts, milk and cereal. It’s a basic shopping list, but for the children and their families receiving this box it’s a lifeline, meaning they are able to feed themselves for the next few days.“We’ve had calls from people in tears”, Pam Knox, chief financial officer from the Waterton Academy Trust, who has been delivering the food bundles. “If they’ve not been able to get out, or are pregnant, they’ve emailed and they are so, so grateful.”The closing of schools on 21 March had a knock-on effect for some children, as, at the very baseline of support from the education system, they have a few meals a day provided for them. While some schools are still open for key workers’ children and vulnerable children, there are families in every city, town and village who will be struggling now more than ever.“We’ve got some quite high levels of deprivation in some of our communities,” says Knox. “There are some sad stories out there. So in the early days of the pandemic, we talked about how best we could support our families.”The trust - which oversees 13 schools in West and South Yorkshire - partnered with ISS Education, a company that provides facilities management services and acts as caterers for 400 schools across the UK. The problem they faced was how to get the food out to the 550 at-risk children and their families while still observing the lockdown.Right from the start, both companies were adamant that they didn’t want to resort to food vouchers. Knox says: “I personally didn’t want to do that because I didn’t feel that the food would necessarily get to the children involved. For me, it would have been the last resort.”Working alongside Linda Cregan, food services director for ISS, they trialled a packed lunch scheme for the first two weeks, where the kids would walk to school to pick up a sandwich and a yoghurt. “What that meant was that some of the children had to come to school to pick those up,” says Knox. “It simply wasn’t working – we had surplus food. They didn’t feel comfortable coming to school to pick something up every day. They really didn’t see the benefit of it.”When the prime minister announced the lockdown, he urged the public to use food delivery services. Orders for online grocery delivery across the UK jumped up. Tesco, Asda and Sainsbury’s sites all crashed with the strain of business, while Ocado’s CEO noted that demand spiked to 10 times the normal level. Knox and Cregan realised that home delivery might be the answer to their problem: they too could deliver a hamper of food to those who needed it the most.“We designed the hampers to give some store cupboard staples like pasta and bread, that meals like lunch or dinner could be made from,” said Cregan. “Then we made sure that there were fruit and vegetables in there.Similar to other pricier food boxes available to buy on the market, they also had the idea of including ingredient lists and recipe cards. Cregan says: “It was to give an idea of what you could do with those ingredients and to encourage children to cook with their families. It’s giving them a creative way to do that by providing the recipes that went alongside the food.”It worked, presumably as it gave families stuck at home an activity to all take part in together. “We have had children on Twitter showing us what they’d been cooking with their recipe books,” says Cregan.The free school meal allowance has been increased because of the lockdown, giving £15 for the weekly box, of which the team are currently delivering 550 a week. However, Knox notes that even with this support, there are people who fall between the cracks: “Some people aren’t on the free school meals register, but need to be. If we have spare hampers, we deliver those ourselves to people who the current crisis has left in difficulty.”Cregan adds that it takes all parts of the chain to make things happen. “It’s been lovely to see the focus on making sure vulnerable children get everything that they need, and having so many people making that happen has been a great thing.”This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

If we were ever tempted to view those post-industrial years in political black and white, Biaolobrzeski’s pictures insist on colouring them in.

Progress on that doorstep novel you promised you’d read when you had the chance not going so well? You could do worse than pick up a copy of Amora.Natalia Borges Polesso’s short story collection won several literary prizes in Brazil after it was published in 2015, and is here given a springy translation by Julia Sanches. There’s a lot to love in these 33 stories of love between women – and they really are short. Fun-sized, you might say, some only a paragraph long. A few are so skimpy they’re more like writing exercises it feels indulgent to include them. But many more are swift in delivering nuanced snapshots of heartbreak, tenderness, embarrassment, and desire.Polesso’s writing is brisk and fresh, and she captures the bleak human comedy of the myriad ways we mess up when it comes to matters of the heart. Her women often have a hefty sense of self-loathing, and a drily pained view of the world.But Polesso can be sweet too. She offers windows into the private worlds created by long-term lovers Marila Wakes Up, about an elderly couple still navigating how to show affection, is especially touching. Occasionally, however, the form becomes a little too cute in Polesso’s hands: she’s fond of tying stories off with a sentimental moment, like a neat bow.I prefer it when she turns to moments of embarrassment and awkwardness. She’s particularly acute on how we feel these physically: the cringe at falling down stairs in front of an ex (“You splat on the ground. You fear being the object of ridicule and lie still, slumped”) the “deathly heat” that climbs up a neck “making the area behind my ears hurt” when someone fears they’re about to be outed. While Amora is an enjoyable collection to dip into, many stories ripple with the ingrained fear and shame that comes from feeling you have to keep your sexuality hidden.• Amora by Natalia Borges Polesso (translated by Julia Sanches) is published by Amazon Crossing (£19.99).

But the government is refusing to answer our questionsWe are at an absolutely pivotal moment in the very public debate about readmitting more children to schools in England.You’ll note that I don’t say “reopening”. This is deliberate. Schools have remained open for vulnerable pupils and the children of key workers. And for those who have stayed at home, school staff transformed their entire working world from the tried and tested face-to-face method to an entirely new online offer for the vast majority of pupils.Now, as we begin to consider readmitting all pupils into school, staff are applying their resolve to the question of how to provide vital education while safeguarding staff, students and families alike.The discussions that we have had with the Department for Education have been business-like and open. That’s not to say it is getting everything right, but it really isn’t the case that we’re at loggerheads as some front-page headlines have suggested.During this crisis, false perceptions have overtaken reality. The perception that schools are shut and staff are inactive is incorrect. The same goes for the perception that this is a battle between unions and the government. Some media outlets have not reported this fairly or accurately, adding to the fear, confusion and anxiety, which is already plentiful. Stoking isions places an unnecessary obstacle in the way of the thing we all want most – to return our classrooms to the busy, happy environments of old as soon as possible.Basic questions we’ve asked the government have been interpreted as nothing short of treason. Questions like, what is the scientific rationale for a 1 June return date? Are large groups of children all in one place likely to spread Covid-19 and cause a second spike? It is not unreasonable to expect the government to have these answers, and to share them.Armed with this information, there is not a school leader in the land who would stand in the way of opening up more widely. Without such reassurances, leaders struggle with the ethical side of opening up, unsure of the risks and therefore unable to mitigate against them.Friday’s publication of the Sage committee of scientific advisers’ advice was an important step in achieving greater transparency and confidence, but we still need the government to explain how it plans to pass its own five tests, which need to be met before schools can admit more pupils.Confidence that any adjustments would not risk a second peak that would overwhelm the NHS is one of the qualifying measures. And at first reading, the Sage information offers little assurance on this issue because the evidence around the likely impact of a return to school is unclear. Furthermore, the separate Independent Sage group report says that new modelling shows the risk of infection would be halved if children returned to school two weeks later than ministers currently propose.At today’s Downing Street press conference, the prime minister indicated that the five tests would be met. But we should step back from 1 June as a “go” “no-go” date. Two-thirds of primary schools are still operated by local authorities and many of them, particularly in areas where infection rates are still high, have said that they won’t advise their schools to open, or at the very least are suggesting some flexibility is needed.The 1 June date has become toxic and counterproductive. The government has ended up in an unnecessary debate about “when”, when it should have had a much more open dialogue with organisations like ours about the “how”.All along, the National Association of Head Teachers has advocated a phased approach to readmitting more pupils. Local flexibility is key: the physical limitations of buildings, both inside and out, plus staff availability and parents’ needs, and the daily rate of new cases in the area should inform how schools begin to readmit more pupils. We will be talking to our members about this in a webcast this week.A school that chooses a gradual approach should not be thought of as failing to deliver, but rather as working as hard as it can to solve a difficult problem, with the needs of children and their families at the heart of their actions.I hope we can now quickly change the debate from when to how we widen access to schools safely and practically. We need to, for the sake of the communities we serve, the children we care for and the national interest too.• Paul Whiteman is general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, which represents leaders in the majority of schools in England, Wales and Northern Ireland"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/50f1aaa261143ddfda3af3b77eb58d8885a46b23/527_0_1473_884/master/1473.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=80974104e10e354c6ca75430e56b08e5","title":"novel sayaka murata convenience store woman","story":"Reading Convenience Store Woman helped me to have confidence in myself as an autistic writerTwo years ago in Dublin, I read the English translation of Sayaka Murata’s 2016 novel Convenience Store Woman. The first paragraph described a Japanese supermarket’s cacophony – tinkling door chime, voices, scanner beeps. I’d been to Tokyo and loved those sounds and there it was, that embrace.I kept reading, and kept seeing myself in the narrator. All her life, Japanese convenience store worker Keiko Furukura has had to teach herself how to behave around others. She’s relieved when her head office trainer guides her: “It was the first time anyone had ever taught me how to accomplish a normal facial expression and manner of speech.” She pretends to share co-workers’ petty irritations, and is serenely oblivious to gossip. When patronised, she only really cares about the logic: yes, yes, that was rude, but was it well argued? I’m autistic, and this is all very me.I’d thought my brain was too different to appear in a novel, but there I was. I smiled whenever I recognised an experience, which meant I basically smiled for the whole book.Keiko never clocks off from acting “normal”. For her and for me, socialising isn’t “leisure”. It’s more work, and there’s no manual. Employers are narrow-minded (“If I ever became a foreign object, I’d no doubt be eliminated.”), but so are most people, or they’d stop requiring us to mimic them. Keiko feels lonely in the way I often do: not because we lack company, but because praise for a persona that we cultivate for others suggests that no one loves our real self.This sentence floored me: “She’s far happier thinking her sister is normal, even if she has a lot of problems, than she is having an abnormal sister for whom everything is fine.” That’s why I squash my emotions in public. I can’t be happy, because if I do then my voice will go monotone and I’ll forget to make the right faces. I can’t get excited because then I’ll start flapping my hands. I need to really trust someone before I can let myself feel anything around them, since I know from robust trial and error that many people will mock my spectrum traits. Keiko’s words made me feel that in my throat: the repression, and some of what I use to cover it.It’s easy to see Keiko as a late-capitalist stooge, but I don’t read Convenience Store Woman as an interrogation of alienated labour. To me, the novel says that if one play-acts everywhere, it’s freeing to have a script. I’d never seen that in fiction: no schmaltzy girl-boss pipe dreams, just bald awareness that all human integration requires pretence if society finds you weird. I loved Keiko. She got it.Then I read the reviews. Apparently Keiko is “chilling”, “an oddball” and “latently psychopathic”. The book is “depraved” and a form of “horror”, this last because our heroine has a low-paid job. Warn the townspeople.For my part, I was entirely Team Keiko. Yes, as a child Keiko bashes two boys with a spade to stop them fighting but she’s using the boys’ own tool – physical force – to achieve a desired outcome. Yes, Keiko sees a dead bird in the park and is confused by her family’s mawkish desire to bury it when they could simply grill it for dinner but what distinguishes this bird from the other birds they eat? Yes, Keiko muses that despite the hassle of soothing her infant nephew, it would be easier to stop his cries by stabbing him with a cake knife but she’s only observing. Is she wrong? Can you think of a quicker way? Leave Keiko alone!I was with her through hell and yakitori. Our thoughts were so similar that no other difference mattered. I’m in my 20s and Keiko’s in her 30s, I’m Irish and she’s Japanese, I like sex and she doesn’t but we were as one on the cake knife question.It puzzles me when people complain of not having “connected” with a protagonist. I can’t speak for anyone else on the spectrum, but I don’t always need to see myself in books. I’m not saying that I never side with characters. I feel close to Jean Rhys’s bad women, Evelyn Waugh’s fractured Catholics, Helen Oyeyemi’s escapists, Oscar Wilde’s caustic queers. But while I’m pleased when I relate, I’m not dissatisfied if I don’t. Characters usually think and act in ways I find alien. If I needed to bond with them then I’d rarely enjoy fiction. That’s not because I “lack empathy”. Non-autistics would feel as I do about “identifying” if most books were about me and not them.Still, I loved Keiko for those “Me!” moments.I try to read generously, and Convenience Store Woman has helped me to approach other novels on fairer terms. When you recognise an experience in a book, an experience you had been looking for everywhere else to no avail, then it becomes easier to accept that most books weren’t trying to depict that experience in the first place. They’re still worth reading, those books, but the rewards lie elsewhere.Better yet, Convenience Store Woman has given me confidence in my own work. I write to allow myself one place, just one, where I can use my mind as it is instead of corseting it to look like other people’s. My debut novel, Exciting Times, isn’t about my life but it came from my brain, so it reflects how I process the world.

She talks about those dark days, the lighter side of lockdown and why Bake Off was just another gigSandi Toksvig has always been a huge “darling”-er. “Darling”, she would declaim when presenting the News Quiz on Radio 4 or QI on BBC Two it was never completely plain to me whether she was being affectionate or ironic. It depended on the context, I suppose on Bake Off, which is a kind of crucible for affection, it always sounded much warmer than it did on the radio. I have thought about this, on and off, for many years, but nothing prepared me for the experience of being called “darling” myself: a billionaire who had hired Beyoncé to sing Happy Birthday to them could not have felt more puffed up with pleasure.“Darling,” she starts, over Zoom of course, from what I take to be a stylish, tongue-and-groove shed in her south London back garden, “I miss restaurants. I want some really, really unctuous service.” Over the course of our conversation, she takes me on a whistle-stop tour of her regular social life, her drink of choice (bourbon), the bars where she’d prefer a martini and why she doesn’t have an American accent, even though that’s where she grew up. It is all peppered with the tantalising promise of imminent firm friendship.“One day, you and I will get roaring drunk together,” she says. “And when I’m roaring drunk, I become extremely American. My wife says to me: ‘Oh my God, New York’s arrived – it’s time to go to bed.’” She and the psychotherapist Debbie Toksvig met at a dinner party in 2000, although they didn’t become a couple until 2006. They were civil-partnered in 2007 and got married as soon as it became legal to do so, in 2014.Great waves of jubilant nostalgia crash over the conversation: I miss extroverts, bars and Dorothy Parkerish wit. By the end of it all, I hate lockdown more than I have in all these weeks annoyingly, Toksvig loves it. “I’m allowed to sit in my office all day, every day, and nobody says anything about it or says: ‘You must come and host an auction.’ It’s marvellous.” She and Debbie have taken up educational cycling. “I’ve got lots of books about quirky bits of London things my poor wife doesn’t give a fuck about. And I say: ‘We’re going to go and visit a prostitute’s graveyard today.’”Now 62, she misses the kids – Jesse, 31, Megan, 29, and Theo, 25 – she had with her former partner, Peta Stewart, and says in a theatrically matter-of-fact way: “My grandchildren are growing up without me.” But the bustle? Not so much. She was never in this game for the attention. “Do you not find it weird, darling, that people have an idea about you? They’ve put you in a category – mine will say ‘comedian’ or something – and that’s not how I see myself at all.”Where would one put her? Certainly, at the start of her career, you’d have said comedian: she was a member of the Cambridge Footlights, as any self-respecting name-of-the-80s had to be. She was a Comedy Store Player before moving into TV, first of all as a presenter on the children’s show No 73. It was not her most distinctive work (she has quite a caustic, not-at-all-childish wit), but is etched into the minds of the now middle-aged.At the same time, she was always a writer, of columns, novels, young adult fiction, plays and musicals. “I love the thing of subduing words,” she says. “My dad was a wonderful writer. He used to describe it as: ‘First, you catch your fish, then you need to fillet your fish until you serve the finest piece.’” He was a Danish foreign correspondent, and while she grew up mainly in the US, her parents were always on the move, and she has the urbane wherever-I-lay-my-hat outlook of a diplomat’s child: she can be Danish, English and a New Yorker in the course of one sentence.By the mid-90s, thanks to the tabloids, she was mostly famous for being gay. It doesn’t seem like that long ago, until you remember how unusual it was then for women in the public eye to come out. And then it feels like centuries ago. The prejudice was extraordinary: Toksvig was stood down by Save the Children, as compere for its 75th birthday celebrations, but a direct action protest by the Lesbian Avengers led the charity to apologise. (Complete tangent, but this is everything that’s wrong with corporate charities – trying to please the Sun newspaper and the Lesbian Avengers at the same time, instead of having some bloody values.)But I am much more exercised about this than Toksvig, who is very funny, even mellow, on the subject. “For a long time, Deb and I didn’t live in a house – we lived in a ‘love nest’. What do they think is going on here? We’re basically going: ‘Do you think these tomatoes have gone off?’” She never made the mistake of taking the media’s view as a snapshot of the culture. “I’ve always said the British people are nicer, kinder people than the tabloid press would have us believe,” she says, of this and, by extension, every era. “I came out, and the tabloid press thought that I was Cruella de Vil I never got that from the public.” The mood of the nation prevailed over the bigotry, and “they’ve stopped putting ‘lesbian Sandi Toksvig’ whenever they mention me. I don’t know whether it’s because it’s a given, or they’ve just given up. I’m still a lesbian.”If all this made her de facto political, she was nevertheless still neutral enough in terms of party politics to be made host of the News Quiz in 2006, and the subsequent decade was the show’s golden age, with Toksvig and the much-mourned Jeremy Hardy perfecting an intoxicating double act Hardy with his fireworks of grumpiness, and Toksvig batting him back with a paw, like a dog and a cat in perpetual high jinks. “My love for that man knows no bounds,” she says, mournfully, “The best bits were not broadcastable. He would dare to do any topic of any kind. There was a terrible story – some Austrian man had kept his children in the basement for years. Jeremy started on why this couldn’t possibly have happened in England because of the planning regulations: ‘You couldn’t possibly have a loo off the kitchen like that.’ He referred to it as the Von Trapped family. It was appalling and hilarious. And I just sat there.” Toksvig quit the News Quiz in 2015 to co-found the Women’s Equality party (WEP). Hardy, she says, “always used to tease me that I’d started the Women’s Nagging party”.She is still very upset about Brexit, and chlorinated chicken – “We’re going to get no-deal, and nobody’s going to notice.” Great. Fresh waves of nostalgia. Now I also miss remainiacs and Jeremy Hardy, and the phase of parenting when you’re allowed to tell someone they’re tired. This, incidentally, is why even before 2015 and the WEP, it always felt as if Toksvig was allowed to skate closer to politics than other broadcasters: even when she’s talking about a prime minister she plainly has no respect for, she manages to couch that quite fondly. She would turf him out of Downing Street, given the chance, but she would ruffle his hair first, and he would probably be glad of it.In 2016, she took over from Stephen Fry as the presenter of QI indeed, technically, it’s the next season we’re here to talk about, along with her podcasts, called Vox Toks, wonderful vignettes telling the unheard histories of women. And although she will occasionally ert into one of those – Emma Cons, for instance, who opened the Old Vic and fought for working-class access to education as well as the vote for women – she talks quite dismissively about her own work. I have never interviewed anyone more fiercely resistant to plugging the thing they’re supposed to plug.It was considered quite a high-risk enterprise to replace Fry at all, since his very distinctive hosting style – veering expertly between pompous and skittish, headteacherly and rebellious – was so baked into the show’s success. Toksvig doesn’t have much patience with this kind of mystique-building on quizshows or, indeed, anything. “I’ve been a broadcaster a really long time. I don’t know what there was to worry about. I ask a question and then I see if anybody else knows the answer.” People kept asking her how she would fill Fry’s shoes. “I hadn’t planned to wear his shoes,” she recalls archly, “so it’s really not a problem. And, also, they tell you the answers beforehand he doesn’t know it all. I hate to break it to you. It’s like a boy’s card trick: ‘Look at me! I know everything.’”When, in 2017, she and Noel Fielding took over Bake Off from Mel and Sue, the pressure was even more intense, because they’d turned a quirky idea into this incredible cash cow, and all the world’s producers were wondering what the exact ingredients were that would keep the cow alive. “People were in a state of ashen terror. I’ve never seen so many executives look so pale. You’d be doing something, with 40 people behind the camera, staring, shaking their heads.” As ever, she refused to engage with this psychodrama. “It’s a job you try to do your best, and you go home.” She quit the show earlier this year to work on other projects, and is being replaced by Matt Lucas. Did she ever experience any pressure, being a national treasure, taking over from two other national treasures, on a show that is itself a national treasure? “I’m diffident about that kind of thing. I don’t know what it means. I just try to be a good person, try to do things for good effect.”The projects she speaks most passionately about aren’t TV at all, but the musicals she has written, most recently, one with her sister, Jenifer Toksvig, a librettist (whom she talks about so admiringly that I nearly wrote “the wonderful librettist”, on a reflex). “At Christmas, my sister and I wrote a show for the Globe theatre called The Snow Globe, and we made it snow inside, and we made people roar, and they were happy. It was wonderful theatre. It was a great thing to do, to watch adults behave like kids.” They’ve just been commissioned to write an opera together, but she won’t tell me the plot because Jenifer would kill her.The prospect of doing the job delights her, even while realities of the world are always biting. “I have not heard one single government person talk about theatre. I’ve not heard one person discuss the reopening of live art. This is important. We need to gather and have those communal experiences. We need that thing, where you leave a theatre feeling better than when you arrived. I feel like I’m flying when I do live shows.” I think, on balance, that’s the box you’d put her in, if not comedian, host or writer: “Person whom you leave feeling better than when you arrived.”• QI returns to BBC Two on Thursday 28 May, and Sandi Toksvig’s new podcast We Will Get Past This is available on all podcast platforms."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/779f66db8cdadc029811ab54d2fd41b7016824ce/0_166_5311_3186/master/5311.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ceccc807eb964f9680cbaeac82deaeb5","title":"pm accepts some english primary schools may not return on 1 june","story":"Boris Johnson has agreed schools need more time to prepare for restartBoris Johnson is pressing ahead with plans to reopen schools on 1 June but moved to appease councils and teaching unions by acknowledging for the first time that primary schools in England won’t have to reopen to more pupils until they are prepared.The acknowledgment by the prime minister came in his opening statement at the daily Covid-19 press conference on Sunday, in which Johnson said the government wanted primary schools to plan for allowing pupils in reception, year one and year six to return on 1 June.But Johnson took notice of the controversy the 1 June reopening date has sparked among local authorities, parents and teachers, with many saying it was too early, especially in those areas of the north-east of England where coronavirus infection rates remain high.“Now I acknowledge that a June first opening may not be possible for all schools but the government will continue to support and work with the sector to ensure that any schools experiencing difficulties are able to open more widely as soon as possible,” Johnson said.Patrick Roach, general secretary of the NASUWT teaching union, said in response: “The government has yet to reassure parents and teachers that opening schools from 1 June will be safe, and now appears to accept that many schools will not be able to reopen on that date.”Johnson also named a later date for secondary school pupils to return, with only year 10 and year 12 - pupils in their first year of GCSE and A-level studies – able to meet their teachers from 15 June.Johnson later told the press conference that England’s schools were likely to have fully reopened by September. Last week the national governments of Scotland and Northern Ireland announced that were not reopening schools more fully until late August.School leaders and teaching unions said they were glad to hear Johnson’s acknowledgement that reopening after the half-term holiday this week was unrealistic for all schools, and that many would need more help.“We welcome the prime minister’s recognition that it will not be possible for all primary schools to open to more pupils from June 1,” said Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders.“The reality is that many schools will need to phase back eligible pupils over a period of time, and there will be a great deal of variability across the country.”The prime minister said the Department for Education “will engage with teaching unions, local authorities and school leaders in the coming days, giving them an opportunity to ask questions and probe the evidence behind our plan.“The final decision will be taken as part of the formal review into lockdown measures, which the law requires us to undertake by Thursday. We will, of course, continue to consider all the evidence, as we said we will do, and we will continue to work hard with those bodies over the course of the coming week.”But Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT), said the government needed to “step back” from the 1 June cliff edge.“The 1 June date has become toxic and counterproductive. The government has ended up in an unnecessary debate about ‘when’, when it should have had a much more open dialogue with organisations like ours about the ‘how’,” said Whiteman, writing in the .The NAHT leader – who represents mainly primary school heads and senior staff – also defended the role of the teaching unions in challenging the government over its plans despite the heavy criticism they have attracted from some wings of the media.“Basic questions we’ve asked the government have been interpreted as nothing short of treason. Questions like, what is the scientific rationale for a 1 June return date? Are large groups of children all in one place likely to spread Covid-19 and cause a second spike? It is not unreasonable for the government to have these answers, and to share them,” Whiteman said.“Armed with this information, there is not a school leader in the land who would stand in the way of opening up more widely. Without such reassurances, leaders struggle with the ethical side of opening up, unsure of the risks and therefore unable to mitigate against them.”Whiteman revealed that the DfE’s discussions with unions have been “business-like and open. That’s not to say it is getting everything right, but it really isn’t the case that we’re at loggerheads as some front-page headlines have suggested.”Sir Michael Wilshaw, the former chief inspector of schools in England, told Sky News that implementing social distancing for children as young as five “is going to be like herding cats, it’s going to be really difficult. But other schools are doing it abroad and we should be doing the same.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/106b7a121dc37a4752ad605e9f2187399fea4001/0_0_7360_4418/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af1993501dbaf3f7ce1bfb56529f024b","title":"shopping habits of generation z could spell end of fast fashion","story":"Research shows consumers are following younger generation’s lead in move towards sustainable fashionWith the high street and the fashion industry brought to its knees by the coronavirus pandemic, the ‘buy less, buy better’ ideology of generation Z – those aged 18 to 24 – could see the beginning of the end of fast fashion, new research suggests.If generation Z’s habits are adopted by the population as a whole there could be a shift to consumers with a “ided wardrobe” – featuring rented items and others bought from resale vendors – becoming the new normal.The RSA are also asking for enforced standards around how durable clothes are, plus a push towards a more circular localised economy within fashion.This emphasis on sustainability, non mass-produced goods and uniqueness mirrors the consumer values of the younger generation whose attitude towards fashion has been shaped by the “Blue Planet effect”. Kati Chitrakorn, retail and marketing editor at Vogue Business, said: “For today’s kids fashion is less about fitting in and more about making choices that reflect their own identity.”Before the pandemic two-thirds of clothing was purchased in stores, but the 18+ group had already found alternatives to bricks and mortar (their sophisticated modes of consumption often outpacing what the high street could offer) shopping through online resale sites such as Poshmark, Grailed, Vestiaire Collective and clothing rental sites, all of which have seen a sales boost during lockdown. “Being able to ‘do something’ – upcycling, customising or reusing rather than discarding – lets younger people feel like they’re part of a movement,” says Chitrakorn “and that mindset has been popular even prior to the pandemic.”Sonia Lapinsky of retail consultants AlixPartners said: “Rental will continue to expand, given consumer sustainability consciousness and a reset in consumerism. We have all made do with a lot less for many weeks – enough to form new habits.”“We definitely believe that this unique moment will encourage people to reconsider resale as an alternative to shopping ‘new’,” she says. “Our community has access to a vast inventory of pre-loved streetwear, vintage designer, one-of-a-kind creations and more that allows them to build their own identity and create their own story all as a sustainable choice. They have the financial incentive to buy and sell garments, rather than leaving them unused in a wardrobe or sending them to a landfill.”But it’s not that simple. With retailers still working out what a re-opened store would look like (socially distanced shoppers in store, sales assistants behind plexiglass, compulsory masks, the question of changing rooms), post-corona resale and rental outfits will have the same issues. “Are they communicative and transparent regarding product handling processes and cleanliness?,” asks Lapinsky “If not, the consumer will likely remain skittish to pre-used garments and accessories.” However, e-commerce is still considered by many to be the safest way of shopping.The future of fashion and retail is under debate. The RSA’s calls follow similar requests from fashion bodies calling for social and environmental sustainability.On Thursday, the British Fashion Council and the Council of Fashion Designers of America released a statement requesting a reduction in the number of seasonal collections, clothes produced and travel. The sentiment was echoed in an open letter from designers and retailers led by Dries Van Noten that appeared early last week."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f6d06a53a8d104c9d95b6c1be7ae143b556efea/0_1262_4160_2496/master/4160.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=99f396f46319c2267a09241dfc74e478","title":"a look at the worlds most stylish men in pictures","story":"The Staley-Wise Gallery in New York is currently closed, but has plundered its archives to curate an online exhibition celebrating some of the world’s best-dressed men.

In an age of pandemic, might such digital stars become the norm?With A-listers such as Scarlett Johansson, Will Smith and Steven Spielberg on its books, Creative Artists Agency (CAA) is a fixture of the Hollywood establishment, but its latest client is a little different. On 6 May, Variety revealed that CAA had signed up Miquela, a 19-year-old, Brazilian-American model, pop singer, influencer and self-described “change-seeking robot with the drip”. That’s right: Miquela isn’t an actual human. She is a virtual celeb, created in 2016 by a California tech startup named Brud. But her career is looking pretty real right now.According to Variety, CAA will work with Miquela in areas “including TV, film, and brand strategy and commercial endorsements, raising the prospect of a movie or show featuring the character”. So there’s a tip for all you struggling actors wondering where you have been going wrong: try not existing!From an industry perspective, virtual actors are an enticing prospect. They are literally totally malleable. They will never complain, they are always in prime condition and camera-ready (creepily, Miquela is for ever 19 years old). They will even work through an industry-stalling pandemic without complaint. And their salary demands are competitive. Miquela also brings along a fanbase. She has 2.2 million Instagram followers, she’s duetted with real-life singers, and she has sagas with virtual boyfriends and frenemies (no doubt negotiating their own deals right now). She pushes the right buttons: young, fashionable, fluent in social-media discourse. She is not ambitious, she’s just programmed that way.Is Miquela the vanguard of an army of virtual actors, poised to put human stars out of work? If that is the future, then blame the movies for paving the way with stories such as Her, Ex Machina and, especially, Al Pacino’s forgotten romcom Simone (where his virtual thesp wins the best actress Oscar). We are not there yet, though. For one thing, Miquela is not a genuine AI she is scripted and voiced by humans, so is effectively an animated character. Nor is she much of an actor. Her face has limited range when it comes to nuance or emotion. Mind you, they said that about Arnold Schwarzenegger once.CAA clearly senses which way the wind is blowing. It knows that being a successful actor is never just about acting. The reason, say, Vin Diesel or Dwayne Johnson command huge salaries is not because they are so good at inhabiting a role (sorry guys, hate to break it to you). Celebrity is an inextricable factor in the equation, and it’s no longer exclusive to humans. You could argue that virtual actors will never advance the arts or capture essential truths about humanity, but they don’t have to. They just have to fake it. And isn’t that what acting’s all about, anyway?

I knew this before I watched it because, every few months for the best part of two decades, Mark Kermode has reminded me on his Wittertainment radio show. But not until I watched it did I understand the extent to which Jaws is not a film about a shark, and it would still elude me now had I not watched it when I watched it.You can’t come cold to Jaws, but everything you think know is irrelevant once the opening sequence is under way. Set in the ocean around Amity Island to John Williams’ brilliant, horrendous score, it submerges the viewer with an oppressive helplessness that is intensely familiar. Death is imminent, and all we can do is wait.Tone established, we cut to people on the beach, enjoying joy. They remind us that life is both precious and fragile, because we know one of them will soon lose theirs in the course of simply going about their business.The stress is profound, and all we can do is hope for the impossible – that the threat either fades away or swerves off course – until it doesn’t. We see an end that is lonely, protracted and savage, but then see neither body nor grieving relatives, so do not really feel loss, the victim a statistic whose death does not speak to us. We feel relieved that we had no relationship with her and guilt at that relief, before life swiftly resumes.But Martin Brody, the police chief, sees the corpse and, fearing further tragedy, shares his fears with the mayor – a try-hard blow-hard who oozes smarm, privilege and phoney eccentricity. In the way of a man who has never had to take responsibility for his actions, he responds with crass condescension, prioritising profits over people – Independence Day is imminent – and glibness over substance. Jaws is not a film about a shark.So we return to the beach for our next horrendous death, before which a woman wonders when she’ll become “an islander”. “Never!” her councilwoman friend tells her. “You’re not born here.” The cost of this smug, insular exceptionalism – this islander mentality – will soon be measured in blood.The vulnerability of the second victim, a young boy, is even more disquieting than the first, and this time we see the mother who loves him. When she returns shortly afterwards, utterly bereft, we can no longer ignore the reality that death is irreversible and everyone is someone’s something. In desperation, she slaps Brody.Naturally, people are concerned, so a town meeting is called. Brody is asked if he is going to close the beaches. He says he is, only to be overruled by the mayor, whose power and privilege mean he still feels safe. Thus danger you can’t see is abetted by leadership you can see through. Jaws is not a film about a shark.The mayor’s problem is that ingrained within him is a disgust for detail and decency, which is why he was surprised by an attack that was both predicted and planned for. Because he does not care for people not of his type, he refuses to shock people who must be shocked by something shocking, for fear of them being shocked, while those whose job it is to understand the specifics – we might call them experts – become ever angrier.Quickly, those fearing something terrible happening are painted as unpatriotic stiffs, bringing science to a pride fight. As such, though there’s a clear way to avoid aggravation – staying away from the water – people choose not to, unwilling to compromise the freedom that helps them make sense of things. Believing itself to have conquered the world, humanity is used to doing as it pleases, so when that turns out not to be the case it responds with confused belligerence, determined to show an oblivious opponent precisely who is boss. Jaws is not a film about a shark.The mayor’s desire to solve the problem lasts only until the cost becomes apparent. He can’t bring himself to sensibly pay a professional putting himself in harm’s way for the cause, so various chancers seize the chance to make a wedge, killing any old shark and proclaiming an easy victory.Those who know better insist to the contrary but, his already unstoppable arrogance fortified, the mayor encourages islanders to visit the beaches on the Fourth of July, even allowing his own kids to partake, and then, when people stay on the shore, pressurises someone to lead them into the water. A modern-day comparison might be to imagine a disease that can be spread by shaking hands and an exhibitionist prime minister then shaking hands with those suffering from it, at the same time as allowing huge sporting events to proceed and evoking war as an everlasting deposit into a national wank-bank able to cure every ill.Meanwhile, sensible people grow increasingly despondent at the preventable horror soon to be visited on unsuspecting patsies. The constant dread is of who will be next – when will someone we know die? – until finally we see the hideous threat with our own eyes. The reality, though, is that its effect – a severed limb – is far more traumatic, likewise the suffering visited on the children proximate to it. Jaws is not a film about a shark.Now, the mayor has no choice but to act, his realisation fired by his personal proximity to disaster. Consequently, the experience does not change him. He stumps up money for the hunt, but his performance reveals the incompetent invertebrate we already knew him to be.So three men set off to kill the shark – the bounty hunter, the scientist and Brody – and before they do, we see how worried Brody’s wife is. Previously, she had assuaged her feelings with sex and drink, but now the peril is directly upon her, she cannot, which is to say that everyone thinks they understand it until they understand it.Out at sea, booze, singing and camaraderie soon give way to squalor, rancour and claustrophobia, people trapped against their will with death marauding somewhere outside. Eventually, though, they neutralise the killer in a scene of ecstatic, triumphant relief and, victims forgotten, we assume that Amity immediately reverts to the vacuity that underpinned its catastrophe to begin with. Yeah, Jaws really is not a film about a shark."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83a26c72c2f432117710881a71123c9be6a77aee/24_581_6927_4157/master/6927.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=31b1039f63f44329a3ae9680bf397d96","title":"its time for a takeaway and there is a dazzling array of offerings available","story":"There’s a wide variety available, from literally gilded to cheap and cheerfulIn the depths of lockdown, the arrival of a takeaway can feel like a promising message from a lost world one where restaurants continue to do what they always did. It’s a sudden spike on the emotional heart monitor. A few weeks ago, I said I wouldn’t talk about such things in this column and I never go back on my word. Except when I do. So many intriguing takeaways have arrived at my house recently that to not mention some of them would be a dereliction of my ludicrous duty.Mostly they have been taken in a professional capacity. Oh, that we should all have such professions. Just before restaurants closed, I was recording a third series of my podcast Out to Lunch, in which I grill marvellous people to a turn over a marvellous meal: Dita Von Teese at Norma, Charlie Brooker at Chutney Mary and so on. But we have all had to adapt. So now I stay in for lunch and interview marvellous people by video, with a takeaway.We started outrageously. I was able to send both myself and Edgar Wright, director of Shaun of the Dead and Baby Driver, a Chinese. Except it was a gilded, Michelin-starred Chinese from Hakkasan Mayfair, which delivers across the centre of London. By gilded I mean literally so. Gold leaf may have been involved. The pert lobster dim sum, as full and rounded as an Instagrammer’s lips, came topped with caviar. You may now wish me to check my damn privilege. Well I just have. It turns out I have loads. So that’s nice.There was prawn toast, the plump, sesame-crusted minced seafood a fabulously wealthy but distant relative of the dour high-street version. There was finely sliced rib-eye steak with lily bulb with punchy black beans, and a raucous dish of king prawns in a thick, spicy coconut sauce. It all survived the journey unharmed, mostly because it came via Supper, a new high-end, app-based delivery service using bikes with temperature-controlled compartments that has partnered with some of London’s fancier restaurants. Basically, my takeaway arrived by limo. Accordingly, it is not cheap. Main courses start in the high teens, but don’t loiter there for long. (For £120 you can get a two-person menu, with all proceeds going to Great Ormond Street Hospital.) As ever, it’s worth it, but only if you can afford it.Hush now. Here’s something much cheaper. The charming singer-songwriter George Ezra got a bike’s worth of top dishes from the glorious Middle Eastern supermarket Green Valley in Kensington: it featured tabbouleh, pumpkin kibbeh and falafel popcorn, which are two words that had long been waiting for each other. To match him I stumbled upon the delightful Limett Bistro in West Dulwich. They were due to open on 1 April. That obviously couldn’t happen so they moved straight to delivery. Romanian-born George Moldoveanu’s Mediterranean-inspired cooking is vivid, thrilling and a cheery exercise in value.All starters are around £6.50. There is chargrilled pumpkin, spiced with the whipcrack of zatar, alongside crumbly feta and a herb salsa. Humble carrots are roasted with the punch of harissa to give them a leg up, and served with a citrus-boosted hummus, while spiced lamb meatballs arrive with a field-fresh cucumber salad and flatbread. The star is grilled chicken thighs marinated in yogurt, lemon and garlic alongside a mixed pepper stew and a fattoush salad, for £9.There have been others worthy of note: the Vietnamese restaurant Banh Banh, in Peckham, sent me a sweet-sour shredded papaya salad tossed with king prawns, crushed peanuts and crispy shallots, which made me feel like I was being healthy, plus chicken wings glazed in sticky fish sauce and chilli, which made me feel messy. I have also become mildly addicted to the fried chicken from Bird in Brixton, with its undulating crusty skin, full of golden nooks and crannies and spiced echoing crunch. It’s what KFC would be, if it had a career mentor and ambition. That, I ate on my own time.But undoubtedly the most engaging adventure was the readymeal kits dispatched to me by podcast guest Tom Kerridge, full of his familiar bravado and enthusiasm. I couldn’t see the point in sending him a takeaway, when he was supplying his own from his pub, the Butcher’s Tap in Marlow (alongside cooking hundreds of meals a week for the vulnerable). My starter of Isle of Wight tomato and feta salad with garlic pesto, priced at £5.50, had 11 potted elements. I had a jolly time, layering sliced tomatoes, then dressing them with a sticky tomato reduction, a wild garlic pesto, a crispy shallot crumb and many other things besides. Instructions were clear and the heaped, Technicolor result felt like the moment you finish running a bubble bath and it’s just waiting for you, the steam rising.The £9 main course was long-braised ox cheeks in a bordelaise sauce packed full of lardons, red wine and so much gelatine that when it first came out of the box to be heated in the oven, it was solid and rubbery. I didn’t know whether to eat it or play squash with it. There was mustard mash, asparagus and a box of finely ground crispy beef fat. I finished with a remarkably light sticky toffee pudding. No, I wasn’t spared the washing up, but it still felt like someone else had done the important work.A word on packaging. I’ve long fretted over the piles of plastic boxes that each takeaway moment can generate. They might carry a recyclable mark, but who knows whether that means anything? Those who have been involved in producing meals for vulnerable groups from home during this crisis, will now have found them damn useful. A black mark goes, then, to the restaurant local to me which dispatches its food in plastic pots closed up with a heat-sealed film instead of lids, meaning they are useless when emptied. Top marks, however, go to both Bird and Limett Bistro for using a paper-based packaging. And that, I can promise, is the last time I will mention takeaways in this column. Unless, of course, I change my mind.Let’s have a round-up of a few interesting delivery and takeaway options from around the country. French restaurant La Garrigue in Edinburgh is offering both home picnics and three-course meals. Dishes might include gutsy stuff like snail and duck gizzard pie, alongside cassoulet or chicken with a fennel and lemon sauce, followed by a blueberry clafoutis at £23.50 a head (lagarrigueathome). Meanwhile, the team behind both Artusi in Peckham and Deptford’s Marcella have various pastas – bucatini, cavatelli – alongside a variety of sauces from puttanesca to a sausage and saffron ragu, for around £12, while £28 could get you a mushroom and artichoke lasagne for three or four (artusi).In Newcastle, the Grainger Market traders, with support from the city council and a throng of volunteers, has put together a delivery service. It includes a variety of market boxes – fruit and veg, bread, cheeses – as well as selections from the various fishmongers, butchers and delis trading from the site. On 30 May they’re inviting customers to join them from home for a “bloody big afternoon tea” in support of Blood Cancer UK (shop.graingerdelivery).At the other end of the country the lovely Jeremy’s restaurant at Borde Hill, Haywards Heath in West Sussex has teamed up with the onsite café to provide an extensive takeaway menu of dishes that are both ready to eat and to be finished at home. It includes everything from a three-course menu for £35 a head, through a Sunday roast, to scotch eggs and cheese plates (jeremysrestaurant)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a5692b4af2214f9727d2db4506eb900e66885023/0_682_8031_4820/master/8031.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=93b724534a2d05808f0ff796767846f2","title":"rachel roddy recipe charred spring onions with pancetta","story":"They may be a Sicilian specialty, but cipollate catanesi are easy to enjoy anywhere – all you need is intense heat Maybe it is because I know the chances of going to Sicily this summer are slim, but I keep playing bits of the trip in my head in the same way I used to listen to lines of songs on cassettes: the screeching rewind, snap-stop, replay. The ripping drive down the autostrada del sole, motorway of sun, to Naples the overnight ferry to Palermo or Catania the first thick coffee the trip to the market to get a picnic for the journey to my partner’s family home. There is nothing special or unusual about a looping thought of getting away for a holiday the evocation of heat, saltwater or cold beer.At the moment, in Rome, the smells and tastes of Sicily are vivid to me, almost rudely so, amplified by my imagination, a cassette played through 120W amps, with distortion. The walk from Catania fish market back to the car park is always a smell-driven journey: it means passing under a bridge banked with rubbish, then past a man tending charcoal grills full of blackened pepper and onions. Writing this now, the smells of fermenting rubbish and scorched onions are as real and intrusive as the smell of the alcohol-bleach mixture my neighbour squeezes into the cracks on the communal staircase to kill “the virus”.I think the virus my neighbour chases with a cloth is the reason for my amplified senses. I have not been alone, I don’t think, in my almost tick-like checking for symptoms in the past few months: cough and temperature, obviously, but also smell and taste. I reassure myself I am fine, having the most exaggerated sense of both: coffee, fish bones, flowers, bleach, the uncovered cheese, sour milk, the rubbish in our courtyard, strawberries, baked onions.The man working the grill in Catania tends whole onions, baking them in their skins until they are completely charred on the outside. Inside, however, they are soft, with opaque layers that flump out when you peel away the outside, ready to be dressed with oil and red-wine vinegar. Other things found on Sicilian grills are le stigghiole – lamb’s intestines wound round spring onions then grilled over charcoal – and cipollate catanesi, pancetta wrapped around spring onions. Both are referred to as arrusti e mangia, roast and eat, and can be made just as easily in a garden or a kitchen.Most spring onions have bulbs the size of an olive they are ideal for this. If they are a passing-round snack, estimate three per person if they are part of a larger grill spread, two. I don’t bother trimming the spring onions, leaving all the green intact, plus the little stringy root, which provides a handle of sorts and can be bitten off.Simply wash the onions and pat them dry. For every onion, you need a thin rasher of pancetta, which is salt-cured pork belly. Streaky bacon works here, too. Wrap the rasher around the onion as if it were a ribbon round a maypole, so at a bias, covering the bottom two-thirds of the onion this leaves the greenery sticking out at one end and half the fat bulb peeping out at the other. Rub with olive oil and it is ready to cook.Most of the time, we cook this over white-hot charcoal in our small, bandy fornacella, which means we are on the flat concrete roof of my partner’s grandparents’ house in Sicily. I have also cooked them in an aluminium tray barbecue, in a friend’s pizza oven, on an iron griddle pan, in a frying pan, under the grill and in the oven. There are many options. Wherever you cook them, the heat needs to be intense (but not flaming), so the fatty pancetta melts then crisps, the slender onion cooks underneath and both ends char until black. A great part of the pleasure of onions and pancetta is the smell of the catching and the scorching, arrusti, then the mess of eating with your fingers, wherever you are or wherever that takes you."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36986ffc91afe2f0fa872578719467c92b60d559/0_141_3872_2324/master/3872.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=53a4b1d90cb45b8442fad634529975a4","title":"well put together four dressings that work for every salad","story":"Upping your salad dressing repertoire allows you to transform a dull bowl of leaves into something fancyThe secret to a great salad is a great dressing. Dressing your salad leaves like they’re about to appear on the Met Gala red carpet turns them from a second thought to fulfil your daily vegetable quota into a meal’s supportive understudy – ready to step in, perform and outshine if need be. Don’t worry, no foul play involved. Like the friend who is able to impressively clear and coordinate everyone’s iCal schedule for a weekend away, it’s the dressing that brings everything together.  All you have to do is master a few simple dressings and know when to wheel them out. I’ve found these four have served me well. There’s no science or witchcraft to them and they mostly use ingredients you probably already have at home. Just like your favourite winter trenchcoat, this simple Italian dressing goes with everything.  It’s your classic part extra-virgin olive oil, part vinegar combination, and you probably already have this one in your repertoire. This one really is about going on your own Italian vinegar adventure, depending on your vegetables and mood. Balsamic vinegar is great for salads that have a salty cheese (feta, goat’s cheese), tomato or fruit element (think grilled peaches or roasted pears). White-wine vinegar and red-wine vinegar can be used interchangeably the red variety is slightly more pungent. Both work with leafy green salads and crunchy vegetables including fennel, cucumber and radish.Extra-virgin olive oil, generous splash Vinegar, generous splash (your choice of balsamic, red-wine vinegar or white-wine vinegar)For this one, generously coat salad with equal parts extra-virgin olive oil and vinegar, then season with salt and pepper. Taste as you go – if you like a more robust dressing, add an extra splash of olive oil for more tangy, extra vinegar.This one is a riff on your classic French vinaigrette. It’s a little tangy and a little bit sour.It works well with bitter leafy greens, including rocket, ene and witlof. This is a good one if you’re also going down the route of salad for dinner and having a tuna nicoise, as the dressing is non-offensive and works well with fish, green beans, eggs and potatoes. 1 lemon, juiced2 tbsp Diijon mustard3 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil½ tbsp apple cider vinegarSalt and pepper, to tasteWhisk ingredients together or shake in a jar. Season with salt and pepper to taste.Often the greatest kitchen victories are those when you open the fridge and declare “there’s nothing to cook” and then using your end-of-week dregs miraculously whip together an impressive anything-goes dish. For me, the key ingredients for experiencing this success involve having tahini and yoghurt in the fridge and pouring this dressing over whatever rogue vegetables I’ve found. I’ll use this dressing over salads that incorporate a roasted vegetable element (such as eggplant, cauliflower, sprouts or broccoli) or chickpeas and kale.½ juice of lemon2 tbsp tahini (preferably hulled)¼ cup Greek yoghurt2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oilSalt and pepper, to tasteMix together and season to taste. Consistency should not be too thick or thin. Add extra olive oil if too thick, as it will help loosen the dressing and make it easier to coat everything in your salad.This is one of the greatest kitchen waste hacks – it utilises those wilted herbs in the bottom of the crisper and turns them into a herby, garlicky green sauce you will want to pour over everything from salads to meat. This version is a slight riff off one I learned from Alex Elliott-Howery of Sydney cafe Cornersmith, and as a salad dressing fiend I bow down to her every day for bringing this dressing into my life. Again, you can interchange this recipe with whatever soft herbs you have leftover in your fridge, and it pairs well with bean salads, potato salads, and also over eggs and meat.1 lemon (juice and zest)1-2 cloves of garlic (based on your taste)2 cups of soft herbs and stems (whatever you have left over, you can mix and match too – I like dill and parsley)¼ cup of extra-virgin olive oilSalt and pepper, to tasteRoughly chop your herbs – stems and all. Add everything to a food processor and blitz. Season to taste. You want the consistency to be slightly running and similar to a chimichurri, so add extra olive oil if need be. Once done, transfer to a container and store in the fridge for up to five days."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/77568d94b35e70b925142515fc8cd2b165cb040c/77_148_1801_1081/master/1801.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a5c1c459015b5178928764098634dee6","title":"joe hart all i want is to be a big part of a club hope burns through me","story":"Former England goalkeeper has started three games this season but he is still only 33 and feels he will have to move abroad to get back into the big timeMore than 500 days have passed since Joe Hart last played in a Premier League game and so, on Zoom, he leans forward when I say that the hurt of not being picked must eat away at him. “Yeah, but I embrace that feeling,” he says intently. “I’m glad I feel like that because you need that fire in you. You almost need that arrogance to think: ‘Why am I not being picked?’ The reason that I’m at the top fighting, or have been at the top, is because that’s in me.” Hart is 33 and he has been playing professional football for more than 16 years.He made his debut for Shrewsbury the day after he turned 17 and since then has won two Premier League titles with Manchester City, four Golden Gloves and 75 caps for England. After 12 years with City he played for Torino, West Ham and Burnley. But Hart has been in goal for Burnley only three times this season – a Carabao Cup defeat to Sunderland last August and two FA Cup ties, against Peterborough and Norwich, in January. He has been on the bench for all the other games.A simplistic assessment of Hart’s career would suggest it splits into two halves – before Pep and after Pep. Hart was told clearly by Guardiola in July 2016 that he had no future at City. Guardiola cannot be accused of being wrong for, in Ederson, he now has an outstanding goalkeeper who is highly accomplished with his feet. But Hart is intelligent and interested in exploring the blurred boundaries of football. Some of his greatest games – including the 2015 Champions League night at the Camp Nou when Lionel Messi described him as a “phenomenon” – followed soon after adversity. He is also keen to explain that, despite his predicament, his desire has intensified.“It’s got stronger. This lockdown has made me realise how much I want to play football,” he says. “All I want to do is be a big part of something. I understand I’m not going to be part of Real Madrid. I don’t think I’ve lost the ability, but I know how football works. I just want to be a big part of a club and give my all to them. That’s all that burns through me.”In the meantime Hart is opening up – in this interview and in a BBC programme on football and mental health to be screened on Thursday. He is one of the footballers who Prince William meets in the programme although, as he reiterates here, he has not suffered badly from depression. His career has been in a slump and he wants to share the lessons he has learned. Hart admits “it’s certainly my lowest point” and “I’m sad I’m not playing.” But he sees his long absence from the first team as “a challenge rather than a dark cloud. Mentally, because of what I’ve put in place when I was flying higher and winning leagues, I feel really comfortable talking about my head space. But I also need to speak because football’s difficult.”In the 2013-14 season, when he was dropped by Manuel Pellegrini at City, Hart felt angry. “I didn’t really know how to handle tough moments. You just want to bat everyone away: ‘I’m fine. Just leave me alone.’ It was really frustrating me and a bit of anger came in. Then my place came under threat for the first time.“I had a good relationship with the manager and we decided to get myself right away from football so that, when I came back, I could just enjoy playing again. That’s when I’m at my best. After five or six games I was back in.”Hart helped City win their second Premier League title in May 2014 – having been one of the few survivors who had played for the club before they were taken over by the Abu Dhabi group in 2008. He had been a key figure when they won their first title in 2012 and played under six managers before Guardiola changed everything.During all the ups and downs does Hart still see the same psychologist? “Yeah, I see Jamie on a regular basis. He’s become a huge part of my life and someone I’ll always work with. Having a sports psychologist helped me realise that you can definitely lighten the load if you lean on people. It’s so empowering when you open up.”Those lessons help him now. “I’m going to try and get back in the team. And if I don’t, there’s always another transfer opportunity. There’s no point in sulking. I’m still part of the squad. It gives you some power if you have a dialogue with the manager. It’s important to have that when you’re doing well. But it’s even more important when you’re not doing well.“I want people who haven’t experienced any adversity in football to learn from this. It’s all very well riding the wave but it won’t last for ever. Every professional I’ve spoken to, has had this ride where nothing can go wrong. Inevitably, it’s hard to maintain. How we react is something I’m keen on trying to help people with – giving them the tools to deal with those situations.”“It’s been tough. That’s no secret. Pure game-time is difficult because, with the greatest respect to Burnley, they’re not a cup team. Staying in the Premier League is all important. It’s just not my time right now. But I’m determined it will come again.”Did he and Guardiola also talk openly before City sent him on loan to Torino? “Yeah, I made sure we had dialogue. I certainly backed myself to the hilt when we spoke. I listened to what he had to say. There’s more to it than me not being as good with my feet as he wants from a goalkeeper. I realised he needed to make his stamp at City. He had a direction he wanted to go and he’s not exactly struggled since, has he?”Hart spent a season at Torino and says: “I enjoyed being part of that club. In terms of being in a different country, experiencing a different culture, playing a different league, I absolutely loved it. It’s definitely something I’d love to do again.” Are there clubs looking to sign him next season? “I believe there will be. But they all need to work out exactly what the hell’s going on. I like to think I’m a good catch. I’m on a free contract, I’ve got experience and real hunger. The Premier League has been great for me but I’m more than willing to spread my wings.”At the mention of Serie A, La Liga or the Bundesliga, he says: “I’m totally open. I just want to play at the highest level I can. In England, I don’t feel I am going to be able to do that. Maybe if I hadn’t achieved what I’ve done in this league I might not be so ready to step away. Don’t get me wrong. I’d love to have another big chance in England, but it could be difficult.”Ian Woan, Burnley’s assistant manager tested positive for coronavirus last week, but Hart and his teammates are well. “We’re back training and we’ve got another Covid test tomorrow. This will be the process until we can move forward.”How does Hart feel about the return of the Premier League? “It’s a really interesting time. We’re all involved in this once-in-a-lifetime thing. Right now, the most important thing is health, and helping people that are putting their lives on the line. As long as those guys are looked after, then maybe we’ve got a chance of playing football.”During the lockdown his interest in psychology has been deepened by watching The Last Dance – about Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls. “I am fascinated by human beings and elite sport. I’ve been blown away by the Jordan documentary. What a beast. What a man. What a one-off mindset. It must have been painful to be that direct and aggressive every day. He absolutely took it to a new level.”Hart has also been savouring the simple pleasures of life away from the bench while supporting Prince William’s mental health campaign. “For our mental health it’s so important to talk about the times we’re feeling good. There are two sides to mental health. Obviously the dark depths are very important. But you need to appreciate when you’re happy and savour the small little smiles, the small little shivers.“One of the greatest things for me is to help people. It can be a simple conversation. Are you OK? Are you all right? I’m looking for a future role where you invest in people and bring the best out of them. Those are the most important moments in life.”Football, Prince William and Our Mental Health airs on Thursday 28 May at 8.05pm on BBC One"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa6bcbe688bbaaab6a29c5522c5ad2639886afbf/0_0_1587_952/master/1587.jpg?width=465\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ecdf3ed3d075cbb8f8417407e317f0fa 465w","title":"premier league share riches save english football","story":"The argument for financial reform is at last beyond credible dispute as historic clubs face ruin owing to the Covid-19 crisisEven before football was plunged into crisis by the Covid-19 pandemic, influential people in the game were discussing the need for the Premier League’s improbable fortunes to be shared more equally. As historic, stalwart lower-ision and semi-professional clubs stare at ruin, and promised investment could drain from the grassroots, the argument is finally beyond credible dispute.Some sceptics raised eyebrows when the EFL chairman, Rick Parry, made his forthright arguments that football’s finances need a reset and described Premier League parachute payments as an “evil that must be eradicated”. Football people who are getting on a bit recall Parry as the energetic first Premier League chief executive, engineering its breakaway with the Football League’s First Division clubs, and the introduction, in 1992, of parachute payments for relegated clubs.But Parry’s advocacy for financial reform, much more urgent and necessary now, is not a case of amnesia from the work he did earlier in his career. When he was headhunted by the EFL last year, in what seemed a turbulent period but now seems like a lost utopia, Parry is understood to have reminded people that he has long advocated closer union, and more distribution, between the leagues.The Football League’s response caused a huge internal row at the time, since filed away with all the other huge football rows, because the board rejected the offer. Larger clubs in what is now the Championship were furious at that missed opportunity for more sharing with the Premier League and it led to reforms, including Richard Scudamore’s appointment as the Football League’s chief executive in 1997.Scudamore was highly rated as an operator and was promptly snapped up by the Premier League, where he came to personify its resounding worldwide growth in popularity and unfeasible broadcast fortunes. Scudamore was also an unforgiving fighter for its independence and supremacy, beating back the FA’s influence as the governing body, and cementing and widening the gap with the EFL.Before the crisis hit, the discussion about more sharing was not just limited to the EFL. Some Premier League clubs, for whom relegation is a possibility, were beginning to argue for change too. Surprisingly, there is said to be some support even among the top clubs for the longstanding traditions of distributing money, genuine solidarity and strength in depth.League Two clubs have decided to curtail their season, League One clubs are considering the same, and many are wondering how their futures can be sustained. These clubs say there is no point borrowing from the government’s crisis scheme, because loans will need to be repaid and they may still have paltry income next season if crowds remain prohibited. But if they know that from 2022 they will receive significant funding from joint Premier League and EFL selling of TV rights, they could borrow against that and plot a survival plan.Before the general election, the FA was given the very surprising promise from the Conservative party of £730m for grassroots investment over the next 10 years, but that must now be in doubt. However, the need to have decent sports facilities for people to maintain and rebuild their physical and psychological fitness will be more compelling than ever in the period of national recovery to come.The grim, greedy insistence that a few clubs must keep so much of football’s money has been damaging for years and now, in this terrible crisis, the game faces a compelling case to put itself back together again."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c070469400b953df02779112789ff7497dda8607/0_10_1784_1070/master/1784.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c02fda891766862656247d88540e28d8","title":"job simulation games farming trucking bus driving","story":"From farming to trucking to bus driving, why do millions play games that replicate regular jobs in forensic detail?There is no escape for me this time. The rear axle of my pick-up truck is wedged on a boulder protruding from the mud in the middle of a deserted backwater road in Michigan. I’ve tried to attach a winch to a nearby tree to pull myself out, but it’s not working. I will have to abandon the vehicle, fit up another and try again. This load of timber is not going to deliver itself.I am playing Snowrunner, the latest in a series of painstakingly authentic offroad delivery simulator games in which players have to haul goods through a variety of unforgiving landscapes at speeds that would shame a garden snail. Before each trip you have to select exactly the right vehicle for the job, fit the correct tyres and work out your likely fuel consumption to the nearest millilitre. On the frozen roads of northern Alaska, there is no room for shoddy planning.Over the last five years there has been a renaissance in serious job simulator games. Titles such as Euro Truck Simulator, Bus Simulator and Train Sim World have attracted huge fanbases and critical acclaim, each replicating its profession with unremitting attention to detail. In an entertainment sector where ludicrous power fantasies rule, where players get to be space marines, ancient warrior princesses and football superstars, it seems antithetical that 25 million people have bought Farming Simulator, a game in which your main challenge is to harvest a successful wheat crop.But it is the very precision of these games that has attracted such a devoted following. “Throughout development we gather a lot of questions,” says Julian Mautner at Stillalive studios, the team behind the Bus Simulator games. “When you turn the ignition key once, which functions of the bus actually work, and which icons on the dashboard light up? What happens afterwards when you turn it into second position? These are the details our players really care about.”According to Mautner, the studio has a partnership with its local transport company, IVB (Innsbrucker Verkehrsbetriebe), which they regularly visit to inspect real-life buses and take hundreds of pictures. “We also talk to the bus drivers about their everyday challenges, about special situations or tricky manoeuvres they had to execute,” he says. “That provides us with immensely valuable insights into the workings of a transportation company.”Meanwhile, the coders accurately simulate all aspects of engine performance – gear changing, torque, acceleration – using information from manufacturers. The audio team makes more than 1,000 recordings of sounds from all around different buses. The artists recreate interiors exactly. As Mautner explains: “Nowadays we aim to get actual 3D data for the cockpits, because replicating the details from images and blueprints often led to small inaccuracies that the community noted.”The landscapes are vitally important, too. With truck and train driving simulators much of the appeal is the scenery that whizzes past as you’re hauling goods from Berlin to Bonne, or driving a Great Western train to Cornwall. “Real-world references are essential for the world creation,” says Ondrej Dufek, a project leader at SCS Software, the creators of Euro Truck Simulator and American Truck Simulator. “Google Earth, Maps and Street View are a vital tools and sources of photo references. On YouTube, there are also videos from truckers who drive across various states and countries, commenting on their surroundings and pointing out interesting stuff. Information about elevation, economy, industries, markets, traffic density, freight routes, weather, even demographics – everything is important and helps us decide what roads and cities to put in our world.”“Sometimes we’ll take photos straight against a wall so our artists can see what kind of brick is being used,” says Matt Peddlestone, a senior producer at Dovetail Games which makes Train Sim World. “As you go down a route, the supplier of the brick changes because the bricks are being made locally and the colours of the building will change. We want to capture that.”It’s easy to think of hardcore sim fans as pernickety obsessives, but there is a quiet joy in interacting with these lovingly replicated systems of lights, switches and signals. In an unpredictable world, it is calming to open the doors of a bus at the right time, to give the correct change, to set the heating system correctly, to obey the traffic signs. It is gratifying to see a button, to press it and to know something will happen.“I play simulators because by their nature they are internally consistent,” says fan Melissa Harper. “If you’re playing a game and you’re in a cockpit, and you can’t press all the buttons, that absolutely slaughters the experience for me. But in Microsoft Flight Simulator, you can press all the buttons, and they all do something. That’s SO satisfying, and then you can learn what they all do.”Her favourite example is the ultra hardcore Stormworks: Build and Rescue, where you run your own sea rescue service. “It’s the most brutal game I’ve ever played,” she enthuses. “You have to make the whole plane yourself – and all those hundreds of buttons? You have to place them by hand! The developers just toss you into a ridiculously complicated editor and say, ‘Hey, it’s only aircraft, propulsion and electrical engineering, how hard could it be? F*** you.’ It is my favourite game.”All the simulation developers I spoke to know that some of their players are professionals in the field being simulated. The Train Sim World developers are quickly told when a siding has been placed in slightly the wrong position, or if a certain signal outside Stratford never shows a green light, only ever yellow because that’s the way it’s been wired. “Drivers send us tips,” says Dufek. “What truck stops and unique landmarks we should include, which parts of the roads are infamous for their difficulty (steep climbs, mountain passes).”Beyond all this, simulators have an emotional and nostalgic value. Train Sim World lets players drive historical trains and journeys, which has allowed retired drivers to rediscover routes they once travelled every day. Fishing: Barents Sea Simulator was inspired by the life of co-creator Goran Myrland’s grandfather, a fisherman in 1950s Norway. “He owned a classic boat just like the Follabuen, which is in our game,” says Yasemin Hamurcu, COO at Misc Games. “He spent months with his crew on the rough sea to find the best catch, to earn money and provide for his family. His wife always worried about him, hoping he would come home safely.”I have friends who drive for hours in Euro Truck Simulator, using the game’s real in-game radio app to pick up local stations. For me, Snowrunner has been almost hypnotic – it’s given me longer to take in the scenery, to get the feel of rural North America. Many players aren’t here for the authenticity of the equipment of the simulation minutiae they’re here to experience a landscape in their own way, in their own time. A slow and steady escape."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd64037aef73619d95204240a462a5c846cd3afe/0_53_960_576/master/960.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=cc804e6e5a28166c2502942b37eedaa2","title":"lockdown gives asylum seekers reprieve and hope for change in policy","story":"After Covid 19 pauses threat of detention and deportation, campaigners call for rethink on UK immigration As Britain takes its first small steps out of lockdown, there is one group of people quietly wishing that it wouldn’t.For many asylum seekers, the two-month hiatus has meant reprieve. Freed from detention centres, liberated from the threat of imminent deportation and no longer obliged to report to the Home Office, many have welcomed the relief. And all this at a time when the general population have learned something of what it is like to live with severe curbs on civil liberties.“I know it sounds bad to say, but I felt like coronavirus should not go,” says Maimuna Jawo, a Gambian asylum seeker and female genital mutilation campaigner who had to report to the Home Office once a month before March. “My fear now is that normal life will resume and I’ll have to start reporting again.”Before lockdown, Jawo was under orders to report to Eaton House immigration enforcement centre in Hounslow, west London, on the first Wednesday of every month. The preceding nights were always sleepless.“I don’t know what will happen tomorrow. Maybe they might deport me. Maybe they might put me back in detention,” she says. “You’re going to face somebody who you know can harm you. It’s like there’s a rope around your neck every time you go to sign the rope is pulled.”On 17 March, Jawo was told that reporting requirements had been lifted because of the pandemic.There has been a similar reprieve for hundreds of people held in detention pending deportation. Latest figures show that numbers have fallen from 1,225 in January to just 368 as of 29 April.Melina* fled Malawi after she was raped by a police officer who had arrested her for being bisexual, she said. She was detained at Yarl’s Wood Immigration Removal Centre in March.On 24 March her fellow inmates began to be released en masse following news reports of a case of coronavirus at the detention centre. Melina was ecstatic. “I just fell to the floor, putting my hands up, telling the officer, ‘thank you so much!’. They said: ‘do you want to stay? Quickly, go and get your things’. So I ran to my room, got my things and left as fast as I could.”The pandemic has left Britain’s “hostile environment” policy, of zero-tolerance towards illegal immigration, in limbo. Covid-19 has made it impossible to deport asylum seekers and unsafe to keep them in close confines. NHS workers have received automatic visa extensions.A Home Office spokesperson said: “All decisions to detain are made on a case-by-case basis, and in some cases, release on immigration bail may be the most appropriate option.”For some campaigners the current circumstances represent an opportunity. “What has happened in a really short space of time with Covid-19 is the undoing of decades of rhetoric that said ‘we can’t possibly do that’ – the stopping of reporting, the hundreds of people being released, the extending of visas,” says Karen Doyle, from national organisation Movement for Justice.Toufique Hossaini, director of Duncan Lewis Solicitors, agrees: “Well, now it has happened and maybe people can see that this isn’t just possible, it’s actually desirable.“The Home Office, for a long time now, has pushed back on the idea of an alternative to detention. This is a turning point: they made their own decision to release people and actually the immigration system didn’t collapse,” he says.Hossaini argues that it would not make sense to invest time and public expense in resurrecting a broken system: “It would just be a matter of not re-detaining. They’re already out here, they haven’t committed criminal offences, they haven’t disappeared.”Some believe that, as the crisis has exposed flaws in the system, this could be a good opportunity to look at the Home Office rule barring those awaiting immigration decisions from working. “Coronavirus has shown the whole system to be really irrational,” says Hossaini. “We had to fly in a whole group of Romanian nationals to pick our fruits and vegetables. And yet there are so many of our clients already in the UK eager to work, in both skilled and non-skilled jobs.”Since 2012 Maimuna has lived in a 17-bedroom house with 17 adults and nine children provided by the Home Office. No one is permitted to work. Instead, they subsist on a government allowance of £35 each per week.“I’m thinking, how many people did they put in limbo who could be working on the front line of the NHS right now?” she says. “Everybody here can work and wants to work but we’re not allowed to. We could be cleaners. We could be carers.”“There’s a lot of talent in the asylum community,” says Frederick Kkonde, who fled torture in Uganda to come to the UK in March 2013. He was granted asylum in July 2015 and is now working in a rehabilitation facility while he pursues a masters in adult nursing.He campaigns with Movement for Justice and believes it is both cruel and wasteful not to allow asylum seekers the dignity of contributing to the country they live in. “All of the asylum seekers I know have something in mind that they want to do. They’d rather make a positive impact.”His goal is to become a consultant nurse he believes that his life experiences only serve to make him better at his job: “I have what it takes to understand what an inidual goes through,” he says.Doyle explains that many people seeking asylum in the UK are victims of trafficking, torture and sexual violence. The pressures of lockdown can lead to heightened stress, and cause flashbacks.Melina has been told that she must resume reporting at Eaton House on 4 June. “I don’t feel hopeful,” she says. “I know for sure that means that they’re going to take me again.”A Home Office spokesperson said: “Face-to-face reporting requirements will return as soon as practicably possible.”* Name changed to protect identity"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eae9cb481de055928d06fbda7f154c86f5a75794/0_0_4962_2979/master/4962.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5b653b2d1939a8f07a0466dca5a38cbe","title":"29000 annual claims 50 years equal pay act","story":"The 1970 act established the principle of equal pay for equal work after a strike by women at Ford’s Dagenham plantA consistently high number of workers are alleging that their employers are illegally paying them less than colleagues in similar roles, according to research released to mark the 50th anniversary of the Equal Pay Act.The act, which established the legal principle that workers should receive equal pay for equal work, was given royal assent on 29 May 1970, following the huge publicity generated by striking sewing machinists at Ford’s Dagenham plant.The story of that struggle was revived in the 2010 film Made in Dagenham, starring Sally Hawkins, Bob Hoskins and Miranda Richardson.However, 50 years on, the number of cases brought to employment tribunals are showing no sign of decreasing, according to research by the law firm DLA Piper.Since the 2007-08 financial year, employment tribunals in England and Wales have received more than 368,000 complaints relating to equal pay, an average of almost 29,000 complaints a year.Jane Hannon, DLA’s employment partner, said: “Whilst the concept of equal pay for equal work has been around for 50 years, the consistently high number of employment tribunal claims indicates that this is an issue which some employers are still grappling with.Recent cases have included last year’s court of appeal ruling that Asda’s lower-paid store staff, who are mainly female, could compare themselves to higher-paid warehouse workers, who are mainly male, in pay claims.The Ford strike was called in 1968 by female workers who were infuriated by a pay structure that blatantly favoured male workers. Their action triggered a meeting between strike leaders and Barbara Castle, then employment secretary, who brokered a deal to end the three-week strike that included the conception of the new act.The act took effect more than five years later in December 1975 and has since been repealed and replaced by the Equality Act 2010."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc609e2c94f5260953451ba583b464ebc58e0028/0_248_5118_3070/master/5118.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6271bc0492883cd82fcd52ba11fe602d","title":"a bride a groom and a booking but no big day yet for lovers in lockdown","story":"Couples, wedding planners and venues speak of the challenges, costs and heartache involved in moving the main event Across Britain, would-be newlyweds are frantically making adjustments to wedding plans thrown into disarray by the worldwide pandemic.Some are rescheduling for later in the year, hoping that the lockdown will ease in time for their big day. Others have postponed until next year to allow the recovery to take hold.Wedding planners, in tandem with the owners of venues, are working flat out to help.Sarah Brookfield-Almond, group director of James’ Places, which runs five wedding venues in Lancashire and north Yorkshire, is concerned about a likely concertina effect as thousands of 2020 brides try to switch to next year.She also points to varying guidance from county council registrars around the country. In Lancashire, she says, registrars have warned that they don’t expect to be conducting ceremonies until September. “It’s less than helpful to have made the decision so early.”Brookfield-Almond claims that many in the industry feel let down by insurers, with only a “tiny number” paying out on cancelled wedding claims. “Wedding insurance is a very specific and specialised product, yet the government doesn’t seem to have asserted any pressure on them to honour these claims,” she says.“All the burden is being left on a hospitality and wedding venue industry that is already seriously challenged.”The couple were due to marry at Caerphilly register office, south Wales, on 2 MaySharon Lovesey, 44, who works in a call centre, and Mark Evans, 45, a baker, met online last April. Six weeks later, Evans proposed. “As soon as we met, we just clicked and fell in love,” says Lovesey.“We were so looking forward to the day, but it wasn’t to be. We’re gutted.”The couple spent their intended wedding day trying to pretend it was just a normal Saturday. “I could have cried all day, but I managed to hold it back,” says Lovesey. “We were really quiet. We went out to do our food shopping just to keep our minds off it but we kept saying things like, ‘We should have been getting ready now, we should have been having photos done now, the car would be arriving now, we should have been man and wife now’.”On what would have been their wedding night, they watched films and ordered a takeaway. “It was so upsetting not becoming Mrs Evans that day,” says Lovesey.The couple are hoping they can at least have a few witnesses for their rescheduled wedding at the end of June. They also plan to have a blessing next year on their wedding anniversary, followed by a rescheduled honeymoon in Turkey.“It’s the same resort, just a different hotel,” says Lovesey.Originally due to marry in August, the couple deferred their big day to April 2021Lisa Barnish, 28, a Ladbrokes manager, and Sarah Johnstone, 35, marketplace manager for the same company, have been together for two-and-a-half years.“We got engaged on holiday in Barcelona,” says Barnish. “It was me who asked Sarah on the beach.”They were due to get married at the Shireburn Arms, Hurst Green, on 14 August. “We fell in love with the place as soon as we walked in and looked at the amazing scenery,” says Barnish.The pandemic has forced them to postpone both their wedding and a planned honeymoon to Italy in September.“Fortunately, the Shireburn has been amazing and we’ve been able to get a new date of 23 April 2021.”Lisa would have happily kept the various gifts, signs and wedding cake toppers that carried the August date, arguing that “it would be a story to tell, a memory to keep”. But she was over-ruled. “Sarah insisted they would be out of date, so we’re buying new.”Both are “very relaxed” and trying to take the upheaval in their stride. “We’re just grateful that all our family and friends are safe and well.” Lockdown rules permitting, they hope to get away for a few nights to mark their planned wedding date. And just to get them in the party mood, they intend to drink “lots of gin”.The couple had planned to marry in Italy on 30 May.Alex Mason, 27, a sales manager, and Laura McCartney, 24, a nurse, should have been getting married in the garden of an 8th-century monastery on Italy’s Amalfi coast on Saturday.But now the whole event, along with a “mini-moon” in Sorrento and a full honeymoon in Santorini, has been put back to July 2021.Mason and McCartney, both from Wombourne, south Staffordshire, have been together for five years and got engaged in Dublin in December 2017. Laura recalled: “Alex had planned it and stood up to propose in front of a restaurant full of people.”The couple chose Italy for their wedding but then came the pandemic. So far they’ve received a refund from Airbnb but are still pursuing British Airways over the cost of their flights. At the moment the airline is insisting on giving vouchers rather than a cash refund so they can buy fresh tickets – still with BA.McCartney finds it “horrible” to catch glimpses of her wedding paraphernalia bearing next Saturday’s date, but is relieved that everyone on the couple’s 35-strong guest list is still able to come to the wedding next year.“It’s still our dream location, so we’re more than happy to wait to have the day as we intended,” says McCartney. “We are so very lucky to have our family fit and well, and for us to have our health during these scary times.”The couple intend to spend their now-abandoned wedding date “getting some nice food in, cracking open a bottle of wine, watching some movies and having a romantic day together”.McCartney adds: “We know it’s important to remember there are people out there losing loved ones. We’re very lucky to have one another and to be able to get married next year.“It was a blow at first, but we were the ones to actually make the decision to postpone. We didn’t feel it right to get married with everything that was happening. We could have hung on longer, but it was clear from the start that weddings in May – especially the ones abroad – would not be going ahead this year.“My hen do had already been cancelled and it was making us both very stressed and upset. Once the wedding was postponed it felt like a weight had been lifted off our shoulders.“We now are both focusing on just getting through this lockdown, looking forward to seeing loved ones again and hoping everyone stays safe. We will have our special day and it will be perfect even if we have to wait another 14 months.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d999d78c367891690c375cd67573f8726a9916e/33_122_2455_1474/master/2455.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=6d584f0cc9b85851ae568c6b0dd9e69f","title":"best way composting council food waste","story":"My local council has stopped collecting food waste and I’m not sure what I need to compost itEvery week a  Money reader submits a question, and it’s up to you to help him or her out – a selection of the best answers will appear in next Saturday’s paper.My local council has stopped collecting food waste and I think I need to start composting.

Kraftwerk’s pioneering approach, using synthesisers and sequenced drum arrangements to evoke robotic or industrial rhythms, became the blueprint for Detroit musicians such as Juan Atkins, who coined the term “techno”. Forty years later, an array of electronic genres have been created from that blueprint: Schneider and Kraftwerk created a feedback loop between Germany and Detroit that has existed for more than half a century.When Schneider and Ralf Hütter started Kraftwerk in 1970, their influences included several Detroit-based acts including the Stooges, MC5 and, according to later member Karl Bartos, Berry Gordy’s Motown label. Gordy initially worked for the Ford motor plant, and gave Motown an industrialised music production-line inspired by Detroit’s automotive industry. This was the ice-breaker in the conversation between his city and Germany – Kraftwerk’s automated drums, vocoder refrains and future-facing outlook also stemmed from the conveyor belts, piston-driven machinery and monotonous rhythm of factory life. This inescapable repetition of sound and movement – programmed, precise – was present in Detroit and Dusseldorf, both industrial centres.Released in 1974, Autobahn provided Kraftwerk’s international breakthrough, setting the wheels in motion for their first tour of the US in 1975. It was a moderate success, but if it hadn’t been for radio and club play – and the record shops that supplied those DJs – then Kraftwerk would not have had the impact they did. Downtown Records in New York was one of many spots where Afrika Bambaataa would pick up the records he played in his legendary freeform sets at block parties in the Bronx. Known for its eclectic stock, Downtown (and other similarly idiosyncratic outlets) helped deliver Kraftwerk’s avant-garde sounds to America’s black communities. On the radio in NYC, Frankie Crocker was spinning Kraftwerk records on his WBLS show.In Detroit, Charles Johnson, more commonly known as the Electrifying Mojo, commanded the airwaves via WGPR-FM. His unconstrained programming attracted a huge following, introducing his audience to obscure European imports and US acts including Prince. Kraftwerk were among the European artists receiving regular play on his show, where Numbers was a staple. In Motor City, the decline of the car industry led to a city-wide economic crash. Science fiction and technology provided optimism, a means to escape, a channel to a brighter future. The situation was similar in postwar Germany: by turning their gaze to the future, Kraftwerk offered hope and new beginnings. Their sound of the future, driven by American rhythms, resonated with the nonconformist presenter, and his support for the group was undoubtedly a catalyst contributing to the birth of techno.Lauded by Mojo’s listeners and Bambaataa’s crowd, Kraftwerk’s music made its way into the clubs, even featuring on Detroit’s legendary Soul Train-inspired dance show the Scene, later replaced by the New Dance Show. In New York, their songs were also regular features on the dancefloor, which the group witnessed first hand when François Kevorkian took Schneider and Hütter out to experience NYC’s underground clubs in 1981. It was inevitable that their experiences in black and Latino clubs would lead to the creation of music that fed straight back into those very communities.Juan Atkins was an avid listener to Mojo’s show. As with Bambaataa’s iconic Planet Rock, produced with Arthur Baker (another Kraftwerk fan), Atkins’ early work draws heavily on Kraftwerk’s tropes and themes. Upon hearing their sequenced drum programming, he immediately adopted the technique to mimic the group’s tight, robotic rhythms. As Model 500, Atkins used warped vocals and intergalactic computerised effects to envision the future from a Motor City perspective. (Kraftwerk’s influence also made its way to Chicago.)New wave, early synth pop, the new romantics, London’s Blitz kids, OMD, David Bowie, Gary Numan, Visage, Depeche Mode, Soft Cell and many other groups from the post-industrial early 80s ushered in the first generation of popular music that was entirely created with electronic instruments. Initially niche, it soon went mainstream and travelled across the continent, resulting in a new wave of homegrown German electronic acts such as Boytronic, Rheingold, DAF and Stratis. In 1988, Virgin released Techno! The New Dance Sound of Detroit, compiled by Neil Rushton. It introduced Europe to the first wave of Detroit techno artists, Blake Baxter, Derrick May and Eddie Fowlkes among them. This first wave of electronic music, inspired largely by Kraftwerk and their electropop offspring, was the US’s reply to the German group.As the 90s approached, radio DJs such as Monika Dietl were educating Berliners on both sides of the Berlin wall Mark Ernestus, founder of record shop Hard Wax, was intrinsic to bringing the Detroit sound to the German capital. The fall of the wall in 1989 was pivotal: empty warehouses, factories and derelict buildings provided the perfect opportunity for the city’s large community of outliers to enjoy their newfound freedom to the fullest. Clubs such as Planet, UFO, E-Werk and Tresor became hubs for the new sound. A faction of Detroit’s second generation of techno artists had pushed the genre into a more minimal, uncompromising incarnation, which resonated with Berlin’s punks and misfits. The mood evolved to become more militaristic, the BPMs went up, the vocals disappeared, the rhythms remained monotonous and hypnotic. It transformed into a hardcore hybrid of Underground Resistance-style techno, EBM and gabba, which flourished among Berlin’s anarchistic creative communities.Around this time, Ernestus traveled to Detroit with Thomas Fehlmann and Moritz von Oswald, with whom he later formed pioneering dub techno act Basic Channel. Their mission was to meet their Detroit heroes and gather up analogue equipment that had been offloaded at many of the city’s pawn shops. They met Mike Banks and Juan Atkins, turning up unannounced at an apartment they shared. This connection would lead to a 25-year-long collaborative relationship and friendship. Meanwhile, Tresor founder Dimitri Hegemann booked Atkins to play along with Mike Banks and Underground Resistance. Soon after the club’s launch, Tresor’s label wing appeared: their first signing was Underground Resistance as X-101. Tresor also signed two of Drexciya’s albums, Harnessed the Storm and Neptune’s Lair, and music from Atkins, Robert Hood, Jeff Mills and Blake Baxter. Dimitri inspired the conception of Atkins’ Borderland project with Von Oswald.Once again, rhythm and musical language stimulated the flow of communication between the two cities. Underground Resistance’s anger, political commentary and paramilitary aesthetic, expressed through their uncompromising music, spoke to reunified Berlin and its hardcore punks and hippies. Clubs with virtually no rules and powerful sound systems provided an emotional outlet for the once-ided city, prompting the birth of the first generation of Berlin techno pioneers. Once that connection was made, only the UK could compete in terms of its burgeoning dance music culture and allure for international artists, though it didn’t last – 1994’s Criminal Justice Bill strangling the emergent rave scene.As techno’s popularity grew in Germany – Berlin’s infamous Love Parade started in 1989 and blossomed into a million-strong party by 1997, and alternative techno centres emerged in Cologne and Frankfurt – it became fringe in the US. The music moved back underground, as corporate-owned radio and TV stations shifted to commercial dance releases. It reached the point where artists from the States were playing more in Europe than they were in their own country, with a far greater number of techno clubs and festivals providing more demand and more opportunity. But the musical conversation and mutual respect between the two territories has never ceased. In the 2000s, a wave of Detroit selectors including Magda, Seth Troxler, Matthew Dear and Derek Plaslaiko migrated to Berlin. Artists such as Carl Craig and Jeff Mills became closely affiliated with their European counterparts, with both men exploring classical music with orchestras on the continent, as well as launching collaborative projects, including Craig’s long-running relationship with Moritz von Oswald and Francesco Tristano.While national demand dipped, Detroit’s influence on the rest of the world remained consistent. At the turn of the millennium, the very first Detroit electronic music festival arrived, cycling through a few incarnations before settling as Movement in 2006. In 2016, Kraftwerk headlined, bringing their 3-D show to Hart Plaza for a kind of homecoming. Rumours about a Kraftwerk show in Detroit had been circulating for years, going back to that first festival in 2000. The group acknowledged their bond with Motor City during the track Planet of Visions, the statement “Detroit electro, Germany electro” repeating over and over.Hütter described the link between Detroit and Germany as a spiritual connection. He was impressed “that this music from two industrial centres of the world, with different cultures and different history, suddenly there’s an inspiration and a flow going back and forth”. Kindred spirits from different backgrounds bringing people together and trying to envision a brighter future.

In retrospect, many will ask whether he was just trying to beat the traffic.Over the last 72 hours, Downing Street officials, unnamed sources and ministers have attempted to cast doubt on parts of the timeline of Cummings’s travels.But an examination of the public record, placed alongside the  and Daily Mirror’s reporting, means that it is possible to lay out the significant claims and counter-claims of the period in question – and where questions still remain.On the day Cummings ran out of No 10, his wife, Mary Wakefield, appears to have been already ill, according to her Spectator article about the experience, in which she says: “My husband did rush home to look after me.” The article did not mention that soon after he rushed home, the family went to the other end of the country.The government has briefed that Cummings travelled north before developing symptoms of the virus, which is said to have struck him over the weekend of 28-29 March.Wakefield wrote that Cummings said “I feel weird” and collapsed 24 hours after he came home to look after her, placing their journey north on Friday – perhaps trying to beat the weekend getaway – or Saturday at the latest.The details of the journey from London remain unclear.Did he drive or take the train? On Sunday, the cabinet minister Grant Shapps didn’t know. He was asked whether Cummings had stopped for a break at any point on the four-hour journey accompanied by a small child and a sick wife.Despite being given notice of the question by Sky’s Sophy Ridge the evening before, and having been in contact with Cummings, Shapps was caught flat-footed. “I’m afraid I don’t have detail to the point of what time of day, and how many stops,” he said, adding that he was “expert” in transport matters and would prefer to talk about the A66.In its defence of Cummings, No 10 said the couple had had to travel north in search of childcare from Cummings’s sister and nieces at the property owned by his parents.The former Downing Street director of communications Alastair Campbell, among others, described this as guff. He said it was unbelievable that Cummings had to travel 264 miles to get help with childcare.But, in the end, Cummings and his wife did not need childcare, No 10 have said, instead relying on the family to deliver food to their door.The police have said that on 31 March they were “made aware of reports” of Cummings’s presence in the area.On Friday, Durham Constabulary told the  and Daily Mirror that they had then contacted the family to “reiterate the appropriate advice around essential travel”.The statement confirmed – for the first time – that Cummings had left London for the north-east.But on Saturday, Downing Street insisted the police were wrong. No 10 said that “at no stage was Cummings or his family spoken to by the police about this matter”.This version is now under intense scrutiny. Under pressure to explain the differing accounts, police issued a new statement on Saturday and stood by by the original claim.Not just that, it seems the police might have been alerted to Cummings’s presence in Durham by – his father. And that it was during this conversation that police had “reiterated the appropriate advice around essential travel”. By Sunday morning, Shapps was disputing a subtly different point. He told the BBC’s Andrew Marr: “For one thing the father contacted the police, not the other way round” and claiming that security was the “key thing” in the conversation.The following days, by Wakefield’s account, were a mixture of family idyll and health nightmare, as she made a “palace out of polystyrene packaging” with their son even as Cummings’s breathing got so bad that she feared he should be in hospital.But 10 days after her husband first fell ill, she said, he began to feel better – just as Boris Johnson went into hospital. That would place the improvement in his condition around Sunday 5 April, although 10 days after the 28th – the earliest point at which Cummings was said to have been symptomatic – was 7 April.That Sunday, a passerby told the , they spotted Cummings by sheer chance. The encounter was fleeting but memorable: Cummings was standing outside with his little boy, in “dark coat and thick tartan scarf”, and Abba was playing at full blast.On the same day, the  asked Downing Street about the claims. “It’ll be a ‘no comment’ on that one,” an official responded. On the Friday of the same week, after establishing further details, the  asked again. Again, the response was no comment.Wakefield did not mention that on 12 April – her birthday, according to Companies House records – they allegedly made a trip to Barnard Castle, a charming town 30 miles from the Cummings’s family property, described on the English Heritage website as having “fantastic views” and “plenty to do for families on a day out”.That detail emerged in an interview with Robin Lees, a retired chemistry teacher who lives in the town.Lees, who says he has a photographic memory, told the  he was “a bit gobsmacked” to see Cummings, and then was so incensed that he made a note of the family car’s numberplate and checked it online when he got home.While government officials spent weeks refusing to talk about Cummings’s whereabouts, and have since Saturday sought to dismiss the joint investigation as “fake news” and “a stream of false allegations … from campaigning newspapers”, they have not disputed Lees’s account.His account is awkward for No 10.On Saturday, Shapps – like other Conservatives who defended the prime minister’s most senior aide – repeatedly emphasised that after the Cummings family had made their journey across the country, they had “stayed put”.Not according to Lees, they hadn’t. On Sunday, Shapps appeared to change tack.He seemed to say that this trip would have come at the end of the quarantine period.No mention, however, of the fact this trip would seem to be a clear breach of the strict lockdown rules in place at the time.Would a journey to a popular day-trip destination on a loved one’s birthday, 30 miles from the lockdown location, constitute essential travel or compliance with the government’s “stay home” instruction?That Easter weekend, a new government campaign reminded people that even at a time when people might wish to spend time together, the rules still applied. “The new campaign reinforces the importance of staying at home over Easter,” it said, reiterating the importance of “only leaving your house to buy essentials, to do one form of exercise a day, to travel into work, but only where you cannot work from home, and for any medical or social care need”.The 14-day period of Cummings’s isolation would have expired on 10 April, assuming it is counted from when Wakefield appears to have first fallen ill on 27 March. . In a piece for the Spectator, the magazine she works for, Wakefield wrote: “We emerged from quarantine into the almost comical uncertainty of London lockdown.” No clarification, however, that they had actually emerged into the capital from Durham. asked Wakefield to confirm whether the family had been in London throughout the lockdown period, but received no reply. Cummings was photographed back in Downing Street on 14 April, clutching a bag containing a carton of soup, a tangerine and a carrot.Could Cummings have then gone back to the north-east from London? Downing Street is emphatic that he did not.The denial came after another witness claimed to the  and Sunday Mirror that they had seen Cummings and Wakefield on a country walk in Houghall Woods, a beauty spot near his parents’ property in Durham.According to this account, Cummings said: “Aren’t the bluebells lovely?”While Downing Street would give no on-the-record comment before publication of the new stories on Saturday, it then issued a statement.It accused the  and the Mirror of writing “inaccurate stories … including claims that Mr Cummings returned to Durham after returning to work in Downing Street on 14 April. We will not waste our time answering a stream of false allegations about Mr Cummings from campaigning newspapers.”In interviews on Sunday, Shapps said he understood the sighting in the woods was false. But there has still been no direct on-the-record denial from Cummings himself.The witness who says they saw him on that day, in that place, is sticking by their story, but had nothing more to add."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0fcc64c69ebc4dac195177667ee694835441c02c/0_50_3664_2199/master/3664.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=37e1e208ad43554b0bfc7dfbc652777b","title":"what planet are they on the papers on the pms defence of dominic cummings","story":"Almost all the front pages focus on Boris Johnson’s response to criticism of his senior aide’s lockdown breachesBoris Johnson’s defence of Dominic Cummings has dominated the front pages of the UK’s media landscape, with newspapers taking varied lines on the prime minister’s decision to excuse his senior aide’s lockdown breaches.The Daily Mail – whose coverage usually backs the prime minister and his government – has taken a particularly strong line against Johnson, simply asking: “What planet are they on?” The  has stuck closer to its usual pro-Conservative position, quoting Johnson’s defence of his senior aide., which revealed Cummings’s lockdown breaches along with the Daily Mirror, leads with “No apology, no explanation”, highlighting the prime minister’s refusal to back down despite public outcry over the aide’s flouting of lockdown rules.The Mirror doesn’t hold back, labelling Cummings “a cheat” while Boris Johnson is marked as “a coward”.No holds barred from the Mail either. In a marked departure from its usual line, the paper – usually considered a staunch Tory ally – asks incredulously: “What planet are they on?”, suggesting that the government is out of touch.In a trail of its leader comment piece, the paper actually calls on Johnson to sack his aide. “Dominic Cummings has violated the spirit and letter of the lockdown,” it says. “For the good of the government and the nation, Mr Cummings must resign.

People think it’s like flicking a light switch back on again but it absolutely isn’t.“It’s fiendishly complicated and will take a lot longer than people think because there are a number of different problems that have to be sorted first. We need to ensure that hospitals are safe for people without coronavirus who need to be treated, including those who need elective surgery.”Some 4.2 million people in England are waiting to have a non-urgent procedure such as a cataract removal, hernia repair or hip or knee replacement.Hopson’s remarks are a blow to Hancock and Sir Simon Stevens, NHS England’s chief executive. They have told hospitals to resume as soon as possible the normal activities – operations and diagnostic tests – that have been largely suspended since March because of the pandemic.Hospitals cannot do that until doctors and nurses can have regular tests for coronavirus and get the results back very quickly, to prevent asymptomatic staff – or patients arriving for an operation – inadvertently bringing the virus in with them, added Hopson.In pointed criticism of ministers, he said: “The gap between the tone and content of the government’s statements on testing and the difficult reality on the ground is painfully wide and needs to be closed quickly. The reality is five- and even 13-day test turnaround times, which are effectively useless to the hospital.”Hancock pledged on 10 April that “we have capacity for all key social care staff and NHS staff who need to be tested to get those tests”. But many health workers say it is still too difficult to get a test and that results can take many days to come back.Shortages of full-length surgical gowns could mean that patients have their surgery cancelled at the last minute, Hopson added.Although patients due to have surgery have been told to isolate for 14 days beforehand, trusts typically only have four or five days of supply in hand, so cannot guarantee that they will have enough PPE to undertake the surgery, added Hopson.“It’s particularly unfair to ask a patient whose operation has already been delayed to start the difficult process of isolation without being certain that they can actually perform the surgery when the due date arrives.”NHS England bosses are understood to be sympathetic to Hopson’s concerns and share what he called hospital bosses’ “deep frustration” at ministers’ failure to solve either problem.Public Health England research published on Tuesday found that up to a fifth of hospital inpatients with Coronavirus and nine out of 10 healthcare staff may have become infected in hospital.Doctors’ leaders said Hopson was right to warn that safety had to have been assured before operations could restart.“While the PPE situation is improving, we need a guarantee that there is adequate equipment to protect all staff before we recommence services. This includes equipment for those delivering non-Covid care in order to reduce the risk of transmission through health settings. Staff must have confidence that they will be properly protected from infection now and into the future,” said Dr Rob Harwood, chair of the British Medical Association’s consultants committee.That, and routine testing of patients due to have routine surgery “are central to protecting both staff and patients, and are essential if we are to avoid a second spike in the virus”.Dr Claudia Paoloni, the president of the Hospital Consultants and Specialists Association, said: “We are all keen to see hospitals to restart a wider range of NHS services, but not until this can be achieved safely and sustainably.“It would be premature and inadvisable to attempt a return to ‘business as usual’ before the testing regime is operating effectively and accurately in all parts of the country and significantly increased supplies of PPE can be guaranteed to protect staff and patients.“We cannot risk a further spike of infections among hospital patients, who are much more vulnerable to the illness because of other health conditions.” approached the department of health and social care for their response."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d061cbecb908f46db0efd3e5f2c0f2efa6881b43/184_255_6536_3922/master/6536.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6d224bd4e1fe159275bb7071351d07fc","title":"knocking down barriers through boxing photo essay","story":"A gym in Bristol has become a vital mental health service for young people with a combination of boxing, psychological support and personal development. Before the lockdown,  Alexander Turner spoke to and photographed the coaches and mentors behind the project – and the young people whose lives have been transformedFounded by Martin Bisp and Jamie Sanigar in 2006, Empire Fighting Chance (EFC) has transformed the Empire Boxing gym – a respected Bristol institution since the 1960s – into a vital mental health service operating in the centre of the city. With world heavyweight champion Tyson Fury frequently advocating the value of boxing and fitness towards his own mental health, the connection with boxing and emotional health has never been stronger.EFC predominantly works with people aged eight to 25 who experience significant challenges in their lives, including those excluded from school and involved in antisocial behaviour – almost always as a result of mental health issues. With a unique programme of support, EFC provides an invaluable resource to more than 4,000 people each year in one of the UK’s most deprived areas. It offers young people who would probably not access traditional forms of therapy a variety of bespoke services designed to support complicated home lives, blighted by poverty, deprivation and inadequate housing.“We are a charity that uses boxing, non-contact boxing and boxing training as a hook, to leverage the street credibility of the sport to knock down some of the barriers to entry for some of society’s most difficult to reach young people,” says EFC. Alongside that, it offers intensive personal development, psychological support, therapy, and advice on careers and education.“Young people arrive at our doors with a range of behavioural and emotional issues, including anger, anxiety, depression and low self-esteem,” says Bisp. “Their distress is often expressed in ways that can lead them into trouble rather than care and support.” Young people are referred to EFC by schools, charities, pupil referral units and even the police.Bisp says: “I’ve not yet met a 10-, 12-, or 13-year-old whose real life ambition is to be selling drugs or who wants to get involved in some of the situations they have been involved in. We have not yet met young people who have any desire to be mentally unwell. What happens is that their behaviour can manifest itself in certain ways. What we’ve found is that if you look at the symptom of anger or criminal behaviour, there are always underlying core problems. It may be chaotic home lives, it may be substance abuse by the parents, it could be domestic abuse, it could be sexual abuse. There is a whole series of factors that can lead into a behaviour that becomes symptomatic, which then gets a young person labelled.” Through its unique package of non-contact boxing and intensive personal support, EFC seeks to challenge and inspire vulnerable young people to “realise their unique potential” and participate in sport, gaining support in ways that feel natural.Marvin Rees, the first directly elected black mayor of a UK city, trained at the gym as a young man. “I was a very lost teenager, a mixed-race kid in the middle of a racially fractured Bristol in the 1980s,” he says. “Poor family, living in the inner city about 200 metres from this club. I had a reasonable brain but I was immobilised by a fear of failure and low self-esteem. Through boxing, I got a real sense of confidence. And I was also around coaches who cared.”Many of the young people EFC works with may have fallen through the gaps in mental health services or be waiting to receive support. “The young people we are dealing with come from chaotic home lives, maybe lack of parental support, lack of parents in total, they have mental health issues,” says Sanigar. “They want to access mental health services but the waiting list with CAMHS (child and adolescent mental health services) can be six months. The hoops that a young person has to go through – visiting the GP, getting a referral to CAMHS, making that appointment, filling out the forms … That is challenging enough if you’ve got two parents in a middle-class family. But when you’ve probably not got the support, the barriers to entry for that service are too challenging and too long-winded, too time-consuming and too late in the day. Within that period of time, anything could have happened.”Visiting the gym in 2019, Prince Harry said: “The thought of sitting down in a chair, one to one, with a therapist, can be a real deterrent. However, this is the sort of place where you don’t even realise you are being cured, but you are.”“A lot of these kids have gone through so much, it might be physical or sexual abuse, it could be anything – and they are angry,” Bisp says. “Rather than try and tell people they shouldn’t feel angry, actually what we start talking about is that anger is perfectly normal. Anger is a manifestation of issues, and they are issues they have a right to be angry about. So, what we’re teaching them is how to react and how to deal with those situations in a way that’s constructive.”The former IBF featherweight world champion Lee Selby is a mentor at the club. “I try and get into them that I’ve worked my way up,” he says. “It’s not just sports that that works in, it’s general life. If you work hard you can achieve your goals and your dreams.” The influence of somebody such as Selby on marginalised young people – many of whom will have grown up watching and hearing of his achievements – can be dramatic. “They know I am from the same sort of background and they can relate to me,” he says. “At school they are being told what to do by some posh guy and they are not really interested.”For many of the young people, a supportive, nurturing relationship with an adult can be a new experience. Sarah, foster mother of April, 16, describes how April’s relationship with her coach Courtney “has grown to the point where Courtney is a trusted adult. That has been a rare thing for her in her life, in her experience. It’s really important.”This type of relationship at EFC is built and maintained over a 20-week programme that combines non-contact boxing with mentoring and psychological education. The coaches believe that boxing, being largely inidual and broken into three-minute rounds, allows a unique opportunity for therapy and mentoring.“The way that boxing is broken down into rounds means you’ve got opportunities to build relationships and to talk while they are doing the activity,” says Sanigar. “They can be skipping and you can be having a conversation. They can stop for a minute, you can have a conversation, you can’t do that in football. You have your own inidual goal set by a coach, and your goal might be to get five skips. We build small mini-goals for young people to achieve.”Ellie, 15, was referred to EFC by her therapist. “I had a really bad home growing up,” she says. “I never had space where I could just go to relax. It was always tension, tension, tension. I struggle with really bad anger issues. They have calmed down a lot, so much, since being here. Even after the first session you could see the difference. I’d keep everything in and wouldn’t let anything out. They really taught me how to open up about how I’m feeling. It’s definitely made a difference in every aspect of my life.”Nina, who has PTSD, depression and social anxiety says Empire has made her “less anxious about being in groups, and being with new people”. She adds: “I just feel comfortable being able to come back even if I don’t have to do the sessions. I can speak to someone, it doesn’t necessarily even have to be about what’s going on, it can just be about anything which helps and it’s a nice distraction from everything else.”Dontae, 17, was referred to the gym after being excluded from school a number of times. He is now at college studying health and fitness and says: “I started coming in more and more regularly. I started loving it and my confidence grew more and more knowing how I feel, and telling them how I feel, and them listening to how I feel. It’s helped me to calm down. They are basically like mentors to me. My mental health has got better. My mental health was just about anger, anger, anger. Now it isn’t. I feel better, I feel more normal. I feel more awareness, mentally stronger, knowing what decisions can benefit me.”One issue that EFC regularly identifies in young people is low self-esteem and sense of self-worth. “The level of extremity has drastically changed over recent years”, says Sanigar. “This is inner city, an area of deprivation that is going through a bit of a funny change at the moment. A three-bed house will cost you over £300,000. If you are growing up in this area with nothing – no role models, no mentors – it’s practically impossible now for you to get on the property ladder. Youth services have been closed. There is nothing for them and they are becoming more isolated, sitting in their bedrooms. They are living a fantasy life on their phones, where it’s Instagram, Snapchat – all these wonderful lives out there. They are suddenly looking at their lives and it is destroying their self-esteem.”One of the employment schemes EFC runs is with local coffee roasters Extract Coffee, who offer a barista training programme. Steven, 20, found employment after completing the course: “I wouldn’t have got the job at Boston Tea Party without Empire giving me that push. When I started coming to Empire I wasn’t in a great place, but now everything has changed. After doing boxing sessions day by day, my mood generally got a lot better. I feel happier, I don’t have those days when I don’t feel like doing anything because I don’t have the self-esteem or the energy. I’m actively looking to do stuff. Compared to where I first started that’s quite a big leap.”EFC has also trained qualified therapists in non-contact boxing skills in order to provide support to young people with some of the most severe mental health issues.“The demographic we have here is very varied,” says therapist Jane Ivall. “Often they will be some of the hardest-to-reach young people. The fact they are engaging and connecting here is a good starting point for them engaging and connecting with us. Here, there is a whole range of people with a whole range of issues, and we just come alongside them using the medium of boxing to enable them to access mental health support. The boxing breaks down the barriers to traditional therapy. It enables people to open up and access things they traditionally may not feel comfortable to access. Talking about a trauma is complex. Working physically enables you to shift trauma, to explore things and to build a rapport and trust with a therapist quicker.”According to Rees, “the benefits to the wider city are pretty straightforward: a healthier population. Young people who are less likely to become mentally unwell, who have more structure in their lives and who are better able to develop their own talents, abilities and ambitions in life. They are also less likely to become service users, or engage in activities that take away the quality of life from other people.”“We’re not careers specialists, we’re not education specialists, we’re not mental health specialists,” says Bisp. “We’ve had to just do our best and what we think is right, and thankfully the results over the last 10 years have proven that what we do does work”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/542ad62400464ecc18bdfc523775c729da8ed80c/0_440_4699_2821/master/4699.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3689300e0ab4b37a162c56683d983797","title":"getting girls active key future womens sport","story":"Athletes and administrators warn that gains at the top will be lost if attention is not paid to the grassrootsGetting more girls and young women active must be a central part of the jigsaw if women’s sport is to continue to grow and thrive, according to players, coaches and administrators.But the England basketball player Siobhan Prior, a former primary school teacher, said the need to hit academic targets meant that activity was too often pushed to the margins. “There are so many pressures on teachers that if there is a small window for PE, or PHSE for personal growth, it often gets reduced because the focus is on tests,” she said. “It’s one reason why I left teaching.“But sport isn’t just running around and getting sweaty, or getting skinny and losing calories: it breaks down barriers, helps in life skills, and motivates people to do other things.”Prior, a director of a basketball academy in Nottingham, stressed that investment in facilities is another vital element in helping to keep teenagers in sport. “A dedicated hub for our club has completely changed the landscape for retaining kids because it also provides a support system for them.”The Commonwealth boxing champion Stacey Copeland, who works in a Manchester secondary school, called for PE to be a core subject on the curriculum and for girls to have the same sports options as boys. “Many girls also don’t want to do PE in a little pleated skirt and T-shirt,” she said, “so let’s just remove the barriers, help them feel comfortable and put the emphasis on the social aspect of activity.”Beth Barrett-Wild, who is in charge of the Women’s Hundred, said the England and Wales Cricket Board had recently launched a women and girls action plan to “demonstrate how you can go from being a five-year-old girl picking up a bat and ball for the first time all the way to becoming the next Heather Knight”.Barrett-Wild said: “I don’t think there’s any point in investing all of your money at the top end without having that really strong investment at the bottom. You’ve got to get girls active and playing the game at all levels.”Dame Tanni Grey-Thompson urged politicians to back up their promises to get the nation more active. “I hope it doesn’t slip away.

Three summers ago, as August tipped into September, my friend Ben and I pulled up in a campervan and passed a freezing night on its banks. We were woken at dawn by a clattering of jackdaws taking to the air from the ruined castle that sits on a small island close to the shore.Mist rose from the surface of the loch, the temperature barely above freezing as I struggled into my swimming shorts. The promise of a swim before the crowds arrived outweighed any concerns about the cold. I swam with my head out, my hair dry, watching the castle loom high above me, rolling on my back to get a better view of the high peaks of the Cairngorms on the far shore.Ben swam around me, grasping a camera in waterproof housing, occasionally ing beneath me and emerging, gasping for air, his long hair slick across his face. He was making a film about our trip across Scotland, based on my previous journeys exploring the UK’s best wild swims, retracing, in part, Roger Deakin’s nature classic, Waterlog.As lockdown progresses, I have fantasised about this swim and its warm afterglow. The lukewarm coffee drunk on the banks after we had hastily dried and dressed. The slow walk through the pines of the surrounding Rothiemurchus Forest, the flowering heather glinting with cobwebs in the rising sun. The red squirrel that engaged me in a staring contest as Ben went back to the van to pack up.Ben lives in Vancouver now. His pictures of camping trips in British Columbia have sustained me as my world has shrunk to the confines of my basement flat. But as summer arrives, I hope he will return. I see us on the small beach at the north end of the loch, readying ourselves to get into the cool water, clothes and towels in an unsightly heap. Ben picks out birds that I cannot identify – a redstart on a nearby branch. There is the distant drilling of a woodpecker as we wade in, the late summer sun rising to greet us.We have lived through something immense, unfathomable since we first came here. The cold, fresh water holds no fear, only the promise of deep relaxation and new beginnings.Joe Minihane is author of Floating: A Return to Waterlog (Duckworth) and available in paperback at  Bookshop"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38a8e6edf205055a5354e8b079f27fed916fd5a7/0_124_5320_3194/master/5320.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=d8daaba1279393e8e96a58f9cec442d7","title":"us judge rules florida felons can vote without paying legal fees","story":"Judge Robert Hinkle says current law is unconstitutional but his ruling is likely to face Republican challenge in key battleground stateA law in Florida requiring felons to pay legal fees as part of their sentences before regaining the vote is unconstitutional for those unable to pay, or unable to find out how much they owe, a federal judge has ruled.The 125-page ruling, issued by US district court Judge Robert Hinkle in Tallahassee on Sunday, involves a state law to implement a 2016 ballot measure approved by voters to automatically restore the right to vote for many felons who have completed their sentence.The Republican-led legislature stipulated that fines and legal fees must be paid as part of the sentence, in addition to serving any prison time.Hinkle has acknowledged he is unlikely to have the last word in the case, expecting the administration of Republican governor Ron DeSantis to launch an appeal.The case could have deep ramifications in the crucial electoral battleground given that Florida has an estimated 774,000 disenfranchised felons who are barred because of financial obligations. Many of those felons are African Americans and statistically more likely to vote for the Democratic party. Florida was also the scene of the infamous “hanging chad” controversy in the 2000 US election.The judge called the Florida rules a “pay-to-vote system” that were unconstitutional when applied to felons who were otherwise eligible to vote but genuinely unable to pay the required amount.A further complication was how to set the exact amount in fines and other kinds of legal fees owed by felons seeking the vote. Hinkle said it was unconstitutional to bar any voter whose amount owed “could not be determined with diligence”.Hinkle ordered the state to require election officials to allow felons to request an advisory opinion on how much they owe, essentially placing the burden on election officials to seek that information from court systems. If there was no response within three weeks, then the applicant should not be barred from registering to vote, the ruling said.Hinkle said the requirement to pay fines and restitution as ordered in a sentence is constitutional for those who are able to pay if the amount can be determined.The case, Kelvin Jones vs Ron DeSantis, consolidates five lawsuits filed by advocates of disenfranchised felons, including the American Civil Liberties Union, the Brennan Center and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.“This is a tremendous victory for voting rights,” Julie Ebenstein, senior staff attorney with ACLUs voting rights project, said in a statement. “The court recognized that conditioning a persons right to vote on their ability to pay is unconstitutional. This ruling means hundreds of thousands of Floridians will be able to rejoin the electorate and participate in upcoming elections.”The 2018 ballot measure, known as amendment four, does not apply to convicted murderers and rapists."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29a962165ef5955d285bfbf5fdbf940c1a419763/0_113_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f7c93636ee2798e144dac5fc5d5b563","title":"do you believe you were infected by coronavirus at a big event in march","story":"We’d like to hear from those who attended events between the end of February and early March such as Wolves v Eyol and Cheltenham FestivalWe’d like you to help us document the spread of coronavirus due to some of the mega-events that went ahead between the end of February and the first couple of weeks in March.

Legislation passed last year by Donald Trump requires the US to sanction officials as undermining Hong Kong’s autonomy. It also requires the US to revoke favourable trade status granted to Hong Kong.O’Brien said the city’s attractiveness as a business and finance hub would also suffer. “It’s hard to see how Hong Kong could remain the Asian financial centre that it’s become if China takes over,” he said, adding that global corporations would have no reason to stay.On Sunday, the Hong Kong government said that criticism from “foreign politicians” of the decision “smacks of double standards and hypocrisy”. In a statement released late Sunday as police continued to detain demonstrators protesting against the measure, the government said: “The vast majority of law-abiding Hong Kong residents, including overseas investors, have nothing to fear.”In response to questions about investor confidence in the Asian financial hub, Chinese foreign minister Wang said: “Instead of becoming more worried, people should have more confidence in the future of Hong Kong.”Wang said the laws “will improve Hong Kong’s legal system, bring more stability, stronger rule of a law and a better business environment”.Beijing’s decision has further worsened US-China ties, already at record lows as Washington claims China is to blame for the coronavirus pandemic.Describing the national security laws as a “death knell” for Hong Kong’s autonomy and political freedoms, the US has threatened to revoke the territory’s special economic and trade status. On Sunday Wang said: “It is unfortunate a political virus is also spreading in the US, jumping at any opportunity to attack and slander China. There are those in the US pushing the two sides to the brink of a new cold war.“It is time for the US to give up its wishful thinking of changing China or stopping 1.4 billion people’s historical march toward modernisation.” Wang said China would “emerge stronger, more confident ... in our nation’s unstoppable march to rejuvenation.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/44531ed673df5bb1c4a2167115887ac68cb1743f/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1ea60ca8dfe0aa4a4eccd8631323a707","title":"eureka moment law firms report rush to patent ideas in midst of uk lockdown","story":"Intellectual property lawyers report increased demand for services during Covid-19 crisisA week before lockdown was imposed in March, Dane Whitehurst and his wife put the finishing touches to a room at their home in Kent that they hoped would be a chillout space for them and their three-year-old daughter. With normal working life abruptly halted, however, the room was urgently filled with desks and technical equipment, and any plans for relaxation were put on hold. From this temporary prototyping facility, looking out on to his garden, product designer Whitehurst began thinking about what life would be like in a post-coronavirus world.As creative director at a firm called Burgopak, Whitehurst works with a small team of colleagues developing “innovative packaging” for a range of products including bank cards, drinks and small electronics. Now his thoughts turned to how, in a hygiene-obsessed future, people would increasingly reject cash in favour of cards – stored, potentially, in an inventive new style of wallet.Whitehurst has now applied to patent the “magic wallet”, part of what some intellectual property lawyers have reported is a rush of new applications since the lockdown period began. “We’ve certainly seen a lot of people coming to us with Covid-related innovation that they want to protect,” says Mark Richardson, a partner and patent attorney at Keltie LLP, the law firm working with Burgopak. “We’ve had people looking at decontamination systems, PPE, there has certainly been an uptick in that area.”“A lot of it has been people coming and saying, ‘we have talked about this in the past and I would like to progress it.’ They are looking at their long-term future and trying to understand where they are going to be when things go back to normal.”Although precise figures will not be available until next year, according to a spokeswoman for the Intellectual Property Office where British applications are filed, “early indicators suggest that input this year is up on the January to April period last year”.While some of the new applications directly address virus-related problems, others may have arisen from their creators processing a backlog of admin. By contrast, in some sectors such as pharmaceuticals, notes Tim Belcher, managing associate at law firm EIP, innovation has slowed due to laboratories having closed.But with the option of patenting ruled out the instant an idea has been discussed with anyone, Belcher says, the impetus to protect a good idea, even under lockdown, is clear. “They need to come to us before they have spoken to possible manufacturers, before they have discussed it with their friend on a Zoom call.”Another innovator who has done that is Atif Syed, CEO and founder of a firm called Wootzano. From a unit in Sedgefield, county Durham, the small company has developed what it describes as “electronic skin”, a highly stretchable polymer that Syed says can detect sensations “the way you and I would, understanding touch, pressure, temperature, humidity”.While it could have many applications, the lockdown has underlined its potential use for robots picking soft fruit, where packing facilities faced with post-coronavirus labour shortages are increasingly looking at automation. The firm has been working on the skin for some time, but the crisis has driven the response from potential customers.One innovation with a very clear potential benefit has been developed at Imperial College, London, where a team of product designers and behavioural scientists have come up with a new product to encourage handwashing in developing countries.“Everyone in the world knows about hand-washing, pretty much,” says project leader Weston Baxter, but research by the team in Tanzania showed that bars of soap were viewed by many as items for laundry and dish-washing, not for washing their hands after using the toilet.In response, they developed a cheap and easily produced soap “tab” and dispenser system which, trials in the country show, dramatically increased rates of hand-washing.In a time of immense new challenges, Baxter says, the opportunities for new ideas are enormous. “Whenever there is a lot of friction like this, it means there is a lot of opportunity for innovation. There has been a lot of very fast trial and error, certainly faster than we have seen in a normal time.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a737a7cb7db5a0463ea83d3162d93dd99f2926e/0_416_3854_2313/master/3854.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8651889a2485ad73271ae7fa8ca0dcd1","title":"explainer what do we now know about covid 19 and can you get it twice","story":"Your questions answered based on current knowledge and the latest research from scientistsThat remains unclear. A key question is whether antibodies produced by the body following an infection with the coronavirus provide some level of immunity, and if so, for how long.But we do have some clues. “We know from ‘normal’ coronavirus studies done in the past you can infect people after about a year following an initial infection,” said Dr Ben Killingley, consultant in acute medicine and infectious diseases at University College London hospital.Dr Joshua Schiffer, an expert in infectious diseases at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in the US, added that any signs of reinfection would require detailed scrutiny.“It is also important to recognise that documentation of one or a handful of reinfections does not prove that this is a common, epidemiologically important event.” This initially caused concerns, as experts feared the results might suggest patients had been reinfected. However, the World Health Organization has since said the results were actually false positives, a result of the test picking up particles of the virus within dead lung cells – but this is not active virus. That’s because the PCR (or “have-you-got-it”) test is based on detecting genetic material from the virus – on its own it does not reveal whether that virus is active, and infectious, or not.Some people with Covid-19 experience complications following an initial infection.“In some persons they begin to feel well again and signs and symptoms including fever decrease, but some then go on to develop respiratory distress and must be provided oxygen in hospital,” said David Heymann, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. “It appears to be a delayed immune response that is more serious in some persons and that reacts to remaining virus in various organs.”Even some people who have had a mild experience of Covid-19 have reported experiencing symptoms for several weeks or even months, although experts say only time and testing will tell what the long-term implications are and how common this is.Killingley said it was unclear what was behind such ongoing symptoms, but there are a range of possibilities – including inflammation caused by the virus – although the mechanisms and risks are, as yet, unclear. Immunology professor Daniel Altmann, of Imperial College London, said such cases are important to study.Schiffer agreed such cases are cause for concern. “In the case of Sars CoV-2, my colleagues and I are particularly worried about the possibility of prolonged periods of lung inflammation andor scarring,” he said.A recent study of 60 coronavirus patients in China showed 10 patients tested positive for Covid-19 after discharge from hospital. However, once again, experts say this could be down to the test picking up genetic material from inactive virus, with other studies, including work in South Korea, suggesting those who test positive with Covid-19 after recovering from the disease are not infectious.“It’s not uncommon to find virus in the nose or throat for up to four weeks after initial infection, but tests to establish whether this is live infectious virus – as opposed to just genetic material detection – are not normally positive for much longer than a week,” said Killingley, adding: “I haven’t come across relapse cases whereby the initial infection acquired weeks ago reignites itself into an infectious case.”Schiffer had doubts: “In my view, the presence of Sars CoV-2 RNA many weeks after initial infection may represent ongoing viral replication in cells, which also implies the persistence of small amounts of “active” virus,” he said. “However, quantities are tiny and may represent the dying embers of infection in the body.”Altmann said that, asymptomatic cases aside, infectiousness correlates strongly with acute symptoms, which typically last for up to 12 days, with a tailout to 28 days. “My sense is that in the people who are feeling unwell long after this, it may not be virus, but some kind of immune or inflammatory perturbation,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8799bfe3e0773c21480e58da0b82fbbe8bf97556/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=df54dbf052749a58564e3d0f8dba9f7e","title":"coronavirus at a glance","story":"A summary of the biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreakKey developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:There are currently 5,407,701 confirmed coronavirus cases worldwide, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. The death toll stands at 345,060. Both figures are likely to be higher, due to differing test rates, definitions and deliberate underreporting.The White House has announced it is prohibiting foreigners from traveling to the US if they had been in Brazil in the last two weeks, two days after the South American nation became the world’s second-worst affected country in terms of coronavirus cases. Brazil meanwhile registered 15,813 new cases and 653 new deaths in 24 hours, taking the total number of fatalities to 22,666, and cases to 363,211 confirmed cases, the Health Ministry said.A top White House official on Sunday likened China’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak to the Soviet Union’s cover-up of the meltdown at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in 1986. Robert O’Brien, Donald Trump’s national security adviser, accused China of a cover-up that will “go down in history along with Chernobyl”, ramping up efforts to deflect attention from a Covid-19 death toll in the US fast closing on 100,000.Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Sunday that Washington seemed infected by a “political virus” but that Beijing would nevertheless be open to an international effort to find the coronavirus source.“Some political forces in the US are taking China-US relations hostage and pushing our two countries to the brink of a new Cold War,” Wang said.Boris Johnson’s chief advisor is facing a possible police investigation under health laws over a claim that he breached self-isolation rules in north-east England, after a weekend of mounting pressure on the prime minister to sack his chief adviser. Boris Johnson described Cummings as acting “responsibly, legally and with integrity”.Coronavirus lockdown measures will finally be eased for people in Madrid and Barcelona from Monday, while elsewhere in Spain the first beaches are due to reopen, AFP reports. Residents in the two cities can now meet in groups of up to 10 people in their homes or on the terraces of bars and restaurants. The gates of the capital’s parks will also be reopened, and major museums will be able to receive a limited number of visitors.Australia’s most populous state, New South Wales, on Monday deployed hundreds of crowd control staff to enforce social distancing on public transport amid an expected commuter surge as schools and offices reopened and coronavirus cases fell. Australia has reported just over 7,100 Covid-19 infections, including 102 deaths, well below figures reported by other developed countries.Chilean President Sebastian Pinera said on Sunday that the country’s healthcare system is under strain and “very close to the limit”, as the number of confirmed novel coronavirus infections approached 70,000, after a rapid increase in recent days. The Ministry of Health reported 3,709 new cases in the last day, bringing the total to 69,102. The death toll is at 718.Domestic flights will resume across India on Monday, the federal civil aviation minister has said, despite a 24-hour record increase in new cases on Sunday. The announcement follows a day of “hard negotiations”, the minister said, after some states sought to limit the number of flights.South Africa will further relax coronavirus lockdown restrictions from 1 June, President Cyril Ramaphosa has announced, allowing large areas of the economy to fully reopen. “Cabinet has determined that the alert level for the whole country should be lowered from level four to level three,” he said in an address broadcast on television, describing the move as a significant shift in approach to the pandemic."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/210f05fb6f30fe50a7c837cd728aee00036e3a27/0_227_5367_3220/master/5367.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bb30f015974416a1bfb38812183b46bf","title":"covid 19 lockdowns african americans essential workers","story":"Experts warn reopening states could have dire consequences on public health, and black Americans already face greater riskDonald Trump recently shared a doctored video of his head superimposed on to actor Bill Pullman’s character in the 1996 film Independence Day’s crowd-rallying scene, likening frontline workers to warriors.But it rang hollow for Denita Jones, a Dallas-area call center worker. For many black, essential workers like her, the message is about reopening the economy, but the real meaning is more subtle.“We’re not essential, we’re expendable,” she said.African Americans in Texas are dying of Covid-19 at a rate more than one-third higher than their share of the population. Yet across the country, the protesters who became the faces of the race to reopen have been mostly white.Jones points out that when another Dallas area woman defiantly violated the state’s stay-at-home order, Republican leaders mostly applauded her. Salon owner Shelley Luther, who is white, cut Senator Ted Cruz’s hair just days after being sentenced to county jail and fined.Experts have warned lifting stay-at-home orders could have dire consequences on public health, with social advocates warning that it could result in the sacrifice of many for the benefit of few. Many critics argue that’s the point: the meaning behind the message. As it has been the case throughout much of American history, those most likely to be negatively impacted are African American.According to the Penn Wharton Budget Model, even if US states reopen with social distancing rules in place, an additional 233,000 deaths could result from the outbreak.Black Americans face greater risk. Across the country African American populations are concentrated in major cities, where coronavirus cases have so far been highest.“That job paid my bills, provided for me and my child, because she can’t provide for herself,” she said. “If I don’t have any money, I don’t have a way to live. I’d be out on the streets.”“The choice of governments to circumvent science to advance this cause of reopening falls on the backs of people of color, the poor and immigrants. It is more than reckless,” said Dr Chandra Ford, a UCLA professor and the director of the Center for Racism, Social Justice and Health. “You can’t run a business when you aren’t breathing”.While the coronavirus had already disproportionately affected black Americans because of the prevalence of underlying health issues such as obesity, high blood pressure and diabetes, the pandemic has also exposed existing racial inequities in the US healthcare and labor system.Black people are twice as likely to lack health insurance compared with their white counterparts, and more likely to live in medically underserved areas where they face health facility closures and caps on public health plans.“We have a governmental policy of violence that is producing unnecessary deaths among poor people and people of color,” said the Rev Dr William Barber of the Poor People’s Campaign, a social advocacy group. “It is a form of policy mass murder.”For many, it’s no coincidence, then, that a shift in tone from keeping all Americans safe to reopening businesses at all costs occurred after data confirmed blacks and Latinos are primarily contracting the virus. “The lives of disproportionately black and brown workers are being sacrificed to fuel the engine of a faltering economy, by a president who disdains them,” the Atlantic’s Adam Sewer wrote.From slavery and experimental medical treatments, to redlining and predatory lending scandals, black history in the US has long entailed laboring, both voluntarily and not, for the benefit of an American society that excluded them.That history continues well into today’s global health crisis. Despite research indicating the virus made its way to the US via European tourists, testing guidelines that required recent foreign travel meant those considered eligible skewed wealthy and white.“What we know now is that Covid-19 had been circulating in our communities for much longer than we realized,” Dr Uché Blackstock said of her black and brown communities in New York City’s Brooklyn and Queens boroughs. Testing at the time was concentrated to the richer, whiter Manhattan.The Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC) have since advised health professionals to be on the lookout for medical bias.Dr Mary Bassett, the director of the François-Xavier Bagnoud Center of Health and Human Rights at Harvard, rejected selectively opening communities considered less Covid susceptible, noting that fuels biases that result in unequal treatment for black Americans during a pandemic.“The idea of racial susceptibility to diseases is longstanding in the US, but is simply inaccurate,” she said, adding the risk of exposure is defined by how people’s lives work, not where they live.Because the virus doesn’t discriminate, the former health commissioner for New York City warned without substantial improvements to testing, contact tracing and treatments, the US simply isn’t ready to reopen anywhere.Jones was only called back to work at the Dallas call center this month, after a lengthy furlough. Her colleagues have erse political views, and some stayed home, others didn’t. At work, there were no temperature checks and masks were optional.Before heading home, she has to call her two asthmatic children so they can isolate in their bedrooms while she disinfects her skin and clothes. There’s no other choice. If Jones didn’t work, she would be not be eligible for unemployment benefits.“This is not fair to me, my family or any essential worker who has to return,” she said. “It’s frightening that I have to come in to this type of environment. But it was either feed my family or not return.”Even relief isn’t equitable. A survey found black businesses were less likely to be approved for aid from the federal government’s Paycheck Protection Program. Experts warn that could worsen the financial wealth gap between whites and blacks.“When white America catches a cold, black America catches pneumonia,” Steven Brown of the Urban Institute told CNN Business. “It’s going to be a lot harder for people to dig out once things get stable again.”Meanwhile, Republican governors, including Greg Abbott of Texas, continue to relax restrictions even as data shows an uptick in the number of confirmed cases.“It’s disheartening to know my country thinks that I’m expendable,” Jones said. “But I have a governor shouting from high that we must reopen”.As the Trump administration escalates reopening efforts, workers have organized walkouts and strikes. The social justice organizations Black Lives Matter and Barber’s Poor People’s Campaign are leading digital movements of their own.He contends that isions have made the pandemic less personal. According to YouGov, a London-based research and analytics group, black Americans are twice as likely as white people to know someone who died from Covid-19.“Too many folk seem to see this pandemic as other people’s problem. Those people are the issue,” he said.Americans of all races overwhelmingly support stay-at-home orders. But responses are largely skewed along party lines. The ide is expected to grow as anti-lockdown protests continue.While the message of reopening states for the sake of the country is loud, Barber added that, for poor Americans, people of color and immigrants, the real meaning is deadly.“We were already a nation of power players too comfortable with people dying from poverty, ineptitude and greed,” he said. “That is a moral movement that impacts every poor person, from black folk in the Delta to white folk in Appalachia.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2fd5e847d065a3b42402da9813961206a49d1749/0_158_2679_1608/master/2679.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3425a120290e6198859fd018de86f607","title":"doctors condemn secrecy over false negative covid 19 tests","story":"Doctors’ leaders have condemned ministers and Public Health England (PHE) for throwing a “shroud of secrecy” over how many coronavirus tests on NHS staff and patients produce wrong results.The Hospital Consultants and Specialists Association (HCSA) has demanded an end to “evasion” and the “wall of silence” around how many swab tests result in false negative readings.The tests, in which samples are taken from someone’s throat and nose, are vital in controlling the spread of Covid-19 in hospitals because they are used to check whether NHS personnel and inpatients have the virus and might unwittingly pass it on.The HCSA, which represents thousands of frontline medics, is worried that staff wrongly declared to be virus-free after being tested could lead to patients becoming infected while in hospital.Doctors feel “deep concern and frustration” at PHE’s “systematic lack of information” about the different types of coronavirus tests and say a “wall of silence seems to have been erected around the issue”.The HCSA is also angry that the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) has refused to fully answer parliamentary questions which Labour has tabled to find out more about the tests.Asked by Madders to name all the Covid-19 tests in use, Dorries declined to do so. She simply replied: “There are eight key testing platforms which deliver the majority of testing. All these tests are clinically validated and have high levels of performance.”Nor would Dorries tell Madders which tests for Covid-19 the NHS had stopped using and why. Instead she reiterated that eight clinically validated tests were being used.Prof Andrew Goddard, president of the Royal College of Physicians, said: “The main issue from the perspective of physicians has been, until recently, the lack of access to testing as shown by our survey. Even though the test is far from perfect the inability for healthcare and social care workers to access the test for themselves, their patients and their families has hampered our ability to respond to the pandemic and control its spread within hospitals and care homes.”Dr Nick Phin, PHE’s incident director, declined to respond directly to the HCSA’s concerns. He said: “The UK’s national testing system is built on strong foundations using the latest scientific evidence and expert advice. The different tests in use have been assessed as performing to manufacturers’ specifications.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6230b4de41f5442c335f7a07c3904e7d718a1bfe/0_182_5454_3272/master/5454.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b9f281a30039cd693565dc17204e0a3","title":"exclusive big pharma rejected eu plan to fast track vaccines in 2017","story":"World’s top drug firms turned down proposals for work on pathogens like coronavirusThe world’s largest pharmaceutical companies rejected an EU proposal three years ago to work on fast-tracking vaccines for pathogens like coronavirus to allow them to be developed before an outbreak, the  can reveal.The plan to speed up the development and approval of vaccines was put forward by European commission representatives sitting on the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) – a public-private partnership whose function is to back cutting-edge research in Europe – but it was rejected by industry partners on the body.The commission’s argument had been that the research could “facilitate the development and regulatory approval of vaccines against priority pathogens, to the extent possible before an actual outbreak occurs”. The pharmaceutical companies on the IMI, however, did not take up the idea.The revelation is contained in a report published by the Corporate Observatory Europe (COE), a Brussels-based research centre, examining decisions made by the IMI, which has a budget of €5bn (£4.5bn), made up of EU funding and in-kind contributions from private and other bodies.The IMI’s governing board is made up of commission officials and representatives of the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries (EFPIA), whose members include some of the biggest names in the sector, among them GlaxoSmithKline, Novartis, Pfizer, Lilly and Johnson \u0026amp Johnson.A global lack of preparedness for the coronavirus pandemic has already led to accusations in recent weeks that the pharmaceutical industry has failed to prioritise treatments for infectious diseases because they are less profitable than chronic medical conditions.The world’s 20 largest pharmaceutical companies undertook around 400 new research projects in the past year, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Around half were focused on treating cancer, compared with 65 on infectious diseases.The COE report says that rather than “compensating for market failures” by speeding up the development of innovative medicines, as per its remit, the IMI has been “more about business-as-usual market priorities”.The report’s authors cite a comment posted on the IMI’s website, since removed, selling the advantages of the initiative to big pharma as offering “tremendous cost savings, as the IMI projects replicate work that inidual companies would have had to do anyway”.The European commission’s “biopreparedness” funding proposal in 2017 would have involved refining computer simulations, known as in silico modelling, and improved analysis of animal testing models to give regulators greater confidence in approving vaccines.Minutes of a meeting of the IMI’s governing board from December 2018 reveal that the proposal was not accepted. The IMI also decided against funding projects with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, a foundation seeking to tackle so-called blueprint priority diseases such as Mers and Sars, both of them coronaviruses.“While the scope of a regulatory topic as proposed by the commission was not supported by EFPIA industries, the theme of regulatory modernisation is considered very important by industries, and will be further discussed,” the minutes record. “Interaction with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) continues but no immediate co-investment is expected.”In response to the report, a spokeswoman for the IMI said infectious diseases and vaccines had been a priority from the outset. She highlighted a €20m project known as Zapi launched in 2015 following the Ebola pandemic and which focuses on biopreparedness.The IMI launched funding for “innovations to accelerate vaccine development and manufacture” in January.The spokeswoman said the topic had been competing with other priorities at the time of the 2017 proposal, including research into tuberculosis, auto-immune diseases and digital health.“The report seems to suggest the IMI has failed in its mission to protect the European citizen by letting pass an opportunity to prepare society for the current Covid pandemic,” she said.“This is misleading in two ways: the research proposed by the EC in the biopreparedness topic was small in scope, and focused on revisiting animal models and developing in silico models to better defineanticipate the type and level of immune response elicited in animals and humans in order to increase regulators’ confidence in the evidence base for alternative licensing procedures.“IMI’s projects have contributed, directly or indirectly, to better prepare the research community for the current crisis, eg the Ebola+ programme or the Zapi project.”The COE report says the directing influence of big pharma on the IMI’s research agenda has led it to becoming dominated by industry priorities, and sidelining poverty-related and neglected diseases, including coronaviruses.The thinktank points to official evaluations that found the IMI had enabled competing global companies to work together with small and medium-sized businesses and academia, but that it was difficult to identify positive socioeconomic outcomes.The most recent evaluation in 2017 questioned whether the European pharmaceutical industry should continue to be the “main driver” on the future of medicine.The COE also says that as a result of the industry’s domination of the IMI, there are significant gaps in funding for diseases pinpointed by the World Health Organization (WHO) Report on Priority Medicines for Europe and the World as of public health importance, for which pharmaceutical treatments either do not exist or are inadequate.Seven of the 25 priority areas the WHO identified have no IMI projects, including neonatal conditions and postpartum haemorrhage, according to the report.Seventeen IMI projects relate to Alzheimer’s disease, 12 to diabetes and 10 to cancer. As important as these diseases are, there is no lack of wider interest in providing treatments, leading the report to question whether EU money has been appropriately spent.“Clearly, these disease areas are not suffering from a market failure, as the global pharmaceutical industry is investing heavily in them already, which is not surprising, given the large market potential for new treatments,” the CEO writes.An IMI spokeswoman said that about a third of the IMI budget was spent on infectious diseases, including antimicrobial resistance, vaccines, Ebola and tuberculosis, and that other funds went on cross-cutting issues in drug development."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ce467171772a069d941f4865df597fb971f0b04/0_371_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=1a2cfa650bad97c3f77a10d9a75571f1","title":"news you may have missed as coronavirus swept globe","story":"The reports that would have been the biggest in the world if Covid-19 had never emerged What if it had just fizzled out? What if leading Chinese scientist Zhong Nanshan had gone on state television on 20 January and delivered news that the unusual virus detected in Wuhan was not spreading between people, instead of what he really said that night: that human-to-human transmission was certain? The infection might have been traced to animal carcasses piled in a seafood market’s lanes, and after they were destroyed – and experts issued their usual warnings that a more serious outbreak was inevitable – the coronavirus story might have ended.What would we be talking about instead? What stories would have defined 2020 so far? Even before the worst pandemic in a century, tectonic shifts were already under way. The news felt exhausting. But the world is still turning, despite the movements of half of humanity being restricted in some way. Even apart from Covid-19, it has been a year of significant developments.In the middle of the night in Baghdad, on 3 January, a US drone fired the most consequential shot in the Middle East in a generation, killing 10 people including Qassem Suleimani, leader of the expeditionary force of Iran’s Revolution Guards.The 62-year-old general had been a thorn in the side of the American-led occupation of Iraq, overseeing the Islamic republic’s campaign in Syria and nurturing proxies that turned Iran into a regional player. He was thought to be untouchable. Donald Trump marked his killing with a wordless tweet of a grainy American flag.The chaotic days following the killing involved a deadly crush at one of the general’s public funerals, Iran’s first ever missile strikes on US troops, the accidental shooting down of a passenger jet over Tehran – killing all 176 aboard – and an outburst of anti-regime protests in Iranian cities.The reverberations may be felt for years: nearly all the regional projects Suleimani was overseeing when he died have faltered, the Observer reported this month, and the al-Quds force is struggling to manage its network of proxies without his giant presence.The largest swarms of locusts in decades have descended on farms in parts of Africa, south Asia and the Arabian peninsula this year, posing “an extremely alarming and unprecedented threat to food security and livelihoods”, according to the UN.The pests form vast, destructive clouds that can travel about 55 miles (90km) in 24 hours. A swarm about a square kilometre large can consume the same quantity of food in a day as 35,000 people. The risk of second waves is said to still be critical, including in Yemen, where food security is already dire amid the ongoing civil war.Hostility towards Indian Muslims has crept further into the Indian mainstream in the past five years since the country’s Hindu nationalist prime minister, Narendra Modi, was elected. In February, it boiled over during a state visit by Donald Trump, culminating in the country’s worst religious violence in decades.The catalyst was widely acknowledged to be a ruling party leader, Kapil Mishra, who on 23 February issued a public ultimatum that if the police did not clear the streets of mostly Muslim protesters, his supporters would be “forced to hit the streets”.At least 50 were killed in the ensuing violence between Hindu and Muslim mobs, amid allegations that the Delhi police stood back to allow Hindus to commit violence while beating to death some of the Muslim men in their custody.The riots and killings contributed to growing unease about the kind of India that may emerge from Modi’s years in power.After nearly 19 years, more than 43,000 civilian casualties and three US presidents, the Trump administration signed a peace deal with the Taliban on a Saturday afternoon in late February.It was a good deal for the Taliban: they managed to exclude elected officials in Kabul and deal with the Americans directly. On paper, US troops could be gone from the country by spring 2021. The Taliban have promised to sit down with their Afghan government counterparts and make a separate peace deal later, but there is no guarantee they will do so, and their attacks on the Afghan army and police continue.The US says the ongoing violence means their troops may stay, but it is clear, not least to the Taliban, that Washington is desperate to get out of the war.For a few days after Bernie Sanders swept the Las Vegas Democratic primary, it appeared that a self-described “democratic socialist” was going to win the nomination of a major American party. Instead, the Democratic establishment rallied behind former vice-president Joe Biden, the campaign’s standard-bearer for the liberalism of the Obama and Clinton eras.Biden cleaned up on Super Tuesday and soon after clinched the nomination, but there was no victory tour, nor conciliatory rallies with his opponents. Instead, the 77-year-old appeared to vanish from view as the scale of the coronavirus emergency finally broke through to policymakers and the public. He is currently campaigning from the basement of his Delaware home.On 6 February, an Argentine weather station on Antarctica’s northern tip recorded a temperature of 18.4C (65.1F) – roughly the same as Los Angeles that day, Nasa noted. The freak temperatures were attributed to the confluence of warmer than average sea surfaces, a high pressure system over South America and a warming phenomenon known as the foehn effect.They come against a backdrop of another looming crisis: an almost 3C temperature increase on the Antarctic peninsula over the past 50 years, part of a pattern of unusual weather events associated with global heating, including Australia’s catastrophic bushfire season.Campaigners in April hailed the passage of a new law that makes the practice punishable by up to three years in prison, but were sober about its impact. The practice is entrenched in Sudanese culture and will take time to be eradicated entirely. “There is so much work to be done. This is a start, a good start,” Fatma Naib, a Unicef communication officer in Sudan, told the .A dawn raid in a Paris suburb in May snared one of the world’s most wanted men. Félicien Kabuga, a wealthy Rwandan businessman, is accused of creating and funding the notorious Interahamwe militia that carried out the 1994 killings of about 800,000 people in less than three months.His radio station, the Radio-Télévision Libre des Mille Collines, allegedly helped lay the groundwork for the genocide with its relentless dehumanisation of the Tutsi population. “You have missed some of the enemies,” it said in one notorious broadcast during the killings. “You must go back there and finish them off. The graves are not yet full.”A 2003 attempt to capture Kabuga in Nairobi ended with the mysterious death of the man who was supposed to give up his location. French police said the 84-year-old had also spent time in Germany, Belgium and Switzerland.He is yet to enter a plea in a French or international court, but his lawyers said last week that he had the right to be presumed innocent.The fatal shooting of Ahmaud Arbery, a 26-year-old African American, as he jogged in a coastal city in the US state of Georgia in February, initially received little national attention. The two men accused of killing him claimed they did so in self-defence. Police and prosecutors showed little enthusiasm for pursuing the case.That changed with the 5 May release of a video depicting Arbery’s last moments. The man is trailed slowly by a car as he jogs on quiet street. He reaches another vehicle and two armed men appear. A struggle ensues with one and several gunshots go off. The last scene shows Arbery dying in the street.The shocking footage led to the arrest of the three men present at the shooting, and has rekindled popular rage at the dangers black men can face in predominantly white communities, and the impunity and inaction that regularly follows their deaths.Once a fringe notion espoused by Israel’s far right, the idea the Jewish state would simply declare swaths of the Palestinian territories – where its settlements have been proliferating for decades – its own territory has over the past year marched into the mainstream.The Trump plan calls for the annexation to take place in consultation with Palestinian leaders, but it is unclear what conditions – if any – the White House would impose on the Netanyahu-Gantz government. The annexation was “an Israeli decision”, Mike Pompeo said recently.European leaders, the UN and scores of retired Israeli generals and security officials have voiced their objection to the plan, arguing that it would isolate Israel and pour petrol on the volatile region. It would also signal the death of the two-state solution, the 1994 outline for peace between the Israelis and Palestinians that has been the framework for all subsequent negotiations, but which many analysts argue has been on its deathbed for years."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90066764405366f1fc137bdbfba3c9f717a08af8/60_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4daf60f6bfa74eab8765efbf2675ab98","title":"new zealand pm jacinda ardern live tv earthquake wellington","story":"Leader says she can feel ‘quite a decent shake here’ as the 5.8 quake strikes during a live interviewNew Zealand’s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has developed a reputation for keeping her cool in the face of a crisis. But an earthquake first thing on Monday morning as she was interviewed live on television seemed like an unusually trying way to start a week.“We’re just having a bit of an earthquake here,” Ardern told Ryan Bridge, a host for Newshub’s AM Show, live on air. Casting her eyes to the ceiling of the room she was standing in at New Zealand’s parliament in Wellington, she remained in place as the television camera jolted.The 5.9 magnitude earthquake hit 30 km north-west of Levin, a town about an hour’s drive north from the capital, at a depth of 37 km, according to the country’s seismology agency. No injuries or structural damage have been reported.“Quite a decent shake here, but if you see things moving behind me, the Beehive moves more than most,” Ardern said, referring to the name given to the main parliament building, as the room rattled around her.The quake lasted about 15 seconds and was felt by tens of thousands of New Zealanders as far afield as Auckland in the north and Dunedin on the South Island.“We’re fine,” Ardern told Bridge, signalling she was ready to continue the interview as the quake rolled to a close. “I’m not under any hanging lights.”Ardern later told reporters that the first thought to mind as the room began to shake was, “Are you serious?”Ardern, like most New Zealanders, is accustomed to earthquakes. New Zealand lies on the seismically active “Ring of Fire”, a 40,000km arc of volcanoes and ocean trenches girdling much of the Pacific Ocean.In 2010 and 2011, two major quakes devastated the South Island city of Christchurch, killing 185 people. And in 2016, another near the town of Kaikoura caused damage throughout the top of the South Island and bottom of the North, with some major buildings in Wellington still closed for earthquake strengthening.There did not appear to be any such damage on Monday, even close to the earthquake’s epicentre.But Grant Robertson, the finance minister, said in a tweet that the quake was “not what we need right now.”Others were more dramatic. “I believe after earthquake and plague, the next one is frogs,” one Twitter user said.Civil defence officials did not have anything to say about frogs but quickly ruled out the threat of a tsunami.A Wellington councillor, Fleur Fitzsimons, reported a strange coincidence during the rumble.“Eek, on the phone to the mayor talking about earthquake strengthening the Central Library when that earthquake hit! #eqnz #Wellington,” she wrote on Twitter. The capital’s main library was forced out of use in 2019 when it was discovered to be unsafe."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2bf88dc8b058e90537619e8ef193f31dd7227a19/0_0_7419_4451/master/7419.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8516965d596bc301463f06b0d3179bce","title":"taiwan promises support for hong kongs people china national security law","story":"President Tsai Ing-wen pledges ‘necessary assistance’ after a resurgence in protests against newly proposed security legislation from BeijingTaiwan will provide the people of Hong Kong with “necessary assistance”, President Tsai Ing-wen has said, after a resurgence in protests in the Chinese-ruled territory against newly proposed national security legislation from Beijing.Taiwan has become a refuge for a small but growing number of pro-democracy protesters fleeing Hong Kong, which has been convulsed since last year by protests.Hong Kong police fired tear gas and water cannon to disperse thousands of people who rallied on Sunday to protest against Beijing’s plan to impose national security laws on the city.Writing on her Facebook page late on Sunday, Tsai said the proposed legislation was a serious threat to Hong Kong’s freedoms and judicial independence.Bullets and repression are not the way to deal with the aspirations of Hong Kong’s people for freedom and democracy, she added.“In face of the changing situation, the international community has proactively stretched out a helping hand to Hong Kong’s people,” Tsai wrote.Taiwan will “even more proactively perfect and forge ahead with relevant support work, and provide Hong Kong’s people with necessary assistance,’” she wrote.Taiwan has no law on refugees that could be applied to Hong Kong protesters who seek asylum on the island. Its laws do promise, though, to help Hong Kong citizens whose safety and liberty are threatened for political reasons.The Hong Kong protests have won widespread sympathy in Taiwan, and the support for the protesters by Tsai and her administration have worsened already poor ties between Taipei and Beijing.On Monday, Hong Kong’s security chief said “terrorism” was growing in the city, as government departments rallied behind Beijing’s plans to introduce the national security laws.“Terrorism is growing in the city and activities which harm national security, such as ‘Hong Kong independence’, become more rampant,” Secretary for Security John Lee said in a statement.“In just a few months, Hong Kong has changed from one of the safest cities in the world to a city shrouded in the shadow of violence,” he said.China has accused supporters of Taiwan independence of colluding with the protesters.China believes Tsai to be a “separatist” bent on declaring the island’s formal independence. Tsai says Taiwan is already an independent country called the Republic of China, its official name.

Then Covid-19 came to Ireland and it was joined almost immediately by panic buying.Spending in supermarkets on the day the Taoiseach Leo Varadkar announced that schools were closing on March 12th dramatically outstripped even the busiest shopping before last Christmas. That day saw sales climb 20 per cent higher than the average big Christmas shop with retailers recording a 60 per cent bounce on the same day the previous week. Toilet paper disappeared from shelves almost immediately.Shocked and scared shoppers seeking certainty in a desperately uncertain time stacked trolleys and stood in long lines.While the panic quickly subsided as people realised that supply chains were pretty solid, spending has continued to surge.The average amount people are spending on groceries today is up about 30 per cent compared with last year.It is not just food people are buying. Manicures and home baking have been the unexpected beneficiaries of the pandemic with sales of nail polish remover, fake nails, hand creams and baking trays soaring as people have done their best to keep themselves busy and distracted from bad news while confined to their homes. Social media users have appealed for help in finding once niche products like yeast and “strong” white flour.Sales of colouring books and jigsaws have also climbed as people have got used to life in lockdown.But what about the Left Behind? What have we stopped buying? Obviously with the closure of virtually all retail outlets apart from those deemed essential – food shops and pharmacies mainly – people had no choice but to stop buying many things but what about the products that we could still buy that we have chosen not to?Pricewatch got in touch with two of the leading retailers in Ireland – Lidl and Tesco – to find out what people are less interested in today than they were before the crisis began.One of the surprising early fallers in the supermarket sweeps was bread, a product which would have been an early favourite to disappear.It certainly had a great track record. When the Beast from the East blew into town just over two years ago the first thing that Irish shoppers reached for was the sliced pan. During and immediately after the snow came, bread could not be found anywhere and thousands of pictures and memes circulated widely on social media showed empty bread shelves.“Oh people reach for comfort food like toast at a time of crisis” was the line from retail experts post-storm Emma. Well not during this time of greater crisis. Supermarket data as well as anecdotal evidence suggest that the professional breadmakers of our world have struggled in the face of unexpected competition from the amateurs.Another victim has been grooming products – or at least those favoured by one gender in particular. While many women appear to have been actively seeking out such things, men appear to be to in grave danger of letting themselves go as the lockdown goes on with retailers reporting a significant decline in things which help men make themselves presentable over recent weeks.“We have noticed that men are adopting a more relaxed approach to their grooming habits with a 23 per cent decrease in sales across our men’s grooming range,” a Lidl spokeswoman tells Pricewatch.“We are predicting plenty of beards and lengthy locks this summer with items such as our hair gel, shaving foam, disposable razors and aftershave moving a little slower from our shelves than usual,” she says.By contrast, she notes that there has been “a significant increase among our women’s beauty range” with nail polish remover, face creams and face masks all proving to be popular during the lockdown.The spokeswoman for the discounter also points out that a 20 per cent bounce in sales of baking products had led to declining sales of some of its pre-made cake and confectionary lines including its premium cakes, queen cake buns and jelly sweets.It will be interesting to see if our interest in baking can be maintained when the world starts to return to normal in the days and weeks ahead.Tesco shoppers, meanwhile have been buying less school lunch material – for obvious reasons – and less bread. “We’re seeing some reductions in bakery products, particularly bread as people appear to be making less sandwiches,” its spokeswoman says.“Equally single serve yoghurt pots and drinks and lunchbox snacks have become less frequent purchases, compared with the same period last year.” Ready-made sandwiches are off the menu too.The spokeswoman points out that with many customers now working from home, “cosmetic items have become less important from a shopping perspective”.She says there had been a decline in demand for make-up, contact lens solution, hairspray and travel size toiletries.Ah remember when we needed travel size toiletries to get through airport security? Good times.People also seem less concerned about stains on their clothes with stain removers declining since the beginning of April. Sales of shoe care products have also fallen, no doubt because the need for shoes never mind shoe polish has been significantly less for months now.What have you stopped buying?We recently asked Twitter users what they had stopped buying since the crisis started. Here are just a selection of the responses.Hair spray, fake tan, smokes – I quit. Toilet paper – I stocked up beforehand. Bread – making my own. Any baked goods – baking myself. - Claire DonanEcological cleaning products. Now it’s like the more bleach to kill germs the better! - Sean DearthaSliced Ham has disappeared as the need for lunch sandwiches has dried up. Single portion items have been replaced with family or large servings as we are sitting down to all meals together. - Derek WynneRazors (I don’t need to explain this one – do I?) Cooked meats (and all things packed lunch related). Prepared meals (when need feeding within 30 seconds of getting home from office). Cream, wine and anything else related to entertaining guests. - Jo FearonHaven’t put diesel in car since 12th March. - Louise HolohanNice yogurts like Rolo etc. Couldn’t resist walking by them but I do click and collect now (live in country not taking spots off people) so never think to add it to the shop but definitely spending more on food as we are keeping meal  bed time routine with kids and more baking. - Sandra Hunt McCannReady made sausage rolls – make my own now. Also inidual yogurts, buying big tubs now, and pour into bowl as needed. - Sam WalshFrozen pizza, used to buy an odd one or liked to have one in freezer if stuck. Would need too many now and no room in freezer. - Alice ReilyDiesel, clothes, ready made meals and cartons of hummus. I’ve time to make my own now. Hummus that is not the clothes! - Sonya MurrayNo school lunches – so less bread and no Frubes, grapes or little bags of digestive biscuits. Oh and more spuds for all the Mammy dinners. Also bought roast beef for today for first time in years. Just to make it feel like Sunday. - Samantha LongSoap and deodorant cos not going out. - Paul KellySpring onions, because they don’t come in plastic (which I was delighted over) but now they’re a little too exposed to the elements. - Niamh Fitzpatrick"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Network could advise government on viruses, climate change and water supply issuesJust Transition Commissioner urges use of second site locations for coastal city businessDavis College pupils in Mallow, Co Cork, scoop top prize for work on plastic pollution"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Antipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping changeThree terrapins as pets seems a bit ambitious considering their needsThe list of causes of damage is long, making it hard to know where to startFew, if any, of Ireland\u0026rsquos mammals have evolved the ability to eat venomous creaturesGolden kelp is notably bare of other sea life, so there are concerns over its possible impactLong-term objective is to see how wildflowers are responding to changes in weather patterns and climateTime to restore meadows once full of insects and nectar in summer and spires of seeds in winterA new report shows no let-up in the loss of wildlife in Northern IrelandCorncrakes get major EU funding despite being of \u0026lsquoleast concern\u0026rsquo on Red List criteriaAs top marine predators, dolphins accumulate the most man-made toxic pollutantsGlobal warming presents potentially damaging cascades of impacts, new study finds"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

The overall number of postmortems carried out in the first four months of the year was substantially down. File photograph: Getty Postmortems should not be carried out on bodies without first testing them for Covid-19, according to newly published recommendations from the Royal College of Physicians in Ireland (RCPI).No “open cavity” postmortem examination should be performed on bodies if their disease status is unknown, the guidelines from the RCPI’s faculty of pathology advise.Staff are at “substantial risk” of infection through carrying out postmortems, the guidelines say, and examinations of deceased Covid-19 patients should therefore be restricted to the two locations where these risks can be mitigated – mortuaries in Dublin and Cork.“Each death must be assessed in great detail and in the context of clinical, radiologic and laboratory findings to ensure that an accurate cause of death is ascribed, with the consideration of the need for a postmortem examination for this determination.”Just five postmortems have been carried out on Covid-19-positive patients, The  reported earlier this month. The overall number of postmortems carried out in the first four months of the year was substantially down.Multidisciplinary team conferenceThe guidelines say hospital and mortuary staff should hold a multidisciplinary team conference with the local coroner in relation to deaths. The decision on whether to go ahead with a postmortem is made by the coroner.Where a patient is assumed to be negative for the virus, but a swab produces a positive result, a second meeting should be convened with the coroner, pathologists and GP. This meeting will decide whether a postmortem is required, or whether the death can be ascribed to Covid-19 based on other investigations such as CT scans, an external examination or toxicology tests.The aim of the system is to deal with Covid-19 deaths in a quick and effective way, thus ensuring remains are returned to families for burial as rapidly as possible, according to Dr Clive Gilgallen, chair of the faculty working group that produced the guidelines.The number of postmortems being carried out “is on the way up again”, he said, as the rate of negative tests increases.It is not know how long coronavirus lasts in the body after death, according to Dr Kilgallen, though the related Sars virus survived several days.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Met \u0026Eacuteireann forecasts dry weather for June bank holiday weekendExpect repeated waves of Covid-19 in Ireland for next four years, disease control expert warnsMen aged between 29 and 36 were arrested on Sunday eveningIndustry body draws up list of more than 100 recommendations for salonsStaff at substantial risk so autopsies should be restricted to mortuaries in Dublin and CorkSiptu wants nursing home workers represented on Minister\u0026rsquos new expert panelAdvertising campaign needed to alert people and to encourage them to save to pay it, says TDEasing plans for late July might be brought forward amid growing calls from businessMary Lou McDonald\u0026rsquos backing of IRA campaign \u0026lsquoretraumatising\u0026rsquo, David Kelly saysTraveller families fear facilities put in place will be taken away after Covid-19 crisis endsGovernment paid \u0026euro112.4m to private hospitals in April and first week of MayVaradkar wants to protect Dublin , BusConnects from State spending reviewsRegions will be affected by having fewer jobs where remote working an option, UCC study findsSurge in demand for housing support expected when emergency rent freeze endsSpanish team is set to begin a dig inside the remains of a chapel in ValladolidHighly respected correspondent reported on view from Dublin through the TroublesHSE chief says reducing physical distancing to one metre would create extra capacityStaff from Pobalscoil Chloich Cheannfhaola dance in costume in a video for pupilsStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4260462.1590181050!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"spanish archaeologists recover bones in search for remains of red hugh o donnell","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tOn day five of the dig in Valladolid’s Constitution Street on Friday, the archaeologists recovered human remains. Photograph: TwitterArchaeologists in Spain have found part of a skull and a femur (thigh bone) in their search for the remains of Red Hugh O’Donnell, one of the great tragic heroes of Irish history. O’Donnell died en-route to Valladolid, a city in northwestern Spain, in July 1602 having failed to persuade the Spanish king Philip III to send another army to Ireland to fight against the English.On day five of the dig in Valladolid’s Constitution Street on Friday, the archaeologists recovered human remains. A tweet from the city’s tourism and culture department read: “A part of the skull, a femur, and some more remains appear in what appears to be the access to the Chapel of the Marvels.”The city’s culture councillor Ana Redondo posted a shamrock emoji and the words “estamos cerca” - “we are close”. The archaeologists involved are also searching for the remains of Christopher Columbus, who in 1492 became the first European to discover the Americas.He was buried in the same place as O’Donnell. However, Columbus’s remains were allegedly removed and reburied in the cathedral of Seville and later in the Dominican Republic. Speaking on Friday, which was the 514th anniversary of the funeral of Columbus in Valladolid, chief archaeologist Óscar Burón said he believed that both O’Donnell and Columbus are “buried right under our feet and now we are concerned with checking whether the research we have undertaken is correct”. He described O’Donnell as an “Irish prince and the hero of the resistance against the English”. O’Donnell and his father-in-law Hugh Mor O’Neill, who between them controlled large parts of the north of Ireland, started the Nine Years War to drive the English out of Ireland.Battle of KinsaleIt began promisingly and the Irish won a number of significant victories, but eventually ended in defeat following the siege and then the Battle of Kinsale in late 1601 and early 1602.A combined force of Spanish and Irish troops was defeated by the English in one of the worst military setbacks in Irish history, after which Red Hugh fled to Spain.Though Philip III never did provide the soldiers requested by Red Hugh, he did give him the equivalent of a royal funeral as described in the Annals of the Four Masters.“His body was conveyed to the king’s palace at Valladolid in a four-wheeled hearse, surrounded by countless numbers of the king’s state officers, council, and guards, with luminous torches and bright flambeaux of beautiful wax-light burning on each side of him.” He was buried within the Chapel of Marvels in the grounds of the Franciscan convent in Valladolid. The convent disappeared in 1836 and with it O’Donnell’s remains.In a statement, Valladolid city council’s cultural department said finding the remains of O’ Donnell would be a “spur to the dissemination of this city abroad and also, of course, within Spain.“The burial in Valladolid of these two characters of such relevance to the world as is the case of Columbus and to relations between Spain and Ireland against their common enemy: England, demonstrate the importance of Spain and specifically of Valladolid for centuries.” On Thursday the team of archaeologists located other human bones, but not those of O’Donnell. They hope that his remains will be easy to identify as he lost the big toes on both of feet from frostbite after he escaped from prison in Dublin in December 1591. He fled into the Wicklow mountains in the depth of winter. His companion Art O’Neill froze to death in the escape.

Photograph: Cyril ByrneSinn Féin had around 10 times more engagement on Facebook during this year’s general election campaign than the State’s other political parties, a study has found.The party ran an “anti-elite populist narrative” on social media, where it “vastly outperformed” its political rivals, academics Kirsty Park and Jane Suiter said.Their study found that Sinn Féin posts on Facebook over the course of the campaign (January 14th to February 8th) had 567,020 “interactions” or responses, compared to 49,358 for Fianna Fáil and 55,152 for Fine Gael.Across the board the top 15 posts in terms of interactions were all by Sinn Féin, with its top post receiving 13,742 interactions. The Fine Gael post with the highest level of engagement had 5,013 interactions, putting it in 16th place the study shows.The results of the study are outlined in Media and the election: social and traditional media narratives in the campaign, a chapter by Park and Suiter in a forthcoming book on the general election, How Ireland Voted 2020.Ms Park is a postdoctoral researcher at the Institute for Future Media and Journalism, at Dublin City University, where Dr Suiter is assistant professor at the School of Communications.The study found that Sinn Féin focused on the topic of ‘change’ in its Facebook posts over the course of the election campaign, with more than one in five of its posts referring to the concept. It accounted for two-thirds of all mentions of ‘change’ by all political parties on Facebook during the campaign.The study, which used the Newswhip API social analytics service, also found a marked difference between the emoji icons used to react to posts by the parties.‘Haha’, or ‘Angry’ constituted 94 per cent of emoji reactions for posts by Fine Gael, and 90 per cent for Fianna Fáil, while they only accounted for 7 per cent of these reactions to posts by Sinn Féin. The study found that 91 per cent of the emoji reactions to Sinn Féin posts were ‘Love’.The study concluded that Sinn Féin ran a successful social media campaign and set a strong narrative as the party that represented change, and that the support it received from voters under the age of 35 may be related to this.Anti-establishmentData collected on Twitter use during the last week of the campaign also found a much greater level of activity on the accounts of Sinn Féin politicians. While the absolute number of tweets were relatively small for all politicians, Sinn Féin’s tweeted the most and were met with more retweets and likes.This underlined the number of Sinn Féin supporters on Twitter, “often referred to somewhat disparagingly as ’Shinnerbots’ given their proclivity to be quick to denounce and attack any post not to their liking”, the authors said.Sinn Féin’s success on social media fitted with international evidence where, on average, social media users are younger and pay more attention to politics than those who do not use social media.“Sinn Féin set a populist, anti-establishment agenda as being a party of change, through their interactions with mainstream media and their social presence, as well as through participating in a voting strategy with left-leaning parties,” said Suiter and Park, who added that the reaction of the mainstream media to Sinn Féin, perhaps inadvertently, served to reinforce the party’s messaging."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Police believe Cian English (19), from Carlow, fell trying to evade men trying to rob himChina proposes path to imposing rules used against dissidents

questions","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDominic Cummings: Was seen running out of Downing Street on March 27th, shortly after it was confirmed publicly that Johnson had the virus. Photograph: Andy RainEPAWhile Johnson, speaking at the Downing Street press conference, said his most senior adviser “acted responsibly, legally and with integrity”, there remain questions about Cummings’s decision to make the initial journey, along with the further allegations levelled against the 48-year-old.Why did he need to go 420km north?The argument pushed by Number 10 is that Cummings, fearing there would be no one to look after his four-year-old son if he and his wife became ill with coronavirus at the same time, travelled to be near his family in County Durham to seek childcare.Yet Labour shadow policing minister Sarah Jones said, in an interview on Sky News’s Sophy Ridge On Sunday programme, she knew of “single mothers who have had Covid-19, when their child has had to stay with them” and neighbours and volunteers had to “chip-in food so they can eat”.Given the sacrifices made by others, critics have queried why Cummings, as someone involved in setting the lockdown rules, could not call on any friends or family in London to assist him in adhering to the restrictions.Did he have Covid-19 when travelling?Johnson tested positive for coronavirus on March 26th and Number 10 confirmed that Cummings developed symptoms over the weekend of March 28-29th.He was seen running out of Downing Street on March 27th, shortly after it was confirmed publicly that Johnson had the virus.On Friday, a statement issued by Durham Constabulary suggested Cummings’s father had confirmed his son was self-isolating in the northeast as of March 31st.Given the average incubation period for Covid-19 is five days, but can be as long as 14, the four-day gap between the two dates suggests he could have been asymptomatic while travelling.Did he have to stop en route to Durham?Driving 420km across the country with a four-year-old and a sick wife in the car, who was already displaying Covid-19 symptoms, Cummings might well have needed to stop for a break.Transport secretary Grant Shapps was asked during the Sunday morning media round about whether the family took a pit stop, but said he did not know the answer.But he argued Cummings was a “stickler” for social-distancing rules, indicating he would have abided by them during any stop-off.The cabinet minister told Sophy Ridge: “I saw a clip yesterday of him asking journalists to be spaced two metres apart, so I know he is a stickler for those rules . . . so I’m sure that they took all the necessary precautions.”Did he go on a day trip to Barnard Castle?The Observer and Sunday Mirror reported that an eyewitness – Robin Lees, a 71-year-old former teacher – saw Cummings with his wife and child at Barnard Castle, a popular tourist spot 50km from Durham, on April 12th.Downing Street has not specifically addressed this allegation, but Shapps suggested the Easter Sunday outing, if it took place, “would have been outside the 14-day period” for self-isolation.Government advice is that anyone suffering from coronavirus symptoms must quarantine for seven days after contracting the virus.And guidance issued by the National Police Chiefs’ Council (NPCC) and the College of Policing in early April advised officers not to punish people for using their cars to drive “a reasonable distance” for exercise.Why is Johnson standing by him?Johnson said he thought his aide acted in the best interests of his child, acting in a way “any parent would frankly understand”.But Tory MPs have questioned the Conservative leader’s judgment in backing him, complaining they remain “unconvinced” by the PM’s defence.It is unclear how much Johnson knew about Cummings’s trip north or whether he approved it. Was his son cared for by family while in Durham?Cummings’s defence for his actions, along with the PM’s justification for keeping him on, hinges on the belief he and his wife could require childcare if they both became unwell.In No 10’s Saturday statement setting out what went on, it made no reference to his son being looked after by family members, only that Cummings’s sister “shopped for the family and left everything outside” the property they were staying in.Was the childcare caveat to the “Stay at home” message made clear in government messaging?Health secretary Matt Hancock said the government’s “Stay at home” guidance was an instruction, “not a request” at a briefing on April 3rd.But deputy chief medical officer Dr Jenny Harries had said at a daily Downing Street press briefing on March 24th that a small child could be considered “vulnerable” and therefore provide exemptions from the stringent rules if their carers became ill.Dr Harries said: “Although we are encouraging everybody to stay in their own households . . . clearly if you have adults who are unable to look after a small child, that is an exceptional circumstance.”For those who were listening intently – and Cummings seems to have been among those who were – a loosening of the restrictions was seemingly confirmed.Who is right: No 10 or the police?A row between Downing Street and Durham Constabulary over police involvement during the episode refused to abate over the weekend.No 10 denied, as was first reported, that police had contacted Cummings’s family following a report he had travelled to stay near family.The government’s denial caused the force to put out a fresh statement on Saturday standing by its earlier assertions, stating that officers had a conversation with the Leave campaigner’s father after he requested to speak to them.But Shapps told the BBC the conversation, while initiated by Robert Cummings, did not touch on the whereabouts of the prime minister’s aide.Speaking to the Andrew Marr programme, he said: “For one thing, the father contacted the police, not the other way round.“And secondly, it was about an unrelated matter, which I think quite rightly they don’t want to go into, about security, so it’s not the case that the police made contact without any reason to discuss this specific matter.” – PAStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com\"/polopoly_fs/1.4192672!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_940/image.jpg","title":"us democratic","story":"The process to choose the Democratic nominee to take on Donald Trump in November’s US presidential election is well under way.States across the country are in the process of choosing\u0026nbsptheir preferred candidate, either through a primary contest or a caucus. A primary is a traditional election where eligible voters select their candidate privately through a ballot system. A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states. Though Vermont senator Bernie Sanders finished first in four states, including delegate-rich California, Super Tuesday checked the Sanders momentum after a strong opening to the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and\u0026nbspNevada.On March 10th\u0026nbspsix more states vote, with most of the remaining primaries taking place throughout March and April. The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role. These are senior members of the party – governors, former members of Congress, etc. Their 771 votes come into play if the convention is contested, which is\u0026nbspa possibility.Notably, six of the candidates were asked during a debate in Las Vegas on February 19th if they would support the idea of a candidate winning the nomination if they secured a plurality but not a majority of the delegates. All but one – Sanders – said they were opposed to this. The issue may become a headache for the Democratic Party as the primary process progresses."},{"url":null,"title":"national interest dominic cummings stay","story":"It is hardly a revelation that Dominic Cummings has many enemies who believe he should be sacked for his alleged infringement of the lockdown rules. He has become a lightning conductor for the anger of a good slice of progressive Britain. They want revenge, above all for Brexit.But the Cummings question raises another interesting question about what, if any, special privileges should be enjoyed by the people running the country on our behalf. There is a kind of hyper-democratic rancour abroad that refuses to contemplate that our rulers, at least while they are ruling, deserve some special treatment.I do not know Mr Cummings personally (and voted Remain in the referendum). Even his fans concede that he can be erratic, and it is reassuring to see, in several decisions that the Government made before the crisis, that his influence is not as great as his enemies imagine. But he is obviously highly capable, science and data literate, and understands many of the failings of the government machine that have been revealed by the crisis (see his 2014 IPPR lecture, “The Hollow Men”). I think it is in the national interest that he stays.   And his case surely sits in a defensible grey zone. Both he and his wife were ill with the virus, placing their child in a vulnerable position. Short of handing the child to social services, it is hard to see what course of action they could have taken but to fall back on family in Durham. And they were, according to reports, fortunate to have the space in Durham to isolate away from Mr Cummings’s parents in a separate cottage, safe in the knowledge they could now rely on family help. They applied human common sense, and their case is in a completely different category to Professor Neil Ferguson’s romantic liaison, or Catherine Calderwood, the former Scottish chief medical officer, who decided to visit her second home. Both of those breaches of lockdown were completely unforced.In general, of course, the law should apply equally to all, and members of the ruling elite should avoid saying one thing and doing another. But there is also widespread agreement that our rulers, and by extension their closest advisers, are entitled to some special treatment. They are, after all, special people, even in democracies – perhaps especially in democracies – and have a very unusual and demanding job, which we want them to perform to the best of their abilities. Boris Johnson clearly did not get normal treatment at St Thomas’ Hospital. Politicians have bodyguards and, to cite a more trivial example, their cars often have police escorts and sail through red lights to get ministers and their advisers to meetings on time. We do, and should, bend the rules for them. The question is, which actions sit legitimately in that ruler privilege zone and which do not? We decided, for example, a few years back, that awarding yourself overgenerous expenses did not (without telling them). There is an anti-elitist piety, often expressed by the academic or media branch of the same broad elite, that refuses to accept the specialness of rulers. I sometimes think that the combination of mass higher education and social media threatens to make society ungovernable. The broad elite is in revolt against the narrow elite. Everyone thinks they know better. We have seen this in freedom of information rules that make it difficult for ministers and officials to have honest conversations, pushing key decisions into private rabbit-holes. (Though it’s a shame the rules were not applied to the scientific advice being given to ministers, where open critique of the science from other scientists would have been useful.)We want transparent, open government, but it has negative unintended consequences that need to be constrained. The transparency requirements of modern institutions encourage a performative, virtue-signalling political culture that makes it harder for people to identify as establishment insiders and come to reasonable compromises.So it’s important that Mr Cummings stays. Even if his actions were technically outside the letter of the law – which is far from clear – there is, surely, an extreme circumstances loophole, and more broadly we need to cut our rulers (and their top advisers) some slack. David Goodhart is author of ‘The Road to Somewhere’ (Penguin)More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"cannonball run record repeatedly shattered us highways empty","story":"When a team of three hurtled across the US at an average speed of 103 mph last year, many believed their Cannonball Run record of 27 hours and 25 minutes would remain intact for years.Then came the coronavirus lockdown which saw highways across the US empty, leaving the roads free for speed-freaks while millions of Americans complied with stay-at-home orders.The temptation of taking on the challenge, which dates back to the early 1970s, has proved irresistible.In just a couple of months the record in the race, popularised in a 1981 film starring Burt Reynolds, has been shattered seven times.A driver, calling him – or herself – Captain Chaos got the journey time down to 26 hours and 38 minutes in an Audi 8 – at an average speed of 106 mph.Now there are unconfirmed reports of at least one motorist – or team - completing the journey from the Red Ball Garage in Manhattan to the Portofino Hotel in Redondo Beach, California in under 26 hours.Speed limits are ignored by contestants in the unofficial race, which sees drivers putting their pedal to the metal as they race along deserted straight highways.Dodging speed traps and evading highway patrols is arguably as important as souping up an engine for cannonballers.Some reportedly use GPS devices and spotters to scan the road for police cars. They have also carried tanks of fuel to minimise the number of pit stops.Ed Bolian, a former Cannonball Run record holder, described the speeds reached by the latest teams as unreal.Certainly, we had some over 110 mph averages through states, they were over 120 mph through several states.How long this record will stand remains to be seen.

On the first Sunday I decided to use my hour of allotted exercise to walk from Hove Lawns to Brighton Pier, the seafront stretch which was the scene of so many good times. Nothing during these two months has left me as sorrowful as that promenade for some reason I imagined that the beach bars would still be open for business (because I saw the esplanade as some fantastic fiefdom which was a law unto itself, like Narnia with hen parties) but of course they were closed. The sun was shining, the canned cocktails were cold – and I felt like I was walking towards my own gallows.Well, what a difference eight weeks makes! I’m proud to admit that I was one of the ocean-going rotters who crowded onto Brighton Beach on Wednesday.I’m burnt to a crisp – but it was so worth it. I love humanity – with the exception of the silly man who has gone viral after a clip of him being interviewed on the very beach where I was basking appeared on Good Morning Britain. Standing there drinking beer, he opined – for all the world like the Homer Simpson of Sussex – “I think we should be stricter like Spain and none of us be allowed out.”He’s not alone in his double-think elsewhere on daytime TV, the presenter Phillip Schofield could be seen clutching his pearls when a woman who lived alone stated her intention to meet up with her similarly self-isolated sister to celebrate her birthday. This would be the same Phillip Schofield who also begged for pubs to open way earlier than planned because “people are going crackers” and “we’ve all got really good at social distancing”.We’re used to people in power being hypocrites. There’s a whole rationale for it de La Rochefoucald’s old saw that “Hypocrisy is a tribute vice pays to virtue”. You could get away with this in a culture of deference which also had no mass media, where the peasants could be scared into believing that they’d burn in Hell if they even contemplated misbehaving themselves as their betters did. But as populism in general and Brexit in particular showed, we no longer live in forelock-tugging times. New plague – same old double standard. Teachers who’ve happily availed themselves of the labour of working-class people for the past two months but think they’re too special to go back to work.Government advisors preaching lockdown and getting around like something out of a Beach Boys song. The sneering on social media at the people licking Mr Whippies on Southend beach which wouldn’t be aimed at some snob swanning around Sandbanks, even though those who bore the brunt of the patronising fury were far more likely to be on furlough, freshly unemployed andor stuck in a small home without a garden. This is just the latest joust in the culture war which has been vivifying – or splitting as the miseries would have it – this nation ever since the referendum.A recent poll by Opinium shows a nation split down the middle, 46 per cent saying the Government is either doing too much or the right amount and 47 per cent saying it’s not doing enough. It doesn’t show who’s on what side but it’s an interesting statistic – and from what I’ve seen I’d bet that those who voted Remain (generally smug stick-in-the-muds) are in favour of a continued lockdown while those who voted Leave (generally reckless rushers-in) want to get things going.The timid may stay at home forever if they wish. But they shouldn’t try to keep the rest of us treading water in the shallow end of life forever, just because they’re scared of the dark and deep.Increasingly, we have the science on our side a new paper in The Journal Of Infectious Diseases shows that while coronavirus can survive for days on indoor surfaces, 90 per cent of it is deactivated in ten minutes when exposed to the midday sun.Even more importantly, what makes us human is other humans without them we are just lackadaisical apes looking at the stars, wondering where we are and pining for an echo of our kind.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"lockdown restrictions eased allowing social contact shops reopen","story":"Lockdown restrictions will be eased to allow greater “social contact” and the reopening of non-essential shops, Boris Johnson has suggested.The Prime Minister on Sunday night promised to reveal details of less draconian measures - which could include more mixing between households - in the coming days.The rules were relaxed slightly a fortnight ago to allow members of one household to meet a maximum of one person from a different household in a public place, provided they stay two metres apart.However, the Government’s roadmap for lifting the lockdown raises the possibility of “bubbles” of social contacts once England moves to Step 2.Speaking at the daily Downing Street press conference, Mr Johnson said he believed the country to be “in a position to move to Step 2 of our plan”.“We will set out what moving to Step 2 means for other areas, such as non-essential retail and more social contacts over the course of the next week,” he said, adding: “We are making good progress, but that progress is conditional, provisional.“We must keep reducing the incidence of this disease.”Mr Johnson will update the Cabinet on plans to lift the lockdown on Monday, but it is unlikely that any easing will come into effect before the start of next week.Northern Ireland already allows groups of up to six people from different households to meet outdoors, so long as they maintain social distancing.The Welsh government still prevents members of different households from meeting outdoors, although the health minister is reviewing the policy and a review is promised on Thursday.Meanwhile Nicola Sturgeon has promised to allow outside meetings between a maximum of two households from that date.The Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies is understood to have advised ministers that Covid-19 infection is far less likely outdoors.The Government’s roadmap document states: “The intention of this change would be to allow those who are isolated some more social contact, and to reduce the most harmful effects of the current social restrictions, while continuing to limit the risk of chains of transmission.”“This could be based on the New Zealand model of household \u0027bubbles\u0027 where a single \u0027bubble\u0027 is the people you live with.”Step 2 of the roadmap also includes the opening of non-essential retail outlets, subject to the size of the establishment and the ability to enforce social distancing.Outdoor markets and car show rooms are two examples, a source told The Daily .However, any reopenings as part of Step 2 are not thought to include hospitality venues such as pubs and restaurants.Some of these venues could re-open from July 4, subject to incidence of the virus decreasing sufficiently, according to the roadmap document.“We must keep that R down below one, and that means we must all remember the basics: wash our hands, keep social distance, isolate,” said Mr Johnson on Sunday.“We are beating this thing. But we will beat it all the faster if we stare that control the virus and save lives.”Aggressive monitoring of new infections is a critical component of the route out of lockdown.Matt Hancock, the health secretary, has recruited 25,000 contact tracers to track down people who may have come into contact with newly-infected patients.However, some experts have said that not enough volunteers will be deployed in the community, rather than call centres.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"sir david attenborough coronavirus pandemic has swept climate","story":"Sir David Attenborough has said the coronavirus pandemic has swept the problem of climate change from the front pages.The broadcaster and naturalist, who celebrated his 94th birthday in May, said the outbreak has made the issue feel as if it is in the distant future.Appearing on the So Hot Right Now podcast, Sir David suggested the virus could make the world\u0027s nations see survival depends on co-operation.He said: The trouble is that right now the climate issue is also seen as being rather in the distant future because we\u0027ve got the virus to think about.And so what are the papers full of? The virus. Quite right, that\u0027s what I want to know about, too.But we have to make sure that this issue, which was coming to the boil with the next COP meeting in Glasgow, has suddenly been swept off the front pages. And we\u0027ve got to get it back there.Sir David referenced the COP26 international climate talks, which were due to take place in Glasgow in November but were postponed due to the pandemic.Asked whether he saw a solution to the decreased awareness of climate change, he said: No, if I knew that I would be a dictator but I\u0027m not.I don\u0027t know - we, you and me and lots of others like us have got to keep on going on about it but the clock is ticking.The danger of the Arctic and the Antarctic warming is becoming greater day by day.Sir David said he hopes the outbreak encourages nations to work together but suggested this would be the first time it had ever happened.He told journalist Lucy Siegle and film-maker Tom Mustill, who host the podcast: What the result of coronavirus is going to be I don\u0027t know.But I\u0027m beginning to get a feeling that for the first time the nations of the world are beginning to see that survival depends on co-operation.If that happens, that\u0027s going to be a first in human history.Sir David praised climate activist Greta Thunberg, 17, for galvanising the youth and following the science.He said: I think she\u0027s very remarkable. And what is more she is, with all that power, nonetheless extremely modest.She is extremely well informed. But she\u0027s also very modest. And she keeps saying: Look, the only guide has to be the science, we must follow what the science says.He defended Thunberg against her critics and suggested they are not particularly well informed.He said: Yes, well that\u0027s the way it is. That\u0027s the way life is, that\u0027s the way society is.And in fact if you aren\u0027t particularly well informed about the natural world, and the minute you find that you can\u0027t get to your work to do what you want to do, or what you need to do to earn a living, because somebody has stopped you because they are talking about an issue you don\u0027t know about, it shouldn\u0027t come as a surprise that there will be some people as a consequence of that who will act in an outraged way.Sir David is the first guest to appear on the So Hot Right Now podcast, about communication and climate change.His episode will be available from Tuesday on all podcast platforms.Former president of Ireland Mary Robinson, singer Ellie Goulding and UN climate negotiator Christiana Figueres will also feature in the series.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"west must stand china ruthless regime flexes muscles","story":"For many years now, China’s approach to the world – patient, strategic, focusing on the long-term – has been a worry and yet also a reassurance for Western leaders. On one hand, unlike the democracies, Beijing has seemed to have the luxury of time in its attempt to win the “hundred-year marathon”. On the other, its “slowly, slowly” mentality meant China never seemed, in the near-future at least, a serious security threat or geopolitical rival.The pandemic has jolted democratic leaders out of their complacency. Beijing continues to resist an independent international inquiry into the origins of Covid-19, but we know it lied to the world about the dangers of the virus, silenced the doctors who discovered human-to-human transmission, and manipulated the World Health Organisation, which is led by a director-general whose election China orchestrated.This behaviour has been compounded by Beijing’s reaction to international criticism. Its “wolf warrior” diplomats and state-controlled media have begun a misinformation campaign, claiming the virus originated in the US, and insisting that those blaming China are guilty of imperialism and racism. Its reaction to Canberra’s support for an inquiry into Covid-19 was to impose tariffs of more than 80 per cent on barley imports from Australia. When the EU’s ambassadors asked to write a column in the state-controlled China Daily, its Ministry for Foreign Affairs censored the text.Beijing’s response to the pandemic shows that China is not just another trading partner, a country that will open up and become more liberal the more it is exposed to Western ways. The Chinese Communist Party is an authoritarian bully at home, spying on its people and persecuting religious minorities. Overseas it is a menace, manipulating international institutions, setting debt traps to bring countries under its control, abusing the international trading system, engaging in industrial espionage and using telecommunications technology to embed itself in societies, economies and security systems.But the pandemic is revealing something else. For China’s attitude and behaviour have changed since the virus started to spread. Its modus operandi over the past few decades can be summed up in a number of Chinese proverbs about strategy. Teaching China’s leaders to mask their true intentions, they advise them to: “Deck the tree with false blossoms.” If a statesman can show enough guile and subtlety, he can trick a rival into making mistakes that allow a rising nation to supplant a superior power. As the proverb explains: “The guest becomes the owner.”Yet since the contagion started to spread, Beijing has allowed its mask to slip. “On the outside,” a proverb recommends, “be benevolent on the inside, be ruthless.” But in China’s recent actions, we have seen not a trace of benevolence.While the rest of the world fought the virus, China declared its intention to build new “research stations” on military bases in the South China Sea. It has become embroiled in a border dispute with India, and some analysts see its hand in another border dispute between India and Nepal. It has sunk a Vietnamese fishing vessel in disputed waters and threatened to shoot down Taiwanese aircraft. In reaffirming its commitment to reunification with Taiwan, it has dropped its promise that reunification must be peaceful.This week, the National People’s Congress will effectively end the “one country, two systems” policy in Hong Kong. This policy was the result of the deal struck between Britain and China in the Joint Declaration of 1984. Hong Kong would become Chinese sovereign territory by 1997, but its judicial system, capitalist economy, civil rights and governing autonomy would not change for 50 years.Beijing has slowly eroded the autonomy of Hong Kong, but what it now proposes amounts to the abrupt death of “one country, two systems”. In contravention of the Joint Declaration, new national security laws will not be agreed by Hong Kong’s legislative council but imposed on the city by Beijing. The new laws include severe punishments for “subversion” and “colluding with foreign political forces”, which are incompatible with Hong Kong’s civil rights.The Joint Declaration is an international treaty, lodged at the United Nations. In full view of the world, China is defying international law and abrogating its obligations. So why does President Xi feel he can show such ruthlessness?One explanation is that Beijing is panicking. Having unleashed a virus on the world, it faces unprecedented scrutiny from the West and mounting questions about public health and economic growth at home, so it may be that Xi is acting aggressively in order to assert himself. After all, authoritarian regimes can never afford to look weak before their populations: their strength is their very purpose.Perhaps a better explanation is that China has made a conscious decision to become more geopolitically assertive. Already the largest trading nation in the world, some predict the Chinese economy will overtake the US’s within 10 years. Beijing is reportedly increasing its military budget this year by 9 per cent. It is investing $1.4 trillion (£1.1  trillion) in new technologies by 2025. It has tested making the yuan the world’s first digital currency, to protect itself from future American financial investigations and sanctions. In exercises conducted by the Pentagon, China would defeat the US in “every simulation” of a Pacific war.Regardless of the explanation, the West’s old assumptions about China can no longer apply. Xi has already made himself China’s president-for-life. “Great historical progress always happens after major disasters,” he recently declared. For China, that progress means the usurpation of the US as the world’s principal power, and the eclipse of the Western-led international order.That threat is no longer a remote and distant possibility. It confronts us here and now. Together, the West is strong enough to defend our values and interests, but it will take leadership and resolve to do so. We must change our approach to China, and fast.Nick Timothy is the author of Remaking One Nation: The Future of ConservatismMore from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"travel updates greece restarts ferries tries salvage tourism","story":"The popular tourist island of MykonosComment:  One way or another we will have a summer holidayWhat is an air bridge and why is the Government considering them? Can I go on holiday in the UK? Latest advice on lockdown restrictions Greece has restarted regular ferry services to its islands, while restaurants and bars are reopening, as the country continues efforts to salvage its vital tourism season.Visitors to Greece are currently required to self-isolate for two weeks, but the country\u0027s low infection rate has encouraged its government to welcome overseas tourists again from June 15. Direct flights to the islands have been given permission to resume from July 1. Foreign arrivals will no longer be required to self-isolate but they will be subject to Covid-19 testing. Further details will be announced in the coming weeks. Distancing regulations and passenger limits have been imposed both on ferries and at restaurants. Whether Britons will be among the first tourists to return depends on how long the UK Government retains its own 14-day quarantine policy, due to come into force on June 8, or whether it offers an exemption or air bridge to those arriving from Greece. For more advice on when Greek holidays will resume, follow this link. Domestic tourists will be allowed to return to the German state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, home to the country\u0027s Baltic seaside resorts, from today. John Gimlette, writing for  Travel, described Meck-Pomm as  Germany\u0027s answer to Norfolk. Hotels in Berlin, meanwhile, are now permitted to reopen, but the city is considering a new tourism strategy. We don\u0027t think people want closely packed big-city bustle at the moment, Burkhard Kieker, the head of VisitBerlin, told RBB Inforadio. His agency has launched a campaign showing how much green space and how much water there is in the German capital.Germany plans to reopen its borders to foreign tourists from June 15. A couple who reportedly drove six hours for a holiday in the Cotswolds on Friday were immediately told by police to head back home, turning their weekend break into a 12-hour road trip.Posting on Twitter, Cotswolds Police said: “Today a couple travelled six hours to spend a few days at a holiday let in Stow. Unfortunately they were greeted by PCSO Symes who told them to travel six hours back. Holiday homes are not open for business.The latest advice for people in England is that they “may drive to outdoor open spaces irrespective of distance, so long as they respect social distancing guidance while they are there”. Overnight stays, however, are not permitted.The national carrier of Fiji has sacked more than half of its staff due to the global coronavirus lockdown.Fiji Airways depends heavily on the tourist trade, particularly from neighbouring Australia and New Zealand, but has seen virtually all flights suspended.Talks are currently underway to create a travel bubble among South Pacific nations that have coronavirus under control, allowing some tourism to resume. But details are still being worked out and implementation could be many months away.Both Australia and New Zealand have stringent restrictions on overseas travel and impose a two-week quarantine on all international arrivals. Fiji has reported just 18 cases of Covid-19, with no deaths and no new cases reported in more than a month.That\u0027s the verdict of Paul Griffiths, CEO of Dubai Airports, and with face masks, temperature checks, and strict social distancing fast becoming the norm aboard planes, on beaches and in restaurants, he\u0027s got a point. Do you think safety measures will spoil the holiday experience? The east German state of Thuringia has become the first to announce it will lift the coronavirus lockdown and allow citizens to make their own choices.“Our motto will be: recommendations instead of bans, and self-regulation instead of state compulsion,” Thuringia’s state leader Bodo Ramelow said on Sunday.Mr Ramelow will reveal details of his plan later in the week, but an end to restrictions on movement and compulsory face masks, plus a complete reopening of schools are all seen as likely.Read the full story. The collapse of Specialist Leisure Group, parent company of coach holiday operator Shearings, could force almost 50 hotels across the UK to close permanently. The firm\u0027s Bay Hotels, Country Living Hotels and Coast \u0026amp Country Hotels brands operated 45 properties in popular holiday destinations such as Harrogate, Bath, Newquay, Torquay and Llandudno. Each will need to find a new buyer if they are to welcome paying guests again after the pandemic is over.   With a warm and sunny bank holiday Monday in store, here are a few overlooked Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty to explore. Find solitude in the hillsAround eight million people will return to work on June 1 after South Africa announced plans to reopen the majority of business after more than two months of lockdown. Under the new rules, limited alcohol sales for home use will be allowed to resume, while a night-time curfew and a restriction on when people can exercise will be dropped. Tobacco sales will remain banned, while restaurants, bars, sporting venues, places of worship and conference centers will stay shut.Tourists will have to wait a while longer before they are able to visit. South African airspace is closed to commercial airlines, land borders to neighbouring countries are shut except for trade, and visa are not being issued. The US has added Brazil to its list of countries from which foreign arrivals are prohibited. The ban, which comes into force on Thursday, applies to all non-Americans who have visited Brazil in the previous 14 days. Only the US has recorded more coronavirus cases than the South American nation. With more glorious weather forecast, and millions of Britons understandably keen for a dose of seaside fun, crowds are likely at many of the UK’s best-known beaches today. So swap Southend, Brighton and Woolacombe for one of these lesser-visited treasures.A hidden cove in CornwallLockdown has been eased in Madrid and Barcelona from today, while elsewhere in Spain the first beaches have reopened.Residents in the two cities can now meet in groups of up to 10 people in their homes or on the terraces of bars and restaurants. Madrid\u0027s parks and museums are also reopening, but masks remain compulsory in public buildings and on streets when social distancing is not possible. Bathers can also return to the beaches of several regions, including Andalusia, the Balearics and the Canary Islands. Limits will be imposed on visitor numbers, however, and umbrellas spaced four metres apart. Spain remains off-limits to Britons, with all foreign arrivals required to self-isolate for 14 days, but the country plans to reopen its borders to tourists in July. Swimming off Spain\u0026#39s beaches is now permittedWhile Britain debated the ins and outs of a certain man\u0027s trip to Durham, Australia banned all cruises until September, Antigua ditched plans for a 14-day quarantine policy, restaurants in the world\u0027s smallest country reopened, and business leaders urged the UK to quickly establish air bridges with low-risk destinations.

Chief executive Kathryn Marinello resigned last week following reports of possible bankruptcy.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe company lost all revenue from mid-March when the global travel industry came to a shuddering halt. Much of the firm’s income is sourced from car rentals at airports but it started missing debt payments in April.Ms Marinello said at the company’s first-quarter earnings conference on 12 May: “No business is built for zero revenue. There’s only so long that companies’ reserves will carry them.”Why businesses should think about going flight-freeBusinesses are a bit more optimistic, but we\u0027re heading for recessionHow the Government is helping UK businesses in the Covid-19 crisisNew insolvency law to stop businesses going bust during pandemicIn the company’s first-quarter report earlier this month with securities regulators, Hertz warned it may not be able to repay or refinance debt and may not have enough cash to continue operations.The report said: “Management has concluded there is substantial doubt regarding the company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the issuance date of this quarterly report.”Hertz said in a statement on Friday: “The impact of Covid-19 on travel demand was sudden and dramatic, causing an abrupt decline in the company’s revenue and future bookings.“Hertz took immediate actions to prioritise the health and safety of employees and customers, eliminate all non-essential spending and preserve liquidity.“However, uncertainty remains as to when revenue will return and when the used-car market will fully re-open for sales, which necessitated today’s action. The financial reorganisation will provide Hertz a path toward a more robust financial structure that best positions the company for the future as it navigates what could be a prolonged travel and overall global economic recovery.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The challenge now is to understand the processes in Earth\u0027s core driving theses changes.One possibility, according to the ESA, is that the weakening field is a sign that the Earth\u0027s magnetic field is about to reverse, whereby the North Pole and South Pole switch places.The last time a geomagnetic reversal took place was 780,000 years ago, with some scientists claiming that the next one is long overdue. Typically, such events take place every 250,000 years.The repercussions of such an event could be significant, as the Earth\u0027s magnetic field plays an important role in protecting the planet from solar winds and harmful cosmic radiation. Telecommunication and satellite systems also rely on it to operate, suggesting that computers and mobile phones could experience difficulties.The South Atlantic Anomaly is already causing issues with satellites orbiting Earth, the ESA warned, while spacecrafts flying in the area could also experience technical malfunctions.A 2018 study published in the scientific journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that despite the weakening field, Earth\u0027s magnetic field is probably not reversing.The study also explained that the process is not an instantaneous one and could take tens of thousands of years to take place.ESA said it would continue to monitor the weakening magnetic field with its constellation of Swarm satellites.The mystery of the origin of the South Atlantic Anomaly has yet to be solved, the space agency stated. However, one thing is certain: magnetic field observations from Swarm are providing exciting new insights into the scarcely understood processes of Earth\u0027s interior.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We’re always experimenting with future concepts using different hardware configurations as part of our proof-of-experience process” Bozworth also tweeted.Virtual reality is content computer-generated in three dimensions in a digital environment, while augmented reality – or mixed reality – is digital content layered over a real-world environment, such as Pokemon Go.The news comes as Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that half of its workforce will likely work remotely over the next five to ten years.“We need to do this in a way that’s thoughtful and responsible, so we’re going to do this in a measured way, he said. But I think that it’s possible that over the next five to 10 years — maybe closer to 10 than five, but somewhere in that range — I think we could get to about half of the company working remotely permanently.“VR and AR is all about giving people remote presence. So if you’re long on VR and AR and on video chat, you have to believe in some capacity that you’re helping people be able to do whatever they want from wherever they are. So I think that that suggests a worldview that would lead to allowing people to work more remotely over time.” What has Facebook done to fix election interference since 2016?Facebook wants to build a ‘hateful meme’ AI to clean up its platformFacebook’s Oculus is developing a new Quest VR headsetThe company also published a blog post  saying that it would create a “super-powered augmented workspace with multiple customizable screens in VR, unbounded from the limits of ​physical monitors.”It would use Passthrough – a technology used on Facebook’s Oculus virtual reality hardware that lets you “temporarily step outside VR to see a real-time view of the world around you” - to let people switch between their real and virtual worlds with the hope that by “combining the flexibility of new inputs like hand tracking with the familiarity of everyday input devices like a keyboard and mouse, we could give people the best of both worlds.”The company is also developing virtual avatars called Codec Avatars which would “let people in the future create lifelike virtual avatars of themselves quickly and easily, helping social connections in virtual reality become as natural and common as those in the real world.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The companies added to the US government’s Industry and Security Bureau’s “Entity List” were accused of “human rights violations and abuses in the implementation of China’s campaign of repression, mass arbitrary detention, and high technology surveillance against the Uighurs, Kazakhs, an other members of the Muslim minority groups” in the region.

Russia has been pushing for greater facial-recognition in the capital yet has a questionable history with the technology, including criticisms that CCTV footage has been hidden to obscure political crimes.Hikvision allegedly sold Chinese authorities 1,000 facial recognition cameras to be placed in mosques in Xinjiang so Uighurs could reportedly be better monitored.Wyden asks colleagues to limit FBI surveillanceAmazon also hosts the NSO Group, a spyware provider from Israel which has been repeatedly criticised for its involvement in spying on human rights workers, hacking hundreds of phones via WhatsApp  and is currently mapping coronavirus cases. Microsoft provides the web hosting capabilities and the email support for Ntech Labs, as well as allowing SenseTime to host emails on its Azure cloud computing service. Sensetime was found to be the supplier of equipment to officials in Xinjiang, where Muslims are reportedly held in internment camps, alongside Megvii, which also uses Microsoft Azure.“Our research shows that Google, Amazon and Microsoft continue to help some of the world\u0027s most controversial technology companies stay online. Many of the companies in our report have faced serious allegations of human rights violations and are known to have sold their invasive surveillance technology to authoritarian regimes around the world,” Samuel Woodhams, co-author of the report, told the Independent. “Despite this, US companies continue to provide them with essential web services, allowing them to continue promoting their technology without restriction. The report also shows that attempts by the Trump administration to decouple the American and Chinese technology sectors have so far been relatively limited in their success.”We have reached out to Google, Microsoft, and Amazon for comment.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That includes no time limits on outdoor activities, meetings of up to 15 people, weddings and visits to nursing homes and beaches.German government considering easing social distancingThe German federal government is recommending that states ease some social distancing regulations from 6 June, Bild newspaper reported, but continues to urge that limits be placed on size of social gatherings.According to an official paper seen by the newspaper, Helge Braun, head of Chancellor Angela Merkel\u0027s office, recommended that private gatherings be held in the open air where possible and be limited to 20 people, while indoor meetings should be limited to 10 people.\u0026nbspJapan ends state of emergencyJapan\u0027s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, has said the state of emergency will be lifted for all of Japan, and that the country managed to get the spread of the virus under control in under two months.Social distancing curbs were loosened for most of the country on 14 May as new infections fell, but the government has kept Tokyo and four other prefectures under watch.The world\u0027s third-largest economy has escaped an explosive outbreak with more than 16,600 infections and 839 deaths so far, according to NHK public broadcaster.Somerset hospital stops accepting new admissions due to \u0027high number of coronavirus patients\u0027A hospital in Somerset has temporarily stopped accepting new patients due to a high number of patients with coronavirus in the hospital.Weston General Hospital, in Weston-super-Mare, stopped accepting new admissions, including into its A\u0026ampE department, from 8am today.The move is said to be a precautionary measure.Czech bars, restaurants and cafes reopenBars, restaurants and cafes are returning to full service as the government takes further steps to ease restrictions.Establishments can serve customers in interior spaces, and hotels are also reopening together with public swimming pools, wellness centres and saunas.Sports, cultural and other public events for up to 300 people will be allowed, up from the previous 100.Restrictions have been only partially lifted for schools.

Total deaths have passed 4,000.The rise in new cases came as some businesses and travel reopened under a new phase of the national coronavirus lockdown.German death toll reaches 8,250The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany increased by 289 to 178,570, data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases showed today.The reported death toll rose by 10 to 8,257, the data showed.Australia urges people to continue working from homeAustralia\u0027s most populous state has urged people to continue working from home despite schools reopening as the number of coronavirus cases slows.Australia has reported just over 7,100 Covid-19 infections, including 102 deaths, well below figures reported by other developed countries.With fewer than 20 new COVID-19 cases most days, Australian states are pressing ahead with a three-stage plan to remove most social restrictions imposed by July.In New South Wales (NSW), which includes the city of Sydney, children returned to full-time face-to-face learning on Monday, allowing many parents to return to offices - although politicians urged those who could to stay home to avoid putting pressure on the transport network.Greece restarts ferry services and reopens cafes and restaurantsGreece has restarted regular ferry services to its islands while restaurants and bars have reopened as the country attempts to salvage its summer tourism season from the impact of coronavirus.Travel to the islands has mostly been off-limits since a lockdown was imposed in late March, but the country’s low infection rate has prompted the government to start the holiday season earlier than expected.The government\u0026nbspstarted\u0026nbspthe holiday season three weeks earlier than the expected June 15 date, as other Mediterranean countries - including Italy, Spain and Turkey - grapple with deadlier outbreaks.Greece has had nearly 2,900 infections and 171 deaths from the virus, but Italy has seen nearly 33,000 deaths, Spain 29,000 and Turkey 4,340, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University.Social distancing regulations and passenger limits have been imposed on ferries and at restaurants to ward off new infections.State-run health services to combat coronavirus are being expanded to the islands, with intensive care units being placed on five islands - Lesbos, Samos, Rhodes, Zakynthos and Corfu - along with existing facilities on the island of Crete.Good morning and welcome to\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0027s live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Some countries’ emissions dropped by as much as 26 per cent on average during the peak of the confinement.Visualising the biggest carbon crash ever recordedIf pre-pandemic conditions return by mid-June, then 2020 emissions could decline by a more modest 4 per cent compared to 2019, though this would still be the largest single annual decrease in absolute emissions since the end of World War II.A UN report last year said emissions needed to drop by 2.7 per cent a year keep warming well below 2 degrees Celsius, and 7.6 per cent a year to keep below 1.5C.“Population confinement has led to drastic changes in energy use and CO2 emissions,” said lead author Corinne Le Quéré at the University of East Anglia.“These extreme decreases are likely to be temporary, however, as they do not reflect structural changes in the economic, transport, or energy systems,” she added.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailPrevious analysis of data from Carbon Brief and the International Energy Agency revealed the unprecedented scale of the emissions decline.China saw the largest drop in emissions in April, followed by the United States, Europe and India.In the countries with the strictest lockdown restrictions, emissions from aviation plunged 75 per cent in early April, while emissions from land transport fell by 50 per cent and from power generation by 15 per cent.Emissions from industry declined by around 35 per cent, with a lack of data causing some uncertainty. Emissions from residential buildings, however, increased by 5 per cent, the study said.“The emissions reductions occurring because of Covid-19 will clearly be unprecedented. What is less certain is how the economy will rebound in late 2020 and 2021,” said Glen Peters at the CICERO Center for International Climate Research in Norway, which took part in the study.“As different countries and sectors recover, it is unclear if activity levels will return to normal levels or if we may see permanent shifts in behaviour,” he added.The environmental impact of coronavirus containment measures has also led to a huge reduction in air pollution in the form of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) emissions, which are released by cars, aeroplanes and other combustion engines.Satellite images captured by the European Space Agency showed a dramatic decrease in NO2 emissions in 2020 compared to 2019.Additional reporting by agencies.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

I don’t know – we, you and me and lots of others like us have got to keep on going on about it but the clock is ticking.“The danger of the Arctic and the Antarctic warming is becoming greater day by day.”Sir David added: “What the result of coronavirus is going to be I don’t know. But I’m beginning to get a feeling that for the first time the nations of the world are beginning to see that survival depends on co-operation. If that happens, that’s going to be a first in human history.”David Attenborough warns ‘moment of crisis’ on climate change has comeHe also praised climate activist Greta Thunberg, 17, for galvanising the youth and following the science.“I think she’s very remarkable,” he said. “And what is more she is, with all that power, she is nonetheless extremely modest.“She is extremely well informed. But she’s also very modest. And she keeps saying: Look, the only guide has to be the science, we must follow what the science says.”Sir David is the first guest to appear on the podcast about communication and climate change and his episode will be available from Tuesday.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This trend, combined with people\u0027s own changing attitudes toward social events and large gatherings, resulted in travel dropping by more than 50 per cent before the lockdown began, according to requests made on Apple Maps for car and public transport directions.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesRequests on Apple Maps for car directions began to fall on 11 March, while requests for public transport directions began to fall even earlier on 9 March.Many activities and behaviours that were considered normal before coronavirus also remain taboo regardless of the government\u0027s guidelines.The recently relaxed rules mean that cleaners and nannies are now permitted to visit people\u0027s homes, but a recent survey found that the majority of people found this very unacceptable.The poll by Ipsos MORI, which was carried out between 8 and 11 May, also found that having non co-habiting friends, family members or loved ones visit was also considered socially unacceptable.​Public opinion about exercise and driving is more greatly ided, ​though the poll demonstrated that government rules may not be a defining influence on people\u0027s behaviours.Companies\u0027 decisions to keep work from home policies in place show that lockdown measures are not necessarily enforced by government policy decision.The figures also suggest that the impact of coronavirus on travel habits, socialising and other pre-lockdown habits could continue long after lockdown officially ends.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s a question of doing the right thing. It’s not about what you guys think.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesNo 10 have said the visit he made to Durham was  “essential”. In the first official comment since it emerged that the prime minister’s chief adviser had apparently flouted lockdown rules, Downing Street said his actions were “in line” with the guidelines.

His sister and nieces had volunteered to help so he went to a house near to but separate from his extended family in case their help was needed. His sister shopped for the family and left everything outside. At no stage was he or his family spoken to by the police about this matter, as is being reported. His actions were in line with coronavirus guidelines. Mr Cummings believes he behaved reasonably and legally.”Members of the cabinet also defended Mr Cummings.Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, tweeted: “Taking care of your wife and young child is justifiable and reasonable, trying to score political points over it isn’t.” Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, wrote in a similar vein: “It’s reasonable and fair to ask for an explanation on this. And it has been provided: two parents with Coronavirus, were anxiously taking care of their young child. Those now seeking to politicise it should take a long hard look in the mirror.”Michael Gove, the cabinet office minister, added: “Caring for your wife and child is not a crime.” Opposition politicians have accused No 10 of a ‘cover up’ after reports some in Downing Street knew Mr Cummings had made the 260-mile journey during lockdown.Labour have called on Boris  Johnson to say whether or not he sanctioned the trip.  SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford said that Mr Johnson had questions to answer  and should fire his chief adviser immediately.

He called on Mr Johnson to state publicly if he believed Mr Cummings had adhered to the rules. “It’s clearly a matter of public interest - lockdown has been heartbreaking for so many families,  this looks like one rule for those at the centre of government and one rule for everyone else,” he said.  The details of Mr Cumming’s trip were revealed by the Daily Mirror and the . A neighbour told the papers Mr Cummings was seen in the garden, while Abba\u0027s Dancing Queen was playing loudly. Durham police confirmed officers had spoken to the owners of an address after reports a person had travelled there from London.A spokesman said: On Tuesday, March 31, our officers were made aware of reports that an inidual had travelled from London to Durham and was present at an address in the city.Officers made contact with the owners of that address who confirmed that the inidual in question was present and was self-isolating in part of the house.In line with national policing guidance, officers explained to the family the arrangements around self-isolation guidelines and reiterated the appropriate advice around essential travel.Senior members of Mr Johnson’s own party expressed concern Mr Cumming’s journey could endanger the government’s plans to lift the lockdown. Former Tory cabinet minister  David Lidington, Theresa May’s de facto deputy prime minister, told Newsnight: There\u0027s clearly serious questions that No 10 are going to have to address, not least because the readiness of members of the public to follow government guidance more generally is going to be affected by this sort of story.Professor Neil Ferguson, the epidemiologist whose modelling prompted the lockdown, quit as a government adviser for flouting the rules when he was visited at this home by his girlfriend. At the time Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said he was speechless and said he backed any police action against Mr Ferguson.Sir Ed Davey, acting leader of the Liberal Democrats, called for Mr Cummings to quit over the allegations, while a spokesman for Labour said: The British people do not expect there to be one rule for them and another rule for Dominic Cummings.He told the BBC Mr Johnson had serious questions to answer. “Did he sanction this? Did he say “this is ok”?”Allies of Mr Cummings said he was  not “remotely bothered” by the story, calling it “fake news”. There is zero chance of him resigning.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

There is no mixing and they aren’t touching each other,” Laurent David, the headteacher of the school near Nantes, tells The Independent. Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“They aren’t wearing masks, but they are following the orders very well, like using hand gel.” The students – aged between five and 11 years old – are experiencing school during the time of coronavirus. ​Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?As countries hit by coronavirus start making the first steps back towards normal life, children are returning to the classroom and parents back to work.In England, schools have been told to prepare for certain years to come back from 1 June, with the aim of all primary schools students returning for a month before the summer – a move which has faced criticism from unions and councils over safety concerns. Meanwhile in France, which has also been badly-affected by Covid-19, children were allowed back to school last week.Mr David says the Ecole elementaire la Metairie started teaching pupils aged five to 11 in school again on 12 May.“In the morning, we are bringing in around half of these children,” he says. “And during the afternoon, we are looking after the children who have stayed at home by doing distance teaching.”However, he says schools were under no obligation to open, and the Ecole elementaire la Metairie asked parents for their opinion first.

This should be reduced to 10 for the youngest pupils in France. Although things have been going well, it gets much harder trying to get younger children to socially distance, Mr David explains. That is why lots of schools – including the preschool attached to his primary – have not yet brought children younger than five years old back into the classroom.He says other places have been bringing children back on alternate days, or even alternate weeks.“No school is working in the same way. The problem with making a six-year-old do a full day when they must stay at a table without moving around, is that becomes a very long day from them.”Mr David adds: “That makes teaching conditions very bad. Because of that, we decided to just open for mornings. It makes it easier, more effective for students, and more bearable.”However, he says it was difficult to balance the parents’ needs who were eager to return to work full time. He adds that schools have to follow health safety guidelines given to every headteacher, and the Ecole elementaire la Metairie​ decided the best way they could open safely was to offer half days for now. Included in the guidelines is what to do if a child displays symptoms: call the parents straight away, and get them tested.Last Thursday, a child from the primary school near Nantes had to be taken home after falling ill and is waiting for their test results.“If it is really coronavirus, we may have to shut the school or send a class home,“We don’t have any problem doing that,” he adds.France allowed preschools and primary schools to reopen from the start of last week, with secondary schools allowed to gradually welcome students back from 18 May – although these older students must wear face masks. ‘I don’t know’: Minister admits schools reopening up in the airMinisters under pressure to scrap plans to open schools to more pupilsParents also have the right to keep their children at home if they wish.When asked what advice Mr David had for headteachers in England working to reopen schools next month, he says it is important to be “well-prepared”.“It took us two weeks to prepare properly,” he says, adding they were ready to open on the first day.“The most important thing is to make decisions as early as possible.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

I can announce our intention to go ahead with that as planned on June  - a week on Monday, he added.We then intend from June  for secondary schools to provide some contact for year  and  students to help them prepare for exams next year.Up to a quarter of older students will attend schools at any one time, the Prime Minister said, adding: Were taking a deliberately cautious approach after a very constructive period of consultation.He said full social distancing may not be possible.However, plans to keep children separate include smaller class sizes, keeping pupils in smaller groups, staggered break and lunchtimes, as well as drop-offs and pick-ups, and increased cleaning.The Department for Education has published detailed guidance on the issue, he added.Progress is conditional and provisional he said, insisting that we must all remember the basics, like washing hands and maintaining social distancing.We are beating this thing, but we will beat it all the fasterwe stay alert, control the virus and save lives, he said.What we will do is make sure that we stagger things and we pace things and we work directly with you, with local authorities, to make sure that there is a plan, he said.Teaching unions are opposed to the Governments plan to re-open schools on June , claiming teachers, pupils and their families will be at risk of catching the deadly virus.The National Education Union slammed the school plan as reckless and warned infection rates were still too high.The union advised members to tell headteachers they were “[awaiting] further advice from [their] union”.More than , schools have now refused to open on June .Some local authorities, especially in the north of England, have advised their schools to stay closed on that date.Doctors also said it was too risky to reopen schools on June  - however The British Medical Association, which represents doctors, has since dropped its hardline opposition to reopening.Dame Angela McLean, the deputy chief scientic adviser, said an effective track and trace system was needed to isolate those infected by the coronavirus before changes were made to lockdown rules.She told The Times that this should be based on observed levels of infection . . . and not on a fixed date.And scientist John Edmunds, another member of SAGE, told Sky News that a track and trace system must be embedded and working well before schools re-opened.An exclusive investigation by The Sun revealed at least  councils have warned schools under their control could stay shut.Analysis by The Sun found the local authorities cover , primaries.The best way to checkyour school will be open is to stay in contact with them directly by checking their website.Reception, year one and year six are set to be the first year groups toto schools after June .The Department for Education issued guidelines on May  on how schools should enforce social distancing - including limiting class sizes to  students.The main points areBut union boss Kevin Courtney tweeted on May : Education unions intend to work together.Dont engage with planning a June stto wider opening - await further union advice.Meanwhile, General Secretary of The National Association for Head Teachers Paul Whiteman told the Education Select Committee: If social distancing is as we understand it now - the two metre rule to be applied in schools - there are very many schools that are saying it is simply impossible to achieve.He said making sure younger year groups stay at least two metres apart from each other and their teachers and practice good hygiene such as hand washing will be particularly dficult. Schools have been closed since March  - three days before the Prime Minister announced a nationwide lockdown.Schools are told to stagger lunch and break times, as well as drop-off and pick-up times, to reduce the number of pupils moving around at once.It also said schools should look at bringing in a one-way system in corridors, or putting a ider in the middle to control the flow of kids.Institutions are advised to remove all soft toys or any toys that are hard to clean.Ministers admitted they cannot keep kids two metres away from each other all day, so each class will form a self-contained bubble so they dont mix with other kids at the schools.For secondary schools and colleges, classes will be halved, the government said.That means that classrooms and workshops will be rearranged with sitting positions two metres apart.Where very small classes might result from halving, it would be acceptable to have more than half in a class, provided the space has been rearranged.Support staff may be drawn on in the event there are teacher shortages, the advice added.Williamson saidscientic advice proposed a limited number of children could be sent back to school, it was his duty to allow this to happen.BURYNo has also confirmed that parents would not be finedthey chose to keep their kids at home over concerns for their safety.A spokesman for No said: While we will not penalise [parents] for keeping children at home, once children are eligible toto school we will strongly encourage them to do so.Dr Bousted urged the Government to meet tests set out by unions, which includes extra money for deep cleaning and personal protective equipment and local powers to close schoolsclusters of infections break out.Health Secretary Matt Hancock said on May  it was completely natural for parents to worry about sending their kids back to school. No has also confirmed that parents would not be finedthey chose to keep their kids at home over concerns for their safety.ltgtOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In London, there are few new cases, and other regions can be expected to follow the same trend.Yet still we proceed with glacial speed towards a tentative easing an agonising ten days away.Is it likely, in that context, that the Government would take a dangerous punt on teachers’ safety, as unions suggest  No.And Sage’s advice, published tomorrow, says they will be at no greater risk back in class than any key worker.It suits the Left to paint the Tories as rash, callous and indferent to evidence.The opposite seems to be true, to a fault.BORIS Johnson has done the right thing lting the NHS charge for migrant health and care workers.It was unjust that they had to find hundreds of pounds to use the very system in which they work.No one knows better than Boris the vital role they’re performing.And it is a mark of strong leadership, especially in a fast-moving crisis, to be able to admit you were wrong and change course.But the surcharge must continue to apply for workers in other sectors.It curtails health tourism and offsets the cost of treatment . . . and still should.WE understand Rishi Sunak’s fears that the self-employed bailout is ripe for fraud — and his reluctance to extend it.But fair’s fair.The Government cannot shut millions of businesses, then not fully support them.That is a disaster morally, economically and politically.Employees have been seen right.Cut off the cash to self-starters, though, and the lockdown will crumble in minutes.WE asked how Steve Coogan could defend claiming taxpayers’ money for his ­furloughed staff.Turns out he couldn’t.Instead he bleated that he was targeted because of his anti-Press campaign.Rubbish. Coogan is cashing in on a scheme meant to save jobs, not to keep his fortune intact.The public interest in that story could not be more obvious.As for his zeal to “reform” the Press, it is entirely self-serving:To prevent it exposing grasping multi-millionaires like him.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But hang on a minute.Are we absolutely certain it’s going to be completely safe by then  Not just for all the daytrippers and holidaymakers, but for the people who are lucky enough to live in the most scenic and glorious parts of our country.I know a lot of businesses are struggling — especially hotels, BBs, restaurants, and tourist attractions — and they desperately need an influx of visitors in order to survive.But that has to be weighed up against the safety and well-being of local people.It’s especially true in areas relatively free from Covid-.A surge of tourists could have the same sort of catastrophic effect that befell the Incas, Native Americans and tribes in the Caribbean who were decimated by disease when Europeans first arrived on their shores.The last thing we want to do is further spread this cruel virus and create a second wave that engulfs our NHS.It would mean all of our efforts staying at home and being so careful about handwashing and social-distancing would have been for nought.No one wants to see the emergency Nightingale and Louisa Jordan hospitals actually being used to anywhere near capacity.And our vulnerable care homes must not experience more deaths.I’d rather exercise caution and put off any holiday plans until we have this properly under control — hopefully just a few weeks longer.I’ve been very dismayed this week at the way everyone seems to have let their guard down.Social-distancing is nowhere near as stringent, and people are drting into pre-Covid behaviour.Of course we need to get back to some sort of “new normal” but I think this has to be done with baby steps.The hordes of sun-worshippers on crowded beaches on the south coast of England, large groups of friends enjoying picnics and teenagers gathering in big numbers to have a booze-up are a recipe for utter disaster.There’s nothing I would enjoy more than being able to go on my annual trip to Orkney, which was of course put on hold earlier this year.It’s one of the highlights of my year and I can feel the stress oozing out of my body when I set foot on this glorious part of the world.The welcome is warm, the food is enticing, the local gin and whisky are things of beauty and just breathing in the fresh air on those coastal walks is a joy.I’d go back this second, but onlythe people of Orkney want me there, and onlyit’s safe to do so.Again it comes down to having clear, no-nonsense, unfudged information.It’s not good enough just to tell us all to be “alert”.I need someone in charge who is trustworthy to tell me that visiting a UK tourist destination this summer will be safe for all concerned.I desperately want to support our tourist industry and I think most of us will be staying at home this year and exploring attractions closer to home.Our Good Morning Britain GP, Dr Hilary, who has been the nation’s voice of reason during this whole crisis, has said he would not be comfortable taking a flight any time soon and I have to agree.I know the aviation industry is in deep trouble, but I don’t see how you can stay socially distanced on a plane, and personally I’d rather err on the side of caution.I feel desperately sorry for families who have booked their summer hols abroad and are now waiting to seethey will go ahead without the prospect of having to quarantine on arrival.They also need clear direction from the Governmentthey have to apply for refunds on their hard-earned deposits or air tickets.None of us wants to be part of the problem, and we need to do everything we possibly can to stop that dreaded second wave.We just need more clarity before we throw caution to the wind.ONE of the joys of social media at the moment is “singing policeman” Tim Jones, who has been posting videos of himself belting out musical theatre songs in his squad car.Tim, from Gloucester, was overwhelmed by the reaction to his rendition of Rocky Horror Show classic Sweet Transvestite, which received more than four million hits and a fan message from US actress Susan Sarandon, who starred in the movie version.Tim started posting the songs to cheer himself up because he was missing his kids during lockdown and wasn’t in a good place

celebrate step-daughter Isla’s th birthday and showed what a close and loving relation- ship the family enjoys.Husband Frank, the Cha football manager, has two daughters, Isla with Christine – and -year-old Luna, from his previous relationship, as well as -month-old toddler Patricia with Christine.Christine has forged a close bond with the girls.She’s never tried to be a second mother to them, but a sort of big sister and a good friend – and she’s got it spot on.Even though it’s not easy for any teenager to have such a special birthday in lockdown, Isla clearly had a very happy day with her family, and right now that’s what’s most important.I will be doing my ITV show from am every morning as usual and I want to say thanks for all your kind messages about the show and also all of your feedback on this column.I really appreciate you all getting in touch.See you Monday at am on ITV and here next Saturday as usual.WE have seen the best of people during this crisis.Our frontline workers have been heroic, as have staff in public transport and those emptying our bins.The amount of money raised for the NHS – from tiny tots to OAPs – has been humbling.Captain Tom Moore, who was made an honorary colonel to mark his th birthday, is quite rightly being knighted for his efforts.Not only did he raise £million, he also lted our spirits.Then we have -year-old Dabirul Choudhury, who walked  laps of his garden during Ramadan.This wonderful man has raised £, for those affected by coronavirus both here and in Bangladesh.There’s also -year-old Margaret Payne, who is more than halfway through her challenge of “climbing Scottish mountain Suilven” by going up and down the stairs at her home.She’s already raised well over £, for the NHS, Highland Hospice and RNLI.Sadly, it’s this admirable generation that has been thrown under the bus.Far too many elderly people were sent home from hospital and into care homes to “unblock beds” in preparation for Covid- patients.Crucially, they weren’t tested for the virus, which spread like wildfire in care homes from the Isle of Skye to Brighton, causing patients to die well before their time.Care home workers in particular have been astonishingly brave and resilient, and some have paid with their lives.Their sacrices must never be forgotten.Yet while we see the very best in humanity, this crisis has also brought out the very worst.I’m distraught and angry to learn that more than  NHS workers and police officers have been attacked during lockdown.This includes thugs spitting at and trying to bite frontline workers, and NHS grafters being assaulted by yobs trying to steal their ID cards to use for store discounts.It’s hard to imagine the sort of despicable low-le cretin who would resort to such crimes, especially against those trying to help us through the pandemic.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I therefore switched to red wine, which meant that by nine in the evening my face was in the bouillabaisse.So I alighted on rosé and I’ve never looked back.A lot of people think it can only be drunk at lunchtime on a hot summer’s day. This is ­nonsense.It also works well when it’s raining, foggy, windy, drizzling, cloudy or cold.I’ve drunk rosé on Bonfire Night and Christmas Day. I even took a case to the North Pole.This really is a wine for all occasions.It goes perfectly not just with avocado and salad but also with meat, fish, curry, pasta and cornflakes.Some call it lady ­petrol, saying it’s a girls’ drink. They reckon it’s just Sarah Jessica Parker in a bottle.But that’s not so. Brad Pitt loves it. And the best sort is Léoube. Which is made by the family that also makes JCB diggers. So there you are. Real men drink pink.And it’s easy to see why.You can spend hours a day in the gym trying to change the shape of your body.It hurts, it makes you sweaty and the results are a long time coming.Whereasyou have just three large glasses of rosé in the evening, which is not hard work, your body will change shape in no time at all.And don’t forget thatyou drink rosé, wine enthusiasts won’t bore you to death about the claret they had last night and how it had high notes of hot handbags in a Bovril factory.They will assume you aren’t interested in wine at all. Which you’re not, because you’ll happily put ice in it.Rosé may look like wine and smell like wine, and it may come in a wine bottle, but there’s no snobbishness to it.It’s just something you drink because you want to feel happy.Six weeks ago, Andy Wilman, who’s my oldest friend and the producer of The Grand Tour, was struck down by coronavirus.Happily, he recovered without having to go to hospital, but he was never back up to full speed before the virus came again.So the next time a family from Keswick comes to London to see a show, let’s tell them to bugger off back to where they came from.Bad news. The future of BBC is in doubt, which means I could be about to lose my favourite lockdown TV show – The Joy Of Painting, with Bob Ross.Filmed in old-fashioned square format, it’s hosted by a man who died  years ago. So we are not talking cutting-edge television here.What you get is a man with Art Garfunkel hair and a Bill Oddie beard who sits there in what look suspiciously like Brutus jeans, painting a picture. That’s it.He has the sort of voice hypnotists use when they are trying to get you to give up smoking, which means you are quickly lulled into a deep, drooling stupor.After five minutes, his picture is starting to take shape and I guarantee you’ll think what I always think – “I could do that”.Five minutes later you’ll be thinking, “I should do that”. And the next thing you know, you’re on Amazon, ordering an easel.This is a big mistake, as painting is much harder than it looks. A point that becomes glaringly obvious as the show goes on.After  minutes he’s always created a pretty good scene but every- thing he adds after that always ruins it a bit until, when the show ends after half an hour, the final result is so bad you have to bite the back of your hand to stop yourself guffawing.It’s the best and funniest thing on TV right now.

We won’t think she’s been gallivanting around on her rabbit.The best-selling car in Britain last month was the battery-powered Tesla .Yup, it beat the Ford Fiesta and all the other usual suspects, and you’ll probably see this as proof that at long last the electric car revolution is starting to happen.Hmmm. I reckon the reason is simpler. To buy a car in the middle of a lockdown you have to be mad.Am I suggesting that you have to be mad to buy a Tesla Well, let’s examine the evidence. I know only two people who have one. James May and Richard Hammond.We learned this week that when the intensely boring sport of cricket resumes, bowlers will no longer be able to use their saliva to make the ball do weird things as it heads towards the batsman.We’ve also heard that footballers will not be allowed to spit, and we assume that boxers will have to dance about, not spraying sweat all over the place as they maintain a two-metre distance.All of which makes me wonder, how is anyone ever going to make a porn film Stars of the industry say Covid- has forced them to shoot their own scenes and do their own editing.

The shock will come when that scheme ends, bringing a new wave of unemployment — predicted by some to be in double digits by the end of the year.As a result, the tax that we rely on to pay for essential public ­services such as the NHS, police, teachers and even MPs dwindles catastrophically.This will put a colossal strain on government funds. One result will be a reduction in finance for public services — and never-ending cuts.The gloomiest assessment of our future is that we don’t need to worry about whether restaurants will reopen, or fear airlines going bust, because we won’t be able to afford to eat out or holiday anywhere.We will be working hard to stand still, which is a rotten position to be in.At the moment, the Government is paying the wages of ten million ­people and giving them loans to survive. That was and is the right thing to do.But the cost to the public — ­estimated to be £BILLION this year — will be vast. And it’s growing all the time.Whichever way you look at it, with lockdown we have swallowed a very poisonous pill. In fact, it may go down in history as the greatest act of self-harm any civilisation has ever inflicted upon itself.Yes, it has saved some people, although not enough of the elderly living in care homes.But we have created a financial burden on the country that will last a generation. The economy is in freefall. It contracted . per cent in March, which is the biggest decline on record. Forget a recession — some say we face a depression.Usually this means higher public borrowing, higher taxes and an end to triple-lock pensions.Whatever happens, let’s just say that Boris Johnson’s election pledge not to raise income tax, National Insurance contributions or VAT for five years is on thin ice.Butthe Government tries to cover this exceptional cost from the current economy we will crash — and we will all be worse off.Rather than start taxing everyone to the hilt, I can see a better solution — with interest rates at rock bottom levels, theGovernment should borrow the money instead, becausetaxes rise too quickly it will halt growth. And growth in the economy is the single most important step to recovery.So we need to borrow, and spread the debt over a long period of  to  years, like the old wartime bonds, to cover the short-term shortfall. If we borrow over a long enough period we could actually increase spending in the short term to incentivise growth.Andwe bounce back, we can pay off our debt more quickly.We just need to get out of lockdown to get this process started.Shops and businesses must open up and start trading again. And we have to get the schools open.People cannot worktheir kids are not in school or in high-quality childcare.If trains and buses are too crowded for people to get to work, we have to find other ways to travel, or work from homewe can.But, perhaps most importantly, we have to accept that this virus is here and it’s not going away.We have to protect the most vulnerable, and those at risk should remain in lockdown for their own safety.The rest of us must take responsibility for ourselves. We need to keep social distance, wear facemasks, wash our hands and stay at homewe have symptoms. We must not take risks.But the quicker people get back to work, the more the recession can be moderated — and we all have a part to play in that.AS proposals go, the one by the man who set out five sausages like fingers on a plate, with his grandmother’s ring on the fourth one, could have been more romantic.Although he also wrote, “Will you marry me ” in HP Sauce on some toast.Presumably this man understands his girlfriend well enough to know what she likes.And when she stopped laughing, I’m guessing she probably said yes.After all, it’s the thought that counts.THIS week, something wonderful happened.It was announced that Captain Tom Moore will be awarded a knighthood after raising a remarkable £million for NHS charities.Cpt Tom, who just turned  and has been promoted to honorary colonel, said on Good Morning Britain he is “thrilled that Her Majesty has chosen poor little me to be knighted”, adding: “It really is a great honour and something I never ever anticipated.“It never, ever entered my head that something like that could happen to me.”But this genuinely could not be more well-deserved.With all the misery we have had to endure over the past few months, this is a little ray of sunshine.Bravo again, Sir Tom.DID anyone  get the giggles at this picture, right, of the Russian nurse wearing only her undies beneath a transparent protective gown Hospital chiefs were not amused and ­punished the nurse for “non- compliance with the requirements for medical clothing”.ONE of the many revelations of lockdown is what a dferent place the House of Commons is without most MPs being there in person.There are far fewer places for people to hide without the armies of grown men and women braying and shouting over each other.As a result, a new type of order is prevailing.The Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, actually threatened to kick out Health Secretary Matt Hancock after he interrupted Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer at Prime Minister’s Questions.Hoyle treated Matt Hancock like a naughty schoolboy – which doesn’t feel right.But respect is earned and should be mutual.Perhaps one silver lining of lockdown will be a more respectful atmosphere in the Commons.I’VE been reflecting this week on what I’ve learned during the pandemic.Yes, I could share my theories here about human kindness and human idiocy, both of which have been on display in abundance over the past couple of months.Many of us have had time to think about what really matters and what doesn’t.We probably all have a mental list of things we most value from the “old” le, as well as silver linings and the benefits of the new way we have been living.But as we enter the ninth week of lockdownmy main conclusion, after a good deal of thought, is this: Women really do have superpowers.Most of the women I know are managing to . . . work from home, look after and home-school their children, cook and clean, shop for essentials, provide entertainment and keep up their family’s spirits, clap for carers and of course bake banana bread once a week.Now that’s what I call multi-tasking.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Juggling my work with that of four daughters aged six to  is a challenge. We’re the lucky ones, too, with plenty of space, devices, and so on.Many families don’t have these advantages, and so their children face an uphill struggle to keep up with those who do. Right now millions of kids are falling behind their advantaged classmates, for reasons completely out of their control, and in spite of their parents’ best efforts.The past decade has seen good progress in closing the learning gap between children. Common sense reforms have allowed all kids to benefit from better discipline, richer curriculums, and tougher exams, but those from more deprived backgrounds have benefitted most.However, the coronavirus crisis is putting these gains and more at risk, even though our teachers have performed near-miracles during lockdown.With minimal warning and no extra money, they went from educating and safeguarding millions of children in classrooms to doing so remotely.They did all this while keeping schools open to children at risk and those of key workers, and looking after their own children at home too! We should all be immensely proud of this.Nothing beats being in a class with a great teacher, though. It’s why I’m so keen that kids get back to school as soon as possible, and for the teaching unions to stop blocking this.It’s also why I love the idea of catch-up summer schools during the summer holidays.I can think of loads of reasons why dferent children would benefit from being in school for some or all of the holiday period. Some might need academic support in key subjects. Others might have faced particular traumas during lockdown and need pastoral support or counselling.It could be as simple as wanting to get back into some kind of routine with familiar faces outside of their immediate family. And of course, having access to summer school would make it easier for many families to get in or back to work as we kickstart the economy in this strange new world.Butwe’re going to make it all work we must use our common sense. We should keep things optional, flexible, and fully-funded.It must be optional for teachers and pupils. Staff have been busier than ever. Kids and their families will want to enjoy any freedoms from lockdown by then. A decent break is vital to ensure everyone is refreshed for a challenging start to the school year in September.However I’m confident though that there will still be enough staff - and community volunteers - for summer catch-up. And schools are perfectly placed to get in the kids who need it most.But we shouldn’t expect it to run like normal school. These are not normal times and we won’t have all the usual staff to hand. We have to work around these, and the needs of the children that come in.And that’s why it must be properly funded by the government. If it’s worth doing, it’s worth doing well, and asking people to give up their summer to pull together something of quality will cost.Get it right though, and catch-up summer schools could make all the dference to kids and families in a time of need. It would also be another great example of the dference schools can make when times are tough.Where can I sign up !To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Mr Johnson wants to salvage the summer for families confined for the past nine weeks.And he is keen to make the countryside accessible again — but in “slow steps”.A senior Government source said: “It is clear from the scientic evidence that the rate of infection is much less likely outdoors. The combination of fresh air and sunshine are bad for the virus but they make it safer for everyone.“So we are looking at opening up the outdoors.

But Chancellor Rishi Sunak has voiced frustration over the pace of the unlocking.He is increasingly anxious about the damage from the lack of economic activity and the cost of furloughing workers.Mr Sunak suggested to Tory MPs in a conference call that the PM was being too cautious, saying said: “Somehow Greece and Italy are opening up. This country can’t be the only place where people can’t go and have a drink in the pub.”But Mr Johnson is unlikely to give the all-clear to pubs and restaurants this week.He is considering letting outdoor cafes resume business with strict limits on table spacing and numbers.

Iran, for example, has deployed a similar strategy.For years, we have known China censors what its people read and say online. Now we know authorities began censoring keywords and discussion of the outbreak weeks before its severity was acknowledged.Already in late December, doctors in Wuhan began to see patients suffering from an unusual pneumonia.Dr Li Wenliang,  who reported it to colleagues, was forced by police to sign a confession denouncing his communication as “illegal behaviour”.Dr Li later “died of the outbreak”.A number of critical journalists then went missing, along with Ren Zhiqiang, a well-known property tycoon critical of the regime.A month after his disappearance, China announced his official detention and investigation.Beijing is now saying that it will allow the WHO to visit for an investigation — but “not yet”.So how should we deal with China going forwards — especially since an inept, repressive officialdom has responded to international criticism with an aggressive misinformation campaign, completely misjudging the mood around the world China, as the world’s second-biggest economy, will remain an important export market for our goods and services.Even the Trump administration in the US does not want to close off a lucrative market for American farmers.It needs to abide by global rulesAs Trade Secretary, I tried to build a constructive relationship with my Chinese counterparts to help our businesses sell more to them and support jobs here.ButChina wants to be a partner in the global trading system, it needs to abide by global rules.This will be a major challenge as we face the inevitable task of reforming the World Trade Organization. When it comes to our national security, as The Sun on Sunday so clearly set out in recent weeks, we cannot afford to have it linked to other economic or political considerations.That is why I, along with a number of fellow MPs, voted against the Government’s plans to include Chinese tech firm Huawei in our G data network.China is at a crossroads and needs to decide whether it truly wants to become a partner in the global community or take the path to becoming a pariah state.That choice is in their hands.

However, the officer did provide advice in relation to security issues.”Earlier No had denied that police had spoken to anyone in Cummings family.After being backed by No, Mr Cummings told reporters outside his home in London: I behaved reasonably and legally.Askedhis trip to Durham during lockdown looked good,  he added: “Who cares about good looks  It’s a question of doing the right thing. It’s not about what you guys think.”An official statement from Downing Street said Cummings didnt break government guidance because he and his we, journalist Mary Wakefield, stayed in a dferent building.Opposition politicians have called for the -year-old to resign or be sacked.His actions go against government advice, which became law on March , which stated: “You should not be visiting family members who do not live in your home.”Only in exceptional circumstances were people allowed to attend relatives addresses for example, to drop off food or medicine to their door.A YouGov poll found that  per cent of voters think Mr Cummings broke lockdown rules, while just  per cent disagreed.And a majority of those questioned,  per cent, they think the PMs top aide should resign because of the scandal.No :Owing to his we being infected with suspected coronavirus and the high likelihood that he would himself become unwell, it was essential for Dominic Cummings to ensure his young child could be properly cared for.His sister and nieces had volunteered to help so he went to a house near to but separate from his extended family in case their help was needed.His sister shopped for the family and left everything outside.At no stage was he or his family spoken to by the police about this matter, as is being reported.His actions were in line with coronavirus guidelines.

This is my le-dream, to wear a bin bag.“I achieved a lot in my le and this is definitely on top of the list.”Aniko now lives in a £-per-week three-bed caravan she shares with five others.It’s a far cry from her £-a-month rented luxury garden pad in the capital.But she was so determined to work on a farm, that she applied to scores of jobs as a produce picker.Aniko said: “I applied through many, many websites. I went through all the big recruitment agencies.“I filled out tonnes of applications. I even had a spreadsheet so I could keep track of how many places and where I had applied.“I started the journey with two friends – who I call my ‘Covid Land Army’ or the ‘Strawberry Team’.“We originally wanted to do strawberry picking but soon enough we found out that only starts later, like the end of May or June and we wanted to start as soon as possible.“What really motivated me is to feed the nation and I’d read many articles about how crops will go to wastewe don’t pick them.”Aniko started her new minimum wage role on UK Labour Day – May  - and now earns in a month what she was previously earning a day.She continued: “It seemed like a good idea to also get back to ‘normal’ le and do something good with my time.“We get paid minimum wage which is £. per hour and working hours are so dferent.“It depends on the order from the supermarkets and on the asparagus itself due to the weather.“So it can be anything from a five hour to a ten hour day.“Picking beans or fruit is better because they pay after how much you have picked.“So that means that pickers can make about £ and £ a month.“As asparagus pickers we are only making about £,.“In my normal job, that would be a day rate but I have to adapt to the ‘normal’ now and just swallow my pride and get on with it.”The  ft  blonde beauty went on to describe the fast-pace and hard work her new role entails: “When working in the grading house, they have seven machines – or ‘lines’ as we call them.“Imagine this like a machine gun shooting asparagus at you with the speed of light.“We have to pick a bunch up and grade them into ten dferent boxes, from extra fine, to jumbo and rubbish.“Sometimes I feel like I’m in a war zone. If I just turn for five seconds, when I’m back in my little tube, it’s full again.“Sometimes it’s so much asparagus-volcano flying at you that we have five of the best people grading like little robots.“I have learned so much about farming. I learned that asparagus grows in a day…you could actually watch it grow in front of your eyes.“If it’s picked a day late, then it’s all rubbish.“We all know thatthe asparagus is too flowery, that we are going to have a very long and hard day.“I never imagined this is how we grade vegetables and fruit.”The Hungarian-born model - who has lived in the UK for eleven years - has been amazed at how much we waste.She said: “It has opened my eyes and made me realise how much we actually, first of all, waste.“We throw out so much just because it has a curve in them and when we go to the shops and pick up a bunch of asparagus, we still judge them andwe don’t like it, we put it back, which is so crazy because all these veggies have been graded by hand.“It’s crazy to think about how picky we are.“Also, I will definitely wash my fruit and veg once I take them home.”She now dons a p blue hair net and gloves instead of being paid thousands to be snapped in lingerie worth hundreds of pounds.She went on to describe her new unorm: “We have to wear this blue jacket and hair net.

So are infections. The “R” rate, a virtually meaningless average distorted by care homes and hospitals, will be at or near zero in many places. One in  has the virus.Politicians and scientists are of course terried of causing new deaths. But over-caution could do so too, by impoverishing millions. Nothing is risk-free.Boris must get us out of lockdown fast — and ram home the dire effects of refusing to do so. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Secret meetings, coded messages, real cloak-and-dagger stuff.“A big part of the MI operation was sending secret items to troops in occupied territories.“Useful items like maps, compasses and even secret orders – anything to help them escape or evade capture.“Very often these items were ‘normal’ items that were sent in aid packages to camps, and the way items were secreted was very often ingenious.“It’s a unique collection, I’ve never seen another like it. These items are rare, really rare, near impossible to find, so to have an entire collection of them is certainly very special indeed.”The sale also includes two dominoes which, once pulled apart, reveal a small section of map. “These were likely sent as a full set,’ adds Andrew. He adds: “Once they had all been pulled apart, they would likely have a complete map of France to England, or similar.“German prison camp officials wouldn’t think twice that an innocent set of dominoes could do harm, but how wrong they were.“You can almost picture some RAF officers in their hut pulling apart these dominoes and planning their escape. It’s incredible stuff, both frightening and exhilarating at the same time.”The craftily concealed spy tools also include a box of matches which hide a secret compass in the base, a miniature spy camera, a miniature radio, and even a specially magnetised razor blade compass.Andrew said: “These items are very special. They highlight not only the ingenuity of the time, but also the desperation.“People successfully made it back to Britain because of these items.“These objects saved lives. It’s really humbling and a perfect example of finding little ways to help those in need. They are quintessentially British.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Its not about what you guys think.Dominic Cummings has so far had the complete backing from Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his fellow senior ministers.Mr Johnson said in Sundays press briefing: Ive concluded that in travelling to find the right kind of childcare, at the moment when he and his we were about to be incapacitated by coronavirus and when he had no alternative, I think he followed the instincts of every father and every parent.Other Tory politicians backed the Prime Ministers senior adviser on Twitter, including Chancellor of Exchequer Rishi Sunak and Health Secretary Matt Hancock.The Prime Minister had already given his backing to Mr Cummings in an official statement from Downing Street on Friday.A No spokesperson said: Owing to his we being infected with suspected coronavirus and the high likelihood that he would himself become unwell, it was essential for Dominic Cummings to ensure his young child could be properly cared for.His sister and nieces had volunteered to help so he went to a house near to but separate from his extended family in case their help was needed.His sister shopped for the family and left everything outside. His actions were in line with coronavirus guidelines.

Chris Murphy , , who lives alone, says the charity has kept him in touch with friends during this dficult time. He explained: The centre has been bringing me a food parcel every week. They stop for a chat when it’s delivered and phone to check I’m okay. I love working in my garden so they’ve sent me bits for that, and there’s also been activity packs and books I’ve borrowed from them. It’s all keeping me busy! It’s great that people are playing The National Lottery and helping us.

The charity helps families and vulnerable, older people, with everything from weekly food parcels to organising bingo nights and quizzes.  Jean Jonesis someone who benefits regularly from their work. The -year-old said: I’ve been going to events including bingo at Twyn Community Hub since moving here nearly six years ago, and throughout lockdown staff and volunteers have been popping round most days to deliver food, and have a chat. I’m lucky in that I phone friends and family, but other older people in the area would see no one otherwise. The meals and food they provide are fabulous. Being able to take away the worry about small, practical, everyday things is so important. Thanks to people playing The National Lottery that is happening right here in our local area. Itaposs thanks to National Lottery players, as well as the people who run these vital services, that these sorts of charities and local projects have been able to continue offering support to the most vulnerable people in our communities.

Boris Johnson had offered his full support to his under-fire chief adviser after it emerged Mr Cummings had travelled  miles to Country Durham despite strict restrictions at the time not to journey long distances. Mr Cummings, in a statement issued through Number , said he travelled to be close to family to seek help looking after his four-year-old child after his we became ill with coronavirus symptoms.

He had travelled while his we was infected putting other peoplesapos health at risk and apparently broken the law. One rule for us, another for friends of the Prime Minister.

Boris Johnsonaposs most senior aide has been marred in controversy this weekend after the Mirror andrevealed he had driven more than  miles up north to visit his parents while infected with Covid-. The trip, which Mr Cummings claimed was taken so he could secure childcare for his son, was a clear breach of lockdown rules. On March , Johnson said his aide was self-isolating at home with coronavirus symptoms. However, police spoke to Mr Cummingsapos family on the same day and they confirmed he was self-isolating in their farm house. Durham Constabulary said: On March , our officers were made aware of reports that an inidual had travelled from London to Durham and was present at an address in the city. Now his mother has confirmed that his uncle, Lord Justice Laws, died in London on April  - the same day he was first spotted in his parentsapos garden at their house in Durham. Did you see Dominic Cummings in Durham  Email webnews@mirror   The jurist, who stepped down from the Court of Appeal in , died with Covid- having already been in hospital. There were also reported sightings of Cummings at Barnard Castle on April  and in Houghall Woods on April , between which he was back in London. Morag, Mr Cummingsapos mother, told The NewStatesman: “You know, we have been a grieving family and there’s been no recognition of that, and I wish reporters would be cognisant of that fact. “Palm Sunday was the day that John [Lord Justice Laws] died, the same day as the Prime Minister was taken into hospital, the same day that the Queen gave her magnicent address to the nation.” Mrs Cummings would not say whether her son had travelled to Durham as a consequence of Lord Laws being ill.  It has been a torrid weekend for Mr Cummings and the Government. After numerous ministers came out in support of his actions on Saturday morning, it was revealed just hours later that he had made a second trip to Durham weeks later. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps and Boris Johnson were both forced to defend Mr Cummings at press conferences this weekend. The PM leapt to the defence of Mr Cummings in a rambling press ­conference during which he cut off reporters, refused to answer questions and claimed his adviser had “acted to stop the spread of the virus” by driving from London to the North East. When the political aide ed to his home this evening he was heckled by members of the public.  As he entered his home, shouts of hypocrite, resign and shame could be heard from the group, which did not appear to be associated with the assembled media. One woman could be heard shouting: My mum’s terried, my dad’s had three shoulder operations… she won’t even entertain me in her garden with a tent. The woman, who was filming Mr Cummings on her phone as she spoke, could then be heard telling him: I’m a single parent. I’ve had no childcare since the beginning of this whole mess, not that I can afford to pay any child care. Another shouted: Would you recommend Bernard Castle for a day out  Mr Cummings appeared not to respond to the heckling.

Mr Cummings is under pressure to resign after the Mirror revealed he, his we and child had travelled  miles from his London home - while his we had coronavirus symptoms - to stay in a house owned by his parents in Durham. The government claimed Mr Cummings and his family isolated for  days while relatives brought him supplies. But ministers have refused to deny claims he left that house to go on a trip to Barnard Castle  miles away around the end of his -day isolation. At the time, Brits were advised not to drive long distances and to only take a walk, bike ride or cycleleaving the house for exercise. Boris Johnson last night defended Mr Cummingsapos breach of the advice to stay at home and not travel, especiallysuffering from the virus. He claimed the aide followed the instincts of every father and every parent… and I do not mark him down for that”. But a string of Tory backbenchers are now turning on the strategy chief, urging him to quit. Here are all the Tory MPs who are calling for Dominic Cummings to resign so far. What are your thoughts on the controversy  Email webnews@mirror Peter Aldous At a time when the Country must move on to the next stage of defeating Covid-, of getting back to work whilst ensuring that there is not a second peak, there must be no distraction from this challenge. The Government should recognise what families have gone through and what people are thinking and saying. It is thus important that Dominic Cummings should now stand down. Steve Baker Enough is enough. I and others saved him once before when he was driving Vote Leave to implosion. Not today. Dominic Cummings must go before he does any more harm to the UK, the Government, the Prime Minister, our institutions or the Conservative Party. Time is up. It is time for Dom to resign so Boris can govern within the conventions and norms which will see us through. It is time to get competing expert advice, decent software and better decisions, end the lockdown and start a long, hard recovery.  Peter Bone The Tory Brexiteer said Mr Cummings has to go because he broke the rules and has not apologised. Speaking on Nigel Farageaposs show on LBC, he said: When an adviser becomes the story, the adviser has to go. Boris Johnson can carry on without Dominic Cummingshe goes but it will be hardhe stays. Damian Collins Dominic Cummings has a track record of believing that the rules don’t apply to him and treating the scrutiny that should come to anyone in a position of authority with contempt. The government would be better without him.  Sir Roger Gale While as a father and as a grandfather I fully appreciate Mr Cummings’ desire to protect his child. There cannot be one law for the Prime Minister’s staff and another for everyone . He has sent out completely the wrong message and his position is no longer tenable. James Gray Unless and until he can justy what he did, he should face the consequences of it and give up his role as a government adviser. Having him continuing at the heart of government undermines our credibility and the strength of our message.” Robert Goodwill The Tory MP sent an e-mail to a constituent saying Dominic Cummingsapos position is untenable. Simon Hoare With the damage Mr Cummings is doing to the Government’s reputation he must consider his position. Lockdown has had its challenges for everyone. It’s his cavalier “I don’t care I’m cleverer than you” tone that infuriates people. He is now wounding the PM Govt  I don’t like that Andrew Jones The Harrogate Advertiser reported he wrote to constituents saying: “It seems clear to me that Mr Cummings has broken the guidelines which we were and are all expected to follow. For that reason I think that he should resign andhe does not do so then he should be dismissed.” Tim Loughton Told the BBC the defence of Mr Cummings is deeply damaging and is seriously compromising the governmentaposs public health advice. Saying heaposs been swamped by e-mails he condemned Boris Johnson, telling the BBC: What I wanted to hear was a proper justication of why what Dominic Cummings did was fine. “I fear I didn’t get that and what’s more worrying is my constituents didn’t get that.” Paul Maynard He said he shared peopleaposs dismay at the response, adding: It is a classic case of aposdo as I say, not as I doapos - and it is not ashe was unfamiliar with guidance he himself helped draw up. It seems to me to be utterly indefensible and his position wholly untenable. Jason McCartney He said while it was important for people to show compassion during the crisis, Mr Cummings had to go because the perceived hypocrisy of the rule makers potentially threatens the success of any future measures under a second wave of the coronavirus. We must have confidence that we are doing the right things for the right reasons and that we are all truly in it together. For that reason I believe Mr Cummingsapos position is now untenable, Mr McCartney said in a Facebook post. Caroline Nokes I made my views clear to my whip yesterday. There cannot be one rule for most of us and wriggle room for others. My inbox is rammed with very angry constituents and I do not blame them. They have made dficult sacrices over the course of the last  weeks. Julian Sturdy I donapost think this can go on much longer. It is damaging the Governmentaposs reputation. You canapost have one rule for Government advisers and one for everyone . His future does seem to look more and more untenable moving forward. The Prime Minister needs to clary Mr Cummingsapos position in a statement as soon as possible. Robert Syms The Poole MP tweeted: The Government has to explain test, track and trace and the next phase of lting lockdown next week. Whatever the merits of a Government adviser, they should never be the story or it detracts from the central message which is to get us out of this crisis. The adviser should go. Martin Vickers David Warburton Tory MP David Warburton said his own father died alone as a result of the coronavirus lockdown, and the Dominic Cummings story gives an impression of “double standards”. He told BBC Breakfast: “People have made sacrices... Instinct hasn’t really been part of it. He added: “Ideally,he broke the rules then he obviously should be subject to the same kind of consequences as anybody  who broke the rules... To me, enough is really enough, I think he’s damaging the Government and the country that he’s supposed to be serving.” Craig Whittaker I totally agree that Dominic Cummings position is untenable.

Unfair tactics British Airways is a distinguished national carrier but risks alienating loyal staff and passengers by using the crisis to impose far-reaching changes. The tactic, when taxpayers are picking up bills for the wages of many of the workforce, feels against the spirit of a furloughing scheme intended to mothball, not axe, jobs.

In his own words he tells his story... aposIf you’d told me  years ago I’d be giving , women a day an orgasm I would have laughed. But that’s what I do – from the studio at the bottom of my garden. People pay me to experience climaxes, but I never lay a finger on anyone. They’re just listening to my voice. I qualied as an NLP instructor in , and have been a trained hypnotist for  years, originally helping motivate business people to achieve their goals. It’s only in the last five years I have focused on making erotic audio, and it’s the best job in the world. Ironically, it was after my girlfriend left me that I turned my attention to this line of work. While together, we’d enjoyed reading erotic fiction as part of a healthy sex le. She liked me reading saucy extracts, but as a dyslexic it came more naturally to tell my own stories. However, it got to the stage where me speaking sexily to her dominated the whole relationship. She was clearing up the kitchen table once and – just while listening to a mundane voice message I’d left her – had a full orgasm. I know that sounds funny, or you might think ‘lucky her,’ but she said it was a problem because she no longer had control of her own body. She said I could read the weather report and it would trigger a climax. We broke up, but afterwards I thought, can I take advantage of this unusual gt I have   I made up my own story, Lure Me, on my iPhone. I put it on YouTube in , to see what the reaction was. I used some NLP skills and some hypnosis, and set them to a filthy story about being seduced at the beach. Well, with no promotion at all it soon got , hits. I was buzzing. The feedback was amazing, women telling me how intense their orgasm was. I started creating more stories and putting them on other s like Sound Cloud, MixCloud and Pornhub. After three months I invested in equipment and soundproofing, turning my garden office into a proper studio. As demand for my erotic audio recordings increased, and I began charging for it, I did less corporate work. For the past year my income has been solely from erotic audio. I don’t wish to disclose how much I earn, but it’s enough for me to live comfortably.  Now I’ve created  books, with many more in the pipeline. Some are available on Amazon Audio Books, others are only available on my website. The most popular – downloaded by , – is a fantasy about oral sex. Most men would like to be good at giving this, but they’re probably not. In real le, I know I can give a woman an orgasm which lasts an hour, and I hope this translates to my audios. Since the lockdown, I’ve seen a spike in traffic to my website. If you’re not able to get out and socialise, then why not improve your sex le at home  I encourage subscribers, and the UK monthly subscription is £.. For bespoke stories it costs around £. I charge £ for  minutes – but typically they run - minutes long . Customers are loyal because, let’s face it, amazing orgasms are addictive. Half these customers are men, gting their partners their unique desires. It’s a safe way to try a threesome, or experiment with something like BDSM, which you might not feel brave enough to try in real le.  Group sex scenarios are also popular, and not just with humans, but fantastical things like werewolves and even an octopus too, which I wouldn’t have anticipated. I don’t judge. All sorts of things turn people on. One woman asked me to create a fantasy about her masturbating with a cucumber, which she then served in sandwiches to her girlfriends. I never laugh about anything, that would be disrespectful to people who have shared their deepest desires with me. It’s a privilege to have their trust. Respect for women is hugely important to me. Every woman deserves mindblowing orgasms. It’s so rewarding when someone writes to me and says, ‘I’m , I’ve been married for  years, but you gave me my first climax’. The biggest blockage to achieving climax is normally stress, and not fully ‘letting go’. I invite people to tune into what turns them on, and let their imagination run wild. Because it’s just them, listening to me in their headphones, erotic audio feels an intimate experience.  Women feel relaxed in their own bedrooms, a safe place to get aroused. Unlike traditional porn, women don’t compare how they look or ‘perform’ when using it. Of course, I can get turned on when making the stories. It would be a bad signI didn’t. I’m told I have a nice voice, which is funny because as a kid growing up in Dorset I sounded like Worzel Gummidge. Looks-wise, I’m only a five out of ten, but I would describe myself as a generous lover, with a high libido. I don’t like my photo published because it spoils the illusion, and I’ve had problems with stalkers. One woman flew over from Canada, unprompted, saying I must sleep with her. Another threatened to harm my rescue dogsI didn’t have sex with her. Although I am single currently and get offered a lot sex, I’d never sleep with a client, it’s unprofessional. I have never been unfaithful, though girlfriends do get jealous of my career choice. After all, thousands of women a day are orgasming by listening to me, it’s normal to feel threatened by that.  When I am dating someone I will happily talk dirty to hershe wants me to – but not every night. I’m thinking about, writing and recording filthy stories all day. I don’t want to take my work to bed with me, too. My job is unusual, but I enjoy it immensely, it’s hugely rewarding and I’m always thinking of new ways to give women pleasure. What more could a man ask for  How does Devlin give you orgasms with his voice  ● Listeners should be alone, with around  mins of uninterrupted time to themselves, and are encouraged to lie in bed, ideally naked, and use headphones for the most intimate experience. ● Some women have powerful orgasms completely ‘hands-free,’ though others use the audio as a guided masturbation tool. Whatever works for you – the emphasis is it’s your body, and your subconscious will do what is perfect for you. ● Each story has a slowly built-up introduction to encourage listeners to fully relax. A simple story unfolds, using gently suggestive imagery . The language eventually becomes more sexually explicit.

Pascal Soriot told The Andrew Marr Show this morning that British people will get first access to the vaccine from autumn, despite concerns it will not be ready. The pharmaceutical firm, which is working with Oxford University, had previously said it has secured the first agreements for at least  million doses of the vaccine. But a leading member of the project told The Sundaythe lower transmission of Covid- in the community leaves the trial with only a  per cent chance of success. Askedpeople in Britain will be among the first to get the vaccine, Mr Soriot said: Yes, we have actually received an order from the British Government to supply  million doses of vaccine, and those will go to the British people. And thereaposs no doubt, starting in September, we will start delivering these doses of vaccine to the British Government for vaccination. Mr Soriot said the possibility of the vaccine being rolled out in autumn depended onan Oxford University trial worked before the transmission rate lowers further. He added: The vaccine has to work and thataposs one question, and the other question is, evenit works, we have to be able to demonstrate it. We have to run as fast as possible before the disease disappears so we can demonstrate that the vaccine is effective. Oxford Universityaposs Jenner Institute and the Oxford Vaccine Group began development on a vaccine in January, using a virus taken from chimpanzees. Following an initial phase of testing on  healthy volunteers between  and , the study is now set to progress to phases two and three, which involve increasing the testing to up to , people and expanding the age range of volunteers to include children and the elderly.  Sarah Gilbert, professor of vaccinology at the Jenner Institute, said: We have had a lot of interest already from people over the age of  years who were not eligible to take part in the phase-one study. And we will now be able to include older age groups to continue the vaccine assessment. We will also be including more study sites, in dferent parts of the country.  Professor Adrian Hill, director of the Jenner Institute, saidthe virusaposs spread is too low, not enough of the volunteers will catch it and the trial will be unable to definitively saythe vaccine works. Itaposs a race against the virus disappearing, and against time, Professor Hill said. We said earlier in the year that there was an  per cent chance of developing an effective vaccine by September. But at the moment, thereaposs a  per cent chance that we get no result at all. Weaposre in the bizarre position of wanting Covid to stay, at least for a little while.

Almost one in three people who died from Covid- in hospital had diabetes. Most diabetics are classed as clinically vulnerable rather than the clinically extremely vulnerable, the worst affected group of people who received letters from doctors telling them to stay at home.

And people with type  diabetics are twice as likely to die from the virus. Nine out of  diabetics have type  and many are obese, which is another major factor in the worst affected Covid patients. Professor Peter Horby, chair of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Groupadvisory group, said diabetes was being considered as part of an active review of the most vulnerable groups. Bridget Turner, director of policy at Diabetes UK, said she hopes the government does not unveil any blanket rules.

Hallie Melling from Old Swan in Liverpool, was initially believed to have been suffering from dyspraxia because she was disorientated and always falling at school. When school staff advised her -year-old mum Amy-Lea to get her eyes tested it lead to a referral to Alder Hey hospital where medics discovered she had Homocystinuria .HCU is a metabolic disorder that prevents the normal breakdown of protein and can affect the brain, eyes, skeleton and the vascular system, Liverpool Echo reports.Amy-Lea said: “Since , they have had a heel prick test that babies get to get tested for it, but they didn’t have it when Hallie was born.  “She’s had six years of this building up in her system and has had to face the consequences. “When she was in reception school they said she had dyspraxia because she was always falling, not very good at PE and was getting disorientated. “Then that led on to them telling us to get her eyes checked because she’s making up what the pictures are in the stories.“So we went to a regular Specsavers appointment and got sent away with a sealed envelope to go to Alder Hey.”The ophthalmologist described the effects the condition has had on Hallie’s sight asher “eye was a trampoline and the supporting strings had been cut.” Over a year, Hallie’s sight deteriorated to the point where her glasses prescription was minus , and eventually, the lenses in her eyes had to be removed.  After genetic tests, the results came back that Hallie had the rare condition HCU. According to the NHS, it needs to be treated to avoid serious complications so Hallie will be on medication for the rest of her le and a restricted diet to limit the amount of protein she eats. Amy-Lea said: “The only things she can eat unchecked are fruit and some vegetables. “The rest is prescription food from the chemist and only  grams of natural protein a day. “She could go to McDonald’s and get a veggie burger meal but that would add up of three-quarters of her daily allowance so we would have to keep her on prescription food for the rest of the day. “She used to be a brilliant eater, she would go to her nan’s and eat liver and everything.

It was outside at .am on a Sunday - it could have been a lot worse. It is believed the fire started on a balcony and then spread into the building.

The countryaposs herd immunity strategy was championed by Chief Epidemiologist Anders Tegnell. He recommended adopting voluntary measures against the virus, rather than a mandatory lockdown like those imposed by many other countries, which has ided opinion at home and abroad. Sweden has kept most schools, restaurants, bars and businesses open even as much of Europe hunkered down behind closed doors.Do you have a coronavirus story to share  Email webnews@mirrorThe policy has exposed it to criticism with death rates running far higher than in Nordic neighbours, evenmuch lower than in countries such as Britain, Italy and France that shut down. The number of Covid- patients in intensive care in Sweden has fallen by a third from the peak in late April and health authorities say the outbreak is slowing. However, Sweden recorded the highest number of Covid- deaths per capita in Europe over a seven day period. The antibody study aimed to find out whether herd immunity was achievable.  If it is, enough people in the population would have developed immunity to the infectious disease to be able to effectively stop it from spreading. The findings were roughly in line with models predicting a third of the Swedish capital’s population would have had the virus by now and where at least limited herd immunity could have set in, the Swedish Health Agency said on Wednesday. “It is a little bit lowerbut not remarkably lower, maybe one or a couple of percent,” Tegnell told a Stockholm news conference. “It squares pretty well with the models we have.” However, the herd immunity concept is untested for the novel coronavirus and the extent and duration of immunity among recovered patients is equally uncertain as well.  The study drew on some , tests from across the country although only figures for Stockholm were released. Unlike the other Nordic countries, Swedenaposs government has not enforced widespread lockdown measures. Basing its approach on a so-called aposprinciple of responsibilityapos, the country has not only kept schools open, but they remain compulsory for children under  to attend. Cafes, bars and restaurants have also stayed open for business, albeit with social distancing measures enforced.  The government has urged people to work from home where possible, while not mandating that anyone does so. While Swedenaposs Health Agency officials have stressed herd immunity is not a goal in itself, it has also said the strategy is only to slow the virus enough for health services to cope, not suppress it altogether. The World Health Organization has warned against pinning hopes on herd immunity.

The . magnitude quake hit Wellington as New Zealandaposs Prime Minister was in the middle of a broadcast - but she was undaunted and calmly continued with the programme. Wellington and nearby areas were shaken by a . magnitude earthquake with the epicentre  kmnorthwest of Levin, a town close to the capital, and at a depth of  km, according to Geonet. Her calm approach to the incident has only heightened her popularity as her approval rating soars following her handling of several crises - a mass shooting in Christchurch last year, a volcanic eruption in December and the recent coronavirus pandemic. Ardern, who became PM in , was speaking on a live TV interview at the time from the parliament building, called the Beehive. Weaposre just having a bit of an earthquake here, Ryan..., she told the host of the show Ryan Bridge, as she, the camera and other things around her shook. Quite a decent shake here... you see things moving behind me. The Beehive moves a little more than most, she said. Ardern assured the host that she was safe and the interview resumed. We are fine, Iaposm not under any hanging lights and I look like I am in a structurally strong place, she added. The video soon went viral on social media. Although the quake caused no damages or injuries were reported, it lasted for more than  seconds and caused panic in Wellington with several people in offices and homes getting under their tables for cover. Meanwhile, Ardern remains the one to beat as New Zealand heads toward a general election. The leader of the main opposition party was ousted on Friday after opinion polls showed he was no match for her soaring popularity. Simon Bridges was replaced by Todd Muller in an emergency caucus meeting of his centre-right National Party following a week of disastrous poll results.

It was great.“I remember being in Dens and just crossing the street and after one minute we were at the Dundee United stadium. That was the most strange thing.“I have played in a lot of derbies, Boca Juniors-River Plate, after that Rangers-Celtic, I played against Lazio when I was at Roma so I can say I have played great games with two teams who hate each other. It was great for the people.“I knew the fans would feel it a lot to win against United. I know the feeling of winning a derby.“With my team-mates we celebrated with the fans and it was great. I had won derbies in my career and that was another one – I wanted to win that game because I knew how signicant it is for the fans.”He added: “It was a great experience, one I liked a lot and I’m not just saying that. I liked my time a lot in Scotland.“I didn’t know anything about Dundee when Bonetti called me but I said ‘let’s go and don’t think about that’. The people were great.“I remember the first game against Aberdeen, coming on in the second half. I was kicked by a defender who got a red card – I had to jump otherwise he would have broken my legs!“I liked the way of playing football in Scotland, I liked the dynamic of the game.“You could never say you had won a gameyou were winning - with five minutes to go. In Italy, you are winning - or - and no one wants to go forward so I liked that a lot.”Caniggia’s ability and manner on the pitch quickly endeared him to the Dundee support with many sporting long, blonde wigs as a tribute.“I remember the guys with the wigs, it was very funny. I like the people in Scotland a lot, very funny, easy going people and with a lot of pride.“Dens was a small stadium but I liked it a lot and the people at the club were great.“We had good players.

Watson, Osman and everyone  got announced last week“That’s the disappointing thing, to achieve what we achieved and not being able to have that wee celebration with those people that are moving on.“We’re going to be there next season and will be able to celebrate it one way or another when we’re together but to see boys moving on is hard.“I really feel for them.”Reflecting on his first season at Tannadice, former Ayr United goal machine Shankland insists he felt at home at United right away.He added: “I knew what I was signing up for, having played against the boys the season before.“There was something dferent about them.“I knew Mark Reynolds, Peter Pawlett and Cammy Smith so that helped.“I feel like, not just for myself, it’s a good place to come into.“It’s a good changing-room and was welcoming from the start. I felt a part of it right away.“That helped me settle in and the football takes care of itself.”Outwith title glory, one of the best moments for Shanks was scoring twice against top-flight Hibs in their Scottish Cup fourth-round tie.United were dumped out after a replay but Shankland believes they can take the positives into the Premiership next season as the Tangerines set their sights on a top-six finish.He continued: “It was an exciting tie for us – everyone was looking at it as probably one of the biggest of the round and it was, obviously, televised and they brought a big crowd up with them as well.“It had a bit of a derby feel to it because the crowd was so good.“At home we more than matched them and earned the replay.“At times, we probably were a wee bit under the cosh and rode our luck a wee bit.“In those games you need to. When we went down to Easter Road and it went to - it could’ve gone either way.“It was just important bigDoidge took all his chances that night.“There’s nothing much you can doa striker’s on form and he takes them all.“It showed us as players we have the ability to match teams like that.“Hibs have got real good quality through their team, they’re all good footballers and comfortable on the ball.“That’s something we need to take up to next season, to be confident in going to places like that and playing.“I felt we can take the positives out of it.”It wasn’t all plain sailing in his first season with the Terrors but Shankland believes their recovery from consecutive defeats to Alloa and Queen of the South showed their mettle.Lting the lid on their post-match debrief in Dumfries, he explained: “It wasn’t the gaffer after the Queen of the South game, it was the players.“We knew that performance wasn’t acceptable, obviously.“Alloa was a tighter game where we could’ve maybe got something from it, albeit we didn’t play well at all.“But when we went down to Queen of the South we got absolutely battered.“We were second to every ball that bounced and we just knew ourselves we were nowhere near good enough.“The boys after the game had a conversation and we put our dferences aside over how we all felt.“I felt it really helped at the time because you don’t want to get caught up in bad runs.“It was two or three games on the bounce but we knew they were hard places to go.“We knew other teams would struggle there and it wouldn’t be just us but the performance at Queen of the South, for me personally, I felt I let down myself.“I knew how bad I’d played and my team-mates were the same.“That was the main thing – everybody looked at themselves and we discussed what we could improve on.“That’s what we did and I felt it worked.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/05/Brian-Sloan-2.jpg ","title":"scottish charities highlight importance of technology for those becoming increasingly isolated during pandemic","story":"While many people across Scotland have been able to adapt quite rapidly to working and socialising from home, there are a great deal of older people who lack the necessary skills to stay connected through technology.Charities are urging people not to #forget# those who are becoming increasingly isolated as a result of the pandemic.The chief executive of Age Scotland, Brian Sloan, has said that loneliness was #already a public health epidemic# before the crisis hit and compared the effect #as damaging to the lives of those affected as smoking  cigarettes a day#.He added that the period of lockdown will have intensied this problem, especially among older people, and said that the present situation has highlighted the dficulties many face when it comes to accessing technology.#Many older people in Scotland have embraced technology as a vital tool to stay connected with their loved ones since the start of the Covid- pandemic,# he said.#Being separated from family and friends has been one of the biggest challenges facing older people and it is heartening to see how many have adapted to Zoom calls, Skype bedtime stories and WhatsApp video chats as a means of keeping in touch.“Having the right technology is of particular benefit for older people who have been self-isolating and are living alone. It lets them interact with others and see familiar faces.“However not everybody has access to technology. Around , over s in Scotland – the equivalent to the population of Edinburgh – do not use the internet.“The cost of technology is also an issue for many older people. Those on low incomes are less likely to have internet enabled technology in their homes.#There are , pensioners in Scotland living in poverty and many won’t have technology, let alone high speed broadband or data connection to the internet.“It’s the same with smartphones. Their use among the over s is incredibly low, with some figures suggesting just one in five have one in their pocket.“So while technology is of huge benefit to those who have it, we must not forget that there are tens of thousands of older people in Scotland who are growing increasingly isolated during this pandemic and who cannot use technology to reach out for support. It is important that they do not get left behind.#We need to find ways to help them feel connected to their family, friends and community eventhey don’t have technology, by using the phone, writing letters or sending postcards.#The Scotland coordinator of AbilityNet, Chris Grant, has echoed Mr Sloan#s views and said that people are mainly reaching out to them for two reasons they don#t have the internet and they#re not able to afford technology.#The amount of people I hear saying that they just cannot afford to get a basic tablet is sad. You can get a basic tablet now for around £,# he said.#People are worried about going into a contract but these service providers are being really good with customers right now and just want to try and help as much as they can.#AbilityNet, which currently has  volunteers active in Tayside and  nationwide, provides free impartial technology advice and training to anyone who is over the age of  or who is living with a disability or medical condition.Mr Grant said that they have had to ramp up their response in order to cope with the pandemic.#Our role is to support people. Since the start of coronavirus, we have told people to contact us now, more than ever,they need any help,# he explained.#We#re now supporting more charities and third sector organisations because a lot of their members have been forced to move into digital. We#ve really upped our response.#We are increasingly busy and the service just continues to grow every week.#When I came on board  months ago I had four volunteers across Scotland and we#d maybe get five or six calls a month. Now we#re getting  calls a month, particularly during Covid-. It has very much increased.#I can#t comment on specic cases but what I can tell you is that we have a lot of people, of all ages, across Scotland and some of them have been really upset [by what#s going on].#When I hear somebody in tears to me on the phone saying that they#ve not seen their granddad or their nephew or a niece, it really pulls a chord for me.#It#s a horrible time for many and there is a lot of depression around it.#We speak to a lot of dferent people in dferent capacities and there are a lot of people saying that they#re really down, so that#s why we#re working with organisations to try and eliminate this by looking at technology which will help with that.#A lot of this stuff focuses on digital inclusion which, in my opinion, honestly affects mental health. If it wasn#t for technology, I don#t know what I#d be up to. It#s frightening.#People have to adjust to working from home which, in itself, is tricky and again technology is needed. Not to mention, it#s the best way to keep in touch with family and friends.#There are so many great things out there that people don#t know about and we#re trying to focus on changing that attitude.#Scott Stewart, manager of Disability Information Scotland, said that their helplines were flooded with calls at the beginning of the pandemic but they related largely to an increased need for practical help.He added that when they do have calls relating to technology, it tends to be from older people who are unable to apply for a blue badge from home and need to utilise library facilities.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-new-transplant-system-launch-date-confirmed","story":"LEGISLATION to introduce an opt-out system of organ and tissue donation for deceased donors will come into force in Autumn ."},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"skyes-limit-sabhal-mor-ostaig---unique-gaelic-only-college-set-stunning-island-location","story":"AS global interest in Gaelic grows, students from across the world are travelling to Skye to study at Sabhal Mograver Ostaig, the National Centre for Gaelic Language and Culture."},{"url":null,"title":"jiving-gis-glasgows-george-square---ve-day-memories","story":"BONFIRES so hot they cracked tenement windows.

They feed on flying insects and spend most of their le in the air # including when they sleep # usually coming down to earth to breed. They are fast fliers, often chasing one another over buildings when they give a screeching call.Swts arrive back in Argyll in early May and breed in towns, villages and other buildings in Argyll. They spend around three months in Argyll, departing early-mid August to their wintering grounds in Africa.The British Trust for Ornithology’s Breeding Bird Survey indicates the population of Swts in Scotland has declined by around  per cent since . A similar decline has taken place in England and Wales. The reasons for the decline are not fully known but are believed to be related to changes in insect numbers and a lack of nesting sites as buildings are modernised.Argyll is at the north-western limit of the world range of Swts. Their distribution and numbers in Argyll is not well-known and the purpose of the Argyll Bird Club Survey is to try to find out the size of the breeding population and where they remain.If you have a Swt nesting in your building, or near you, or would like to take part in this survey further information is available at http:argyllbirdclub.org argyll-surveysFor more information about Argyll Bird Club, email Jim Dickson at Argyllbirder@outlook."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor april 24 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,A few weeks ago I launched an appeal on social media aimed at supporting nurses and medics at the Mid Argyll Hospital during this terrible COVID- pandemic.I was initially trying to find outthere was anyone locally who might be interested in dusting down their sewing machine to make a few sets of protective ‘scrubs’ to donate to the hospital. Within a couple of days the response was staggering.There were volunteers from all corners of Mid Argyll willing to sew, donate material and give freely of their time. Local businesses were also quick to respond with offers of material, pattern printing and transport for moving stock around.I am overwhelmed by the support and generosity of people in Mid Argyll. They have risen to the challenge and far exceeded my expectations.We have around  stitchers from Cairndow to Ardfern, and villages and towns in between, producing brightly coloured ‘scrubs’ using mainly donated fabric, scrap material and jazzy duvet covers. The first donation of ‘scrubs’ is expected to be handed over to the hospital this week and we are sure they will brighten up the wards.Our crowdfunding page, ‘Let’s Get Scrubbing for Mid Argyll’, was originally set up to buy everything to make the scrubs. It has broken the original £ target and we would love to hit the £, mark so please feel free to donate.I am overwhelmed and humbled by this experience and publicly thank the group team leaders, the volunteer stitchers, those working behind the scenes and the wider community for their support and generosity.My thanks is also extended to the following businesses who have helped in so many ways: MacLeod Construction, Kit-You-Out, Mary’s Meals, Top Designer, West Coast Motors, LG Upholstery, Clock Tower, Tarbert COS Thrt Shop, Premier Laundry, Ian Y McIntyre, Willie Leitch Sailmaker, Owen Sails and the Lithgow Family at Ormsary Estate.Nikki Thompson, Ardrishaig.Sir,The time will come when we are through the turmoil of this pandemic but as we work our way through it, I wanted to share a situation that reflects the actions of many.I was recently collecting shopping in Tarbert for registered vulnerable people and, as I was taking off my gloves before getting into the car, I was aware of another#s presence close by pushing a mobile rubbish bin. It was Damon. He saw me about to put my gloves into the rubbish bag in my own car and said cheerily #You can pop them into this bin here,you like#.I was so taken by that gesture. What an example of initiative, thoughtfulness and kindness. It summed up the incredible work of so many volunteers, co-ordinated by Team Tarbert#s Fiona, with Margaret co-ordinating prescriptions, and many others.Perhaps there is no better time for us all to reaquaint ourselves with Rudyard Kipling#s poem #If#.It seems to perfectly summarise humanity working at its best, in which, during this crisis, thanks to so many, Tarbert can walk tall. Stay safe.Peter Minshall, Tarbert.Sir,I write regarding the Argyllshire Advertiser edition dated Friday April  and the front page heading #Hospital prepares for Pandemic#.The article states: #No figures have been released about the incidence of coronavirus in Argyll and Bute# because the HSCP spokesperson said #we are following national guidance and due to reasons of patient confidentiality we will not be able to make public where in the Highland health board areas the positive cases are#.This statement is complete nonsense and shows either the HSCP in Argyll has not been privy to this information or they are just using the term #national guidance# as a smokescreen and an excuse and or sheer incompetence.No-one was asking them for patients# names and addresses, merely figures of those affected in a given area.The people appointed to positions of responsibility in Argyll and Bute HSCP are hopeless when it comes to joined-up thinking and accountability.All they will do is spin you a line and quote stuff like #national guidelines#, which is code for #I don#t have a clue#.Karl Edwards, LochgilpheadSir,Scottish and Southern Electricity Networksis extending the support it provides to those most vulnerable by expanding the eligibility of its Priority Services Registerto include customers at increased risk of severe illness during the coronavirus pandemic.Nearly , customers already receive additional care and support through SSEN’s PSR – a free, tailored service.In addition to those self-isolating or shielding for  weeks, customers are eligiblethey:Julie Walker, SSEN."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 24 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsMidton has been making the distinctive and coveted awards for the Royal Television Society for the past  years # and this week the company#s resourcefulness in adapting to face shield production was acknowledged by the society.

By adding night-scented plants and soft lighting, along with pale-coloured flowers and foliage that appear to glow in the fading light, your garden will become an enticing ‘room’ to sit in at the end of the day.White flowering plants # like big blooms of hydrangeas # have a lovely glow in the evening garden reflecting the last of the light which makes them appear brighter than other plants.  Pale blues and lilacs also look their best in fading light, so sea holly with its tiny blue flowers that sit in rosettes of silvery-grey bracts is a great addition.Bright foliage also creates an evening glow in the garden. Light-coloured, iegated and silver leaf plants reflect any available light. Lambs Earis a popular ground cover plant that has the most wonderful soft, furry, silver-grey leaves.  It’s fairly drought resistant so a good choice for a dry, sunny border.Many beautul flowers only produce scent at night and often have a stronger aroma than their daytime counterparts.  Fragrance is released from night-scented flowers as the heat of the day lingers into the evening.  Petunias may seem be a strange choice for a night garden, but they are night scented. Some smell during the day, but not to the same intensity of the night scent. Night Scented Stocks do just that and have a pastel colour flower palate.It’s best to plant scented night garden flowers where you’ll brush against them or come close to them. Try planting them around doors and paths.  If you are planting in pots make sure you arrange them round seating areas to provide a heady aroma or position them near doors and windows so that the fragrance drts inside.Even though planting the right night-flowering plants in the right place will give you stunning effects,you want to really enjoy your garden after dark, some form of garden lighting is essential.  Try not to floodlight your entire garden. Instead, pick out specic plants and trees to showcase. Up lighting, either set on spikes or recessed into the ground, showcases plants beautully at night.But it’s not just at night time you want your garden to look good so here are some tips for this month from the Royal Horticultural Society."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor may 15 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,A big thank you to whoever has tidied up Ardrishaig Community Garden, mown the grass and repaired and painted the fences.Such a peaceful place to call into while out exercising.

Mindfulness concentrates your mind on the ‘here and now’ and is a proven way of dealing with mild depression or anxiety.Focus on the what the plants feel like – not just their fragrance when touched – from leathery and lacey through to soft and smooth. You can also mix plants that are great to touch with tactile hard landscaping elements such as a water feature, smooth polished round pebbles or the glazed ceramics.Some top touching plants and features to considerLeaves # try Stachys byzantina, commonly known as Lamb#s Ear. Its soft, downy, furry silver-grey leaves area favourite among gardeners who tend to use it for ground cover in rich soil. As a contrast there is Acuba japonicawhich has smooth, glossy leathery leaves.Flowers # who can resist touching a bottlebrush Callistemon cintrinus – bundles of tiny delicate stamen flowers form a brush that’s soft to touch – or the soft paper-thin petals of a poppy Papaver orientale.Grasses # run your hand over the arching, threadlike leaves of feathery Stipa tenuissima also known as Mexican feather grass or the more robust drought proof ornamental Festuca glauca with thread-like blue foliage that forms dense mounds.Bark – tree bark can also provide a tactile experience especially when it’s the stunning flowering cherry Prunus serrulate with mahogany coloured bark that peels away in bands round the trunk.Landscaping – you can easily y the textures in your garden by choosing dferent hard landscaping options. If you have smooth pebbles surrounding a water feature that you can run your hand over and through, then you could place lichen-covered rocks in another area of the garden.Our general wellbeing is intrinsically linked to the natural world which is why Thrive – the gardening for health charity – has developed the Thrive Gardening Club.

inAugust.The First Minister revealed this will be a \"blended\" approach, far from normality for our nations youngsters, as part of a four-phase plan to ease the lockdown.But even this is reliant on two key factors -the scientic andmedical advice confirms it can be done in a way that will not disrupt efforts to control the virus andthere is sufficient PPE and other hygiene measures in place.Following Ms Sturgeons announcement in parliament, the Scottish Government published its strategic framework for the re-opening of schools.Here, well detailwhat parents need to know ahead of their childsto the classroom.When will schools re-open Schools in Scotland are set to re-open on August .This is earlier than planned for some schools - but the universal approach is being advised by the Scottish Government.Teachers are set toto the classroom by June to plan and prepare for the new blended model of learning.Some pupils set to start P or S may also receive some in-school experience in late June, to help ensure they are supported to make the next steps in their education.Critical childcare will continue until August to ensure the ongoing provision for key worker and vulnerable children.How will the blended model work Under this approach, children will have a mixture of in-school and in-home learning.According to the framework, this is reliant on consistent and easy-to-use in-home materials which are \"intended to support and complement, but not replicate\" in-school learning.To help disadvantaged pupils, a further poundm was announced to provide laptops and other technology for the home learning.However the document notes: \"No matter how well planned in-home learning is, it is not the same as having effective learning and teaching within the school environment, led by teachers.\"The blended model will be kept under constant review.How will pupils social distance For the first phase of re-opening, schools are being asked to assess the maximum numbers they can accommodate, with guidance including:Pupils being taught in smaller groupsThese groups will not be mixed, where practicableSeating positions will be re-organised to allow for m gaps between pupilsOutdoor space will be used moreThere will be staggered arrival and departure times, so parents will avoid congregating in playground areasBreaks will be staggered by class to avoid contact from dferent classesTeachers, rather than pupils, will move around classrooms where possibleThere will be enhanced hygiene practices across all schools, including additional cleaning,params: .pushExpanding the learning estateLocal authorities are being advised to look for ways they can maximise the capacity for pupils to benefit from in-school learning as much as possible.One such way they are doing this is through expanding the learning estate.This would mean seeingclassrooms could be made fromoutdoor space,libraries, community halls, leisure centres and conference centres.It might also include taking short-term leases of vacant business accommodation.Who will be prioritised for in-school learning As set out above, there is likely going to be a finite number of daily places for in-school learning.As a result, to support NHS capacity and other essential work, a priority will be given to the children of keyworkers - but this is only in circumstances where absolutely necessary with no other option for childcare within that household.The remaining allocation is to be distributed across all year groups to ensure every pupils benefits from in-school learning where possible, according to the framework.Local authorities are being advices to use their knowledge of local circumstances to prioritise any groups where need is greatest.Speaking in the Scottish Parliament on Thursday, the First Minister said: ldquoThese arrangements will not represent a completeto normality by August.ldquoBut we judge them to be the most sensible approach we can plan for at this stage.Later in the session, the First Minister said the Scottish Government wants to ensure pupils will be back at school ldquoin a way that allows them to be children.She added: ldquoNone of us relish the prospect of seeing kids, particularly young kids, socially distancing or be as aware of these risks as we will undoubtedly have to require them to be.ldquoTrying to get, for children in

Governments across the UK moved quickly to introduce business support schemes.I know, however, that many Scottish businesses, especially SMEs, have been frustrated with the level and speed of help provided, with some even seeking a judicial review of the Scottish Governmentrsquos policy.The frustration grew from the decision to initially block retailers with multiple outlets from applying for more than one grant ndash putting small chain businesses in Scotland at a competitive disadvantage.Following a backlash, Ministers relented, but businesses with multiple properties here are still only allowed to claim  per cent of the maximum support grant for subsequent properties.But with almost half a billion pounds of business support grant finance still not having been allocated, and the allocation of funds slowing down, Scottish Labour is demanding Ministers urgently reconsider this policy and offer businesses with more than one premises their additional grants in full.Given the widely predicted long-term economic damage likely to be caused by the pandemic, it will be vital that once the public health crisis is under control we dedicate the same urgency and intervention to repairing our economy.I want this to include a jobs guarantee scheme to help tackle the looming threat of unemployment, especially for young people.Further information about the advice and support available for businesses during the pandemic can be found at findbusinesssupport.gov.scot coronavirus-advice, while the governmentrsquos Covid- business helpline number is   ."},{"url":null,"title":"day-centre-receives-holyrood-recognition","story":"Harlawhill Day Centrersquos efforts during the coronavirus pandemic were highlighted by the countyrsquos MSP, Iain Gray.The facility had to close its doors on March  due to the global pandemic but Mr Gray felt it was important to recognise the efforts being made by staff and volunteers.The centre, on the townrsquos East Loan, has continued to offer a range of support to members during the pandemic, including organising socially distanced street celebrations outside membersrsquo homes to help mark VE Day and delivering special afternoon tea packages and other food and treats to help keep their spirits up during lockdown.Mr Gray, who lodged a motion at Holyrood highlighting the facility, told the Courier: ldquoHarlawhill Day Centre has always been a special place, very much at the heart of the community in Prestonpans.ldquoIt was a very sad day when it had to close its doors to members back in March.

Here are her words:In the past many couldnrsquot read or write and so our history was rolled into the mind and later unravelled when the wheels stopped rolling and the horses were roped for grazing.Cars and lorries may have replaced the old methods of transport, but the importance of our cultural tales remained the same.Stories for children were about joys and adventures of the fairy folk, goblins and broonies.As they grew older, moral messages were concealed in the stories to teach the young person about moral issues.Respecting the earth and all that lived on her made for some wonderful tales about animals and birds why the snakes see all, who painted the eaglesrsquo feather tips, does a blackbird feel a storm coming at the base of his beak Is it not wise to heed the warning of a dog who does not rise to happily welcome the arrival of its master Our lives revolved around such tales, and their inner meanings. The boy who cried wolf was forever with us do not lie!You see, forests hold more than trees and rocks will whisperyou have an ear to listen.Our entire lives were, and are, stories. In my culture we had a teller in every family.In her books about the lives of traditional travellers, and her personal experience of it, she does not overly romanticise it.It could be a hard le, and one often misunderstood or discriminated against, as indeed it still is.But the legacy of stories, told and re-told over campfires, in caravans and kitchens, passed down from generation to generation is a rich and priceless inheritance.I was honoured that she shared a tale with me, albeit online rather than face to face, as these times demand.I believe it is a tradition we should all honour and can learn from.And so here is the story she shared.It has a Tinkerrsquos Leap in it and, who knows, it could refer to the place so named in Woodhall Dean.I have tried as best I can to keep the resonance of Jessrsquos voice in the telling.So sit round your campfire, real or imagined, for Jessrsquos tale:The story I am going to tell is of the Earl of Hell. Aye well that is how folk called him. Irsquom told he was a relative of the famous Jeannie Gordon.Well, he was a handsome lad, and had a roving eye. He also had a knack of walking into trouble.Well one day he was accused of stealing something. He knew he would get no fair hearing in court, and sure enough he didnrsquot.Soon he found himself before a dour judge, who donned his black cap and pronounced that he will be hanged at the light of dawn.Now the Earl had already escaped death three times. Some say he had the blood of Red Ruth in his veins.This time it seemed, he had met his fate. But this young lad was not ready to meet his maker.The hangman did his deadly job but as the Earl fell through the trap door he began a dance at the end of the rope, in which he dislocated his shoulders, threw his legs up in a circle and managed to free himself.The jailers were aghast, and disbelief momentarily paralysed their responses.This gave the Earl time to scuffle to his feet and flee up the steps. No door was locked, for nobody had expected the need of it.The lad jumped onto a horse and rode at speed. His horsemanship was, of course, a skill honed from childhood and he rode to freedom.However, a guard was likewise a skilled rider and took chase after him.Perhaps the Earl eased up on his horse for a moment, believing he was well away, but soon the sound of galloping told him dferent. The guard was closing in.The Earl made his horse fly like the wind. He headed into the trees, hoping to lose his pursuer, but to no avail.The steep sided burn lay ahead. So he rode like the devil towards the precipice.But at the last moment his horse took understandable fright, and stalled, throwing him to the ground.As the Earl stood, his horse would have no more of it and fled.His pursuer now drew a sword that glinted in the morning sun as he charged perhaps after all the Earl of Hell would die in this dawn light.But his title was well earned.He turned towards the precipice and threw caution to the wind and leapt over the edge.The pursuing guard pulled up his horse and watched as the Earl flew over the ravine and landed like a cat on the other side.The guard fumbled for his pistol, but the Earl vanished into the thicket of the wood in moments.The location became known ever after as Tinkerrsquos Leap.And as for the Earl of Hell himself, he was seen again only through the misty visions of drunk men, and the eyes of his sweetheart who did not tell his story till long after he was dead."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-council-caravan-bid-rejected","story":"Lammermuir Livery and Stables wanted to provide accommodation for relief staff for their stable manager to live at their rural base at Castlemains Farm, Gford, to run the business.And they hoped East Lothian Council would back their planthe caravans were hidden from sight on nearby land already used to store mobile homes and other vehicles.However councillor officers refused to grant planning permission and the councilrsquos Local Review Body backed their decision during an online meeting this week when they refused an appeal against it.The planning application, which was retrospective also asked for permission to have an office, already built at the entrance to to site, but that was also rejected by the review body.Making their case for the caravans, the firm said: ldquoWhen considering this we were aware of the visual impact a caravan could have on the landscapeand decided the best option would be to site the caravan in the existing storage yard in an area designated for that purpose, this area already has caravans stored, which we have permission forand therefore the caravan would not be a new thing in that area.HoweverCouncillor Norman Hampshire, review body chairperson, described the decision to let people live in a storage area as lsquounacceptablersquo.He said: ldquoI do not think residential caravans on a storage site is an acceptable place for people to be living.The stables had also argued that there was not secure space within the equestrian buildings it had at he farm for an office and one needed to be built on another part of the land, however this was also dismissed by the review body.Members carried out inidual site visits to the farm ahead of meeting todayonline.Councillor Sue Kempson said: ldquoThe caravans are in the wrong place and should not be used as living accommodation on a storage site, it sets a precedent.ldquoLooking around the equestrian site there is plenty of room to provide a secure office so I am supporting the officersrsquo decision.Fellow body member Councillor Kenny McLeod made the decision unanimous when he ruled the office and caravans were too far away from the centre itself to be of any benefit.Planning officers refused the original application for temporary planning permission for five years for the office and caravans retrospectively, stating there was no business case for the equestrian business to support the need for the additional building and that the caravans would set an ldquoundesirable precedent.The applicants had told the review body their agent, who had been asked to provide a business case, had ldquovanished and they had no knowledge of the request."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-parents-need-know-school-reopen-date-confirmed","story":"The First Minister revealed this will be a \"blended\" approach, far from normality for our nations youngsters, as part of a four-phase plan to ease the lockdown.But even this is reliant on two key factors -the scientic andmedical advice confirms it can be done so in a way that will not distrupt efforts to controlthe virus andthere is sufficient PPE and other hygiene measures in place.Following her announcement in parliament, the Scottish Goevrnment published their strategic framework for the reopening of schools.Here, well detail out what parents need to know ahead of their childsto the classroom.Schools in Scotland are set to reopen on August .This is earlier than planned for some schools -

For over a year this tiny offshoot has been sinking its roots deep. Above ground, however, itrsquos little more than a frond. With the solicitude of a father for his firstborn, Alan has been watering it since March, and awaiting the first leaves of the season. Buds eventually appeared, followed by the unfurling of glistening leaves the colour of old pennies. Just the other day he witnessed the arboreal equivalent of a childrsquos first day at school: a sparrow alighting on its branches, treating it like a real tree.The gardener who told us how to plant it said that it canrsquot get enough watering. Itrsquoll take however much you pour on it, allowing roots to take hold, and speeding its growth. So when eventually the clouds opened the other evening, it was the infant beech I thought of, soaking it up before reaching for the sky.As the rain pounded on the skylights, I stood at the window. Lit by the streetlamp on the village green, water filled the cobbled gutter. It rushed blackly towards the drain, a sprinkling of fallen apple blossom bobbing on the tide, asa wedding party had just passed. Through the small hours the downpour continued. I could lie awake all night listening to it. When I was growing up my bedroom was in an attic. Early in the morning seagullsrsquo flippers would patter over the roof, and the slightest breath of wind or rain was amplied by the rattling windows and nearby trees. The worse the weather, the more I enjoyed it.This astonishingly dry and sunny spring has been a boon during lockdown, the best possible antidote to gloom. I donrsquot like to imagine how miserable it would have beenthere had been incessant damp and cloudy skies. Yet surrounded as we are in Hoolet by fields of crops, and with flocks and herds munching grass, lack of rain means everything suffers. Cattle especially have been known to break out in search of water, thirst driving them slightly nuts.Following last weekrsquos cloudburst, the village has emerged from its dousing like a bridesmaid from the hairdresserrsquos. At first light the blackbirds were out in force, working their way across the green, combing every inch. I read that itrsquos been a good year for blackbirds, but that was hardly news. The place has been jumping with them for weeks, males chasing off rivals or fighting mid-air asreenacting the Battle of Britain. Females have been shopping for worms in pairs. No patch of lawn or grass goes unforaged, the birds keeping several feet apart, like customers at a supermarket checkout. Ousting wood pigeons and thrushes from telegraph poles, they declare their territory and every few minutes one flies past the window at such speed, yoursquod think it had been fired from a gun.A year or two past, one of our neighbours found a blackbird lying stricken in his garden. Alive but bleeding, it was being mobbed by other birds. He took out a chair, and sat near it for the rest of the afternoon, until it had recovered enough to fly off. He noticed it had been ringed, and when it began to make his garden its home, he called it Wilf. If he were ever tempted to rename his cottage, he could do worse than Wilf Hall.While we were speaking, Wilf chittered from the hedge. A day or two later, he turned up in our garden, two fields away from base, pecking for worms. With his gleaming ankle ring, and boot-polished feathers, he has a debonair look. I used to think they were all much the same, but once you start examining blackbirds, they emerge as iniduals: the plump matron, the one with a white feather on its wing, the scrawny, aggressive male, ceaselessly refuelling himself and his nestlings.Like pheasants, they allow us to get very close ndash Wilf especially, who seems fearless around people ndash but itrsquos not because they arenrsquot smart. You feel a pheasant is capable of walking on to the Christmas platter and arranging the carrots and parsnips around itself while it waits for the gravy blackbirds, on the other hand, know how to take advantage of what we can offer.Given the kerfuffle they make in the beech hedge, they could be devouring a packet of crisps. They make no attempt to hide their presence or keep their distance and whenever I start digging, the cry goes out. They donrsquot sit cutely on the spade handle like robins, but they hop within a few inches, spotting grubs I couldnrsquot detect even with a magnying glass. Once theyrsquore used to you, their confidence quickly grows.Some time ago I interviewed a woman who kept crows and rooks in her house, as they recovered from injuries. While we sat in her kitchen drinking coffee, a small rook click-clacked towards us over the tiles. Keeping one eye cocked on me, it pecked at my bare ankle, before growing bored and toddling off.The blackbirds in Hoolet arenrsquot tame, but nor are they shy. When worms began emerging after the rain, they were already in place, waiting. Itrsquos been a good week for them, and soon their well-fed broods will be joining the party on the green. Irsquom less certain about our bluetits. Occasional cheeping can be heard from the nest box, but itrsquos too early to knowtheyrsquoll survive. Caterpillars are their food of choice, but as the butterfly population declines, so does their larder. Might they have something put away in case of a rainy day "},{"url":null,"title":"paul-tamburrinis-lockdown-feast-caesar-salad-fried-chicken-chococolate-cate-chocolate-sorbet","story":"This weeks recipes are a sumptuous three-course meal fit for any table:Caesar salad with lettuce emulsionServes - starters Romaine lettuce hearts, cut into bite sized bitesg parmesan shavings fillets of good quality anchovies in oil, halved waysFor the bread croutons Day old baguetteExtra virgin olive oilSea saltFor the dressingfrac cloves of garlic, green germ removed and finely grated fillets of salted anchovies in oil free range eggsml red wine vinegartsp Dijon mustardml grapeseed oilg finely grated parmesanJuice of frac lemonfrac tsp of Worcestershire sauce drops of TabascoSalt and black pepper to tasteFor the lettuce emulsiong Baby gems leaves, green only ndash washed frac tsp Dijon mustardml vegetable oilml cold waterTable saltFor the bread tuillesPreheat the oven to C ndash cut  very thinly slices from the baguette, so you have  per person.

This would mean that all inidual adults in Scotland would receive a regular income to cover basic needs, paid regardless of their working status and income from other sources. To what extent do you support or oppose the principle of paying the lsquoUniversal Basic Income \"Of the  women asked, % agreed strongly, or tended to agree, with the introduction of basic income, while % of  men said the same.Geographically, % of people surveyed from the east of Scotland supported it compared with % of west coast residents and % of those who live in the north.Those aged between  and  were more likely to support the introduction of universal basic income, with two-thirdsof people surveyed in that age group agreeing with the idea.Within the same age group, % said they opposed UBI, % said they were neither opposed nor supportive of its introduction, and % said they didnt know.The age group with the largest number of people opposed to the idea was the over-s, with % of those asked within this category saying they would tend to oppose, or were strongly opposed. In this age group % of people had no opinion either way and % didnt know what they thought about it.Jamie Cooke, head of the RSA, said that basic income \"offers the chance to respond to the current crisis\" and \"create a new foundation for a reinvigorated social contract for the future\".Mark Dfley, founder of Mark Dfley Consultancy and Research, said: \"The coronavirus pandemic has accelerated interest in and discussion around the issue of Universal Basic Income. New polling evidence now suggests that the majority of Scots support the principle of UBI, with two-thirds either strongly supportingor tending to supportthe principle. At the other end of the scale, just % of Scots oppose the principle.\"What is striking is that support is broad across the population, including across all age groups and those from dferent social class backgrounds.\"This poll does not point to unequivocal support for UBI but does lend support to those promoting this signicant policy change, and point to the need for a more detailed national conversation on the issue.\""},{"url":null,"title":"whisky-review-glover---fifth-edition","story":"If yoursquore just beginning to learn about whisky, Irsquove got a wee bit of advice for you ... donrsquot believe the people who say only old whisky can be great whisky.Some of the best drams Irsquove ever tasted have been young ndash less that  years ndash with some real beauties less than five.The latest release of The Glover ndash a marriage of Scotch and Japanese single malt whiskies which has become the talk of the steamie in recent years ndash is the perfect case in point.This fth edition is a blend of Scotch from the Ardnamurchan Distillery and Japanese malt whisky from legendary Chichibu ... and both are only four years old.Each drams is highly acclaimed among whisky specialists in its own right despite its youth ndash and blending them together really does prove that old saying ldquoGreater than the sum of its parts.But before we get to tasting, what is The Glover  This bottle is the th in the series of pioneering blends from Fusion Whisky, which specialises in creating premium ldquofusions of Scotch and international whisky to commemorate a historical Scottish figure.The Glover itself celebrates the so-called ldquoScottish Samurai, Thomas Blake Glover, a merchant and diplomat who had a profound effect on Japan in the late th century.This fth edition is one of only , bottles, from first-fill bourbon barrels.

On a per-capita basis it should be almost ten times that.Now, the purpose of all this testing is admittedly unclear, north and south of the Border. The clinical advisers in Scotland have always been distinctly cool on community testing, at least in the current phase. The former CMO, Dr Catherine Catherwood, famously called it a ldquodistraction.However, everyone agrees now that one of the major failings of the UKrsquos response to the pandemic was a lack of preparedness and a failure to install the architecture of TTI: test, track and isolate. Progress in Scotland can only be described as glacial.:Opinion: Iain Macwhirter: Its easy to scare people into staying home harder to persuade them to come out againThen there is the avoidable tragedy in Scotlandrsquos care homes, which I wrote about last week. This was the policy, hotly denied, that old people were cleared out of acute hospitals without proper testing and sent often to care homes where the virus spread rapidly.Last week, the Health Secretary, Jeane Freeman, finally came clean about the elderly clearance, and said nearly , had been discharged in March alone. She had previously said only  had been so decanted.This is a serious error and calls into question the competence of the minister and the health service bureaucrats upon whom she relies. It comes on top of the inexplicable failure to inform the public about the major Covid outbreak in February at a Nike conference in Edinburgh.There is every sign of a massive buck-passing operation between the NHS Scotland, Public Health Scotland, the Chief Medical Officer, the Care Inspectorate and the private care homes, all trying to blame each other for the care home scandal.Nicola Sturgeon admitted last week that there had been a panic reaction to the forecast of , Covid deaths made in mid-March by the disgraced Imperial College epidemiologist, Professor Neil Ferguson. She said hospitals feared they were about to be ldquofilled up with coronavirus cases and so discharged as many old patients as possible into care. In the event, the wards have lain empty as old people died.Nearly half of all Covid deaths in Scotland have been in care homes. The misery this policy has inflicted on Scotlandrsquos senior citizens, dying in cruel isolation, is unimaginable.Lessons will be learned etc. However, no-one seems to regard these as lessons particularly for the First Minister. Similarly, criticism of confusions in her route map to normality go right over her head.Garden centres and bowling greens can open, but people canrsquot use the toilets, which make it rather pointless. The ldquoblended solution to teaching means parents will have to remain at home even after schools go back in August. The tourism and hospitality industry is in despair, forecasting losses of up to , jobs.But Nicola Sturgeon is safe and socially distanced from blame. She has the shield of confidence around her, burnished by the flattering attentions of legions SNP supporters, who dominate social media.It has now become clear that the PMrsquos closest adviser, Dominic Cummings, had been bending the lockdown rules to travel Durham, with the full sanction of Boris Johnson.The UK media seems mainly interested in using Scotland as a stick to beat the Prime Minister. The Sky presenter, Kay Burley, urged UK political leaders last week to ldquotake a leaf out of Nicola Sturgeonrsquos book.It is also, of course, because Boris Johnsonrsquos handling of the crisis has been confused and erratic. The messaging about ldquoStay Alert was vague, the rules about travel incomprehensible, the attempt to reopen the schools cack-handed.:Iain Macwhirter: Failures over testing means no end to coronavirus lockdown in ScotlandThe UK Government has oscillated between promises of wonder apps and ldquogame-changing breakthroughs, like antibody tests, and panicky pronouncements that have led to invasive crackdowns by the police. The decision to introduce draconian -day quarantine for travellers may have made sense two or three months ago, but seems pointless now.Westminsterrsquos approach has been an object lesson in poor leadership, which will be examined by students of governance for many years.

The former CMO, Dr Catherine Catherwood, famously called it a ldquodistraction.However, everyone agrees now that one of the major failings of the UKrsquos response to the pandemic was a lack of preparedness and a failure to install the architecture of TTI: test, track and isolate. Progress in Scotland can only be described as glacial.:Opinion: Iain Macwhirter: Its easy to scare people into staying home harder to persuade them to come out againThen there is the avoidable tragedy in Scotlandrsquos care homes, which I wrote about last week. This was the policy, hotly denied, that old people were cleared out of acute hospitals without proper testing and sent often to care homes where the virus spread rapidly.Last week, the Health Secretary, Jeane Freeman, finally came clean about the elderly clearance, and said nearly , had been discharged in March alone. She had previously said only  had been so decanted.This is a serious error and calls into question the competence of the minister and the health service bureaucrats upon whom she relies. It comes on top of the inexplicable failure to inform the public about the major Covid outbreak in February at a Nike conference in Edinburgh.There is every sign of a massive buck-passing operation between the NHS Scotland, Public Health Scotland, the Chief Medical Officer, the Care Inspectorate and the private care homes, all trying to blame each other for the care home scandal.Nicola Sturgeon admitted last week that there had been a panic reaction to the forecast of , Covid deaths made in mid-March by the disgraced Imperial College epidemiologist, Professor Neil Ferguson. She said hospitals feared they were about to be ldquofilled up with coronavirus cases and so discharged as many old patients as possible into care. In the event, the wards have lain empty as old people died.Nearly half of all Covid deaths in Scotland have been in care homes. The misery this policy has inflicted on Scotlandrsquos senior citizens, dying in cruel isolation, is unimaginable.Lessons will be learned etc. However, no-one seems to regard these as lessons particularly for the First Minister. Similarly, criticism of confusions in her route map to normality go right over her head.Garden centres and bowling greens can open, but people canrsquot use the toilets, which make it rather pointless. The ldquoblended solution to teaching means parents will have to remain at home even after schools go back in August. The tourism and hospitality industry is in despair, forecasting losses of up to , jobs.But Nicola Sturgeon is safe and socially distanced from blame. She has the shield of confidence around her, burnished by the flattering attentions of legions SNP supporters, who dominate social media.It has now become clear that the PMrsquos closest adviser, Dominic Cummings, had been bending the lockdown rules to travel Durham, with the full sanction of Boris Johnson.The UK media seems mainly interested in using Scotland as a stick to beat the Prime Minister. The Sky presenter, Kay Burley, urged UK political leaders last week to ldquotake a leaf out of Nicola Sturgeonrsquos book.It is also, of course, because Boris Johnsonrsquos handling of the crisis has been confused and erratic. The messaging about ldquoStay Alert was vague, the rules about travel incomprehensible, the attempt to reopen the schools cack-handed.:Iain Macwhirter: Failures over testing means no end to coronavirus lockdown in ScotlandThe UK Government has oscillated between promises of wonder apps and ldquogame-changing breakthroughs, like antibody tests, and panicky pronouncements that have led to invasive crackdowns by the police. The decision to introduce draconian -day quarantine for travellers may have made sense two or three months ago, but seems pointless now.Westminsterrsquos approach has been an object lesson in poor leadership, which will be examined by students of governance for many years. Scotlandrsquos handling of the actual medical emergency may not have been much better, but Nicola Sturgeon has cornered the market on that all-important asset: public trust."},{"url":null,"title":"delay-imposing-lockdown-restrictions-saw-cases-rise-1-3m-just-nine-days","story":"An investigation by the Sunday Timesrsquos Insight team foundBoris Johnsonrsquos hesitance in imposing measures saw cases rise from , on March  to . million on March .During this time, the Government deliberated on the timing and scale of the lockdown.:Coronavirus - what now: two-thirds of Scots support Universal Basic Income, poll findsThe increase in cases during this time is shown in a study by Imperial College Londonrsquos pandemic modellers and Oxford Universityrsquos department of statistics.The study used backward modelling to calculate that the rate of infection was doubling every three days on March  ndash the date it is believed the Government first agreed that lockdown measures would be necessary to curb the virusrsquos spread.Professor Peter Openshaw, a member of the Governmentrsquos Nervtag , told the paper: ldquoI think that critical period of delay made the big dference to the peak numbers, both of hospitalisations and of deaths.:Coronavirus ndash what now: is this the end of the care home ldquoI think everyone would accept now in retrospect thatwersquod gone for lockdown a couple of weeks earlier that would have greatly reduced the numbers of hospitalisations and deaths.In a statement to the paper, a spokesman said the Governmentrsquos strategy throughout the pandemic has been to protect the NHS and ldquosave lives.ldquoIt has been vital through this global pandemic to make interventions which the public can feasibly adopt in sufficient numbers over long periods."},{"url":null,"title":"national-5-higher-exams-scrapped-next-year-claims-scotlands-largest-teaching-union","story":"Our sister title The National says the Education Insitute of Scotlandwant the country to instead focus on continuous assessments for pupils due to sit school qualications next year.This years exams, which were due to take place in May and June, were cancelled due to lockdown restrictions, and the unions general secretary Larry Flanagan claimsthat contingency planning is required to ensure this years pupils do not face the same uncertainty.ldquoIf schools were trying to deliver the  hours these courses normally have attached to them there would be no hours left for st, nd and rd years, he told the Sunday National.:Coronavirus comment: why universities need to rethink what it valuesldquoThe second issue is what will be the nature of the assessment.\"Wersquore clear from an EIS point of view that we have to proof the accreditation against a second wave of the virus and the exams being cancelled again.

But it is reported Mr Johnson is adamant he will not throw Mr Cummings \"to the dogs\".The chief aide has insisted he acted \"reasonably and legally\" and had done the \"right thing\".At the start of this afternoons Scottish Government press briefing in Edinburgh, Jeanne Freeman, Scotlands Health Secretary, was keen to underline the lockdown message onself-isolation, saying the \"message may have become confused in the last  hours because of events in other parts of the UK\" and stressing that it meant that anyone with the virus \"should not leave the house for any reason\".Despite the growing furore, Grant Shapps, the Transport Secretary, insisted Mr Cummings would not resign but, as he took the Sunday morning media round for the Government, admitted he had not spoken to himin person about the growing controversy.Askedthe Governmentrsquos guidelines, which state ldquo you or someone you live with has symptoms of coronavirus, do not leave your home for any reason, still applied, Mr Shapps said: ldquoAbsolutely right, the advice does stand.However, he then referred to what has been described as ldquowriggle room, pointing out how a section in the guidance, recognised thatpeople were living with children, then lsquonot all of these measures will be possiblersquo.When it was put to the minister that Mr Cummings had broken the rules, the Secretary of State explained: ldquoThe guidance also makes clear you have to put in place the structures around to look after, in this case, a four-year-oldhellip[who] needs to get support and having that support around them, in this case, by being not with the parents but in the property adjacent to the parents with the support of the sister and a niece meant they could bring food to the house and so forth.On Saturday, Jenny Harries, Englandrsquos Deputy Chief Medical Officer, said everyone with the virus should self-isolate unless there was a risk to le.Pressed by the BBCs Andrew Marr on whether there was such an extreme risk to le, Mr Shapps replied: \"A four-year-old cant feed themselves, a four-year-old cant bathe themselves and change their clothes, so it is clear they wanted to put some measures in place.\"The lockdown began on March .

But it is apparent it is not going to happen in one or two years.ldquoIt was agreed we would need to be looking at funding to run the hill. To do that we needed to be able to show potential investors, our work within the community, within the estate or around the estate. With climate change we have to be more creative than worrying about a ski resort. Le is changing whether we like it or not.\"ldquoWhen the Trust was conceived the funicular was running, there was an operator there. The situation has changed dramatically.She added that the pop-up ice rink is one of several ideas that have been discussed.ldquoPeople have talked to us about a pump track, allotments, a velodrome. The ideas are massive and wonderful.ldquoAsset transfer is not a short-term gain. This will take years not months, but our goal hasnrsquot changed and HIE has been nothing but helpful.A spokesman for HIE said: ldquoThere is no specic requirement for a community group to undertake a dferent commercial project as a pre-requirement for a successful asset transfer request.ldquoWe believe the trust is aware of this but also recognise that they cover the wider Aviemore and Glenmore area and not just Cairngorm and that they do need to generate their own income.He added: ldquoWe have supported the trust in many ways, including providing access to expertise and advice on community ownership, and funding two posts to help them develop their future plans.\"ldquoAGCT has also made us aware of their idea for a pop-up ice rink.

To complain that Scotland is at least \"three weeks behind England\" ignores the fact that the virus has taken time to spread northwards. It is now some weeks since Covid- peaked in London. Then for some reason he criticises the First Minister for pursuing a four-phased approach to easing lockdown which is \"in sharp contrast to what the Prime Minister has introduced\". But surely such a phased approach in England is exactly what Boris Johnson announced, and indeed Downing Street has just claimed credit for what is now being rolled out in Scotland The real problem, however, for Mr Stevenson is public reaction. I think that it is abundantly clear that the cautious and measured approach of our First Minister commands considerable public support, which stands in stark contrast with how Boris Johnsonrsquos decisions are perceived. His rushed and ill-thought-out decision to insist that schools in England should be opened on June  is a classic example of how not to proceed. While here in Scotland the decision to bring pupils back to school on August  Not surprisingly the mood in England is one of confusion and concern. According to reports, the UK Governmentrsquos policy to reopen schools will not be followed by perhaps as many as  local authorities. Teaching unions have expressed serious reservations on behalf of their members. Schools and teachers have been given little time to physically prepare their teaching programmes, classrooms, toilets and playgrounds for the childrenrsquos safe . The scientic advice also urges caution. The Department of Health and Social Care and Public Health England warns that ldquothe essential well-ing local test, trace and isolate protocols will not be in place in England by early June, Not surprisingly the latest opinion poll suggests that the June  start has the support of only  per cent of parents a large majority would prefer a September . This is in marked contrast to experience here, where I would suggest public support for the \"glacial easing\" remains strong.Eric Melvin, Edinburgh EH.STRUAN Stevensons article was a timely reminder,such were needed, that the Tories have,anything, consolidated their position as the Nasty Party. His advocacy of rapid easing of lockdown belittles the suffering of those who have already died from the effects of the virus, the courage and dedication of those in the NHS and the care sector and the fears of those of us who, because of existing medical conditions, are at high riskwe contract the virus. While recognising the damage that the economy is suffering, the cavalier disregard he displays for the human costs likely to be incurred through easing too much, too soon, is appalling.We should, of course, not be surprised by this. The UK has a Prime Minister who lies, sleeps around and failed to take action in the early stages of the pandemic, preferring meaningless twaddle about British exceptionalism. In Priti Patel we have a Home Secretary who smirkingly advances legislation that would shut off the opportunities granted to her family in the past ldquopull up the drawbridge, Im OK. Jacob Rees-Mogg openly flaunts the opportunities he has helped to create for dubious financial deals, the profits from which he stashes away in overseas tax havens until such time as this Government provides similar facilities for the ultra-rich within the country. Having promised that food standards would not be compromised in the search for trade deals toreplace those within the EU, Parliament then votes to remove all such protection to appease the United States.As for the behaviour of Dominic Cummings, words fail me. His complete disregard for the letter and spirit of the emergency measures, is beyond belief.What is also surprising, in a smaller way, is that you chose to devote half a page to Mr Stevensons nonsense.Dr RM Morris, Ellon.IT is becoming abundantly clear with each passing day that Nicola Sturgeonrsquos calculated decision to \"grandstand\" her position as First Minister by trailing Englandrsquos easing of the Corona lockdown in order for Scotland \"to go its own way\" is beginning to backfire on her ndash indeed, Struan Stevenson astutely sees through her lame excuses that she is not playing politics .Also, the SNPrsquos request for Westminster to extend the furlough scheme beyond October for Scotland has been essentially denied, piling pressure on the First Minister to catch up with England in respect of lockdown easing.Now, instead of being perceived as leading from the front, increasingly, Ms Sturgeon is going to be perceived as passively following from behind ndash not a good track-record for entering the  Holyrood elections.Philip Adams, Crosslee.I WAS going to sit down and compose a y, erudite response to Struan Stevensons interesting take on the Scottish Governments proposed road map. Then I read your leader columnand put my pen away.Alastair Clark, Stranraer.STRUAN Stevenson has a good go at the Scottish Government. Fine, thats what Tories do, but I must comment on his sign-off, \"Historically, pandemics either ended with the medical containment of the disease, which in our case could occur with the development of a vaccine, or they end when society loses its fear of the virus\"He suggests that since a vaccine is a long way off, \"its time we lost our fear\".Grand, there are three ways to do this.First, be immune. Secondly, die of the virus. Or of course, you could go the third way, and thats to be so rich and isolated from real le, as it is lived by most of the rest of us, that you are not affected by it, nor do you have to give a hoot.AJ Clarence, Prestwick.I THINK I am a reasonably tolerant man. I very rarely lose my temper. But I am enraged by Dominic Cummingss behaviour. How dare he  The lockdown instructions were very clear, despite the weasel words of the deputy English Chief Medical Officer, Jenny Harries. She knows that she dare not say anything against her masters for fear of losing her job.Everyone and their auntie knows that he did the wrong thing. Trying to excuse it on a technicality just makes it worse. Then we are told it was because he was concerned for his four-year-old son. Really  Did he not have any other options open to him  Does he not have any friends who live locally  I suppose not. But whose fault is that Why should I or anyone  follow Matt Hancocks instruction  Ill tell you why. Because it raises the risk to others.Robin Mather, Musselburgh.DOMINIC Cummings ndash the perfect example of the adage dont do as I do, do as I tell you.Dave Biggart, Kilmacolm.INTERESTING that despite reasonably positive public opinion of Nicola Sturgeons handling of the pandemic in Scotland, there were three negative letters in The Herald . The performance of the Scottish Government has certainly not been flawless, but the criticism, to paraphrase Mr James Martin, is pathetic.First, Ms Sturgeon would have been severely criticisedshe had erged from the UK at the beginning of the outbreak, and the UK was slow. Secondly, as a retired clinician, I disagree with retired NHS manager Danny Crawford about patient confidentiality. It was, presumably, suggested by clinicians and accepted by the First Minister. It may be a moot point, but I would side with that view. If there was poor contact tracing, that needs to be avoided in the future.Finally, I get the impression that whatever Ms Sturgeon and the current Scottish Government do, these correspondents and their ilk will find a reason to criticise. R McMurtrie talks about Ms Sturgeons empathy, but many would consider hers as genuine concern for others. Would he prefer Boris Johnsons or Priti Patels form of \"empathy\" George Rhind, Clydebank.UNTIL now, according to the UK Government daily reports, approximately three million people in England have been tested for Covid-. On a pro rata basis that could mean that we have tested approximately , people in Scotland. However, any figures I have heard do not at all approach this figure.I accept that, as the First Minister says, testing is not the silver bullet, but as it is being touted strongly by the World Health Organisation, surely we should be maximising our efforts in this regard and letting the Scottish people know the results.W MacIntyre, East Kilbride.THE proposedof golf to being one of our permitted activities has been greeted with a fanfare. Further along the Scottish Governments route map, we are advised to drive no more than five miles.The authors of this document are obviously unaware of the fact that many golfers live as many as  or more miles from their clubs. I think in particular of several clubs on the Ayrshire and east coasts which depend for survival upon members who live in and around Glasgow and Edinburgh.Tough luck, I suppose.David Miller, Milngavie.Read more: Letters: We have paid a high price for Scotlands slow virus response"},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/2050526.jpg?type=article-full","title":"fifth-rbs-mortgage-customers-approved-mortgage-payment-holidays","story":"RBS has confirmed that , of its m mortgage customers across the UK have so far been approved for mortgage repayment holidays.Customers affected have been emailed to let them know that they will benefit from the full three month offering which will run from May to July.Latest figures from UK Finance show across the banking industry, . million mortgage payment holidays have been issued as of May  ndash equivalent to one in six mortgages.It comes as the partly taxpayer-owned Edinburgh-based bank set aside pound million to pay for potential losses related to coronvirus as customers struggle to cope with loan repayments.Operating profits at the bank, still majority owned by the taxpayer after being bailed out in the financial crisis, halved to poundm in the first quarter of the year compared with the same period a year earlier as a result.While banks in general have been criticised over the amount of lending they have done through the Chancellors coronavirus business interruption loans scheme , RBS appears to have been punching above its weight relatively, having approved pound. billion, or more than , loans.That is around % of the total CBILS approved loans so far.The chief financial officer, Katie Murray, has said that while CBILS would not be hugely profitable for the lender she expected a ldquonominalfrom the loans.It has also provided , customers with pound.bm through the Bounce Back Loan Scheme in the three weeks since its launch although one in five have not been been approved.RBS, which is changing its parent name to NatWest this year, says it has removed late credit card payment fees.And it has frozen interest rates on overdrafts at current levels while removing all fees until at least the end of June.A Royal Bank of Scotland spokesman said: ldquoWersquore committed to supporting our customers through this unprecedented crisis, and itrsquos why wersquove introduced a range of measures including mortgage, credit card and loan payment holidays and have proactively spoken to over , customers who are elderly, vulnerable or in long term isolation.

The industry looks forward to regulatory guidance being finalised swtly to ensure both borrowers and lenders can plan over the coming weeks. Meanwhile those borrowers who have already taken a mortgage payment holiday and can afford to make payments are encouraged to do so, as this will reduce the level of their repayments in the long run.ldquoFor those borrowers who have not already applied for a mortgage payment holiday, the industry supports the extension of the availability of payment holidays until October ,  as this will provide much-needed breathing space for borrowers who need it. Lenders are also committed to the moratorium on involuntary repossessions to ensure no homeowner loses the roof over their head because of Covid- related repayment dficulties.ldquoA payment holiday may not be the right choice for everyone, and borrowers should only applythey need one. We would encourage any borrowers concerned about their financial situation to check with their lender, starting by looking at their website which will have the latest information on the support available.Lenders arealso providing almost , payment holidays on credit cards and , on personal loans for customers facing cash-flow problems due to the coronavirus.Over  million customershave been offered the option of interest-free borrowing for three months on the first pound of their arranged overdraft.The figures for up to the end of April comes as part of a broad package of measures from the industry to support customers affected by the Covid- outbreak."},{"url":null,"title":"hope-scotlands-wildcats","story":"For a long time, it has seemed asthe Scottish wildcatrsquos nine lives were well and truly up.The \"Highland Tiger\" can grow twice as large as a household tabby and, with powerful, angular jaws made for crunching prey, is typically much more ferocious.But impressive physical characteristics have not stopped its numbers dwindling rapidly due to factors such as cross-breeding with feral and domestic cats, habitat loss and disease.Only last year a report from the International Union for Conservation of Nature confirmed the iconic carnivore was on the verge of becoming genetically extinct and said the population north of the Border ndash most recently estimated at just  - was no longer ldquoviable.Now glimmers of light are emerging after the Royal Zoological Society of Scotlandrevealed that  saw  wildcat kittens born under its management of the UK captive breeding programme ndash a record high since it took over the project.The total breeding population looked after by the Society and partner organisations also shot up from  in  to  last month.David Barclay, RZSS Conservation Manager and coordinator for the UK Scottish wildcat captive breeding programme, welcomed the increases and said they could prove a major boost to efforts aimed at replenishing the wild population.ldquoIt comes down to space, good animal care, collaboration between collections, effective management and having the right animals together for breeding at the right time,\" he said.\"At a time when the wild population is on the brink of extinction, having a successful, sustainable captive population thatrsquos growing each year is a fantastic resource to have as a support tool for the conservation of the species in the coming years.Although they now have protected legal status, wildcats were not always popular.During the Victorian period they were blamed for killing grouse and poultry, and became a favourite target of gamekeepers.Today it is hybridisation which threatens the species, with fears that mating between wildcats and their domestic or feral cousins could lead to genetic extinction.ldquoWe know that, for the wild living population of wildcats, hybridisation is one of the biggest threats, said Mr Barclay.ldquoTo ensure that this threat would not impact the captive breeding population, we genetically sampled and tested the breeding population in .ldquoThis has allowed us to ensure that all wildcats in the captive breeding programme are not only viable for future breeding but are an incredibly valuable resource to support conservation recovery.ldquoThe aim of the EU LIFE partnership recovery project Saving Wildcats is to take a number of captive cats from the captive breeding programme to the projectrsquos dedicated reintroduction centre and prepare them for release in the coming years.ldquoWe have to make sure that the captive breeding population is big enough and robust enough so it can act as a source population for recovery and help save this iconic species.Mr Barclay said maintaining such a population involved a delicate balancing act.ldquoScottish wildcats breed once a year and have litter sizes of two, three, four kittens, he explained.ldquoThey are sexually mature in their first year. The first five years of le are the ones in which wildcats are most likely to produce and successfully rear kittens.ldquoSo having that age range well represented in the breeding population is really important. Having a majority of older cats, for example, wouldnrsquot be helpful for a developing population.ldquoItrsquos also about choosing animals as unrelated to each other as possible.ldquoIt comes down to something called lsquomean kinshiprsquo ndash how related one animal is to another in the population.ldquoMaybe therersquos an animal that has not bred for several years and those wildcat genes are not widely present in the population ndash those are genes that you would want to introduce into the population as this helps increase the genetic ersity.Mr Barclay said the Scottish wildcat was by no means out of the woods but added that its prospects may now be a little brighter.ldquoThe wildcat breeding season generally begins in April, May, June, he added.ldquoI know that a couple of kittens have been born already. At the Aigas Field Centre they have had their first litters already. We hope there are many other kittens on their way at other collections.ldquoWe are at a point in time when we can look at the captive population and say, wow, this really gives us some viable options to help support wildcat recovery in the wild."},{"url":null,"title":"dominic-cummings-controversy-unfolded-timeline-events","story":"Mr Cummings says he made the journey for childcare purposes.

Forcing MPs to choose between the safety of our communities and equal representation is unacceptable.“Parliament must be a forum where every part of the United Kingdom can participate equally. The Secretary of State knows this better than most and the challenges posed to communities that are more distant from parliament. We are calling on him to be a voice for equal representation in government.”Mr Jack was questioned on the issue in parliament yesterday, by SNP MP Allan Dorans. Mr Jack said: #Members of Parliament are key workers. More importantly, as a cabinet minister and a secretary of state, it is right that I should be here in the chamber so that I can be properly scrutinised and answer these questions.#I came down at the weekend and travelled on a train very safely. I willsafely and I will be isolating myself when I do, but that is solely because I go back to family. I do not see why we cannot have proper scrutiny of parliament when we have the virtual proceedings, which work for some, but for me it is absolutely about being here, being scrutinised and being at the Dispatch Box.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Signicant adjustments will also be required across our public transport services as the lockdown is eased in the coming weeks and months and the safety of the travelling public is hugely important.“The committee wants to hear about the experiences of iniduals and businesses and whether they feel they have received the support they need to survive and recover from this crisis.“We also want to learn about examples of good practice as we consider what lessons can be learned about the response to the pandemic and also how existing practices may need to change as we move forward.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

National media reports have suggested that Home Office staff cannot access paperwork held in offices due to inefficient home working procedures.Mr Carmichael said: “EU citizens make a massive positive impact in the Northern Isles and the coronavirus crisis has only made that impact clearer. The pandemic has demonstrated the vital contributions that workers from all over the world make in supporting our economy and keeping the NHS running under severe pressure.“The ongoing legal limbo for over two hundred EU citizens in the isles is unacceptable. Continued confusion and delay caused by administrative problems must be put right. Failing to do so puts people’s futures and lives clouded in uncertainty. They deserve better from a government that promised their right to remain.“This news comes in a week in which the government has seemed blind to the importance of immigrant workers in our health and social care sectors. I am glad that the Prime Minister backed down on plans to charge immigrants working in the NHS but it should never have come that far.

In Orkney, this currently stands at two and seven respectively.However, the Scottish Government and NHS Orkney have refused so far to confirm the number of people in each area that have been tested, partly on the basis of concerns around patient confidentiality.Mr McArthur said: “In the absence of a vaccine, any move away from lockdown needs to be backed up by a reliable regime of testing and tracing. We need to keep the virus in sight, so we can properly manage the risk.“If there are any issues in getting this set up, local areas need to know so that those problems can be raised and then fixed.“That is why it is essential that Ministers are as transparent as possible.  Being up front about the amount of testing taking place at a local health board level is a key part of achieving that transparency, keeping people informed and building public confidence.“Without knowing the extent of testing in Orkney, it is dficult to know what to make of the relatively low numbers of confirmed cases of COVID. That is a point I have been reinforcing with Scottish Ministers and NHS Orkney over recent weeks.“The First Minister has called for a ‘grown up’ conversation about how we take the dficult decisions in easing lockdown restrictions.  Grown up conversations, however, are founded on transparency and honesty. That is why we need to see detailed figures on a localised basis.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It is also understandable that Ministers want safeguards in place to ensure that public funds are being allocated appropriately.“However, it is clear that requiring applicants to evidence use of a business bank account is causing real problems for many small businesses in the tourism sector.  Many were advised by their own banks to use personal bank accounts to run their operations. Having taken that advice, many now find it is denying them access to the support they desperately need.“BB owners are the backbone of an already vulnerable tourism sector in Orkney and, like other businesses, are facing an uphill challenge at this time. Yet, it is almost asthey haven’t been considered to be a viable business at all, which is deeply frustrating.“I have been raising this issue with the Finance Secretary for a number of weeks now and was encouraged by Kate Forbes’ recognition of the problem and her willingness to keep looking at how this gap in support might be closed. So far, Ministers have been willing to widen criteria and make improvements to funds where needed. I hope the same can happen in this instance so that the hardship fund can continue to target support at those businesses that it was designed to help.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

His house was so large that he could let the legislature use four rooms. He was one of the wealthiest men in the town but he was not the only successful Orcadian businessman there. About a quarter of the men who formed the first Winnipeg Board of Trade, in March , were Orcadians or the sons of Orcadians: John Inkster and his son Colin, William Drever, Robert Tait, James Clouston, William Flett and George Kennedy.Three of the Board of Trade members have had roads named after them: Bannatyne Avenue, Inkster Bouled and Tait Avenue. There are two more named after Orcadian settlers: Mowat Road after Edward Mowat from Orphir and Setter Street after Andrew Setter, or Seatter. It is no surprise that Orcadians played such a prominent part in the early le of Winnipeg because they were there right from the start: in the Red River Valley.All through the th Century Orkney men went to work for the Hudson’s Bay Company. At its peak, in ,  of the  employees were Orcadian. Most of them came home but a good number settled in the Red River Valley: the colony south of Lake Winnipeg founded by the Earl of Selkirk for Highlanders displaced by the Clearances. The HBC had granted the land on condition that their men could retire there.The colony struggled through its early years but things settled down after the union of the HBC with the North-West Company in . Shetland pioneer Issac Cowie wrote:And it was these Orkneymen, with other veterans of the fur trade…, coming in sufficient numbers to defend it, who made permanent the settlement of Red River.”…Douglas Hill, in The Opening of the Canadian West , described the birth of Winnipeg, within the Red River Settlement, when warehouses and stores were built near the HBC#s Upper Fort Garry.#The collection of ramshackle log or frame buildings, with one or two solid houses, was at first called McDermotville after its leading citizen, an Irish settler-turned-trader named Andrew McDermot, who with his son-in-law, A G B Bannatyne, erected Winnipeg#s first buildings. Soon the town#s shops were thriving, and challenging the Fort as the settlement#s focal point#In  the prairie path that had been graced with the name #Main Street# was properly surveyed, graded and furnished with one or two culverts . It was a symptom of the magnicent optimism that prevailed. Yet the optimists were justied: Winnipeg and Manitoba were on the threshold of great things.  vw, px\"  The full version of this article can be found on page  of this week’s edition of The Orcadian. Patricia Long is a local tour guide based in Stenness, with a particular interest in social and family history.

He said the goal is to balance preventive measures and the economy until vaccines and effective drugs become available.But the worldrsquos third largest economy has fallen into a recession, and public discontent over his handling of coronavirus has sent his support ratings tumbling. Recent media surveys show public support for his cabinet has plunged below %, the lowest since he ed to office in December .Mr Abe declared the state of emergency on April  in several parts of Japan including Tokyo, expanded it to the entire nation later in the month, and then extended it until the end of May.Under the emergency, people were asked to stay at home and non-essential businesses were requested to close or reduce operations, but there was no enforcement.Since May , when the measures were lted in most of Japan, more people have left their homes and stores have begun reopening.Economy minister Yasutoshi Nishimura said recent data suggests infections have slowed enough and pressure on the medical system has fallen enough to allow a gradual resumption of social and economic activity.He said Tokyo, Kanagawa and Hokkaido, where the number of infections is still fluctuating, need to be watched closely.Inidual prefectures are allowed to impose their own measures.Tokyo governor Yuriko Koike said last week that the capital will reopen in three phases starting with schools, libraries, museums, and longer service hours for restaurants.She said theatres, sports facilities and other commercial establishments will be next, with nightclubs, karaoke and live music houses in the final phase.copy -.

a new and continuous cough or a high temperature # are being reminded to isolate themselves for seven days.Anyone  in a household where someone has symptoms should still isolate for  days.England says thank you, Boris. #You can now sunbath!#. Now, why does not Nicola change the dictate for Shetland  We would love to sunbath also, between the snow showers!!!!!😂😂😂😂How fortunate that the Scottish, Welsh and Irish leaders are maintaining their more sensible , balanced and wary approaches .Enlighten us Haydn, why is the infection rate lowerin England than in Wales and Scotland  I for one am not the least confused by the messages, just what is confusing you She niver agrees wIth what the rest off the UK IS DOINGBruce, you make it look asNicola, is acting like a Tory##..The Tory policy being##..me, me, me and melolSince you appear to not know, there has been confusion in Britain today about the actual meaning of BoJo’s statement yesterdayand , as I write, he is trying to explain himself away on TV. THAT shouldn’t be necessary should it  But, in true B J fashion he is resorting to make do and mend bluster. I am mindful of the blind leading the blind.Let decisions be made by scientists not ill equipped dabbling politicians.That little pat on the head should appeal to you !!But never mind Nicola is letting us out exercise twice a day. It is a shame we are all being channelled into the same crowded places, through the same gates and chokepoints whilst the wide-open spaces and beaches of Shetland are closed down to the majority!!In the present serious crisis she is in full agreement with Wales and Ireland but not with England. How fortunate that is.Britain is no longer ruled by England now that devolution has taken place. Boris Johnson claimed to be PM of 🇬🇧 Britain.He surely meant🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 not 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 Scotland or 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿Wales.Westminster is reluctant to let goIt is extraordinary sad news from Care Homes and Care Workers, but not unexpected. It takes months of training and years of experience to Barrier nurse to prevent cross-infection. Even the use of PPE requires extensive training. Our most vulnerable people conjugated into crowded homes was an accident just waiting to happen. Hopefully, next time, our care workers will have extensive professional training cross infection control with qualications and wages to match. Our most vulnerable, not all be herded into care homes but perhaps into a chalet system where separation and quarantine would be so much more effective..What is the R rate for Shetland  Looks like zero The politicians # all of them can #go away# .Do your gardening, go fishing, go for a walk whenever and where ever you want. Get the kids back into school. Get our economy open and people back to work.This is my opinion.Dive, e , e # incoming!!!What do you want  A Country with a minimised death toll but teetering on the brink of bankruptcy, or a country that#s suffered a higher death toll, and while perhaps shaken somewhat financially, is still resilient enough to continue without any great undue hardship for the survivors.England at present seems to be trying to steer an admittedly somewhat shaky course towards the latter, the rest of the UK, unfortunately seem hell bent on taking the direct route straight to the former.You cannot sustain increased Governmental expenditure and decreased Governmental income for any longer than the very short term, it called burning the candle from both ends#. We#ve been doing it now for  weeks### Very soon the time will come when Governmental leaders will have to make decisions on how many deaths are acceptable collateral damage to allow them to provide the services the majority need and keep their country afloat. The longer they leave it to make that decision, the more rushed, and by consequence, less appropriate, it is likely to be.There is no vaccine, there is no #cure#. Unfortunately some are going to have to take a hit for the team.It’s unfortunate that three centuries of free-market capitalism hasn’t generated enough wealth to feed the country for more than three months without going bankrupt but don’t worry Michael. Many people share your concerns about the economy and the government is onto it:A confidential Treasury assessment of the coronavirus crisis leaked to Theargues that it will require measures including a two-year public sector pay freeze in order to “boost investor confidence# in the British economy. So, a round of grateful applause for the NHS Staff, Care Workers, Police and everyone at London Transport.I hope the nurses are enjoying all the clapping and rattling of pots and pans every Thursday because that is all they are going to get.It is reassuring to know that things really are ing to normal.At least a public sector pay freeze will not discriminate. It will apply equally across the board and affect everyone from care home cleaners on minimum wage to the head of health and social care at Labour controlled North Lanarkshire council, salary £,“Some are going to have to take a hit for the team.”Yes Michael, in more ways than one.Well put, Malcolm.Incidentally, there is no freeze on public sector wages. Typical nonsense and  information being leaked, another left-wingPR leak from socialist civil servant perhaps I think it was the the Argntine president when speaking about Covid  said, #you can recover from a drop in GDP, you cannot recover from death#Fernández makes a good point. The Argentine economy is taking a battering and so is our own but we need to see things in perspective:Last month, Morningstar ran an article about the likely effect of the Coronavirus lockdown on share idends to be paid out by U.K. companies listed on the London Stock Exchange.It set out four possible scenarios, best-case, worst-case, and two “realistic” estimates within that range. In the best-case scenario, overall idends fall % to £. billion, and in the worst they more than halve to £. billion.More recent comments in The Financial Times suggest that we are heading towards a midway point between the best-case and worst-case scenarios while Reuterswarned of a possible % drop in idends “ the situation continues to worsen.”If the economy can afford idend payments of £ billion during the lockdown, I suspect that it is strong enough to recover. Of course, the FT and Reuters are known to be simmering cesspits of socialist subversion, so possibly more fake news.p.s.For the avoidance of any unnecessary tantrums:“The Morning Star” is three words with two spaces whereas “Morningstar” is just one word with no spaces.The simple fact is unavoidable this virus is here to stay. One day we will all meet it. The single most important thing is to keep the numbers down, so ICUs are not swamped, learn the best therapies to reduce the death toll as much as is practical and research for treatments and a vaccine. Try and avoid peak outbreaks, especially in winter, when the flu   covid combination will be nasty. Isolate our most vulnerable, maybe for a very long time and leave people to chose. I am approaching  years old and have no intention of isolating forever. In due course, I will get this virus and take my chances. I would instead rather enjoy my time than clamber fearfully into a sterile hole forever!!! As for Sturgeons exercise twice a day, she can stick that where the sun does not shine. The simple fact is being fit is perhaps my and everyone best chance for survival, twice a day exercising and the rest of my time on my sweet derriere is stupid, just as Nicola#s latest dictates!!!Ian#s reply to Malcolm#s well reasoned contribution oddly fails to address it.Why I’m reminded of the proud mother watching her son taking part in the passing out parade at Sandhurst.She noticed that everyone was out of step apart from her son!Oh dear, did I just read #BO JO#s policy actually worked# Thats plainly pants, pure and simple.Briefly, to Michael#s point, it is only recently that we paid off our war debt to the USA, so some financial mechanisms will be found.But I think I heard Portugal went into lockdown straight after their first COVID  death, whereas the UK waited for over a hundred. Plainly things could have been very dferent, very much better, and acting quicker would have been far cheaper, with far less loss of le, and a quickerto a ing economy.But it would have also required people being put before profit right from the start.So it really had been business as usual from the bottom feeding disaster capitalists that run the UK.#BO JO#s policy actually worked# indeed.That would be laughableit wasn#t so tragic.Sadly without vaccines and anti-virals, it is that simple. The fact is it has only just started and will be with us until we are all immune or dead. Let us pray for the former and immunity by vaccination. To coin a cliche, it will be total isolation for the most vulnerable until herd immunity develops, as with every infectious viral disease in human history! Development of immunity and resistance is what will stopCovid  eventually, nothing , as withPolio, Smallpox, Measles, Herpes et alNo. We need to keep as many people alive as possible until vaccine is developed.People are not simply expendable.Effective PPE supplies and speed of sufficient testing is critical to this.The Tory led, Tory delayed UK response has been woeful on these.No scope for argument there.Thousands have died that need not have.No scope for argument there either.It has been an ideologically misled catastrophe. genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced # genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced #But now that you point out about all those genetic iations, we probably ought to phone them and tell them to call of the hunt since they#ve probably not thought of that. Best just let nature take its course and get the economy on track with hundreds of thousands of deaths, a swamped NHS and a profoundly sick and worried population.Bo Jo#s policy was actually endorsed and followed to the letter by all the devolved Governments of the Uk until we got our knickers in a twist about a slogan. I never realised Nicola was a # bottom feeding disaster capitalists # for endorsing Bo Jo#s policy for so long. She only on Sunday became confused and what a fuss out that she made. On the bright side, we may legally exercise twice daily now, what outstanding leadership!Ian your unwavering faith in BoJo the clown, in the absence of any logical rationale or evidence for doing so, is truly astonishing.Robbie, I have no faith in any politician, but I do find Bo-Jo so much better than the other clowns in the circus. I love the way he routed the remoners, destroyed the Socialist horror of Corbyn and so antagonised, confounded and confused his opponents. Most are left with nothing by puerile and infantile comments to make, such as Bo-Jo the Clown. Is that Robbie the level of your wit and argument Again, Tory apologist spin from Tinkler. From mid-Jan through Feb Boris missed  COBRA meetings on COVID  to which Sturgeon was not invited.Yes the UK#s other parliaments fell into line once the Bullingdon Club realised there was to be no Britains Open for Business, herd-immunity-now approach. Elements of that thinking lingered on and are resurfacing now, not the least within the twisted outpouring of local eugenicists.Best information as of   .On that basis I think we need Nicola Sturgeon down here in England as well!Act in haste, repent at leisure seems to sum up such weakness.I am trying very hard toto see things from your perspective, but I cannot ignore the indicators and commentary that indicates that the UK economy will officially be in recession by the end of  Q.GDP has fallen by % in the first quarter of this year and predicted to be possibly as high as % in the second quarter.The Bank of England has tried to put a brave face on things by saying #the impact is likely to be temporary with activity rebounding strongly once social distancing measures are lted#. The question is when will social distancing be lted.Are you advocating that we just wait and see how things pan out, maybe the idea of a V shaped recovery will happen in the rd and th quarters, a vaccine will be developed in time and the world can go back to the #old normal#A simple warning from history # Recession , Depression, War.Recession, depression, war. Exactly. We know that the mortality rate is roughly .%. UK population is approx  million. Let#s say we just let the virus take its course, albeit slowed due to some adjustments to how we work and % of the population catch it. An effective treatment or vaccine is by no means guaranteed. % of  million is . million. .% of that is about , deaths. Then there are the hundreds of millions of working days lost to people off sick with the virus. Then there are the people suffering long term consequences of the virus and the cost of caring for them. How is this a recipe for a healthy economy  How will this level of death and suffering motivate investment or spending  Where does this assumption that we can just get going again like things were before come from  The world has changed. I know it feels good to bury our heads in the sand and think we can just go back to how things were and let a few old folks die. But that is profoundly naive. There is no simple answer. Except Mr. Tinkler#s. Make of that what you will.Ali asks: # genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced #I don#t know Ali.I#m not a dentist.To my understanding there does not need to be an exact genetic match for vaccines to be sufficiently helpful, but as I can#t trace my male line back over countless generations maybe Ali should consult a bard or a sage instead.There is, and has been, something of a medical research race on for understanding of transmission, for patient management treatment and for vaccines.Prompter action would have kept more folk alive longer whilst progress was made. The usual suspects are welcome to argue that and which way they may like, but it won#t change matters.There has been medical research and hard work for years into a reliable vaccine for corona viruses. How are they doing on that front  You don#t need to be a dentist to find that outYes Ali, but you do need to know the dference between a Virus and Venus, RNA and DNA, a vaccine and socialist vacillation, that is where humanists and left-wing ideologues come up a little short!!As I#m not a puller of teeth its a challenge to tell Ali how this virus dfers from the common cold, or why the research may be getting more funding and focus than the industry and government gave previously.You stated that you don’t need to be a dentist to find that out but, to be fair and reasonable about this , someone with medical training is likely to be better equipped than someone without to come up with insights which could be useful. In all probability Ian will not strike gold but how thankful we would behe did !!Fake news  Trump tried to buy Moussa and replace the old stone buildingswith a shiny new tower and Miss Sturgeon will use the proceeds to building a border wall.The deal came unstuck when China claimed Shetland as part of its North Sea and Atlantic territorial waters. It is understood that Miss Sturgeon has been learning Madrin while Scotlandis locked upOwen Jones has denied that he supports Identity politics, woke culture and he is not a social justice warrior.CNNhires Greta Thunberg to appear on a  as an expert on Covid .Best not to bother with why UK has biggest obesity problem in Europe. Such inquiry requires social science, some sociological imagination and a grain of empathy.Much easier to blame those poor plebs who haven#t got a grip.No need to invest on ending intergenerational deprivation and increasing opportunity too.Playgrounds for schools in poorer parts of our cities Why bother.Simples Peter, integrate #Care# for young and old into the NHS. That would include a voucher towards joining a gym or active participation sports club for every citizen irrespective of wealth. Those who chose not to use it, be it on their heads, it is their own health and wellbeing which will suffer. Covid  is ruthless with the obese and unfit,blame and empathy are not part le and death struggle of potentially fatal illness.Ian#s suggestion does nothing to end intergenerational deprivation, aka poverty. Poverty, and other social ills, can result in obesity in ious ways.Obesity simply is not automatically a #lestyle choice#.To suggest so is to indulge in inflammatory victim blaming and victim shaming.Not all single parents on benefits, depending also on whatever the Foodbank might provide, can easily promote healthy lestyles for all of their children.Many are struggling with issues beyond Ian#s limited appreciation.Seven year olds don#t generally make lestyle choices. Fat cells, once over produced in response to whatever unwelcome stimulus, don#t simply disappear. They hang around calling to be filled.Not all parents have time or money to afford Shetland Recreational Trust#s offerings.They dont all have the ability to get their children to the leisure facilities.It is only #simples#you take an uncaring and simplistic approach. Ian knows this intellectually as it has been pointed out more than once. Yet he persists. Odd. A little more fellow feeling might stem his approach.All I am suggesting Peter is an attempt to control excessive eating of Junk foodswith integrating our NHH with free access to all to a gym or active participation sports club for every citizen irrespective of wealth. Just how can that be #to indulge in inflammatory victim blaming and victim shaming. #Where are you getting your figures on childhood obesity in Shetland from Ian  Surely not from the newspaper article you’ve linked below, which is from  and quotes figures for adults from  It is mildly reassuring that Ian Tinkler has #no faith in politicians# presumably including BoJo the Clown. This Government has bungled it#s handling of the Covid- crisis on an industrial scale. Exercise Cygnus in October  highlighted serious shortcomings in the UK#s Emergency Preparedness Resilience and Response Plan to a pandemic. Since then PPE stock levels were run down by %. Being made aware of the virus in December  no preparation was started until March when the herd immunity strategy was quickly jettisoned. Britain refused to participate in the EU procurement scheme for PPE leading to farcical attempts to obtain PPE from some guy in Turkey who made T shirts. Unsurprisingly the PPE was unusable. Rather than get ventilators from established manufacturers The Government ignored their offers of help and went to Tory donors like James Dyson who managed to produce  of the  needed. Flights bringing  people a day into the Uk without test or quarantine only stopped  months after lockdown. People being placed in care homes without being tested. Unbelievably lockdown is being eased in England without test track and trace being implemented. We have the second highest death total in the world.England does not have the highest number of deaths in Europe, and England has a far higher recovery rate than many in European nations.The Care homes in England have about half the death rate of their Scotish counterparts and the Death Rate per capita in England is considerably less than in Scotland. Just to keep you up to date, Nicola has just today,reversed her political decision on lockdown. The statistics are available online however, ferreting the Scotish records is problematic. For some reason, the SG is far less transparent with the Data than the English. Figures below are slightly out of date but show the comparison.The population of England. ,, No of deaths. , Death ratio. .So in summary, the gospel according to Ian Tinkler is that BoJo the clown hasn#t put his size  feet in it at all as the death rate is higher in Scotland than in England.Ian, I think your calculations are the wrong way round and show what you might call a #survival ratio# rather than a death ratio. There#s also a decimal place error but for the purposes of comparison that doesn#t really matter.If you work it out in deaths per million of population you can see that Scotland has a lower death rate.England:  from      per mPlease do not put words in my mouth Robbie. What is happening in Scotland is down to The SG and Nicola, as theFM and former Health Secretary. Trying to make political capital out of people dying is morally reprehensible, obnoxious and malign. Bo-Jo and Nicola have equal responsibility for any mistakes, they both shared and followed the best science they could. For once they were in harmony and agreement. The NHS was not overwhelmed, lives were saved, be thankful for that. Fortunately, the injection of disinfectant, we will leave to a real clown who is now mainlining hydroxychloroquine!!! Perhaps Darwinism will step in soon! God save America.Oh this is too funny to pass by! Mr Tinkler creates his own, entirely , Coronavirusfigures to make a political point and is immediately shot down. He then states that only an idiot would try to use coronavirus figures to make political points. Well, on that we totally agree # only an idiot would.Ray try and understand the dference between political comment and malicious point-scoring.ian seems to be using dferent measurement criteria between scotland and england and even dferent data within scottish figures. on  may he has scottish figure  but on  may it has gone up to .the lower figure is the one for deaths from positive test cases, the higher one is all deaths where covid is mentioned on death certicate.in his original calculation for england he uses positive test figuresthus for accurate comparison he should use the lower scottish figure also. this is what alan leask has done and produced an accurate comparison.The vaccine is focusing on a very small sequence in the S viral protein which enables it to bind to the ACE receptor on human cells in mucosal linings and infect them. There isn’t much room for mutation there without the virus losing its ability to bind to that receptor. Other mutations mentioned, in other parts of the virus, enable “strains” of virus to be tracked. Reproduction is subject to errorand billions upon billions of virus are being produced, so mutations will take place. However the critical site for immunity is probably conserved.I did read it Ian # that’s how I know it’s completely irrelevant. Now you’ve produced aarticle from ! So, just to be straight, your reasoning for easing the Coronavirus lockdown in  is a  year old newspaper article about obesity  I don’t think that’s the real reason is it now  Could it be that you’re putting your political prejudices first again  Not that it matters of course. Now even the FMs most recent slight adjustments to lockdown only allow five-mile car run to a place to exercise. That does not get a Glaswegian far from the centre of Glasgow. It just does exactly the worst thing, concentrates people together in highly populated areas. The counterargument regards spreading the virus into new areas is fallacious. Just in case our FM had not noticed, the virus has already disseminated widely and in the great outdoors of Scotland Social Distancing is a lot easier than in Glasgow or any other city.So, the death ratio in Scotland from Covid , according to the self-proclaimed STE expert is .. That, I believe, is patently incorrect, not to mention entirely absurd, and would mean that . people from  person had died from the disease. As an analogy, based on a notional teeth count,someone had, let’s say, ten teeth and subsequently had one removed then the ratio of teeth removed to those not having been removed would be  , or %. The “survival ratio”, as someone referred to, ie the teeth remaining, is the remainder as a proportion of the whole, in other words  out of , or %, assuming that the dentist extracts within remit. The two equations are not inter-changeable. This, however, from the statistical and other real experts acknowledged in their fields is very interesting: A good point and as always I appreciate a good dental analogy to illustrate the dference between death and survival rates. I know here we like to fight tooth and nail about such things, but it is good to see someone #filling in# the gaps here. And as for Mr. Tinkler, he certainly puts the effort in and even though we may disagree, it keeps things on here lively. He deserves a plaque.Michael Inkster, Try .Decimal point one, not  to  . Actually maths was wrong recalculation above. Simples absurdly so, evenmental arithmetic was a little rusty first time round!!Since it appears to be much more virulent and deadly than flu the future would seem to be less than rosy.In fact, depressingly gloomy and all the statistical information so diligently presented will be consignedto no more than being purely academic and capable of making not a scrap of dference.I am more intrigued into the sources of  major viruses having a global impact from China, and what is the Chinese Government doing about the health and safety of food products and the, apparent, lack of any proper procedures in which to prevent further outbreaks  What is the WHO doing in regards to monitoring potential infections from China and or limiting the movements of live animals in poorly developed hygiene conditions, allegedly We hear the origins of such viruses, but no information regarding preventative measures taking place to restrict and confine such health hazards within an area and to stop this from spreading further afield  Why has there been no ban on the sale and transport of certain foods from China Is the whole process of live animal meat production having to be totally reviewed by the Chinese government or is it a case of waiting until something even greater forces them to act Should we enforce our own standards of Health and Safety onto other countries in terms of a trade agreement or should market forces have a free for all without any restrictions, including Health and Safety  Should this be reviewed JOSEPH NIVEN has hit the nail squarely on the head. The statistics are not clearly put and blaming one UK politician, BoJo or Sturgeon is wrong.

It looks increasingly likely that any exit from lockdown and safe re-opening of tourism and hospitality businesses could be during the low season.#Without financial support to tide them over, that could be the nail in the coffin for many businesses.“In Shetland, like where in Scotland, earnings from tourism during the spring and summer months sustains people through the winter and it is a real worry that coronavirus hit just when the visitor season was starting.#It is clear that a -month plan, at least, is needed to ensure that viable businesses can survive to provide a living for their owners and be ready to safely welcome visitors again when the time is right.”Speaking via video link earlier this week, Mr Carmichael welcomed the Chancellor of the Exchequer#s announced extension to the furlough scheme to protect jobs – but added more was needed to help tourism.“Here in the Northern Isles we particularly see that in the visitor economy, which is crucial to us,# he added.#The assistance for bed and breakfast operators, or operators of self-catering accommodation, leaves too many people without the assistance they need.“A support scheme that finishes at the end of August, or September or whenever it will be, simply will not be adequate in parts of the country such as ours.#Those parts of the country that have seasonal tourism require a -month programme, or  the tourism industry that will be left to be resurrected at the end of this process will be that much weaker, and the rebuilding and recovery that much more dficult.” on Wednesday also heard from struggling tourism businesses.One BB owner said she had been unable to apply for support funds as they required applicants to have paid businesses rates, whereas she paid domestic council tax.Living Lerwick has also raised the plight of small tourism operators.Project manager Emma Miller said that as some did not have a business banking account they had been unable to apply for the Creative or Tourism and Hospitality Enterprises Fund, which opened in Scotland to support the industry. raquo"},{"url":null,"title":"more vessels but aprils gross tonnage is well down on last year ","story":"Lerwick Harbour saw a big reduction in shipping tonnage during April compared with the same month last year – although the number of arrivals was actually up slightly.A total of  vessels called, compared with  in April , but the overall tonnage dropped from , to ,grt.The deficit was partly due to no cruise ships callinglast year, although ferries, live fish carriers and oil traffic were all also down considerably.The April arrivals this year included  fishing boats,  workboats tenders,  ro ro ferries,  live fish carriers, eight oil boats, eight tugs, five tankers, five ferries and three pilot boats.The fishing vessels comprised  Shetland,  British, three Danish, two French and one Norwegian boat.For the first four months of the year the overall number of arrivals at Lerwick holds up reasonably well with  – , as compared to , in .

We will now develop our planning, referring to the national framework and our own unique local circumstances.#We will do all this in partnership with school managers, colleagues in transport planning, building services, health and safety and human resources, and in discussion with local unions.“We will share further information to school staff and parents and carers as soon as it is possible to do so. It is important to stress that the safety of all our children and staff will continue to be paramount in all our planning.”Chairman of the education and families committee George Smith highlighted the progress with remote learning for children and young people since the majority of Shetland’s schools and nursery settings closed on th March.The new technology will continue to support the blended approach to learning and teaching planned for August.“I have been extremely impressed with the response of our teachers, support staff and children and young people,# said Mr Smith.#Schools are delivering a range of learning activities suited to all the levels and needs of our learners.#I am very confident that all our staff will rise to the challenge of delivering education in this blended way, ensuring all pupils receive the highest quality education possible.”Mrs Budge also praised parents and carers.“During these challenging and uncertain times, we have been very grateful for the support we have received from parents,# she said.#They have been excellent in providing feedback to their schools on their children’s remote learning experiences.”Anderson High School and halls of residence.

The move is vital to secure a stronger future for the business which is urging politicians to support its drive to produce , hydrogen buses in the next four years.The  staff that remain would be more than a ten-fold increase in the number of employees inherited by the management team when it bought Wrightbus out of administration in October , with hopes to grow the workforce to , by the end of .“When we saved Wrightbus from administration last year, there were only about  employees, and since then we have grown the workforce to ,” said Mr Atwal.“The decision has been taken to trim the workforce to the size we believe we will need to see us through to the end of the year.”The redundancies are a necessary measure given the economic slowdown as a result of the current Coronavirus crisis. However, it has not altered the long-term vision of prosperity for the company.“Throughout the COVID- pandemic, while we furloughed a large section of the workforce, we also kept about  engineers, designers and sales staff working to make sure we can take future orders of buses and work on long-term projects, which will provide security and stability for Wrightbus in the coming years,” said Mr Atwal.The Wrightbus factory has created the world’s first hydrogen-electric double-decker bus, which emits only water and there is a great belief that in the coming years this will see a large number of orders come in.There are already strong sales for the delivery of buses in London and Aberdeen this year, with more cities due to follow suit.Mr Atwal said: “We see the future in zero-emission hydrogen and battery-electric transport and have positioned the business accordingly.

The announcement by management is therefore profoundly regrettable.“Management plans to make redundant  employees and to bring forward a phased-process of reducing agency staffing affecting up to  workers.

The whole reason we did it was to take our minds off it and give us ourselves a challenge, so it definitely helped us to not feel down in the dumps about the day that should have been.Starting at am, the -hour endurance feat took place on a treadmill outside, with stormy conditions adding to the challenge.It hit me on Thursday night that I should have been with my mates getting ready for the big day, he said.But we have it lined up for next year and it will be bigger and better, so we#re trying to stay positive.After volunteering to work at the Nightingale hospital in Belfast City Hospital, Amy is now back on the cardiac ward at the Royal Victoria Hospital.Adam said it was a nervous time for the family with uncertainty over how the NHS would cope.At the start it was the big unknown and everyone was panic-stations thinking they were going to be unprepared, said the former Ballinamallard United target man. We were really worried about front line NHS staff, but thankfully they#ve not been overwhelmed and we#re hoping there won#t be a second wave. It could very easily have gone the other way.On putting off moving into their first home together, he said it was just another inconvenience that many more were facing.There#s not a person that hasn#t been affected, with weddings, houses or holidays missed. So there#s nothing you can really do but accept it and wait.While missing his sporting le, Adam - whose side had reached the Irish Cup semi-finals - said he does not foresee ato competing any time soon.I think the Irish League will have to make a decision on playing games soon but I really don#t see how it#s financially viable, based on the league that is, he said.Obviously the English and Spanish leagues are set tosoon but they#re heavily financed by television revenue.The Irish League haven#t got that, so a lot of clubs would rely on the gate receipts with people coming to watch the games.If it does come back, it will be on a sort of half-cooked measure with restrictions on gates.I don#t see how clubs could afford to bring players back, and you would have to do testing as well, which will be costly.I really don#t envy whoever has to make the decision as there#s bound to be people upset and all sorts of fallout from it.It#s crazy times. As a player you really miss it, but I didn#t realise how much you miss the sport and the whole team environment until you don#t have it.Speaking personally, I would love to be back soon as I can but I don#t want to risk anybody#s safety.For more information about the fundraising campaign, visit uk.virginmoneygiving AmyEdgar  Belfast   Most ReadCoronavirus: Northern Ireland retail shops to get go-ahead to reopen soonOne further death and  new cases of Covid- in Northern IrelandThe Big Interview: Sinn Fein, the IRA and me - Mary Lou McDonaldBlundering Barry McElduff#s video sham exposed as gaffe-prone Sinn Fein man breaks social distancing measuresBelfast murder victim Kieran Wylie killed over dissident #tout# claim,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

But a second wave of Covid- in the autumn could disrupt these plans. Mr Donnelly said: If we ended up in a second lockdown, I don#t see how grammar schools could use academic selection to choose pupils for the following year.Teachers have been asked to predict grades for cancelled GCSE and A-level exams but it would be disastrous to do this for the transfer test. So much rests on the grade awarded.It would be unacceptable to ask a teacher to make a call as to whether a child gets into a grammar school or not. It would put immense pressure on teachers. It would poison our relationships with pupils and parents, and it would open the door to litigation.Peter Weir needs to make a clear statement reassuring primary school teachers that we will not be asked to project grades.Last year more than , pupils sat transfer tests which are used by the vast majority of grammar schools here to select pupils.Northern Ireland Commissioner for Children and Young People Koulla Yiasouma and head of the Catholic Church in Ireland Archbishop Eamon Martin have called for the exams not to go ahead this year.But their appeals are likely to be ignored despite P pupils having missed so much of the school year due to the coronavirus crisis.The Education Minister last week announced a phasedto school here from late August.He said the reopening would be subject to safety and medical guidance.But Mr Donnelly urged the minister to detail the social distancing measures that would apply so that schools could start making preparations now.We need to knowwe will be adhering to the existing social distancing rule of two metres in Northern Ireland, or whether it will be reduced to the World Health Organisation#s one metre guideline, he said.That#s crucial so we can make plans as to how to ide classes. Without that knowledge, we won#t know how many kids we can actually have in each classroom.In England there has been talk of around  children in a classroom. I don#t know how you adhere to social distancing with so many in a class.The west Belfast principal added: We need clear guidance from the minister as soon as possible so we can decideit#s necessary to split our classes of up to  children into three, four or even five groups. We must be told this by next month at the latest so we can map out the way ahead.Mr Donnelly said that as smaller classes were necessary, children would not be ing to school full-time.He added: We need to knowthe department will allow schools themselves flexibility in drawing up timetables orthe minister will direct the approach taken. And what approach will that be Will Peter Weir propose splitting groups into morning and afternoon sessions or will he want children to be in school for a full day but perhaps only two days a week Mr Donnelly also urged the Education Minister to send unemployed substitute teachers into our most deprived areas to help children during the pandemic.The Executive last week announced a £m fund to assist substitute teachers during the Covid- crisis. They are now being paid without being required to work.Mr Donnelly suggested that they could be deployed in deprived areas. There is widespread concern that our poorest and most vulnerable kids are destined to be the most disadvantaged as a consequence of the pandemic, he said.It would be an innovative step for Peter Weir to use this pool of teachers to help counter the adverse impact of the enforced school closures by allocating them to schools in communities with the greatest social and economic deprivation.It would be a way of targeting work on numeracy and literacy and also offering pastoral support to those kids who need it most.In response to the issues raised by Mr Donnelly, the Department of Education said that a very wide range of issues were under consideration. The department would be working closely with the whole education sector, including school principals, to develop appropriate guidance to assist schools with planning provision, it said.

So choose wisely.And he ended the live-stream of the Mass with a song I Gotta Wash My Hands - a parody of the old Beatles hit I Wanna Hold Your Hand.But the cleric also had serious messages, urging fairer treatment of front line workers and pleading for help for people in poorer parts of the world.Read More Priest follows up Sash joke with mental health messageCanon McPhillips started the service by revealing that , people saw his Mass the previous week, tuning in from all over Ireland, the UK, Australia, France, India, Denmark, Russia, Switzerland and the Philippines. It#s such a pity that we cannot take up a collection, he laughed, but he pointed out that people could still donate online.Canon McPhillips acknowledged that a few extra people were watching the virtual service yesterday as a result of what he called his little misdemeanour the week before.Read More I did it for the craic, says priest who played The Sash at Mass and put a smile on many a face amid pandemicAt first people last week thought the priest had made a mistake by playing the recording of The Sash, but he later admitted he did it for the craic to brighten parishioners# moods in the coronavirus lockdown.Fr McPhillips later rued the fact that he had received so much media attention for his prank. But he was soon back on the ball, adding that he wanted to welcome the Orange lodges of Ireland and indeed throughout the world who, he said, were joining him yesterday morning. He went on: As Father Dougal would say: #There#s nothing to beat a good Mass, Ted#.Canon McPhillips then turned to the more serious side of his service. He called for a more equal new world to emerge from the pandemic crisis.After his prayers and after celebrating Communion, he was joking again, saying he was so fit from all the walking and cycling he was doing that he might offer his services to the local GAA teams.He then launched into a stand-up comedy routine. One joke was about how he went to buy an ice-cream and the vendor asked himhe wanted hundreds and thousands. I said #we#ll start with one#, he replied.As he prepared to play his closing music, which last week was The Sash, Canon McPhillips said:I know you#re all sitting there waiting patiently looking forward to hearing my choice of music. So here goes.And that was the cue for I Gotta Wash My Hands to play.

Read her big interview interviewExpand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseSinn Fein President Mary Lou McDonald FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappSinn Fein President Mary Lou McDonaldHugh O#ConnellMay   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailThere are two conflicting narratives around how Mary Louise McDonald of Orwell Road, Rathgar, south Dublin, ended up being leader of this island#s most controversial political party.The first, proffered by her critics, is that having come from a Fianna Fail family, she unsurprisingly joined that party in the mid-s. As a bright, articulate and well-educated young woman, her stock was high and Bertie Ahern#s party was on the brink of three successive general election victories. But, recall some in Fianna Fail, she found her path to elected office blocked by the party#s old guard in Dublin West. So she upped and joined Sinn Fein.The other version, recounted by McDonald, is dferent, perhaps darker, but far more compelling. She vividly recalls the sadness in her house in the spring of  as the hunger strikes in the Maze Prison unfolded, how tense her mother was, the national grief, the protests. Four days before she turned , on May , , Bobby Sands died after  days on hunger strike. It was the moment at which I realised there was something radically, radically wrong in the politics and the le of the Ireland in which I was growing up, McDonald reflected last week.A cynic would ponder how such enlightenment could come so early in le and, evenit did, why it would take nearly  years before McDonald even considered joining the party that Sands represented.But it#s her story and she sat down to tell it in detail on Wednesday in Leinster House.Read MoreEilis O#Hanlon:Opinion Mary Lou McDonald is living proof that the real struggle now is about who gets to tell the story of the Troubles... perpetrators or victimsHugh O#Connell: Why have you agreed to sit down with the Sunday Independent Mary Lou McDonald: Well, I don#t think it#s a secret that there have been tensions between the Sunday Independent and Sinn Fein for quite some time. I mean, the editorial line has been, to our way of thinking, quite hostile towards us. But like everything  in le, things move on - people move on, the world changes, politics changes. We came out of the last election having taken more votes than any other political party. We#re now the largest political party on the island, we#re a party that#s preparing to enter into government.I think the Sunday Independent has changed as well, as I observe it from the outside. And I think my first preference would always be to have open dialogue and cordial relations. The Sunday Independent is a big newspaper - so I think now is the right time for us to talk.HOC: Do you think Gerry Adams would have done this MLMcD: I don#t know, to be honest. Was he ever asked HOC: You mentioned before that there were people in the party who didn#t want you to do this.MLMcD: There#d be an anxiety for people who either read or don#t read the Sunday Independent - that it has a very negative view that#s sounded out consistently. Lots of people believe that very often the commentary was unfair.HOC: Did you have to get clearance to do this interview MLMcD: No, absolutely not. Absolutely not.In , Mary Lou McDonald#s parents, Patrick and Joan, separated.The Pope was coming that September, she recalls. At that time - it sounds mad now - but this isn#t something you talked about. For your parents to announce they#d separated, it was a big deal.It was almost like a big scandal because it was one of the great taboos. I mean, back in those days it was a time when that awful term #broken families# was used, so I suppose you didn#t advertise the fact that you came from a broken family.Her mother raised her, her two brothers, Bernard and Patrick, and her sister Joanne. She is reluctant to talk about her relationship with her father. We#re very dferent and we#re very similar, I suppose. So it#s just one of those things, you know.Askedthe relationship was - and remains - dficult with her father, she says: Well, of course it was dficult. I mean your parents separate - of course that#s dficult - and you#re raised by your mother, so of course that#s one of the consequences of people#s parents separating. But I think that we managed it reasonably well.But my mam raised us, so of course that#s dferent thanyou grow up in a household where your parents don#t separate and where you#re all together.It is not something she wishes to discuss further.Privately educated at Notre Dame des Missions in Churchtown, McDonald studied English at Trinity, did an MA in European integration studies at the University of Limerick and went to DCU, where she abandoned a PhD in industrial relations.She doesn#t believe she grew up in privilege but acknowledges she had a privileged education. I#m very well educated and it#s amazing how sometimes those two things are confused. I#ve never been wealthy, I have no prospect to be wealthy and I have no ambition to be wealthy.HOC: [The hunger strikes] radicalised a lot of people. If you had been older at the time, would you have joined the IRA MLMcD: I don#t know, maybe. I certainly understand how it was that people volunteered to [join] the IRA - anybody looking at the circumstances from partition onwards, the nature of the northern state, everything that happened, how young people in particular took the fight to the British state. And, let#s face it, there have been previous chapters where previous generations of young people in a dferent context, but with the same impulse, had equally volunteered to the IRA and taken on that fight.HOC: You must have thought about it, in all the years since then MLMcD: Not hugely - you live the le that you live.HOC: I am putting it to you now. What do you think MLMcD: Yeah, I think there#d be every chance, every possibility. I grew up in Dublin so the Troubles and the conflict were the background noise of my generation.When we were growing up, we were at a distance from it in one sense […] but it was the framing narrative of news broadcasts, night in, night out, the political debate. So growing up in Belfast, growing up in Derry, growing up in Tyrone - they weren#t at a distance, they were right in the middle of the conflict. But you can only live the le that you have lived and I don#t think you can second guess yourself on what you might and what you might not have done. What doesn#t change is the politics that I have and my beliefs in terms of Irish freedom.HOC: A lot of bad things happened in the s, perpetrated by the IRA. You were  when the Enniskillen bomb happened, you were  when the Warrington bombing happened.MLMcD: I remember them.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseThe Enniskillen blast aftermath FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappThe Enniskillen blast aftermathHOC: How did that impact on your thinking about republicanism and what the IRA were doing at that time MLMcD: I just think that the whole cycle of armed actions and of violence just became debilitating for everybody.HOC: What did you think at the time about those acts MLMcD: I remember Gordon Wilson [whose daughter was killed at Enniskillen], I remember him recounting how his daughter had said goodbye to him. Anybody seeing that, it was absolutely heartbreaking, it was absolutely devastating. Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseGordon Wilson FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappGordon WilsonYou don#t see suffering like that and not feel devastated for the people who are hurt - and all of that happened in a political context. You cite two horric incidents - and they happened all round. That#s the thing when conflict takes a grip, it takes on almost a le of its own and it#s very, very hard to stop that cycle of violence.HOC: Did you think the IRA were wrong to do that  Did you think, #what an appalling act by a group of terrorists #MLMcD: I thought all of the acts of violence were awful.HOC: Did you think they were terrorist acts MLMcD: Back then - and now - I don#t regard that people who fought for Irish freedom were terrorists. I do accept that IRA actions hurt and killed a great many people. I also know that actions of state forces and actors and loyalist paramilitaries similarly caused grief and loss. For me, the important piece of this is not to label any people as #terrorists# but to accept that there was a political context, there was a reason.HOC: Did you see a political context back then MLMcD: Oh, absolutely. And I think that any thoughtful person would have understood. You couldn#t have understood what was happening  miles up the road unless you understood the political context.HOC: An awful lot of people back then - and now - would say that was terrorism.MLMcD: And others would say the terrorists were those who went onto the streets of Derry, and went into Ballymurphy and those who colluded with loyalist death squads to kill people. That argument is circular and frankly gets us nowhere. The important piece, to my way of thinking, is that you have to understand the #why# of a conflictyou#re going to contribute to its resolution.McDONALD#S political le began in Fianna Fail, sometime around  when she joined a branch in Dublin West.Fianna Fail is very comfortable for me, because of my family#s sort of political tradition - in a typical way, where Irish families split along the Civil War lines. My family were anti-treaty and that#s the origins of Fianna Fail.A former Fianna Fail politician, who knew McDonald at the time, said: She was always a star, she was highly intelligent and highly educated. My observation was there was no room for her in Fianna Fail. She was in the same constituency as Brian Lenihan Jr. There was no room for her there.McDonald denies this, says she never met or spoke to Bertie Ahern when she was in Fianna Fail, nor does she believe she was being groomed to run for election. If I was, that#s news to me.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseBertie Ahern FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappBertie AhernHer interest in the North was evident from her involvement in the Irish National Congress , of which she was chair, at around the same time. The organisation led a protest against an Orange Order plaque being erected on Dawson Street and some INC members were against the Good Friday Agreement.McDonald says she was not one of them, but did harbour concerns at the time about the removal of Articles  and  - the State#s territorial claim to the North - from the Constitution.I suppose at the end of the day, people figured that the negotiators who had gone in, who had thrashed all of this out in all of its aspects, had landed on the best available deal at the time, she says now.The best available deal was sold to hardline republicans by Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness - a feat McDonald says she viewed as incredible at the time. She joined Sinn Fein not long after that.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseSinn Fein’s Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappSinn Fein’s Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinnessHer middle-class background was not to everyone#s liking. In , when she was picked to run for Europe, one disgruntled party activist, speaking to the Sunday Independent, bemoaned the party picking a spanking new middle-class candidate over an experienced, long-serving working-class candidate.Not that she cared. Then, or now. Obviously I am a middle-class woman. I am who I am. How I was raised and everything, yeah absolutely. It#s not a big thing for me but, yes, I was amused at times, when I initially came on the scene, that I was written up as very posh - like, the poshest human being that ever lived in Ireland. I used to throw my eyes to heaven and say #Oh, for God#s sake#.HOC: You were a favourite of Gerry Adams, weren#t you MLMcD: Yeah, I probably was. Yeah.HOC: How did that make you feel MLMcD: It was grand, yeah… It#s nice to be affirmed, it#s great to be given the chance, it#s great to be given opportunities. It#s great, then, to go out and do the best that you can with the opportunities that you have, to be part of a team, work together. [But] there was lots of other people coming up as well.HOC: You were the party#s MEP candidate in Dublin. You were a big deal.MLMcD: I was the first Sinn Fein MEP, so that was a little bit of history at the time. That was a big deal, that was a huge big deal.HOC: So that put you up ahead of anyone  up-and-coming in the party.MLMcD: Oh, it was a huge deal for me, obviously personally. But it was a hugely big deal for the party in the city and nationally.HOC: In August , you spoke at a Sinn Fein event to commemorate Sean Russell, who was the IRA chief of staff during World War II and is viewed as a Nazi collaborator. Why did you do that  [Russell died in  on a German U-boat travelling to Nazi Germany where he was seeking support for the IRA#s efforts to reunite north and south.]MLMcD: I don#t believe that anybody actually believes that he was a Nazi collaborator. He was certainly a militarist. He was certainly somebody who saw in pretty stark terms that Britain#s problem was Ireland#s opportunity. So there was a commemoration there annually. I was asked to speak at it and I did.HOC: Do you regret speaking at it MLMcD: No. I mean, there were members of his family who still lived in Fairview. Some of them still lived in London and used to come back for the commemoration.HOC: A lot of people would be appalled that you#d speak at a commemorative event for someone like Sean Russell.MLMcD: He was a militarist, but he was not a Nazi collaborator. There#s nothing to support that contention. My assessment of him is that he saw in very narrow terms the struggle for freedom in a framework that was, as I said, #Britain#s problem is our opportunity#. I think that was misguided,that assists you in your line of questioning.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseOn speaking at commemorations: #If you examine the words that are spoken ... you will find that there is an explicit running theme about reconciliation# FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappOn speaking at commemorations: #If you examine the words that are spoken ... you will find that there is an explicit running theme about reconciliation#HOC: You don#t have any regrets about doing it MLMcD: It#s like I said earlier on - you have to make your decisions, do your work.HOC: Some people might see that as testing your mettle, your preparedness to back people associated with the IRA, the republican movement, and Sinn Fein who wouldn#t be commemorated by other parties. Do you see it that way MLMcD: No, because I#ve spoken at countless commemorations since and will speak at countless commemorations again.HOC: In , you spoke at a commemoration for the Tyrone Volunteers in Strabane. A lot of victims# campaigners were very annoyed by that. Kenny Donaldson, of the victims and survivors groups, the South East Fermanagh Foundation, said you were associating yourself with a number of commemorative events to those within the republican movement, many of whom were serial killers who murdered their own neighbours because of sectarian and ethnic-motivated hatreds.MLMcD: Well, I don#t accept that assessment - although I absolutely accept the fact that there are survivors and victims across society who need to be acknowledged and supported.HOC: But they feel that you kind of give them two fingers when you do that MLMcD: No. I would invite you to examine the words that I said at that commemoration. What you will find is that a great deal of what I had to say was about healing and reconciliation.And in fact,you examine the words that are spoken at commemorations... you will find that there is an explicit running theme about reconciliation, about forgiveness, about forging a new future. They#re not occasions on which there is an attempt made to stir up hurt or offence for others. They are used as occasions to assess our republican progress.HOC: A lot of people see these as events that try to justy those actions. A lot of people are appalled by that.MLMcD: Lots of people, I#m sure, are equally appalled at commemorative events for the British army and for loyalism… Those things, those people mattered, they lived, they lived the le that they lived. We had a war, there was a conflict, they lost their lives in the course of that. They have families who live still on this island. I think it is not just valuable to remember, I think it#s essential to remember.HOC: So, IRA volunteers matter MLMcD: Of course they matter. Their people buried them too. Of course they matter.

Far from resiling from her two-decade defence of everything her predecessors in the republican movement did, McDonald, emboldened by her electoral success, defends them more vocerously now than ever before. It is a strategy which, objectively, is bearing fruit.With a spell as the lead opposition appearing likely, she is making the case for greater state intervention to deal with the fallout from the Covid- crisis. Much of this can be funded from borrowing, she argues. But it is not, as the Taoiseach said last week, free money.HOC: How do we pay for it eventually MLMcD: We work hard, we pay our taxes ... We made the point consistently - banks should not have a honeymoon period in respect of corporate tax. We#ve talked about people on very high incomes, and I#m not talking about people who are well paid…HOC: You#re talking about people on €,-plus MLMcD: €,-plus.[McDonald misspoke here. Sinn Fein#s manesto proposed a pc levy on income above €, - an effective third rate of income tax.]HOC: You think that#s a lot of money MLMcD: Oh, I thinkyou#re earning €,, lucky you, it#s a lot of money. The vast bulk of Irish workers earn less than €,, soyou#re earning €,, more power to you, fair play to you.HOC: It used to be €, and you#ve moved it to €, now, why was that MLMcD: I mean, you sht and move your policies all of the time. When you look at the maths and you have to balance the books and things have to add up and things have to be paid for, you make taxation decisions on that basis.HOC: Is it because it would appeal to more people on Orwell Road MLMcD: No... There#s lots of people on Orwell Road who don#t earn €, - most of them don#t. It#s a very small section of workers who are that lucky.Taxation isn#t an instrument of punishment or vengeance it#s the mechanism by which we raise the funds that collectively we need to provide for the services that we rely on. So it#s movable but, of course, what#s not a movable option is the reality thatyou have more, you pay more.HOC: One of the core wealth taxes in other economies is property tax, but you want to abolish that.MLMcD: If you live in a two-up two-down in East Wall or in Ballyfermot, your house is your sole asset. You#ll have spent your whole working le paying for it - oryou#re a younger person and you#ve negative equity. For some people. it nearly becomes an albatross around your neck.

Unfortunately, Guy has asked we pass on this.” ‘Guy’ is Guy Pearce, a British-Australian actor, musician and singer-songwriter and crucially, a man who made a guest appearance at Slaughtneil disco back in . While no reason is given for him deciding to pass on our offer to relive the memories, there is a good chance the trip in Sean McGuigan’s silver Renault  may have something to do with it. “I picked him up in Maghera town – I don’t know who got him there, but that’s where I lted him,” says the current club chairperson. googletag.cmd.push “We were going out the road and it just got immediately dark. It scared the wits out of the poor fella. He said, ‘Jesus mate, where are we going to ’. “The poor fella thought he was getting hijacked, but he went in and did all he needed to do.” Pearce was nearing the end of a three-year stint as ‘Mike Young’ in Australian sitcom ‘Neighbours’ after making his acting debut on the show in . Terry McIl was DJ at the time of Pearce’s visit and recalled how hordes of frenzied teenagers packed Slaughtneil hall to the rafters for a glimpse of the star. googletag.cmd.push “There were , people there the night Guy Pearce came. There was even a marquee at the side of Slaughtneil that night as well as the hall being packed.” he said. “They just came up with this idea that they were going to get Guy Pearce. I had to go and buy myself a radio mic for it. He was civil, a nice fella. “He was good with the people, chatty and friendly. Even with the photographs we have, the stage was packed because everyone was up to get autographs and that kind of thing.”  Among those who had made their way to Slaughtneil with fancy notions of chatting to the Neighbours star were three girls who ended up getting closer than they had bargained for. The rush to the front caused a bit of a crush, and amid the screaming and the heat, a few of the girls who were closest fainted. They were hastily dragged onto the stage by the bouncers. Cathy Rennie was one of those who were lted out of the crowd and said she was sure to make the best of a bad situation. “I don’t know how I got up near the front, to tell you the truth,” said the Dungiven woman. “I don’t even know what he was doing on the stage, whether he was singing or anything, but I just felt myself getting all faint. “The next thing there was somebody lting me. Two bouncers lted me up onto the stage and it was near where he was at. He just looked round and smiled at me and I touched his hand. “I think he had on a black leather jacket and I just grabbed him. It’s a wonder he didn’t take me for assault! “Then I was took to the back of the stage and there were a couple of girls sitting there who had fainted too. We had the best seats in the house.” Cathy recalls how the build-up to the event had reached fever pitch during the week when the details were finally confirmed in the local newspaper. “Momentum was building up all week at school that he was coming to Slaughtneil. I’m almost sure it was confirmed in the Mid Ulster Observer,” she said. “For him to come to Slaughtneil after us watching him on the TV was amazing. Neighbours was the main thing. It was on every day at five o’clock and you rushed home from school to watch it. “The whole thing was unreal, the excitement of ‘imagine you got talking to him’. It was the first time any of us had ever been somewhere there was a star. “We would never have experienced that before, apart from maybe Daniel O’Donnell or Barry McGuigan at the Castle. “I remember Barry McGuigan coming after he was the champion, the Clones Cyclone, and that was a big thing in Dungiven years ago, but Guy Pearce was after that. “It’s not like young ones nowadays who can go to a concert and see Westle, or Girls Aloud or One Direction or whatever. We never had anything like that in our lives. “When I think of Slaughtneil, I always think of that night. It was just class.” The teenagers of south Derry spent over  years filing into Slaughtneil hall, but, for many, the first occasion that springs to mind is that night in ’. Guy Pearce has gone on to have a successful career on both the screen and the stage, and the , who crammed into Slaughtneil hall will claim some credit for sending him on his way.

Shrouded in darkness on a Friday evening, its charms were not easily advertised, butthe mountain would not come to Muhammad, then Muhammad must go to the mountain. But how would south Derry’s teenage prophets get there  “Putting on the Ulsterbuses and all the coaches is what really got it going. They came in fairly quickly and it did the trick,” said current club chairperson Sean McGuigan. “Darragh’s and McLaughlin’s only had maybe four buses and they were a wee bit reluctant to send good buses to the disco. Ulsterbus were a great saviour.” googletag.cmd.push Every Friday evening, a group of hardy bus drivers would set off from towns across Derry, delivering the county’s youth to Slaughtneil hall. It wasn’t for everyone. Pat McGlade, who drove the Draperstown bus for a brief period as the disco was drawing to a close, beat a hasty exit. “I was never at Slaughtneil in my le, I didn’t even know where it was at, but the first night I landed, we got them off and the fighting started,” he said. “I said, ‘JesusI get out of here tonight, I’ll not be back!’. I’d never seen the like of it – they were killing each other that night!” googletag.cmd.push His predecessor, Loup man Sean Glendinning, approached the journey with a little more relish. “They all called me Big Sean for some reason. I wasn’t that big, but I would have gave an odd roar out of me and they sort of listened to me!” he said. “I got on well with them, really. You can’t put old heads on young bodies. You have to be flexible, andyou work with young people, they’ll work with you. “We had no real hassle on the bus, the young people were easy talked to. I gave them a bit of space and they knew how far they could go with you. I never had any hassle. “You’d have got a bit of fighting, but you never passed any remarks on it. It wasn’t too bad, just a bit of a row. “I used to tell the young boys thatthey wanted to box, to go and do it in the ring and earn a bit of money. “The worst bit was whenever the snow was on, you got a bit of a snowballing! There was many a hairy night about it now, but we made it, we got there.” Every night the fleet of drivers was ushered into the club’s kitchen and were wined and dined in traditional GAA style, with plenty of sandwiches, tea and biscuits to be had. “We were well looked after up there,” said Sean. “Once you got there, they took you into the club and Willie Hampson was the main man. You got your tea and all the drivers got a fiver. “You had men from everywhere. The Ulsterbuses came from Kilrea and Dungiven and you had men from all round. Good times and good chat. There was the odd lie told! “The kettle was going and there would be biscuits and a bit of craic. There were four or five in at one time and one or two would have stayed out to keep an eye on the buses.” Willie Hampson is held in high esteem by all the drivers and his hospitality on a Friday night is remembered fondly when they recall the disco. “Willie Hampson looked after the bus drivers and he was some man,” said Colm McGuigan, who started driving the Dungiven bus around . “He used to try and give us all a fiver, but we would have left it all and split it at Christmas time. I would say Slaughtneil got me through twelve Christmases when the weans were young!”  Colm is the current Derry GAA kit man and never tires of reminding the Slaughtneil players of his role in their success. “I used to slag the Slaughtneil men when they came on the Derry team that it was me built their club, bringing all the weans over,” he said. An Ulsterbus employee, he did the school runs by day from Limavady depot, and it was after some pestering from a few of the pupils that the routes to Slaughtneil expanded. “When I started, it was only Dungiven going over to it. They would have gathered at the bus depot and two buses would have left,” said Colm. “A year or so into it, the school weans used to say ‘would you not put a bus on to Slaughtneil ’ “I was in Limavady depot at the time, so I talked to a few of the drivers and we said we’d book a bus ourselves in our own name.” Demand for the bus shot up as hordes of teenagers clamoured for a place every Friday night, but the Troubles still cast a shadow over South Derry in the s and s, and the chances of stumbling on a security checkpoint with an overloaded bus were high. “Some nights there were maybe  weans on the bus, but we were lucky, we were never stopped,” said Colm. “I remember we left Limavady during holiday time with about  in a -seater. Another  or  got on in Drumsurn, another  or  in Ballerin and by that time I was looking down the bus thinking ‘Jesus, how many is in this thing ’ “When I got theof Glenullin, there were  weans standing and I was thinking ‘what am I going to do here ’ “I put the  weans on anyway and they were up in the racks and everywhere, so I said to myself I couldn’t go down onto the main road with these weans. “I had to put the bus into first gear to get it over the top of that hill past the Gaelic pitch and I took it over the back roads into Slaughtneil. “I came back that way and once I got those weans left off in Glenullin, I was happy enough to go down onto the main road again after that!” In order to reduce the potential for mischief on the buses, the GAA club provided bouncers who would travel on the bus with the drivers. Colm generally preferred to police the bus himself and recalls one night in particular when support came from an unlikely corner. “One night I couldn’t get a driver, so I had to drive it myself. This boy got on with a bag of drink,” he said. “Usually you weren’t allowed it, they just poured it down the drain, but this boy was a bit older than the rest of them and had a bag, so I took it off him and told him he’d get it after. “I put it in around the cab. He behaved badly on the way over and I warned him a few times, so coming back again I said, ‘you behave yourself til we get home.’ “He didn’t do so bad until we got theof Drumsurn and he went clean mad again, wrecking and tearing at the back of the bus. “We got to Limavady and he came to me and said, ‘I want my drink’ and I said ‘you’re not getting it, you didn’t behave yourself.’ “He drew out and he hit me and knocked the glasses off me. He had long hair and I managed to grab him, and the next thing was he landed out onto the street. “I looked and the police were sitting in the Landrover. I could see them coming and I thought ‘Jesus I’m in bother.’ “He got up and ran and the policemen chased him. The two cops came down then and askedI was alright andI wanted to press charges. “I said ‘naw you’re alright’ and they said, ‘you did a brave job with him anyway’ and I never heard another word about it.” Despite the odd bit of trouble here and there, Colm is full of praise for the Slaughtneil clubmen who kept things under control. “All the boys that were looking after the disco were pioneers. They were great clubmen and they were never short,” he said. “Even when the younger boys that were going to the disco in the early days, when they got past it they were doing their bit at it too. “It gave them a serious name in those early days, and it put a bit of a push on the other clubs about the county to make their club as financially strong as Slaughtneil.” With his parents’ house being in Maghera, Colm was able to take advantage by dropping in for a visit while the hundreds of teenagers he transported were dancing just a few miles out the road. “Every Friday night I would have reversed the bus up to the side of the house and watched The Late, Late Show with my mother and father,” he said. “You had to rush back to get up before the parents came up in cars. It would take you  or  minutes to get out, but it was well-marshalled and it was a good time for the weans.” The bus drivers who braved the roads leading to Slaughtneil disco kept teenagers dancing in the South Derry hills. They became the trustworthy ferrymen of teenage dreams.

Sean McLaughlin, the owner of Georges Bar in Bishop Street, had organised a night of live music to celebrate the le of Shenda McKenna on her first anniversary on April . Due to the coronavirus the gig was cancelled, but undeterredthe the singers moved online where they played on Facebook Live streaming service. Music lover Shenda was just  when she passed away. We wanted to mark the anniversary of our beautul friend Shenda, said Mr McLaughlin. We would have loved for nothing more than celebrating her le in the bar, however, the musicians agreed to go online and the event was able to go ahead and raised pound,. googletag.cmd.push Georges Bar is well known for its live music and craic and the regulars regard each otheras family. We call it the Georges family, said Mr McLaughlin, who has owned the bar for seven years. We have a long tradition of charity fundraisingand we would raise a lot of money for the Playtrail, so this seemed like the perfect way to remember Shenda. She was in here every weekend and she loved music. Last week, Georges Bar held another fundraiser in aidof the late Pat ODonnell, known affectionately as Wee Pat, who passed away last Christmas Day aged . Pat was a stalwart of Georges and was part of the furniture here for a number of years, said Mr McLaughlin. googletag.cmd.push Sadly, we lost Pat on Christmas Day , and that void has never, and will never, be filled. Pat had travelled the world and worked looking after garment factories in the likes of Madagascar and Mauritius. His stories were legendary and he lived a really full and interesting le. He was like a piece of the furniture in here and he was in almost every night when he lived in Mountjoy Street and later Abbey House. He was the oldest person in the bar and he had a real love of music. He used to always ask Sean McCafferty to play The Lakesof Pontchartrain for him but we never knew why and then when Sean played it on Thursday a cousin of Pats messaged from Canada to say he lived just a few blocks from Lake Pontchartrain, so now we know! The night in aid of Wee Pat took place on Thursday, May , and raised a further pound for the Foyle Food Bank, bringing the total raised to pound,. Its been really nice to raise this moneyeven though the bar cant open and Im sure its badly needed at this time, added Mr McLaughlin.

South Derry film fans’ closest venues under the initial plan would have been Derry city, Portrush and Antrim, but plans are currently underway to bring the tour to Cookstown and Dungannon. Conor Moran, from The Big Drive Inn, told the County Derry Post that they hope to show four dferent screenings per day. He said: “We use an LED screen and the brightness is a lot sharper than a projector. Our movies can run from  o’clock in the day til  o’clock at night. googletag.cmd.push “In the afternoon, at pm and pm, we will be showing more family-orientated films. At pm, we’ll show a classic film and at pm a blockbuster. “The plan is to do this as a tour of Northern Ireland and keep it going as long as Covid- lasts.” The company had already begun to tour in the Republic of Ireland before it was placed into lockdown, with shows in Dundalk and Cavan, and are now resuming plans to move north. In keeping with strict hygiene guidelines, the organisers say they will be taking all necessary precautions and implementing social distancing. “We encourage arriving in, staying in and leaving in your car so it’s complete family isolation,” said Conor. googletag.cmd.push “Toilets will be provided, we provide portaloos. Your temperature is taken on entering the toilet by an automated temperature taker. “If your temperature is too high you wouldn’t be able to enter the toilet. All toilets are sanitised and there is state-of-the-art technology checking temperatures. “All toilets are sanitised after each use. There will be sanitisers on site as well and we’ll be encouraging people to sanitise. “We have a host of other processes in place to protect against Covid-. All transactions are cashless, so you buy your ticket online. “We won’t be offering any food yet, until the lockdown eases. If that’s during the tour, we’ll look at doing some food, but for the first few events, we’ll be encouraging people to bring their own. “All our staff members have undergone safety training to ensure we promote and enforce a safe event for all.” If the tour proves to be a success, the organisers have said they may look at continuing the service after the Covid- restrictions have been eased. “We hope to continue with it after the lockdown. It will be almost a funfair operation, staying in each venue for two days. “All of our screens are on trailers and we have four smaller trailers that are shown throughout the car park.” Conor does not foresee any issues in having to enforce social distancing but have insisted that they have a security team in place to deal with those who aren’t complying. “We did it just before the lockdown in the south and to be honest, people don’t want to leave their cars,” he said. “We had hundreds of cars and had no hassle. People are excited to see the film. If they do, we’ll ask them to leave the car park and we have staff in place for that.” More details can be found on the Big Drive-Inn Facebook page.

On Monday, five of Derry City  Strabane District Council’s  household recycling centres reopened after being closed for a period as a result of the COVID- emergency legislation. Long queues formed outside the centres before they opened as people who were in lockdown attempted to dump and recycle materials that had accumulated. Derry’s centres do not charge people to get rid of their waste. In Donegal people must pay for some items at recycling centres while others are free.  googletag.cmd.push At the most recent meeting of the council, DUP Alderman Maurice Devenney said the use of the dumps by people from Donegal was a quite serious problem which needed to be examined. Alderman Devenney said that given the costs being faced by the local council as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, they should not be footing the bill for people from a dferent jurisdiction to get rid of their rubbish. He suggested that when the dumps are re-opened the council should look at new measures to prevent people from outside the council area using the facilities. Alderman Devenney asked for a report to be prepared in a bid to try and establish how many vehicles with southern registrations are using the local dumps. googletag.cmd.push Addressing the issue of cross border waste, a council spokesperson this week said that it is aware of ‘some cross border waste’ being brought to its recycling centres by members of the public and that its centres are designed to handle the volume of waste which passes through daily. She said: “This issue is reviewed on an ongoing basis with elected members recently requesting a full report on usage that will come before them for review and discussion at the next Environment and Regeneration Committee. “Council acknowledges the fact that there are many instances where users of the amenity sites live outside of the Council area, for example they may own a property within the Council area. “Council continues to remind people from outside of the council area that where possible they should limit travel and should use services and facilities in their own areas.” The Council spokesperson added that they experienced a high volume of users at the sites when they reopened on Monday and encouraged the public to hold off and avail of the services later in the week. Five centres at Pennyburn, Glendermott Road, Strathfoyle, Claudy and Strahan Road in Strabane are all open from am to pm Monday to Friday, am to pm on Saturday, and Sunday opening from  to pm for Pennyburn, Glendermott Road and Strahan Road sites only. The public are reminded that the council’s regular refuse collection service is fully operational throughout this emergency period and that additional support to deal with excess waste has been provided through a bespoke COVID Waste Helpline –    - and a free Bulky Waste Collection Service that can be booked online on the councils website.

Patricia McCallion, who owns her own hair and beauty salon in Waterloo Street, agreed to be stripped of her make-up and lashes to take part in Pretty Single which airs on Monday. The series sees siximage-concious singeltons embrace the natural lookto try and finda love connection that is more than skin deep. Patricia kicks off the showbygoing on five dates with five dferent guys, while her co-starswatch the dates unfold from the comfort of their sofa – providing supportive and humorous commentary throughout. googletag.cmd.push Mum-of-one and self-confessed romantic, Patricia admits she hides her true self behind make-up to boost her confidence. “It’s putting on a mask in the morning, it’s covering the flaws that you don’t like about yourself, she said. People often say to me you look like you workin the beauty industry and I do like to look the part. I have to look at myself in the mirror all day at work so I want to look mybest. Each of the five suitors have been specially matched to Patricia but she could only take one to dinner. The dates were one after the other and then you had to whittle it down to two and decide which one to take on a proper date, explained Patricia. googletag.cmd.push If I was going on a normal dateId have my make-up done because you want to impress, but the funny thing was the fellas didnt even notice we werent wearing make-up. I felt like I was putting myself out there and it was scary, but at the same time I felt like they were getting to know the real me because I was more vulnerable. Patricia remains tight lipped about who she chose for her date, but revealed she was given the option of going bare faced or wearing make-up. I kind of went for a bit of both, she laughed. She is now looking forward to seeing the show for the first time when it airs on Monday. The trailer came on the other night after Eastenders and I was jumping around the room, she admitted. I kept rewinding it to watch again. Narrated by Derry Girls star Saoirse-Monica Jackson, Pretty Single is a Stelly Media production for BBC One Northern Ireland and BBC Scotland. It begins on BBC One Northern Ireland on Monday  May at .pm. All six episodes in the series will be available on BBC iPlayer after the first episode is broadcast.

The -acre estate, which includes the derelict Boom Hall, stretches across a large section of land close to the Foyle Bridge at Culmore. Appeals have been made in recent years for more to be done to preserve the famous hall which is such bad condition that the land around it has been secured off. The new company, which has charitable status, is called the Boomhall Trust. The organisation has been awarded a Project Viability Grant by the Architectural Heritage Fund to help them explore uses which could revive and sustain the historically signicant and challenging building. googletag.cmd.push Speaking earlier this year when the new organisation was launched, Boomhall Trust chairman, Jim Sammon, said the buildings and land on the site have been unused and ‘run down for the past  years’. “A restored Boomhall Estate will be a powerful statement of optimism and confidence in the future of the region, and send the strongest signal to everyone that five decades of decay are coming to an end in the North West,” he said. Mr Sammon said the Boomhall Estate is mostly owned by Derry City and Strabane District Council which has commissioned a conservation plan for the buildings and landscape. googletag.cmd.push He said the new company is consulting with the council on the options for the site. He added that the Department of Communities has also part-funded the Boomhall Trust to undertake an archaeological investigation of the site in partnership with the archaeology department of Queens University of Belfast. “Our intention is that Boomhall will remain in public ownership and generate resources for local communities to sustain themselves for generations to come,” said Mr Sammon.

From skipping to keepy uppys, Hanging Tough to Netball Shootouts, the Faughanvale staff showed their sporting talents and set targets for the children to beat. Being confined to home means that our pupils who are normally immersed in exercise, through school PE, after school activities, organised sport and outdoor play, have had to find a new normal,” commented Vice Principal Ciaran OHare. The Sink the Staff challenge, is the most recent initiative by the staff in what has proved to be a busy few months. Their Music co-ordinator, Miss Moore has captivated the pupils through the creation of the Virtual Choir, releasing new songs each week for the pupils to perform. googletag.cmd.push The PE coordinator, Mrs McKeever has continually promoted a healthy and active lestyle in the build up to a Virtual Sports Day in early June. Moving more and sitting less are key to help our pupils maintain physical and mental health.

At the beginning of this year, Derry City and Strabane District Council said that it was working on the development of a funding and financing strategy for the Templemore plans. However, in light of the devastating impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the councils finances, there are concerns over what will now happen with the Templemore project. googletag.cmd.push The local council recently revealed that it is facing an estimated loss of pound.m this financial year because of the pandemic. The Templemore project will be discussed at Thursdays monthly meeting of the council when a motion will be put forward by Sinn Fein councillor Aileen Mellon.

Second past the judge Iain Duff was Supersat, ridden by Leo Gracey, with James McGurgen third on John Megawrsquos Gortmerron Lady.Mark is now the only local amateur to have ridden out his racecourse riders claim.The First Trust Maiden race was ided and in the first ision Jackie Kidd from Loughinisland won on Tullamore, owned and trained by her father, Mayne, beating Brian Dougan on his own Russell Lodge, with Jimmy Henry third on Redheadmustgo.The winner of the second ision was Cortynan in the colours of Dr Fitz Gillespie, who sadly passed away recently.This one providing Glyne Dyne with his third career success. Bend in the River was second ahead of Crawfordstowncross, with Jimmy Henry in the saddle.In the Ulster Bank Open race Liam Lennon had his first winner of the day as a trainer when Younowhat, which he also rode, won in the colours of Moirarsquos Jim McMullan.He also saddled the runner-up, Patsy Murphyrsquos Blackout, ridden by Mark OrsquoHare. Glencloy was third.The W  C Glazing Ltd two winner race saw Banbridge rider James Smyth record his first success of the season when successful on Supreme Lancer, in the colours of Mrs Carol Rooney from Newry. Second was Cepu Gale with Colin Andrews third on Golden Start. It was Smythrsquos fourth career success, his first having been at Comber.Eleven took part in the Bewleyrsquos Open Race for lady riders with victory going to Comber owner Elizabeth OrsquoPreyrsquos Wherersquos Sam, ridden by Caroline Barker.Jackie Kidd was second on her neighbour Norman McKnightrsquos Lady Zaffaran, with the veteran Voloi third.

As part of the Marathon Potential  cohort, I attended a two week training camp near Torre-Vieja, Spain, organised jointly by Athletics Northern Ireland and Athletics Ireland.I had the honour of going toe-to-toe with then NI marathon record holder, Paul Pollock, on the track.I also had the opportunity to spend time with Paul off-track, alongside Kevin Seaward, learning from two powerhouses of Irish marathon running and building on the advice we received from Stephen Scullion, in Belfast in early December.Most importantly, I made lasting friendships with my fellow Marathon Potential  athletes. The sense of community allowed me to really embrace the project.Setting a goal of putting two of us on the start line of the  Paris Olympics is very ambitious. As a younger athlete, I always felt like an underdog.This feeling, which I once perceived as a negative, has become one of my chief strengths. The goal of becoming an Olympian, which I have chased mdash still chasing mdash from an early age, has, at times seemed unattainable.However, as time has passed, I have grown to love the chase. I look forward to the next stage on this journey, in the company of the Marathon Potential  athletes and support staff, under the stewardship of my coach and mentor of  years, Richard Rodgers, and the band of local training partners.Our way of le has changed dramatically in the space of four months due to COVID-. I remember reading the news in January and having the unnerving feeling that it would not be the last time that I would do so.When I recorded a : personal best over the half marathon in Barcelona in mid-February, the virus was relatively undocumented in Europe. By mid March, I understood that I would not be racing for a long time.My biggest mdash and somewhat selfish mdash fear was that there would be a blanket ban on exercise. Nonetheless, the sanctions under which we are all living have forced me to reconsider the spirit in which I run.To those friends and family in the health service, who have been tackling the virus over the past six weeks, I am amazed beyond words. Thank you for what you are doing.As a PhD student I do not consider myself a key worker. I decided that I would follow lockdown protocol as strictly as possible to do my part. Double runs mdash two runs a day mdash have always been a staple part of my training, allowing me to hit the high mileage required to prepare for the marathon.Completing the same mileage across the week off one daily training session was initially challenging. However, I eventually adapted after two weeks of attrition. In the process, I learned that I benefit from the extra recovery time between runs. This pleasant surprise helped me come to terms with what seems like a more or less empty race calendar in .Athletes are creatures of habit. We are conditioned to race on a monthly or two-monthly basis. Having the options restricted has enabled me to focus on the process of training without looking too far ahead. It has reminded me that, despite thriving off pushing to my limits in races, I love the journey, equally as much.Yes, it is all about achieving in races, but also, to get there a long time is spent training mdash  years and counting. So we have to love the training too. A consequence of this has been that I have begun to pay attention to the finer details in training.When doing a hard workout, I set high standards for each and every repetition, be it focusing on my running form, my cadence or my composure in a strong headwind. I have been trying out new drills and core routines to break up the days.Beyond training itself, I have found myself looking after my kit better than I may have done in the past. This, strangely enough, has been one of the most fulfilling aspects of my day.Given the recent stint of unusually sunny and warmer April weather, I have been leaving my shoes to dry in the sun after runs. A friend recently told me that this is a standard practice in Japan, harnessing the heat of the sun to kill off microbes.It has become a bit of a ritual for me. My shoes fairly pound the roads, so I guess they deserve some respect for what they allow me to do. Seeing them propped against the wall lts my spirits.I can understand that many of you will be disappointed not to have run the Deep RiverRock Belfast City Marathon, but your chance to do so will come around again in September or the future.Anyone who is brave enough to step on the start line of a marathon is a special type of person, irrespective of fitness.More so those who run to raise money for a cause. It takes courage to do this. Bank that courage and build on it over the coming months. It is directly transferable to enduring the current crisis.I remember passing the -mile mark in the  Dublin Marathon. I was in a world of pain mdash itrsquos worth it when yoursquore on track for : mdash when I passed a sign that read lsquoWhat wall rsquoI knew then that I would be coming back to this distance time and again. Right now, I have to wait. We all have to wait. Runners are resilient. Focus on whatever training you can do right now and enjoy the journey..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/20th May 2020 Dundrum.jpg","title":"Dundrum chef stars in Great British Menu final  ","story":"CHEF Alex Greene narrowly missed out on being crowned Champion of Champions at the Great British Menu banquet to honour  years of childrenrsquos literature.The Dundrum man admitted he was ldquogutted at not securing the final accolade for the best dish at the event ndash despite becoming the second chef to have got two dishes through to the final and the only Northern Ireland finalist ever to have done it.He lost out to double Michelin-starred chef Niall Keating whose fish dish was voted the best by the  diners, who included Alexrsquos mother, Glynis, his employer, Michael Deane, and Michaelrsquos we, former UTV presenter Kate Smith.However, he was being feted by local fans and well-wishers after the show came to an end on BBC on Friday night.The highly competitive  year-old wowed judges and guests with his starter and desert dishes - a potato and cheese sauce based dish inspired by CS Lewisrsquo book, The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe and a coconut and chocolate ganache dessert with edible rice pages and covers presented as a book inspired by Oliver Jeffersrsquo book, The Incredible Book Eating Boy.The event was held in early February, so Alex, who started his career off in the Buckrsquos Head restaurant in his home village, has had some time to reflect on his success.ldquoIrsquove been overwhelmed by the response Irsquove had from people on social media itrsquos been just mental, he said.ldquoItrsquos another achievement for me and itrsquos something I wanted to do for a long time. To get one dish is big, to get two dishes to the banquet is major as itrsquos only happened twice before and never for someone from Northern Ireland.ldquoAlthough I think everyone was shocked that I didnrsquot get Champion of Champions. A producer came afterwards to ask me how I felt about it and even Niall didnrsquot think he would get it.ldquoI was gutted to be honest. It couldnrsquot have been any closer and I did feel it after all the hard work I put into it. While I enjoyed the whole experience, I do regret not getting Champion of Champions. To me, not to get the whole thing, particularly after coming so far, was tough and hard to stomach. Itrsquos hard when I know the amount of effort I put in and then to get so close. But I know that I couldnrsquot had done anymore.Alex revealed that he worked seven days a week on perfecting his menu dishes for four months while maintaining his demanding job as chef at the Michelin-starred EIPIC restaurant in Belfast, the fine dining experience of the Michael Deane group, where he has worked for the last three years.ldquoWe started filming last November and I was working in the kitchen at Deanes every day, and even on Sundays when Irsquom normally off.

He also raised concern that a commitment to pay staff for the days they went on strike last December has not been delivered.In a detailed response mdash issued after last weekrsquos production deadline had passed ndash the South Eastern Trust said while the Covid- outbreak appeared to have reached a plateau within its hospitals, ldquothe incidents and challenges within the care sector continue to increase and the organisation is currently some distance from being able toto business as usual.The statement continues: ldquoWe are now considering a recovery plan for our elective, cancer and all other key services. This will include the services we can safely restore and by when.ldquoThere is also a global supply issue regarding anaesthetic, opioid and other medications.The shortage of these medications, amongst others, will have an impact on what services we can restore and how quickly.ldquoRoyal College guidelines for surgical specialities and endoscopy currently advise risk assessment and only performing very urgent procedures. This is due to the risk to the staff and also the patient attending hospital.ldquoThis is signicantly limiting the level of endoscopy we can carry out at this time. There are no plans to cease the reprocessing and maintenance of the endoscopy equipment in the Downe day procedure unit.The health trust insists that it is required to agree any recovery plan regionally to ensure equitable provision, explaining the bowel screening programme Mr Hazzard refers to has been suspended across Northern Ireland.ldquoOur priority will continue to be the safety of our patients and staff whilst we do this, said the health trust.ldquoThere is an ongoing requirement for additional staffing from across the organisation within the emergency departments at the Ulster and Lagan Valley hospitals which continue to have signicant and rising numbers of patients attending.ldquoBoth EDs have been separated into Covid- and non-Covid- spaces. The safe separation of patients requires the support of more staff, helping to reduce the likelihood of cross infection and facilitates the requirement for social distancing.The health trust says there is also a requirement to separate inpatient wards into Covid- and non-Covid- spaces at the Ulster, Lagan Valley and Downe hospitals which requires the support of more staff.ldquoUnfortunately, the Trust is also experiencing signicant numbers of staff absences at present. The reasons include self-isolation due to symptoms and shielding of vulnerable persons. This includes a high number of staff who work in the day procedure unit in the Downe Hospital, the statement continues.ldquoIn addition, we continue to work with colleagues in primary care, including the independent sector where there is an ongoing high level of pressure as a result of the virus.ldquoIn some cases, our staff have been providing care and support to the nursing and residential homes in the locality where the need is most acute. Supporting our colleagues within the care sector and the most vulnerable in our society is an absolute priority.The health trust insists that a commitment to pay staff travel time between the Downe and Ulster hospitals has not been rescinded and that eligible staff will receive a payment in lieu of travel time.In relation to strike pay, the Trust said Stormont health minister Robin Swann gave a commitment that pay deducted as a result of industrial action would be reinstated, with payments from the Business Services Organisation delayed as a result of Covid-.

These protocols will help advise any future science-led coastal management approaches we may adopt for protecting these vulnerable environments.Gina McIntyre, CEO of the Special EU Programmes Body, said the research being carried out will provide invaluable data to help protect Murlough Bay for many years to come.ldquoIt is one of the key environmental protection projects that will lead to better, more sustainable, marine conservation activities across Northern Ireland, Ireland and Western Scotland, she said.Dr Melanie Biausque, who can often be seen surveying the beach at low tide using a quad bike, explained what is done with the collected data.ldquoWe visit the site every month and for the next few years this will help generate a visualisation of surface height changes on the beach, telling us how waves move sand around under dferent wave events, she said.ldquoThese are incorporated in a computer model that should allow us to see how future storms will react with the underlying sandy seabed and beach.Another Ulster University researcher, Dr Edoardo Grottoli, has also been collating information of past changes of the coastal system in Murlough Bay using historical maps, past aerial photography and historical accounts of storm impact.He said: ldquoPast events will show us to better understand how important patterns of change have unfolded through time and how the coastline is evolving to present and future positions.ldquoSociety needs to understand the movement of the coast and the processes that drive the changes in order to protect our marine environment in the longer term..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/20th May 2020 Supporters Club.jpg","title":"Supporters’ club members select their favourite Man Utd team  ","story":"LOCAL Manchester United fans have picked their favourite Reds team of the Premier League era.Members of the Downpatrick Manchester United Supportersrsquo Club were asked to pick their favourite players since the start of the Premier League in .They were tasked with selecting a best eleven along with five subs.

I wasn’t on all fours exactly so I didn’t fit the bill for treatment. When the job was finally completed and my plants began to grow nicely I had a running battle with slugs and, no, used tea bags do not keep the wee blighters away from your lettuce. I should get some tips from that County Tyrone photographer who dug up his front lawn to grow vegetables when he couldn’t get out to work. Jim Kerr said the gardening acted as a kind of therapy for him. I must remember that.Sticking to the safe distance rules isn’t easy. I forget myself at times whilst out walking the dog which leaves me having to perform a quick jump right or left with him yelping as I almost fall over him.

Unemployment is soaring into the millions and, no, the people do not want to go and pick fruit and vegetables from the ious English farms. That’s too much like hard work I suspect though I recall, as a young child, many men leaving the province and catching the Liverpool ferry and then going by train to the fruit and vegetable farms in the south. Farmers are currently looking for , UK workers as there is a shortage of the usual seasonal workers from Europe who are facing travel restrictions. When the furlough arrangement, where the Government pays  per cent of people’s wages, ends, for many there may be no jobs toto. It could be back to the s when massive workers’ strikes could not save jobs as technology was turning industry upside down.There is the other possibility that working from home can be more profitable for employers and employees – a headline in the News Letter’s business pages this week indicated that workers were getting more work done at home. The possibility that home could be the next workplace is not as far fetched as it seems. It could solve our pollution problems, doing wonders for our planet.

But Mr Johnson went on to say that his key advisor had behaved “responsibly, legally and with integrity”.The Tory leader is dependent on Mr Cummings, who is an architect of Brexit, and of the Conservative victory last year nationally and, specically, its success in northern Labour heartlands. Mr Cummings is an abrasive character. We do not knowhe ever actually said “I don’t careNorthern Ireland falls into the f****** sea” as was reported.

But the PM’s response yesterday was not only inadequate, it did great harm to the government. The public support for the massive damage and sacrices of lockdown has been high. People have given up funerals for loved ones and lost their businesses and jobs.Those who help oversee lockdown must observe it. Catherine Calderwood, the Ulster-born Scottish chief medical officer, was right to quit when she breached rules, Professor Neil Ferguson of Imperial College likewise and also Mike Nesbitt MLA, who stood down from a Stormont committee.Mr Cummings’ trip is the worst of those breaches. He drew up the rules. He must go. He might in a year or two be able tobut for now his position is untenable.

Please try again later.Submitting...Despite receiving multiple awards around the world, before Adrian McKinty started writing his latest bestseller The Chain, he was struggling to make ends meet and had decided to work as an Uber driver. Persuaded by fellow author Don Winslow to give it a final shot, Adrian started on what would later become The Chain – a terrying thriller that sees parents forced to kidnap children to save their own – for which Paramount Pictures has acquired the screen rights.Explaining how an old school teacher was the inspiration for the book the -year-old said: “I know a lot of people just think chain letters are silly, but I remember when I was a kid they scared the wits out of me. “People would say, ‘make three copies of this and send it on or your mother will die’. I thought better safe than sorry, I’ll make three copies of this and send it on.“When I was at Victoria Primary School in Carrick my P teacher was this woman called Mrs Carlisle. This was in the late s. These chain letters had been going around for a long time. She heard about it and askedanyone in the class had been getting chain letters and was really worried about it. Most of the class put their hand up. She said, ‘bring them all to me tomorrow’. “We all brought them to her, she took us outside, put them all into a bonfire and said, ‘I will take all the bad luck and all the hexes and stop these chains now’. Then she set fire to all the letters. I just remember I could not believe it. I thought, ‘well, we won’t be seeing her again’.“It made a huge impression on me as a kid when you’re so vulnerable and impressionable. “I remember any time I was away I’d always say to my mum when I got back, ‘how’s Mrs Carlisle doing ’ expecting to hear something out of The Omen, some news of a grizzly death, but no, she’s still alive, living in Trooperslane to this very day.“My mum gave her a signed copy of the book. She knows she was the big inspiration for the book.”After leaving school in NI Adrian went to Oxford University on a full scholarship to study philosophy before emigrating to the USA to become a high school English teacher. Normally Adrian’s book are set in Northern Ireland, however The Chain takes place in Boston: “I wanted it to be set in America for a couple of reasons. I wanted the main character to be able to buy a gun.“Also, the only part of America I really know well is Boston. That’s where my we is from.“I like my books to be very accurate. You want somewhere where you’re familiar with, you’ve walked the streets, you don’t make mistakes. You know the smells and the colours and the textures. You don’t want to have to Google details.”Before The Chain he was best known for his DS Sean Duffy series set in s Northern Ireland: “To me it was a no brainerI’m going to write a detective series set in the s, what do I know really well – Belfast and Carrick. I knew what was on the radio, what was on TV, what people were eating, what they were driving. For me to write about London or New York in the s I’d just be guessing.”Of the movie prospects for The Chain, Adrian said: “Whether that becomes a film or not I don’t know. Fingers crossed. One of my previous books was optioned – Dead I Well May Be – they renewed the option  times, every year for  years then they didn’t make the film.”Adrian’s books have won the Edgar Award, the Ned Kelly Award, the Anthony Award, the Barry Award and have been translated into over  languages. The Chain was recently longlisted for the Theakston Old Peculier Crime Novel of the Year. He faces tough competition in four former champions Denise Mina, Chris Brookmyre, Val McDermid and Lee Child, with the public voting now open to help determine the shortlist, which will be announced on June .Asked whether sales or awards were more important, Adrian said: “I suppose ultimately it’s selling copies of the books over awards. You have to be able to make a living out of this racket. I had a few years where I was winning crime fiction awards but only selling a couple of thousands copies of my books a year.“At a dollar a book that’s about two grand a year. You just can’t live on that no harm to you.”Discussing his decision to quit writing he said: “People have said to me, ‘you should never give up your dreams, you’re a bad example’. People have gone after me a wee bit, but I feel like I gave it a good go. “For eight or nine years I dedicated myself to being a writer. The books were coming out, they were getting good reviews. “My problem was they were set in Belfast during the Troubles, that was a hard sell. People would read the back and say, ‘I’ve had enough of all that nonsense’.“Getting people in England to buy those books was really dficult. It was even worse in America. For a lot of American readers their view of Ireland is The Quiet Man. The stuff I was writing about – RUC vs the IRA, Protestants vs Catholics, bombings, shooting, raids – was really interesting to me but perplexing for American readers.”He said: “I think the break helped. It gave me a time to think about new ideas and new concepts. I started thinking about my childhood at Victoria Primary School, growing up in Carrick, and that’s where The Chain came from.”Coronavirus literatureAskedhe thinks there will soon be a wave of novels set against a backdrop of the Covid- pandemic and lockdown, Adrian said: “There’s two ways of thinking about it.“After the  epidemic , in , , Charlie Chaplin didn’t start making a lot of lockdown movies. They were basically the same films that he was making before.“You look at the writing – you have Ulyssesand The Waste Land– they weren’t about what was happening in that period.“It just could go on the same as it always has. People don’t want to think about.”He continued: “Another way of thinking about it is, it’s such an interesting topic, everybody is going through it. Somebody is going to have to write something about it.“I was thinking to myself it is actually quite interesting for a crime writer. I’ve written a few locked room mysteries in my early career.“I really like the idea of someone being murdered in a locked room, during lockdown, while everyone  is in a locked room in lockdown as well. What could be more delicious than that ”Also discussed during our interview was the idea of a serial killer at work during lockdown.Adrian said: “I remember reading a book about a serial killer during the Blitz. It was the perfect crime because so many people were being killed by bombing every night what’s another body lying on the street.“That might work for Covid too. What’s one more little old lady dead when the police are already overstretched ”Least productive timePeople who think writers will have found it easy to adopt a stay at home regime during lockdown are way off the mark according to Adrian.He said: “I haven’t really been out of the house for about six weeks, but what  can you do, you have to obey the orders, stay inside.“I’m in New York, I’ve been here about two years. Up until the last six weeks it seemed like a great idea, now we’re stuck inside a tiny, wee apartment for two months it’s getting a bit claustrophobic.“It’s the funniest thing, this has probably been the least productive two months in the past  years.“Both kids are home all the time, you’re homeschooling them and helping them with their online homework and stuff like that. “They’re bored out of their minds so you’re playing Cluedo, Monopoly, and at the end of a day of really doing nothing you’re just exhausted.“I don’t really understand it to be perfectly honest. Normally I’d go to bed at about midnight or one. By  o’clock I’m just beat. Another day’s over, you go to bed, get up and it’s the same thing all over again.“It used to be I’d go out and do a really long walk every day, four days a week I’d go to the gym, go for a swim or whatever. “I’ve been doing none of that, yet I’m exhausted all the time.“For the first month I was feeling really guilty about it. I was saying to myself, ‘Adrian, you’re wasting your le, son, you should be getting up at six, getting the work done before the kids get up’. I was really beating myself up.“Then I was emailing with a whole bunch of friends and everybody was telling me the same story. They’re not getting anything done and are just really exhausted.“Somebody on Twitter posted that they’ve used this time really well, they’ve learned French. I unfollowed them immediately. The rest of us are stuffing our faces with pizza and watching TV and you’re learning French – give me a break.”He added: “When this lockdown is over the first thing I’m going to do is go to the pub, the second thing is get a haircut. I look like I’ve been living in the jungle for five years. If there’s some hipster haircut place that also sells beer I’m going there.“If you’d asked someone six months ago what they wanted to do, what their aspirations were, they’d maybe have said they want to go skiing or run a marathon. Ask me now, I want to get a pint in the pub and haircut.”Sadly for Adrian, he doesn’t think he will be able to visit home this summer: “I go home every summer to check on my mum and stay for a while. I don’t knowthat will be possible this year.”Adrian’s late father worked at Harland and Wolff while his mum worked as a secretary. He has other family members who still live in Carrick, and some further afield.He said: “It might have to be Christmas instead. I love to get back and see everyone. It’s a real shameI can’t this year.”One elf is enoughAdrian lives in New York with his we Leah and his daughters Sophie and Arwynn.Arwynn’s name is based on a Lord Of The Rings character due to the fact Adrian and his we met in the Oxford pub that author JRR Tolkien used to frequent. “When Sophie was born I wanted to call her Eowyn , but Leah wouldn’t let me. She said we’ve got one elf in the family and that’s enough. She’s named after her grandmother.”Loosehead prop for Jerusalem LionsAdrian explained how he ended up playing rugby for Jerusalem’s local rugby team when his we was there on a year’s scholarship.He recalled: It said on the scholarship that neither you or your partner is allowed to work. For the first couple of months I was just walking around the city enjoying Jerusalem, then I saw this poster for this rugby team – the Jerusalem Lions. I thought, ‘well I’m bored out of my mind here, I’ll go along to their training’.“I think a lot of them had never played rugby before because I immediately made the first team after the first training session. I spent that year playing loosehead prop for the Jerusalem Lions. We travelled all over Israel, Egypt and up into Lebanon. It was very surreal when you look back on that.”He added: “When I was playing you took your kit home with you and you got a laundry allowance to get it washed. It was about  shekels a week, that’s about £ or £. It suddenly occurred to me, ‘Adrian, you’ve attained your dream – you’re a professional rugby player’. I was playing rugby and getting paid for it.”\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

There is zero chance of him resigning.”– May :Downing Street appears to be standing by the PM’s chief aide, saying in a statement: “Owing to his we being infected with suspected coronavirus and the high likelihood that he would himself become unwell, it was essential for Dominic Cummings to ensure his young child could be properly cared for.“At no stage was he or his family spoken to by the police about this matter, as is being reported.”Speaking to reporters outside his home, Mr Cummings says: “I behaved reasonably and legally.”When a reporter suggests his actions did not look good, he replies: “Who cares about good looks  It’s a question of doing the right thing. It’s not about what you guys think.”Later at the daily Downing Street briefing, Mr Shapps says Mr Cummings has the PM’s “full support” and that Mr Johnson “knew that he was unwell and that he was in lockdown”.Mr Shapps says it had always been permissible for families to travel to be closer to relatives as long as they “go to that location and stay in that location”.Meanwhile, the deputy chief medical officer for England, Jenny Harries, says travelling during lockdown was permissible“there was an extreme risk to le”, with a “safeguarding clause” attached to all advice to prevent vulnerable people being stuck at home with no support.In a new statement released later in the evening, Durham police say officers were made aware on March  that Mr Cummings was present at an address in the city.The force adds that the following morning an officer spoke with Mr Cummings’ father at his own request, and he confirmed his son had travelled with his family to the North East and was “self-isolating in part of the property”.It says the force “deemed that no further action was required. However, the officer did provide advice in relation to security issues”.In another evening statement, a No  spokeswoman accuses the Mirror andof writing “inaccurate” stories about Mr Cummings, including claims that he had ed to Durham after going back to work in Downing Street on April .“We will not waste our time answering a stream of  allegations about Mr Cummings from campaigning newspapers,” the spokeswoman says.– May :Asked by a journalist outside his home whether he had ed to Durham in April, Mr Cummings says: “No, I did not.”A host of Tory MPs call for him to resign or for Mr Johnson to sack him.But the PM, who fronts the daily Downing Street briefing, firmly backs Mr Cummings, saying his aide acted in the best interests of his child, in a way “any parent would frankly understand”.He insists Mr Cummings “acted responsibly, legally and with integrity”.But the PM’s comments fail to quell anger among Tory MPs, opposition parties, scientists and even bishops – one of whom accuses Mr Johnson of treating the public “as mugs”.Durham councillor Amanda Hopgood says she has written to Durham Constabulary’s Chief Constable Jo Farrell after being made aware of a number of sightings of Mr Cummings in the area in April and May.Mr Cummings’ parents Morag and Robert defend him in an interview with the New Statesman, with his mother saying the family had been grieving after her brother – Lord Justice Laws – died on April  after contracting Covid- while ill in hospital, and his father saying he was “disgusted” at the way the press had treated his son during the coverage.– May :Education Secretary Gavin Williamson adds his support for Mr Cummings, saying he should not resign “because he has made it clear that he’s broken no rules and he’s broken no laws”.Gloucestershire’s independent police and crime commissioner Martin Surl says Mr Cummings’ actions make a “mockery” of police enforcement earlier in the lockdown “when the message was very, very clear: stay at home”.Tory MP David Warburton says his own father died alone as a result of the coronavirus lockdown, and that the Cummings story gives an impression of “double standards”.Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says she fears Mr Johnson is “putting his political interest ahead of the public interest” and adds that she hopes he will “reflect further” on the matter.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Its important to us that we support it as much as possible.ldquoIts uplting being able to do that. It was so emotional being able to see the nurses on the Covid ward.ldquoFor me and Charlotte it was very humbling because those guys are putting their lives at risk and theyrsquore asking for stuff for patients, not for themselves.ldquoWe were quite tearful because we didnrsquot want to leave them there ndash but theyrsquore doing it day in-day out without batting an eyelid.

He said the goal is to balance preventive measures and the economy until vaccines and effective drugs become available.But the worldrsquos third largest economy has fallen into a recession, and public discontent over his handling of coronavirus has sent his support ratings tumbling. Recent media surveys show public support for his cabinet has plunged below %, the lowest since he ed to office in December .Mr Abe declared the state of emergency on April  in several parts of Japan including Tokyo, expanded it to the entire nation later in the month, and then extended it until the end of May.Under the emergency, people were asked to stay at home and non-essential businesses were requested to close or reduce operations, but there was no enforcement.Since May , when the measures were lted in most of Japan, more people have left their homes and stores have begun reopening.Economy minister Yasutoshi Nishimura said recent data suggests infections have slowed enough and pressure on the medical system has fallen enough to allow a gradual resumption of social and economic activity.He said Tokyo, Kanagawa and Hokkaido, where the number of infections is still fluctuating, need to be watched closely.Inidual prefectures are allowed to impose their own measures.Tokyo governor Yuriko Koike said last week that the capital will reopen in three phases starting with schools, libraries, museums, and longer service hours for restaurants.She said theatres, sports facilities and other commercial establishments will be next, with nightclubs, karaoke and live music houses in the final phase..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Japan lts coronavirus emergency in all remaining areas article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

this crisis to protect and ensure the delivery of our basic services but like many other councils at this time, the future of these essential services such as bin collections, burials and street

disposal, community support, and provision of registration and cemeteryservices.“The restrictions that have been introduced, with the clear purpose of protecting le and ensuring out health service has not been overwhelmed, have created a severe financial challenge for our  councils as they have lost practically all of their self-generated income through the closure of council facilities.“This funding will help assist councils with their cash flow and support them in the delivery of the vital services they are providing to the community at this time.“It will also help ensure that they are ready to play their key role in our post-pandemic recovery and limit the financial impact on ratepayers going forward.”While the additional funding is welcomed, Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon

must look at longer term investment to support the financial resilience of our councils so that we are resourced to deliver on strategies for bespoke economic recovery and community support.“Councils
