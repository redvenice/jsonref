The sight of our politicians with their snouts in a trough will always provoke rage. A Tory government must act more severely against it than any other sort of government, because Labour can so easily exploit it. Many Tories have found it deeply painful in the past few days having to admit that the attacks made on them by prominent Labour MPs have been largely just. Things are bad when Angela Rayner can score points off you.It is especially sad to see such a mess when the Government has managed to tot up some significant achievements, from Brexit to the Covid vaccine roll-out to COP26, and when a clever hand on the helm over the next year or so may deliver more, including the clearing of the NHS backlog and tax cuts before the Election, to compensate for the emergency measures forced on Rishi Sunak by the pandemic.So it is time to get a firm grip again, and to be very careful what advice to take. Boris has many counsellors, and some of them are perhaps becoming a little orced from reality after more than two intense years in power. Margaret Thatcher famously had Willie Whitelaw at her side, a man who instinctively knew the limits of power.The present Government has no such figure, so the Prime Minister needs to ensure in future that those whose advice he takes have their feet firmly on the ground, and properly understand the hearts and minds of Middle Britain, the source of his power and the most accurate barometer of what is best for this country."},{"url":null,"title":"Rail passengers face 10 days misery Christmas engineering works","story":"Share this article Bruce Williamson, a spokesman for transport campaigners Railfuture, said: \u0027Works need to be communicated clearly with passengers, so they are aware of timetable changes well in advance and have their inconvenience minimised.

She said that while the UK is now at the flattening of the peak, the country could still stay at a “very, very high level like this, which will mean that we have deaths that could be prevented by vaccination”.  Asked who was dying currently as a result of contracting Covid-19, Dr Hopkins said:   Acoording to the government’s latest vaccine surveillance report published this week Thursday, 2,032 double-vaccinated iniduals over 70 have died, and more than 3,000 from the same age group were hospitalised despite having had both jabs. Dr Hopkins added that while it is too early to say the virus has nowhere else to go, its changes are likely to be “smaller and more incremental from here on in”.  Outlining if she thinks this will be the last Christmas where people will be wearing face masks, Dr Hopkins said:  Infections have been climbing steadily since mid-September, when daily new confirmed infections per million people stood at 122.44 on 12 September. This value reached 269.71 on Saturday, according to Oxford University’s Our World in Data database. On Saturday, the country recorded 41,335 new infections, its highest ever daily tally, despite president Vladimir Putin having declared a circuit breaker holiday period from 30 October to 7 November to curb infections.He added NHS staff recognise the “impact” of jabs as vaccinated people are less likely to be admitted to hospital or die. “The NHS needs to do absolutely everything it can to avoid having to call on measures to restrict social contact because of the impact of those measures,” he said. Leaders of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine (RCEM) and the Society for Acute Medicine (SAM) said that some hospitals had effectively run out of space, meaning patients could not receive the right care until a bed became free. Read the full story here: The nationwide seven-day incidence also increased significantly, with the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) saying on Sunday the number of new infections per 100,000 inhabitants now stands at 191.5.  The previous day the incidence was 183.7, and a week ago it was 149.4. Last month it had been 62.6.  On Friday, the number of new infections reached 37,120, a record high since the pandemic began. A week ago, 16,887 new cases were recorded. Thirty-seven new deaths were recorded across Germany within 24 hours. A week ago there were 33 deaths.   The number of patients admitted to clinics with Covid-19 per 100,000 inhabitants over the past seven days – the most important parameter for a possible tightening of the country’s coronavirus restrictions – was 3.91 on Friday and has not been updated since. On Thursday, it had been 3.73.  NHS England will be inviting those who had their second dose more than five months ago, meaning they can receive their top-up as soon as it has been six months since their last vaccine, PA Media reports. Government guidelines state that people who are 50 and over, or aged 16 and over with a health condition that puts them at high risk of contracting Covid-19, and had their second dose six months ago are eligible to get their booster.  The health secretary, Sajid Javid, said younger relatives should urge eligible parents and grandparents to take up the offer of a booster and the flu vaccine.  He said that if “we all come together and play our part” then the country can “avoid a return to restrictions and enjoy Christmas”.  NHS England said eight million people were vaccinated by Saturday out of 12 million people that have been invited. By next week, 16 million invitations for a booster will have been sent since the NHS booster programme began.  People who have not received their invitation can book an appointment on the NHS website or call 119. Although limited to people who are fully inoculated, the relaxation in the state of New South Wales, home to Sydney, lifts limits on house guests or outdoor gatherings, among other measures, Reuters reports. Australia eased its strict border curbs for international travel on Monday for the first time during the pandemic, but only for its vaccinated public from states with high levels of inoculation. The south-eastern state of Victoria recorded the majority of Australia’s 1,417 new coronavirus cases, with public health figures showing 10 more deaths.  There were no new infections in the remote Northern Territory, where a snap lockdown was extended until midnight on Monday to tackle a small outbreak in some areas.  So far, Australia has recorded a comparatively low overall infection tally of just over 180,000 cases and 1,597 deaths in total.

Photograph: Ciro FuscoEPAArchaeologists in Pompeii excavating a villa amid the ruins of the 79AD volcanic eruption that destroyed the ancient city have discovered a cramped dormitory and storage room that offers “a very rare insight into the daily life of slaves”, officials have said.Italy’s culture minister, Dario Franceschini, said the find was “an important discovery that enriches the knowledge of the daily life of ancient Pompeiians, in particular the level of society still little known”.The room was discovered in a villa in the Pompeii suburb of Civita Giuliana, just a few steps from where archaeologists in January discovered the remains of a well-preserved ceremonial chariot.The room, with just one high window and no wall decorations, contains the remains of three beds made out of wood.The beds were adjustable, with two measuring nearly 5ft 7in and one just 4ft 7in, possibly indicating that a family with a child had lived there.Nearby, a wooden chest contained metallic objects and textiles that “appear to be part of harnesses for horses”, according to the archaeological park. There also was a wooden steering element for a chariot.Chamber pots and other personal objects were under the beds, while eight amphorae were in a corner, suggesting storage for the household.“We can imagine here the servants, the slaves, who worked in this area and came to sleep here at night,” said Gabriel Zuchtriegel, the director of Pompeii Archaeological Park. “We know that it was definitely a life in precarious conditions.”The villa, with a panoramic view of the Mediterranean Sea on the outskirts of the ancient Roman city, is considered one of the most significant recent finds at Pompeii.It was discovered after police came across illegal tunnels dug by alleged looters in 2017.Archaeologists also have uncovered the skeletal remains of two people, believed to have been a wealthy man and his male slave, who were stricken by volcanic ash attempting to escape death. – Associated PressStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Circassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"iraqi pm unharmed after attempted assassination","story":"Iraq’s prime minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi survived an assassination attempt with armed drones that targeted his residence. Photograph: Tom BrennerPoolEPAIraq’s prime minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi survived an assassination attempt with armed drones that targeted his residence.The attack, in the early hours of Sunday, is a major escalation amid tensions sparked by the refusal of Iran-backed militias to accept last month’s parliamentary election results.Two Iraqi officials told the Associated Press that seven of Mr al-Kadhimi’s security guards were injured in the attack with two armed drones which occurred in Baghdad’s heavily fortified Green Zone area.He tweeted: “The rockets of treason will not shake one bit of the steadfastness and determination of the heroic security forces. I am fine and among my people. Thank God.”In a statement, the government said the drones tried to hit Mr al-Kadhimi’s home.Residents of Baghdad heard the sound of an explosion followed by gunfire from the direction of the Green Zone, which houses foreign embassies and government offices.The statement released by state-run media said the failed assassination attempt was with “an explosives-laden drone that tried to target his residence in the Green Zone”.“The security forces are taking the necessary measures in connection with this failed attempt,” it said.It was not clear who was behind the attack, nor did anyone immediately claim responsibility.It comes amid a stand-off between security forces and pro-Iran Shiite militias whose supporters have been camped outside the Green Zone for nearly a month after they rejected the results of Iraq’s parliamentary elections in which they were the biggest losers.Mr al-Kadhimi (54) was Iraq’s former intelligence chief before becoming prime minister in May last year.He is considered by the militias to be close to the United States, and has tried to balance between Iraq’s alliances with both the US and Iran.Prior to the elections, he hosted several rounds of talks between regional foes Iran and Saudi Arabia in Baghdad in a bid to ease regional tensions. – Associated PressStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"oxford university making fascist legacy","story":"There is no more poisonous family name in recent British political history. But it has not stopped the University of Oxford grasping with both hands more than £12 million in donations from The Alexander Mosley Trust, a charitable fund primarily established on the back of money inherited from Sir Oswald Mosley, the notorious leader of the British Union of Fascists. The trust was established by Max Mosley in the name of his son Alexander, who died tragically at the age of 39 from an accidental drugs overdose. Max Mosley, who passed away in May at the age of 81 from cancer, was a controversial figure in his own right, acting in 1961 as an election agent for a fascist candidate at a by-election that included publishing a leaflet that warned voters “coloured immigration threatens your children’s health”. On another occasion, he was arrested after throwing punches at anti-fascist protesters during a march in support of his father. For a university that has got itself into knots over its colonial and imperial past - so much so that a statue of Cecil Rhodes sparked an academic boycott - it seems incredible that a £12 million legacy, drawn down from the most reviled British fascist, has barely caused an eyelid to be batted. Welcome to a world in which the University of Oxford, the oldest in the English-speaking world, eats itself up over whether to tear down a historic statue but dismisses any moral or ethical concern over the acceptance of a gift from the Mosley family. In an interview with the BBC in 2017, when asked if the trust’s money came from his father, Max Mosley declared: “Not put together by my father – my father inherited it from his father and from his father. The whole of the middle of Manchester once belonged to the family, that’s why there’s a Mosley Street.”At a university as sensitive as Oxford to the feelings of others - one college removed octopus from its menu so that disadvantaged students at mealtimes felt more “comfortable” and Theresa May’s portrait was taken down from the geography department so as not to antagonise EU students - the Mosley cash has trumped any queasiness.This turning of a blind eye - as one eminent Oxford academic has complained - has caused St Peter’s College to be £5 million wealthier as a result of what it happily calls a “generous gift”. The money is being spent on new student accommodation in the centre of Oxford. Alexander Mosley House, as it was intended to be named, will open its doors to students in the autumn of 2022, although the college has been forced into a rethink on the name. Alexander Mosley had studied at St Peter’s as a maths undergraduate.Although less than 100 years old, St Peter’s occupies a prime spot in Oxford, close to the city’s castle, and its alumni include Mark Carney, the former governor of the Bank of England, Geordie Greig, the editor of the Daily Mail, the director Ken Loach, the ex-politan Police Commissioner Paul Condon, and the celebrated chef Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall.Meanwhile the Alexander Mosley Professor of Biophysics Fund, worth a further £6 million, was received “with gratitude” by the university itself. The choice of professor is made by the university’s vice-chancellor in conjunction with the Master of St Peter’s College among others. A second college - Lady Margaret Hall - took £260,000 to pay for disadvantaged students to spend a year at the college. Its Principal was Alan Rusbridger, the former editor of  whose newspaper shared with Max Mosley a common enemy: the newspaper tycoon Rupert Murdoch, more of which later.The payments are detailed in, among other places, the latest accounts of the Alexander Mosley Charitable Trust, whose chairman of trustees until his death was Max Mosley.Lest anyone forget, Oswald Mosley, founder of the British Union of Fascists, was interned along with his wife Diana Mitford during the war for the threat they posed. The couple had married in 1936 in Berlin at the home of Joseph Goebbels, the Nazi minister for propaganda. The guest of honour was Adolf Hitler. Nobody would want to blame Max Mosley for the sins of his father but the man who would go on to run the sport of motor racing had been a keen supporter of his father’s new post-war party, the far-Right Union Movement. Max Mosley had been charged with assault and later acquitted for throwing punches at anti-fascist protesters in east London in 1962, while the year before, having graduated from Oxford University, he was a party election agent responsible for an election leaflet that included the disgusting, racist slur that “coloured immigration threatens your children’s health.” Asked about his leaflet, when it was rediscovered in 2018, Mosley was hardly contrite.He refused to say sorry, finally conceding to Channel 4 News in an excruciating interview: “I think that probably is racist, I will concede that completely,” before adding that he had “no reason to apologise to anyone”.In 2019, a year after Mosley’s car crash interview, the trust was beginning negotiations with St Peter’s College over a possible legacy. Professor Lawrence Goldman, an emeritus fellow and a former editor of the prestigious Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, says he was first made aware of the plans in February this year in a Zoom call with the current master Profesor Judith Buchanan. “The master mentioned that a new building will be named after Alexander Mosley and I was one of the few people old enough to remember we had educated the boy,” he recalled. But the death of Max Mosley in May - and a thorough reading of his obituaries - made him realise he could not sit back in silence. In May, Prof Goldman wrote to Prof Buchanan and again in June, urging her to reconsider.“Max Mosley was a fascist and racist for a significant part of his life when he was in his 20s, after he had graduated from Oxford,” he wrote. “He supported his father’s Union Movement, took part in antisemitic demonstrations, and published material containing the most heinous defamations of black immigrants to this country, and non-whites in general. All this occurred after the Holocaust. “All this was a matter of public record and could have been unearthed by basic historical research.”He warned that to accept the funds was not only “morally insensitive” but also “politically naive”, adding: “Some might call it blood money. Everything about the Mosley family and Mosley name is tainted and the college should have had nothing to do with either.”Prof Goldman, a fellow of St Peter’s College for 24 years, wrote plaintively of his own family’s experience to underline his opposition to the donation. “My story is not uncommon. My grandfather lost two siblings, their spouses, and five nieces and nephews in the Holocaust,” he wrote. His father’s family, moreover, had come from Dalston in east London, where “Oswald and Max Mosley decided to launch their anti-Semitic campaign in 1962, two decades after other families called Goldman were murdered in Poland for the crime of being Jewish”.He went on: “There are, in fact, many people alive today who share a family history like this. And there are many black families also who know and fear the name of Mosley. Twice he wrote to Louise Richardson, Oxford University’s vice-chancellor, pictured below, but received no reply.Exasperated, Prof Goldman wrote an open letter in June to all the governing body fellows of St Peter’s College, appealing to each of them personally to use their vote to stop the donation. “It is unusual to address the fellowship in this way but my attempts to start a dialogue with senior officers of the college have failed,” he wrote to them. “Though you may not realise it, you are each party to a highly ‘unusual’ act: taking funds from the most infamous fascist dynasty in the English-speaking world, the Mosley family.”Accepting the money, he warned, would not only be a “disaster” for the college but also poses a “reputational threat” to Oxford as a whole.In response, he received a formal letter from the college’s governing body, doubling down on their reasons for accepting the funds and warning him that if he made his concerns public he would be in breach of his fellowship. His pleas had fallen on deaf ears.After Oxford and his flirtation with his father’s fascist movement, Max Mosley went on to become president of the FIA, the governing body for Formula One and other motorsports. But it was his bizarre sexual practices, disclosed by the News of the World in an undercover sting operation, that would catapult Mosley into the limelight and make him the darling of wounded celebrities and even leading politicians, among them Tom Watson, once the Labour Party’s deputy leader. In 2008, Mosley, along with the rest of the UK, woke up to the headline “F1 BOSS HAS SICK NAZI ORGY WITH 5 HOOKERS” plastered across the News of the World. Mosley was furious. His sexual predilections were his private business and a court would later uphold that in a ruling that would shape privacy law for years to come. Mosley’s sexual practices were odd - he enjoyed the pretence of having his hair combed for lice in a prison in which the female guards spoke with German accents. But a High Court judge ruled that the sex games had no Nazi connotations and that there was no public interest in reporting them.  When shortly after, the phone-hacking scandal began to envelope the News of the World (the tabloid would shut in 2011), Mosley became a champion of the tabloid’s many victims, financially underwriting the legal costs of claimants bringing phone hacking legal cases against Murdoch’s newspaper empire. Any celebrity or ordinary person, unwilling to risk the expense of suing News International could go to court, knowing that if they lost Max Mosley would foot the bill. By now  newspaper, edited by Rusbridger, scented blood and had begun to go after the Murdoch empire for hacking phones and paying public officials, including police officers, for stories. Rusbridger, 67, left  in 2015 to take up the prestigious post of principal of Lady Margaret Hall, from which he stepped down in September 2021.Max Mosley, through the Alexander Mosley Trust, funded Impress, a state-backed press regulator to the tune of £3.8m. No mainstream media, including  as well as The , has agreed to be regulated by the body, which has been insistent - and the claim tested in court - that Mosely would have no influence on its decision making.Mosley, through his tabloid crusade, made friends in the Labour Party as a result. Watson, Labour’s deputy leader who led the charge in the Commons against the excesses of the Murdoch press, declared: “I’m proud to call Max Mosley a friend and I’m delighted he has made a financial contribution to Labour.” In less than a year between June 2016 and February 2017, Mosley gave £500,000 in political donations to Watson that followed £40,000 to support his successful bid to be deputy leader in 2015.At the same time that Mosley was funding Watson, the family trust set up in his son’s name was making its first donation to Oxford - just over £1.1 million to the St Peter’s College development fund, the payment for which is revealed in the charity’s 2017 accounts. The bigger payment of £5 million for the construction of the new student block followed. For almost a decade, St Peter’s College was presided over by its Master, Mark Damazer, 67, a stalwart of the BBC, whose roles included editor of Newsnight and controller of Radio 4. Damazer stepped down from St Peter’s in 2019 but by then the negotiations for the endowment from the Mosley trust had been agreed and the deal done.Alexander Mosley, pictured below, a student at Westminster School, studied maths at St Peter’s before obtaining a Phd in economics at the University of London. He was a “flawed genius”, according to friends. His body was found at his mews house in Notting Hill, surrounded by drugs paraphernalia, in May 2009. The coroner ruled that Alexander, a long-time heroin addict, had died from cocaine intoxication. He was just 39. His father’s response was to set up the Alexander Mosley Charitable Trust, whose aim is to “support erse charitable causes”, that also includes training young radio broadcasters in Africa to scientific research into the potential medicinal uses of banned drugs for the treatment of psychiatric disorders. The construction of Alexander Mosley House is one of the charity’s biggest funding projects. A decision was taken in secret earlier this year after Prof Goldman raised his complaint to change the name of the new student building so that it will not carry the Mosley family name after all. But St Peter’s remains all too happy to take the money. More from NewsTriggering Article 16 is hardly the ‘nuclear option’Antivirals will deal the final blow to Covid-19Sunday morning UK news briefing: Today\u0026#39s top headlines from The Fans \u0026#39injected with drugs\u0026#39 at Travis Scott gig where eight died during stampedeIraqi PM survives \u0026#39assassination attempt\u0026#39 in BaghdadMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"bbc licence fee may frozen two years help household finances","story":"The BBC licence fee is set to remain frozen at £159 for up to two years in a bid to ease Britain’s cost of living crisis, under plans being considered by ministers.The  has been told that negotiations between the corporation and the Government on the cost of the licence fee from 2022 until at least 2027 are expected to conclude later this month.According to multiple insiders with knowledge of the talks, the licence fee is now likely to remain frozen initially, helping to alleviate the strain on households facing rising energy and household bills.While the Government has made clear that no decision has been taken, three sources said that a 12-month or two-year freeze was now the most likely outcome.“The sense is it has to be firm but fair,” one said, while another added: “Now is not the time to be whacking up the amount households have to pay.”If confirmed, the settlement is likely to prove a significant headache for the BBC in the short term as it would lead to a squeeze on its finances.While the licence fee currently nets more than £3 billion a year for the corporation, inflation is expected to soar by up to 4.4 per cent next year, meaning it will be forced to endure real-term cuts to its funding.The issue of surging inflation is considered a particular problem for the broadcast and media industry, with insiders at the corporation warning that the pandemic has added to the financial pressures it is experiencing.They pointed out there had been a surge in filming in recent months after a significant slowdown during the pandemic, with streaming giants such as Netflix pushing up the costs of new programming by huge amounts.However, for the remainder of the period, the licence fee is then expected to be allowed to rise in line with CPI, a measure of inflation. This is expected to allow for four to five years of increases.One insider suggested that this would represent a generous settlement for the BBC and would be seen as recognition for the recent progress it has made on addressing concerns over its impartiality.Others believe it is necessary to ensure that the BBC remains financially strong in the run up to 2027, when its current charter runs out.At this point, it is thought that the Government could seek to radically reform the way the BBC is funded.Ministers shelved plans earlier this year to decriminalise the non-payment of a licence fee but have said that removing criminal sanctions remains under review.It comes days after it was reported that Nadine Dorries, the Culture Secretary, had privately expressed her anger at the BBC’s Nick Robinson after he told the Prime Minister to “stop talking” during an interview on Radio 4’s Today programme.Ms Dorries is said to have warned that Robinson had “cost the BBC a lot of money” and suggested she would not engage with the corporation about the licence fee settlement until it addressed claims of bias and elitism.However, other figures in Government have been impressed with Tim Davie, the BBC’s Director General, who has made impartiality one of his key goals since taking over in September last year.Last week, the BBC set out a 10-point action plan aimed at maintaining editorial standards, with the corporation now set to appoint external experts to ensure all of its content is impartial.This firm line will now extend beyond news and current affairs, with experts from outside the BBC appointed to analyse all the broadcaster\u0027s content for signs of potential bias.A spokesman for the Department for Culture, Media and Sport declined to comment.A BBC source said: “There is currently no licence fee deal agreement. Once there is, it is for the Government to announce the terms to parliament at the appropriate time. The BBC cannot comment on speculation.“For our part, we understand the financial challenges people are facing, but there are also very good reasons for investing in what the BBC can do for the British public, the creative industries and the UK around the world.”More from NewsTriggering Article 16 is hardly the ‘nuclear option’Antivirals will deal the final blow to Covid-19Sunday morning UK news briefing: Today\u0026#39s top headlines from The Fans \u0026#39injected with drugs\u0026#39 at Travis Scott gig where eight died during stampedeIraqi PM survives \u0026#39assassination attempt\u0026#39 in BaghdadMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"dementia assessments gps have plunged third since start pandemic","story":"People with worrying signs of dementia are being denied NHS help, with the number of assessments by GPs falling by one third since the start of the Covid pandemic, official figures reveal.Experts said the figures were shocking and showed the most vulnerable had been left to live in uncertainty and fear without even access to family doctors as their memories failed.It comes amid growing public concern over access to face-to-face appointments with GPs. Analysis of NHS statistics reveals that the number of people being assessed by GPs has fallen 30 per cent, while the number undergoing checks in memory clinics has more than halved.The number being diagnosed with dementia has fallen by more than 32,000 since the first Covid lockdown.Ministers including Boris Johnson have vowed to take action to ensure patients can see a family doctor in person. The British Medical Association is threatening industrial action in protest at the plans.New monthly figures show that in total, dementia assessments have fallen by almost 10,000. In total there were 19,393 checks in September, compared with 28,641 on an average month before the pandemic – a fall of one third.The number of GP assessments went from 23,986 to 16,800, while assessments at memory clinics fell from 4,655 to 2,593, a fall of 56 per cent.Under David Cameron, the Government designated dementia as a priority, setting a target for 67 per cent of people with conditions such as Alzheimer\u0027s to receive a diagnosis.This target was achieved until the first lockdown – but during the pandemic the numbers receiving assessment or access to services fell sharply, with patients struggling to see GPs who could refer them to specialist services. As a result, the current diagnosis rate is just 62 per cent, leaving more than 32,000 without a diagnosis.A separate audit of memory clinics, which normally assess and diagnose dementia, reveals a widespread deterioration in services since the first lockdown.In total, 48 per cent said they reduced the number of appointments, with some closing down entirely. One third of clinics said they only saw urgent or severe cases, with even more saying they accepted referrals but placed patients on a waiting list rather than seeing them.The survey of 21 memory services, completed in July, found that more than three quarters were offering patients virtual appointments despite concerns that those with dementia may struggle with technology.Experts warned that people with Alzheimer\u0027s and other forms of dementia had struggled, particularly during the pandemic, with increased isolation and routines and activities devastated by lockdown.Fiona Carragher, the director of research and influencing at the Alzheimer\u0027s Society, said: It\u0027s shocking that the pandemic has left thousands of people with dementia in the dark about their diagnosis, leaving them living in uncertainty and fear. Many are struggling even to see their GP let alone get an assessment to give them the answers they desperately need.Ms Carragher said getting a diagnosis could radically transform people\u0027s ability to live with the condition and allow access to treatments and support, adding: Not getting a diagnosis leaves people vulnerable to the effects of dementia and without the tools to manage the condition.In July, Alistair Burns, the national clinical director for dementia and older people\u0027s mental health at NHS England and NHS Improvement, said the numbers being referred for assessment had fallen by between 40,000 and 50,000 during the pandemic .He told a conference GPs did as they were told and stopped referring patients for dementia assessments at the start of the first lockdown in March last year.Referrals resumed slowly again last summer but declined again during the second lockdown, since when they have risen to normal levels.The latest figures show NHS services are getting as many referrals as they were before the pandemic. But experts said many of the cases were likely to be those who had been assessed long ago, only to get stuck in a backlog because current assessment levels are significantly lower than normal.Prof Burns also said dementia sufferers had disproportionately lost out during the pandemic by being isolated from family, friends and their communities. Official figures show those with dementia account for one in four deaths from Covid.Prof Martin Marshall, the chairman of the Royal College of GPs, said: During the pandemic, particularly at the start, referrals to specialist services such as memory clinics has been difficult – in some cases, not possible at all – and this will have certainly impacted the number of patients being diagnosed.In some cases, patients may also have put off coming forward due to a fear of catching Covid-19 or not wanting to burden the NHS. However, it is now encouraging to see that referrals are starting to climb once again despite the massive workforce and workload issues facing general practice.Last month, the Alzheimer\u0027s Society warned that elderly people with dementia are being forced into care homes for want of basic help at home. The charity said the social system was on its knees before the pandemic, in a crisis deteriorating by the day.An NHS spokesman said: It is understandable that during the pandemic, some older people felt they were unable to seek help for symptoms that may be suggestive of dementia, but the number of referrals to memory clinics is now back to pre-pandemic levels and the NHS is offering support to patients and their families while they are waiting for a diagnosis.The NHS message to people and their families who think they may have dementia is clear – please come forward for an assessment.More from NewsTriggering Article 16 is hardly the ‘nuclear option’Antivirals will deal the final blow to Covid-19Sunday morning UK news briefing: Today\u0026#39s top headlines from The Fans \u0026#39injected with drugs\u0026#39 at Travis Scott gig where eight died during stampedeIraqi PM survives \u0026#39assassination attempt\u0026#39 in BaghdadMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"embracing wokeness electoral kryptonite bidens democrats","story":"The race for the Governorship of Virginia took on a peculiar significance this week. The shock success of the Republican candidate, Glenn Youngkin, was immediately seen as not just an early verdict on Joe Biden’s Presidency. It was swiftly interpreted as a referendum on a formerly obscure activist-academic theory that has recently gripped the US public.Critical Race Theory (CRT) emerged from the American universities from the 1970s onwards and is, by the admission of its own founders, a social movement as much as it is a theory.It argues for re-evaluating absolutely everything in life through the lens of race. Where race is not an obvious factor, racism is said to be hidden in ‘structures of oppression’ and more. CRT focuses on solving this by ‘problematising’ and otherwise lambasting ‘whiteness’, which is seen to be the source of all evils.If it sounds like this might not work in theory then you would be correct. But it works even less well in practice, because when you try to teach or otherwise embed CRT in your school this is no abstract thing. Contrary to the claims of its supporters it is not simply about educating children on history. It specifically aims to target white people. Which means problematising and targeting white children. Oddly enough, the American public does not like this.Youngkin’s campaign was successful for a number of reasons. One was that he deftly and impressively trod around the trillion-dollar question of Donald Trump. Youngkin neither denounced Trump nor sought to be endorsed by him. Republican politicians across the country will have been looking on with keen interest.But the campaign was also successful because Youngkin focused part of his attention on the hugely galvanising issue of CRT. Across the country, school boards have spent recent months trying to defend the teaching of CRT. In the minds of parents this movement has been correctly conjoined with other social issues of the American ‘progressive’ left, especially the issue of transgender ideology. In Loudoun County, Virginia, there have been especially wild scenes at school board meetings. Parents have been carted off by the police after questioning school authorities. They have even been described as ‘domestic terrorists’. There is naturally some disgruntlement about this. And so there has recently been a deliberate drive by opponents of CRT to get on school boards and prevent its wider dissemination. This has happened across the country, but Virginia has been a focal point of public attention.Now that they have been subjected to daylight, CRT’s proponents have responded in a number of ways. They have argued that parents are seeing a mirage that CRT does not exist. They have also argued that CRT does exist but it is not what its recent opponents say it is. Some say CRT should be taught in schools. Others say that it is not being taught but that it should be.The fact that these positions are contradictory has not stopped Democrat lawmakers making all of them. Simultaneously. But parents are understandably fired up about the issue, something Youngkin used to good advantage. “There is no place for CRT in our school system” he said, promising to “ban it” on day one.How have the Democrats responded? Their media machine has had great fun passing around a video of one elderly voter who says he wants to ban CRT in schools, but when interrogated cannot explain precisely what the theory in question is. The fact that in defeat the Democrats have been reduced to this suggests that they may be failing to learn anything at all from the past week. And this is a significant test for the midterms next year.If the party is run by moderates then they will realise that CRT is political kryptonite. It doesn’t matter whether every voter has read every text of these unreadable theorists and activists. All that matters is they understand it is a isive ideology being pumped into the heads of their children. Moderate Democrats ought to rein in the CRT crowd and other assorted race-baiters on the far-left of their party. But the response to the defeat in Virginia this week suggests that they may yet double down on another claim. Which is that opposition to CRT is yet another sign of ‘racism’ and that the American public are not just racist, but stupid too.Perhaps rising US employment figures will help pave over some of the governing party’s ideological excesses. Or perhaps they won’t. But regardless of whether the economy improves, most American voters do not want their children indoctrinated in neo-racism and hatred of themselves and their country. Most still want to think well of themselves, and would like their leaders to think well of them too. The fate of the Democrats rests on whether they recognise this fact, or resent it.More from NewsTriggering Article 16 is hardly the ‘nuclear option’Antivirals will deal the final blow to Covid-19Sunday morning UK news briefing: Today\u0026#39s top headlines from The Fans \u0026#39injected with drugs\u0026#39 at Travis Scott gig where eight died during stampedeIraqi PM survives \u0026#39assassination attempt\u0026#39 in BaghdadMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"ucl imperial among several prestigious universities benefiting","story":"The row over “fascist” donations deepened last night as it emerged more of the country’s most prestigious universities have received cash from the Mosley family trust.Imperial College London has been handed almost £2.5 million from the Alexander Mosley Charitable Trust over the past five years, while University College London (UCL) has received £500,000.Both universities have scrambled in recent years to analyse the bequests of past benefactors and have made a series of pledges to rename buildings and address “abhorrent” racist legacies.But The  can reveal that at the same time, they have accepted donations from a charitable trust set up by Max Mosley to house the fortune he inherited from his father, Sir Oswald Mosley, leader of the British Union of Fascists.Last summer, at the height of the Black Lives Matter protests, UCL renamed lecture theatres and a building named after the prominent eugenicists Francis Galton and Karl Pearson.The renaming of the buildings was part of a package of measures being introduced to tackle the association it deems unsavory, including funding new scholarships to study race and racism.Imperial commissioned an independent group of historians to recommend ways in which it could confront “uncomfortable and awkward aspects of our past”.Last month, the group advised the university to remove a bust of slavery abolitionist Thomas Henry Huxley because he “might now be called racist”.The group also recommended that a bust of the renowned 19th century biologist, dubbed “Darwin’s bulldog”, be taken down and the Huxley Building on campus renamed.UCL and Imperial both received donations from the Alexander Mosley Charitable Trust, which Max Mosley set up in the name of his son who died of a heroin overdose in 2009.UCL was handed half a million pounds to set up a forensic evidence interpretation laboratory, the trust\u0027s 2019 accounts show. Meanwhile, Imperial College London has received £2,445,000 from the trust over the past five years.Of this, £1,150,000 has been used to fund research by Professor David Nutt, an expert in neuropsychopharmacology, and Dr Ben Sassa, a consultant psychiatrist and research fellow at Imperial. Another £1,095,000 was given to Imperial to set up a Centre for Psychedelic Research.Kingston and Westminster universities have each received smaller sums of £137,445 and £84,965, respectively, an analysis of the trust’s accounts revealed. Kingston said the money was used to develop an online archive of the Leveson Inquiry into press culture and Westminster said the donation funded an analysis of the “origins and shortcomings of the press regulator IPSO” and another project on local news provision.Sir Oswald Mosley led the British Union of Fascists and its successor, the Union Movement, both of which spread anti-Semitic and racist propaganda.The party’s supporters, known as the blackshirts, wore Nazi-style uniforms and were notorious for their violence against Jews and Left-wing groups.Max Mosley took up his father’s fascist cause by supporting the Union Movement’s activities in London during the late 1950s and 1960s.He went on to become a motor-racing tycoon and later in life led a crusade against the press, bankrolling Impress, the alternative regulator.Mosley had been caught up in a News of the World sting operation, which exposed his participation in an orgy.Earlier this week, The  revealed that Oxford University and its colleges have been handed over £12 million from the Mosley family trust. The university came under fire from its own dons as well as senior political figures, who accused the institution of “vast hypocrisy”.Prof Lawrence Goldman, emeritus fellow in history at Oxford, said: “The university has gone off the scale in wokery,” citing recent moves to decolonise the curriculum and the row over Cecil Rhodes\u0027 statue, but they go ahead and take money from a fund established by proven and known fascists. Its moral compass is just not working anymore. There has been a total moral failure.”In a joint statement, Oxford\u0027s Jewish Society and the Union of Jewish students said the fact they had not been consulted about the donations was inconsiderate and inappropriate.They called on the university and colleges involved to consider their positions and said: The Mosley family name is synonymous with fascism and anti-Semitism in Britain. The university\u0027s decision to dedicate a professorship to this name serves to commemorate and revere the Mosley legacy.An Imperial College London spokesperson said: “These charitable donations support medical research into new therapies for treatment-resistant depression and other serious mental health conditions. Like all gifts, they are subject to Imperial’s thorough due diligence processes.”A Kingston University spokesperson confirmed the donation, adding: “The Discover Leveson website is a searchable digital resource, providing the public with access to evidence from the landmark inquiry.”A Westminster University spokesperson said: “As an organisation we are committed to ensuring an actively anti-racist, inclusive and safe environment for all.” UCL declined to comment.More from NewsTriggering Article 16 is hardly the ‘nuclear option’Antivirals will deal the final blow to Covid-19Sunday morning UK news briefing: Today\u0026#39s top headlines from The Fans \u0026#39injected with drugs\u0026#39 at Travis Scott gig where eight died during stampedeIraqi PM survives \u0026#39assassination attempt\u0026#39 in BaghdadMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"triggering article 16 hardly nuclear option","story":"‘Nuclear option” is the new favourite buzz phrase used by many a commentator on the turgid Northern Ireland Protocol negotiations – particularly those cheering for the EU’s Maros Sefcovic, presently slugging it out with Lord Frost. If the UK government suspends Article 16, as Frost says it might if EU proposals do not “deal effectively with the fundamental difficulties”, there will be “serious consequences”, according to Sefcovic. Hysteria was prevalent in media reports on Friday, followed by professional disappointment when Frost said that Armageddon would be postponed for a week or so.What would these consequences be? For Northern Ireland, according to Sefcovic, it would lead to “instability and unpredictability”, and be “serious also for the EU-UK relations in general, as it would mean a rejection of EU efforts to find a consensual solution” to the protocol’s implementation. Brussels would then be forced to suspend the wider Brexit deal, launching a trade war that would devastate large sections of British business.Apart from the fact that this would entail a month’s notice and allow for another year of negotiations, and that a trade war would crucify the Republic of Ireland, whose present taoiseach, Micheál Martin, is desperate for a sensible compromise, what’s happening in Northern Ireland is very worrying. Sefcovic’s feared “instability and unpredictability” is beginning to manifest itself on some streets in Protestant areas. The appeasement of those who want to destroy Northern Ireland by putting a border in the Irish Sea has taught loyalists, yet again, that violence pays.The EU weaponised fears of sectarian violence, with the help of the complaisant Irish government of Leo Varadkar. He convinced international opinion that a land border would jeopardise the BelfastGood Friday Agreement. This was nonsense, as Lord Trimble, its unionist architect, pointed out vainly. As Lord Frost said in his foreword to a fascinating analysis by Roderick Crawford for Policy Exchange, the North-South dimensions of the Agreement were prioritised at the expense of those of East-West.The British negotiating team, writes Frost, “drifted into accepting the EU’s view that the only way to ensure no ‘hard border, including any physical infrastructure or related checks and controls’ was for the laws on either side of the border to be identical. This ignored the fact that there already was, and is, an international border, an open one, with different currency systems, laws, taxation, and many trading rules on either side”.The EU pooh-poohed proposals for technological methods of making new border requirements invisible, and the upshot was that in 2019 the only way the new team could make Brexit happen was to agree a sea border. Sinn Féin, beating its United Ireland drum, used this to make many unionists believe their status in the United Kingdom was under threat.Last week saw sectarian rioting in Belfast. Protestant children attacked police, and in the small town of Newtownards, about 10 miles east of Belfast, armed men calling themselves the Protestant Action Force – a cover name for the paramilitary Ulster Volunteer Force – hijacked and set fire to a bus.A vast new wall sign shows two armed men in balaclavas with the legend: “THE PREVENTION OF THE EROSION OF OUR IDENTITY IS NOW OUR PRIORITY. EAST BELFAST BATTALION.” It’s an improvement on “KILL ALL TAIGS”, but the message is nonetheless alarming.Insecurity has been exacerbated by a National Audit Office report into Brexit that shows exports from the Republic to Northern Ireland jumping by 47 per cent since the Protocol was implemented, while trade the other way rose by 61 per cent. In the view of Jim Allister, leader of the Traditional Unionist Voice, the most hardline of the four unionist parties, “That is a manifestation of the building of the all-Ireland economy... a vehicle to deliver an all-Ireland politically.” The EU, he said, “built itself” – through economic union. “It’s the same strategy to try and deliver a united Ireland – to build an economic union on the island of Ireland and from that it’s a short step to political union.”Sir Jeffrey Donaldson of the DUP said that the EU “ought to recognise that the protocol and its Irish Sea border is causing economic harm and undermining stability in Northern Ireland”. He’s right. Article 16 is a mechanism to be used if the treaty isn’t working, which it clearly isn’t – and nor will it until the EU accepts that instead of defending the status quo they are damaging it by further alienating the Northern Irish people. The real “nuclear option” would be persisting with this present state of affairs.More from NewsAntivirals will deal the final blow to Covid-19Sunday morning UK news briefing: Today\u0026#39s top headlines from The Fans \u0026#39injected with drugs\u0026#39 at Travis Scott gig where eight died during stampedeIraqi PM survives \u0026#39assassination attempt\u0026#39 in BaghdadThe Crown\u0026#39s portrayal of Diana is \u0026#39disrespectful\u0026#39, says Jemima KhanMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"covid vaccine booster flu jab","story":"Vaccines QA: Who needs a Covid booster - and are there any side effects It’s important to boost your immunity this winter with both the Covid booster and flu vaccineyou’re eligibleAdvertorialByDave MastersDigital Commercial Editor:,  Nov Updated:,  Nov  As Covid cases remain high going into winter, the NHS is inviting people aged  or over and those at risk of serious illness to get a booster vaccination.But there could also be a signicant flu surge this winter – so getting your jab for that is vital too. Last winter, social distancing and limited mixing meant that flu cases were much lower than normal, but dangerous viruses spread quickly when people are all crowded together indoors.So this winter it’s important to boost your immunity with both the Covid booster and flu vaccineyou’re eligible. YOUR VACCINE QUESTIONS ANSWERED Who needs a Covid- vaccination booster All those most likely to become seriously ill from Covid- and those who care for them. But first you need to have had your initial two vaccine doses. The booster will be offered to people aged -plus, those with a health condition that puts them at high risk from Covid, people who live and work in care homes, and frontline and social care workers.If I’m eligible, when can I book my Covid booster The NHS will let eligible people know how to get their booster, which they can have from six months after their second dose. People with certain health conditions may be offered it earlier. Thousands of locations across the country offer a Covid- booster, to give people choice and convenient access. If you are eligible, you will be able to book an appointment at a vaccination centre, designated pharmacy or GP-led service using the NHS Covid- national booking service, or you can go to a walk-in service by using the NHS Grab a Jab walk-in site finder. This is alongside many GP-led services and hospitals inviting people to be vaccinated through their services. I’ve tested positive for Covid-, but can I still get a booster Yes, but you should wait  days before bookingyou’ve had a positive Covid test, starting from the date you had the test.Can I get a flu jab at the same time as my Covid booster You’re likely to be offered them at separate appointments, butyou are offered both, it’s safe to have them at the same time.Who is eligible for the free flu vaccine from the NHS  For a full list of those who can get a free flu vaccination see nhs.uk flujab, but they include people aged -plus, those with certain health conditions, pregnant women and frontline health or social care workers. What about kids  Most primary school pupils and those in secondary school years seven to  will be offered the flu vaccination as a nasal spray. Parents or s will need to give consent for this. Children aged between two and threewill be offered a nasal spray by their GP practice. Those aged six months to two years with a long-term health condition that makes them at higher risk from flu will be offered a vaccine injection.Where can I get a flu vaccine Your GP surgery, a pharmacy offering the service, from your midweyou’re pregnant, or at a hospital appointment. School-age children will be offered the vaccine at school. Those that haven’t started school yet or have a long-term health condition can receive the vaccine from their GP.I never get flu – why do I need a vaccine The flu virus kills almost , people and hospitalises tens of thousands more in England in an average year. It’s more important than ever to get your flu jab this year because more people are likely to get it because we didn’t build up natural immunity during the Covid pandemic. If you get flu and Covid at the same time, you’re more likely to be seriously ill. Also, getting vaccinated against flu and Covid- will provide protection for you and those around you for both these serious illnesses.So why didn’t we see much flu in last winter There are several likely factors, including the measures put in place to stop the spread of Covid-. Last winter also saw record levels of flu vaccine uptake.Will we be more vulnerable to flu this year Dferent strains of flu circulate each year. There may be more strains this year as there were so few flu cases last season. Thus there is less immunity against last year’s strains, and they could continue circulating this year along with the new strains.How effective is the flu vaccine It helps protect against the main types of flu virus. While there’s still a chance you might get flu, it’s likely to be milder. The flu vaccine will also stop you from spreading flu to others.I’m pregnant – is it safe to get the Covid and flu jabs Yes – both are safe for pregnant women, and it’s important to have botheligible. There are more risks for you and your pregnancyyou contract Covid- without the vaccine, and the flu vaccine will also help protect your unborn baby. If you catch flu when pregnant, you’re at risk from complications such as bronchitis and it could cause your baby to be born prematurely, have a low birthweight and may even lead to stillbirth. If you’re pregnant you can get a free flu vaccine from your GP, pharmacist or through your maternity service. Are there any side effects Serious side effects are very rare. The nasal vaccine might lead to a runny or blocked nose, headache, tiredness and some loss of appetite. The injection might give you a sore arm at the site of the injection, a low-grade fever and aching muscles for a day or two after the vaccination.“The NHS Covid- vaccine programme, the largest and most successful in NHS history, has protected millions of people and saved around , lives.“Flu and Covid- both cost lives and the increased threat from the two deadly viruses this winter makes it even more important for people to continue sticking to good habits like washing their hands regularly. “Anyone eligible should have their flu vaccine as soon as possible, and their Covid- booster once it has been at least six months since their second vaccine. The vaccines are safe, effective and the best thing you can do to protect yourself and your loved ones this winter.”"},{"url":null,"title":"boris more jonny english james","story":"Boris more Johnny English than James Bond as hypocrisy turns Cop moment into farceRachael Bletchly says that while Boris Johnson might see himself as James Bond, license to kill, hes actually a bungling blonde who is on borrowed timethis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video cop-boris-johnson-opens-conference-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:zkKLvB,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,pubmaticVideoPrebidEnabled:true,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,disableOzoneScriptOnDragonfly:true,pubmaticIdDisabled:true,fbia.mantisRecommender:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,partner.quicklinks.bar:true,enableSlideInSkinnySignUp:true,justpremiumDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,videoPlaylistEnabled:true,domain:mirror,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,publicationId:aeed-a--bac-edf,lotameLightningTagV:true,ampVideoCacheBuster:true,pubmaticDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,deleteAccountFromProfile:true,adHiddenLoading:true,adslotsFixedSize:true,sovrnDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,video.header.bidding.enabled:,chatEnabled:true,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,enableAboutTopics:true,converse.widget.enable:true,viafouraComments:true,adMobileBottomSlotLarge:true,video.jwplayer.playerId:DxFYnOv,flagsFromDataLayerForFBIA:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,fbia.converse.enabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:true,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,openxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,globalTrayEnabled:true,manualReconsent:,mpulse.enabled:true,nobidDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,og.image.for.section.and.topic:https:s-prod.mirror @trinitymirrordigital chameleon-branding publications mirror img logo-mirror-socialsharing.png,publicationName:Mirror,video.jwplayer.enabled:true,loadIrisManually:true,delayAdsUntilCMP:true,disableAdvertMaxHeight:true,preloadFonts:true,viafouraEnabled:true,PWA.enable:true,readNextEmbeds:true,removeSSO:true,chartbeatHeadlinePageTypes:[ home , channel , topic , section ],felix.endpoint:https:felix.data.tm-awx ampconfig.,breakingNewsPull:true,nobidVideoPrebidEnabled:true,adFixedMobileBottomSticky:true,magniteDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,footerNewsletterConfig:,xandrDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,consentText:We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

It probably came to him while watching No Time to Die last month, at the special screening in the fancy new press briefing room we taxpayers coughed up £.m for. Climate change…doomsday clock ticking…the world is hot enough. Bingo! Give ‘em a bit of  - classic Johnstonian populism. So the man with the golden hair reminded fellow world leaders in Glasgow how Bond usually ends up “strapped to a doomsday device desperately trying to work out which coloured wire to pull to turn it off, while a red digital clock ticks down remorselessly to a detonation that will end human le as we know it.”Do you agree  Have your say in the comment section But, he went on, we are in Bond’s predicament today ”except this is not a movie, the doomsday device is real and the clock is ticking.” So it’s time to defuse the bomb. Time to stop “quilting the earth in an invisible and suffocating blanket of CO.” And then Boris looked at his ticking wrist watch and realised it was time to scarper.He’d got dinner with chums in a posh London club, so he leapt on a private jet and flew home, belching out ,kg of CO, when the train would have emitted just kg. Talk about shooting yourself in the foot with a Walther PPK! Boris’s staggering and shameless hypocrisy turned his  moment into a farce…more Johnny English than James Bond. And then his arrogant bid to rip up Commons sleaze rules to help a Tory pal also backfired spectacularly. Boris thinks he’s a maverick with a licence to act in any way he sees fit.  But, as he’s watched Daniel Craig’s final outing already, he knows that even  is replaceable. And with Mr Moneysavvy Sunak waiting in the wings he could find himself scrabbling for the circuit breaker on his own political time bomb.. I wonder what the Queen makes of her Prime Minister’s actions this week  She was so disappointed not to be at Cop, seeing it as a rare opportunity to help save the world for future generations. Her Majesty has met all the great world leaders of the past  years, as she reminded the current lot in her speech. And she told them “what leaders do for their people today is government and politics. But what they do for the people of tomorrow - that is statesmanship.” Boris doesn’t think of today or tomorrow, he only thinks of himself. But now he’s in a right old state - and the clock is surely ticking. I wonderhis speech reminded the Queen of her own meeting with . He shoved her out of a helicopter above the London Olympic stadium in . But now it’s bungling James Blond who’s heading for a fall.

Previously only married couples can claim. Anyone who would have been eligible since a Supreme Court defeat on  August  will be able to apply for backdated payments. Previously there was no timescale for the change, but Budget documents now say: “Payments will go out from the date of the Remedial Order coming into force, which is assumed to be September  for the purposes of this costing. “However, this date may sht depending on Parliamentary timing.”  But the estimated number of partners who will benefit has been drastically revised down. The DWP previously estimated an extra £m in extra benefits would be handed out up to  , but the Budget documents now suggest it will be £m. It was not immediately clear why. The DWP was contacted for comment. People who lose their partner before pension age can claim a Bereavement Support Payment. In February  the High Court struck down the rule in that required grieving partners to have been married. Similar rules in Widowed Parentaposs Allowance, which BSP replaced, had already been defeated in the Supreme Court in .  In future,someone had both a spouse and a cohabiting partner at the time they died, only one of the surviving lovers will be allowed to claim bereavement benefits. In these cases there will be a complex order of priority to decide who gets the benefits, with cohabiting spouses at the top of the list. However, for retrospective claims, there will be transitional payments to cover both lovers. This means payments to a widow or widower will not stop eventhe deceased’s partner at the time puts in a claim too. A DWP official said the revised cost would not mean any change to the generosity of payments. A DWP spokesperson said: “This legislative change is in progress to enable more families to access support during the most dficult of times and will face full parliamentary scrutiny. Once approved by parliament, payments could be backdated to  August .” Comment MORE ON Conservative PartyDepartment for Work and PensionsSupreme CourtBoris JohnsonGrievingPoliticsDating\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Shadow leader of the Commons Thangam Debbonaire said Mr Rees-Moggaposs position has become untenable because he has lost control. Mr Rees-Mogg made an embarrassing u-turn on Thursday, scrapping plans to rip up ethics rules in order to save Owen Paterson from a -day suspension. Boris Johnson had ordered Tory MPs to vote to block the suspension Mr Paterson from the Commons for lobbying on behalf of two firms - and to create a new Tory-led  to review his case. But the plans triggered a furious outcry and were immediately plunged into chaos when Labour, the SNP and Liberal Democrats vowed to boycott the new committee.  Ms Debbonaire slammed the Government, including Mr Rees-Mogg, for “conflating” the Paterson case with attempts to overhaul the standards watchdog. She told Sky Newsapos Trevor Philips on Sunday: “This is Tory sleaze, pure and simple.” And pressed on whether Mr Rees-Mogg should resign, Ms Debbonaire added: “If I was him, I’d be considering my position, that’s what I think he should do today.” She added: “I think his position is untenable. Commons Leader Mr Rees-Mogg told MPs that he would seek cross party changes to the system as the plan did not have support. Environment Secretary George Eustice dismissed the Owen Paterson affair as a “storm in a teacup”. He acknowledged the Government had “made a mistake” in trying to get Mr Paterson’s breach of lobbying rules re-examined by a new Tory-majority committee which would also consider the entire Commons standards regime.  But Labour MP Jess Philips responded to his comments on Twitter slamming Mr Eustice as a liar. She tweeted: George Eustice is just lying. Everything he is saying is just a lie.Owen Paterson did have a chance to defend himself and did so throughout. The motion was about Paterson not just a new process. Lie after lie. The back-tracking came only hours after Cabinet Minister Kwasi Kwarteng was sent out on the airwaves to defend the plan, when he insisted he felt no shame over the controversial overhaul.  Former Tory cabinet minister David Mellor criticised Mr Kwarteng for suggesting the future of Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards Kathryn Stone was in doubt. Mr Mellor told Sky News: “He was doing it because he thought that would please Boris and a lot of them – it’s like a children’s party – they all want to please daddy, but the reality is a cabinet minister should be above and beyond that.” And he claimed the PMaposs disregard for rules will get him into trouble in the long run. “I think it’s astonishing the Prime Minister has allowed himself to get into this muddle over Owen Paterson, Mr Mellor added. Mr Mellor added to Trevor Phillips on Sunday on Sky News: “The Prime Minister has many great strengths but he doesn’t seem to respect the rules – and he himself gets himself into trouble with these rules, and the fact he doesn’t believe in rules will count against him in the long run.” Comment MORE ON PoliticsConservative Party LondonJacob Rees-MoggLabour Party LondonLiberal DemocratsOwen PatersonBoris Johnson\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Transport workers’ union Unite has secured wage rises of up to % for truckers delivering food, gts and supermarket products. A string of victories over the past two months is credited to the creation of the union’s “special disputes unit”. It has been central to settlements including: - % for  HGV drivers at a logistics hub company in Chippenham, Wiltshire - A .% rise and paid meal breaks for  Liverpool tanker drivers delivering bulk liquid food products - A hike from £. an hour to £ for more than  Argos drivers in the North West, taking annual earnings from £, to £,.  Colleagues have put the results down to new general secretary Sharon Graham, who pledged to target the union’s resources on winning disputes. She also set up the crack team hub. It includes specialist and local negotiators and aims to settle strikes or threatened industrial action in critical sectors . Ms Graham said: “These results are an excellent reflection of how the union intends to focus all its energy and willpower in the future on fighting for jobs, pay and conditions for our members. It’s early days but the special unit I set up is already beginning to bear fruit.”  Unite also said at least  cement lorry drivers, who are essential for the building industry, will get rises of .% backdated to the start of the year plus .% from January. Other above-inflation deals have been ­secured with Heinz, Sainsbury’s, naval bases and for refuse workers in London. Strike action that could have halted car production at BMW Mini in Oxford was recently averted when Unite drivers for a components firm were awarded % over two years. More than  workers at a global engineering firm in Cambridge have won the right to union negotiating rights for the first time. The successes follow a critical lack of lorry drivers, threatening festive supply shortages.Ministers have blamed Covid, an exodus of overseas operators following Brexit and low wages in the industry.

Russian mobsters are believed to be behind the raid in which a woman in a granny disguise stole £.million of diamonds – ­swapping them for pebbles. Not a penny has been recovered from the  snatch at Boodles in Mayfair, West London.The Sunday People can now reveal that the Crown Prosecution Service has started a new legal battle to claw back the proceeds.But it was warned the effort could be an uphill struggle. A source said: “The police reckon the gems have already been re-cut and sold on, so they will be very hard to trace. The Russian mobsters behind this were well resourced and meticulous. There’s little hope of the authorities recovering the diamonds or the cash made from their sale.”  An international manhunt for the gang is still ongoing, despite three being nabbed. Jewel thief Lulu Lakatos, , was jailed for five-and-a-half years in July. Using sleight of hand, she switched gems for rocks of the same weight while pretending to carry out a valuation for wealthy Russian buyers. The crook – a former cleaner and school catering assistant in her native Romania – managed to hand the purse to two women walking past outside. Neither has ever been traced.  Lakatos dumped her disguise in a Wetherspoon’s pub toilet before fleeing via the Channel Tunnel. Boodles discovered the theft the next day when staff opened the safe and found small garden pebbles. The real diamonds – including a £.m, .-carat stone cut in a heart shape – have never been recovered. The only hint of them being traded on the open market came in , when detectives believed one may have turned up at a Belgian jewellery store.  Its unusual size arose suspicion but the paperwork did not match. Lakatos was tracked on CCTV by police after she boarded a Eurostar train to Paris. She was arrested in France in September last year. Two other raiders, Christophe Stankovic, , and Mickael Jovanovic, , were jailed for three years and eight months last year after being convicted of conspiracy to steal. The CPS declined to comment on the matter except to confirm that confiscation proceedings are due to start at Southwark crown court in February.  Justice campaigners welcomed the move to pursue the gang. David Spencer at the Centre of Crime Prevention added: “It is absolutely right that the CPS is going after this criminal gang to recover the goods it stole. “Too often we see criminals getting to keep all or most of their stolen assets, even when convicted of the crime. “It is refreshing to see that is not the case in this instance and the CPS should pursue every avenue to recover these stolen gems or any financial gain these crooks have made selling them.” Comment MORE ON CrimeSunday PeopleJewelleryThe Mafia\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

She said: “Lung cancer is always thought to be something smokers get, or the elderly. “Iaposm angry and Iaposm sad that we thought the scariest thing it could be was Covid.” Daniel first developed a cough in November , and they both thought it could be down to work stress. When it worsened, they feared it could be Covid, but never imagined it couldaposve been cancer. It wasnapost until a month after Daniel began experiencing back pain that he went to a GP. A series of appointments later and he was diagnosed with stage four lung cancer.  The lung tumour had already spread to his pelvis and spine but the couple were hopeful as he had age on his side. “He’s the bravest man Iaposve ever known,” she said.

He was also stepdad to Nerysapos biological son Nathaniel, who he treated as his own.

Nathan Hunt served alongside the Duke of Sussex and saved the lives of many comrades in Afghanistan. But after he went on to develop post traumatic stress, he was tragically found hanged at his home. His grieving family were then told Nathan’s name will not be added to the national Armed Forces Memorial after defence chiefs ruled his death was not directly linked to his service. Today his mum and dad, Derek and Maria Hunt, share the letter they have written to the prince in the hope he can help them force a U-turn. In the moving document, they tell Harry they are “heartbroken”. They add: “Nathan was a dedicated professional soldier who gave everything in the service of his country. “We believe he was a casualty of war and he died of mental wounds sustained during his service in Afghanistan. You have always been a champion of veterans and we hope that your influence might help the Ministry of Defence to change its policy and add Nathan’s name to the memorial wall.” Nathan served alongside Harry in  in Helmand as part of a desert reconnaissance unit. His role was to locate bombs planted by the Taliban. He was a Royal Engineers Warrant Officer when he died aged .  His parents – who met Harry and we Meghan in  – insist Nathan should be included on the Armed Forces Memorial at the National Memorial Arboretum, which contains names of more than , killed in action or from disease since the end of the Second World War. The names of three other soldiers who served in Afghanistan and died after taking their own lives are engraved on the memorial in Staffordshire.Grieving Derek told the Sunday People : “Nathan’s medical reports show his condition deteriorated after he ed from Afghanistan. “So we just don’t understand why the MoD are basically saying there is no connection between what he experienced there and his mental health. “He was a dedicated soldier who spent  years in the Army. He risked his le almost every day in Afghanistan and his actions saved the lives of many soldiers. Nathan’s job was to find bombs and he did it brilliantly, often under fire from the Taliban. But it took a toll. Nathan might not have come back with physical injuries, but he was mentally wounded. “And those mental wounds took his le. As far as we are concerned, he was a casualty of war.”  The dad added: “Everyone who worked with Nathan knew he was selfless and committed. “The very least the Ministry of Defence could do would be to add his name to the war memorial so that our family and his descendants will be able to see the sacrice he made in the service of his country.“ Prince Harry appreciated the sacrice that Nathan made. It’s just a shame the MoD can’t do the same. I can’t understand why they are being so heartless.” Defence chiefs ruled in May that Nathan’s name should not be included on the memorial. Derek,  and Maria, , from Lincoln, appealed but that was turned down in September. Lieutenant General James Swt wrote to the couple stating “on the balance of probabilities”, their son’s death could not be attributed to his service. A psychiatric report produced after Nathan died said he experienced “traumatic exposure” in Afghanistan and had “some elements of PTSD.” An inquest found he had died from hanging. During his six months in Afghanistan the soldier received a Mention in Dispatches. The citation for his award described him as “a ­superb example of leadership, professionalism and a fantastic ambassador to his corps.” The MoD said: “Careful consideration is given to each case and the decision not to include WO Hunt’s name on the Armed Forces Memorial does not detract from his service in the Army. We are eternally grateful.” The Sunday People’s Save Our Soldiers campaign is fighting to give those who come back from war zones the care they need and deserve.

Pauline Perry, , avoided serious injury in the ordeal, but was traumatised after the stray firework initially landed in her garden and caused her rattan furniture to catch fire.When the blaze caused her patio door to pop, Pauline opened the doors and desperately tried to move the furniture away from her home.But this caused the fire to shoot through her living room and destroy the downstairs, reports Liverpool Echo. Four fire engines dashed to the property in Norris Green, Liverpool, on Bonfire Night at around .pm. The homeowneraposs neighbour, Steve Finlay, who took Pauline in last night after the fire services boarded up her home, said she had not spotted the growing fire as her curtains had been closed at the time. Steve, , said: After the fire ripped through the living room, the neighbours spotted the flames and ran over to get Pauline out of the house and help. Pauline, who is originally from Wolverhampton, West Midlands, moved to Liverpool with her husband around six years ago and has since spoken about how much she loves the area and community.But her partner died in September after being admitted to hospital with sepsis. Steve continued: “She was only just readjusting after her husband’s passing and then for this to happen - there’s just no justice. “I know Pauline has the same views as me when it comes to fireworks already and that is we should no longer be selling them. Only organised displays should be allowed and there should be a stop on selling fireworks to households. “It isn’t acceptable.” Steve said that the community all came together to help Pauline last night. He added: “We have a great little community but we all just done what normal people would do.” Alistair Smith, a local from a neighbouring street has since set up a GoFundMe page in a bid to raise money to help Pauline get back on her feet. He said: “Pauline is okay but just in a bad state. “We’re hoping to raise some money in the community just to help her through it all - every little helps.”  A spokesman for Merseyside Fire and Rescue confirmed that the fire was caused by a stray firework and the incident was not a targeted attack. They said: “Firefighters arrived to find the ground floor of a two-storey detached property well alight and committed  teams of two firefighters, with a hose reel jet each, one team fighting fire, the other searching the house for occupants. “One occupant was out of the property when crews arrived and an ambulance was requested for precautionary checks. “The fire was under control by .pm and crews continued to search the building before firefighting ceased at .pm. Crews continued to damp down and remained on scene until .pm. “An investigation revealed that the fire had been caused by a stray firework igniting garden furniture which had then spread to the property. “ Comment MORE ON FireFireworksBonfire Night\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Chloe Madico, , went out for a palaposs birthday to Popworld on October  in Guilford, Surrey where she said she was surrounded by school friends the entire night.Chloe was shocked when she woke up the next morning with a mark on her leg and realising she couldnapost remember a huge part of the night, SurreyLive reports.She said: I have no recollection of the night whatsoever, my friend had to tell me a lot of the stuff that happened.I just assumed I was just really drunk, even though Iaposd never experienced anything like that. I was apparently dead weight, I was falling to the floor, I couldnapost string a sentence together.  Chloe added: When we saw the mark on my leg in the morning, we just assumed I had cut myself. When she ed to Bournemouth, where she now lives, her flatmates said they saw similar marks on social media with reports of others being injected. She continued: At first as I was just aposoh it will be fineapos but my flatmate was insisting I go to the hospital. Nurses and doctors at Royal Bournemouth Hospital confirmed it looked like an injection mark.  Chloe says now she needs to get multiple blood tests, vaccinations and trips to the hospital and a sexual health clinic to make sure she has not caught anything from the needle that spiked her. Chloeaposs ordeal comes as police forces around the UK have received a growing number of reports of people being spiked in bars and nightclubs around the country, with some allegedly being targeted with needle injections. The increase in reports and accounts has led to some institutions ramping up their efforts to keep patrons safe. for our daily newsletter to keep up to date with all the essential information atwww.mirror email. Some pubs have installed led aposairport-styleapos security at the doors and others have scrapped aposladiesapos nightapos over safety concerns.The spiking reports also led to a national movement to boycott clubs, which was organised by university students. Chloe now hopes to raise awareness for anyone to see medical attention as soon as they can. She continued: The only reason I went to hospital was because a girl I lived with sent me a social media post - I just thought it was a cut and kept saying I would be fine. If she hadnapost convinced me, I would have been sat here thinking it was a cut on my leg. I was so shocked at the time I had no idea, thataposs why I didnapost go straight to AE. Looking back now I know I definitely needed to. Chloe says that although she felt safe going out she believes establishments could make improvements to make it safer. She said: No disrespect to Popworld, but they couldaposve done more on entry. I know itaposs hard to bag search everyone but they were just doing spot checks rather than everyone.  I know it might take longer to get people in and it could cause bigger queues but I do think they need to up their game. A spokesperson for Popworld said: The safety of our guests and our team, has always been, and remains our number one priority and we continually review our safety and security procedures to ensure our customers and staff remain safe. We treat all allegations of spiking seriously and ask customers to bring this to our attention immediately should they have concerns their drinks have been tampered with.Advice and guidance on spiking, both drink and injection, is available from Talk to Frank.The organisation says:If you start to feel strange, sick or drunk when you know that you couldn’t be drunk, seek help from a trusted friend or the venue management.If you think you have been spiked, get a close friend to get you out of the place as soon as possible and take you home or to hospital . Or ring a friend, relative or partner and ask them to come and pick you up.If you feel unsafe, vulnerable or threatened you can ask for help by approaching venue staff and asking them for ‘Angela’. This code-phrase indicates to staff that you need help and a trained member of staff will then support and assist you.Make sure you can trust the person you ask for help, and don’t go anywhere with a stranger or acquaintance.Once you are safely home ask someone to stay with you until the effects of the drug have worn off, which could be several hours.Call for medical helpyou need it and tell the police what happened. “We are aware there is increasing concern over alleged increases in spiking in clubs and bars and have therefore enhanced our measures and employed Guest Support to assist any guests that are feeling vulnerable or unwell. These team members are easily identiable, as they wear a neon armband. We have enhanced security checks on our door, and we ask guests to remain vigilant and report any unusual or suspicious behaviour to one of our team immediately. A Surrey Police spokesperson added: We received a report of spiking by injection over the weekend commencing Friday, October . The victim is receiving ongoing medical care and support from family and friends. This is the first such report of needle spiking that we have received in Guildford, although we do occasionally receive reports of drink spiking. Our Divisional Drugs Liaison Officers and Licensing Officers work closely with nightclubs and bars to raise awareness of this issue, including giving advice to the venueaposs staff on how to recognise the signs in someone whose drink has been spiked, and what to do in that situation. We will continue to liaise and work with them in relation to this latest issue. We would encourage anyone who believes they have been a victim or witness to spiking, in any form, to contact their local police force as soon as possible. Any reports of spiking will be investigated and taken seriously.

But the esteemed actor admitted the wedding celebration - on May ,  at Frogmore House in Windsor, Berkshire - was his most stressful DJ gig. This wasn’t at the community hall — the reception. This was a big, big deal, Elba, who grew up in London, said.  Meghan had sent me a playlist, so I knew what she wanted already. They’re good friends and I wanted to make sure they had a great time, so there was a lot of pressure.Elba, who made his name in US crime drama series The Wire, has also performed DJ sets at Ibiza superclubs and huge festivals around the world, reports Mail Online.But dad-of-two Elba, who is a big Arsenal fan, entertained some global superstars at the royal wedding.  While showbusiness friends, including George Clooney and James Corden, were invited, some of Harry’s oldest friends were left wondering why they hadn’t made the guest list. Tom Inskip — known by his friends as ‘Skippy’ - did not get an invite. Harry had been best friends with the man for years.Elbaaposs revelation comes amid claims Meghan and Harry are planning to carry out more fake royal tours next year. Royal commentator Neil Sean has claimed the couple will visit Australia and Japan in , despite critics questioning what their new role has become since breaking away from the Royal Family.

Apparently they are looking to tour Australia, Japan and back to certain areas of the United States.

She was finally back at her weekly choir meeting, after months of online sessions only during lockdown. But this isn’t any choir – it’s a special singing group, Shared Harmonies, for people with respiratory problems. For Christine, who has pulmonary fibrosis, it’s a leline. “It’s brilliant,” says Christine, , a retired secretary who lives in Drighlington, West Yorks, with her husband David, . “You meet new people. You make friends and are able to talk to people who really understand your problems.” Until now, most people with conditions like pulmonary fibrosis had to find such support groups themselves by searching online or contacting charities. But in , the NHS committed to hiring , special coordinators by March  – helping doctors prescribe activities like gardening groups, community choirs and fitness classes.Now, the Government hopes community groups can help tackle the country’s health and wellbeing crisis in the wake of the pandemic. Emma Baylin, a former NHS volunteer coordinator, welcomes the changes. “It’s positive the NHS sees the value in social prescribing. It can help with early intervention and prevention for a host of wellbeing and health issues,” she says. “I’ve seen first-hand people who have reduced their dependence on NHS services through accessing community groups.”  Nicola Harker, a le coach and former NHS GP , agrees. While working as a GP, she once took the unusual decision to prescribe poetry writing to a patient who had suffered a stroke and was struggling to express himself verbally. “It’s hugely valuable. This particular patient was very frustrated but traditional medication wouldn’t have been able to help. It almost brought me to tears to see how his le changed because he had a new vocation and he solved his communication dficulties,” she says. “While we have to be realistic that social prescribing can’t patch over the funding gaps in the NHS, it can certainly help. “I’d like to see people on the waiting list for mental health services being connected with community projects in the meantime, or people going through cancer treatment finding groups which allow them to express their experiences.” Christine was diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis in  after a persistent cough and breathlessness. At the time, she was given from three to five years to live. “It was devastating, but doctors have since found a cause for my condition and I’m still here  years later,” she says. She found out about Shared Harmonies online, and discovered a class a few miles away in Leeds. “We start by doing relaxation exercises, before deep breathing and stretching. Then we sing two or three simple, short songs with harmonies. “Sometimes we get things wrong and have a few laughs. I’ve made great friends over the years and couldn’t wait to get back to meeting in person after lockdown.” While Christine and her husband were lucky enough to find lots of local support groups online, she agrees more people would find groupsdoctors signposted patients to them. “I don’t know what I’d do without them,” she says. “I have friends locally who I can talk to but it’s not the same as speaking to someone who really understands what you’re going through.”  Christine goes for regular breathing tests and says singing every week has improved her lungby seven per cent. But it’s the emotional support she values most. “It’s so comforting knowing there are groups like this out there, and I think it’s great the NHS is going to start prescribing community classes more.” Avril Clerkson, who teaches fitness classes for people with limited mobility, is also thrilled about the NHS proposals. “People often think they won’t be able to exercise after surgery or being diagnosed with an illness, but we offer a class anybody can do regardless of mobility,” says Avril, , who lives in Addiewell, West Lothian, with husband Steven, . She found out about Paracise exercise classes after being diagnosed with breast cancer during a routine mammogram. She had a lumpectomy and some of her lymph nodes were removed, meaning she had limited movement in her left side and suffered from lymphedema, a fluid build-up in the body. “The diagnosis was a horrible shock and I’d always been very active so it was great to find a class I could still do after my surgery.”  Since starting the classes, she has regained full movement in her left side and the swelling in her left arm is greatly reduced. Now she teaches Paracise classes and has seen the benefits for others too.In lockdown, she could be found bouncing around in her kitchen teaching classes on Facebook.“A lot of people were saying they lived alone and were missing the company Paracise brings,” she says. “So I kept the groups going online and it was a godsend for a lot of people.”The Scottish health service already refers people to her classes for a range of health conditions, including arthritis, fibromyalgia and stroke. And she is glad social prescribing is becoming more widespread.“Classes like this can help prevent people having falls at home, help faster recovery from surgery, and can prevent some people needing mental health services, which eases the NHS burden.” For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here.Aishah Iqbal has psoriasis and says community groups helped her cope with the condition in lockdown. “I’ve had it for  years. It started during my GCSEs from stress and has impacted me at dferent points in my le,” says Aishah, , a paediatric doctor from Leicester. “It gets really itchy and has an impact on my ability to concentrate in the day and I don’t get much sleep at night so it’s a horrible cycle and hits my confidence.” During lockdown she suffered a particularly bad flare-up and turned to a community support group she found through Facebook. “When I wasn’t really getting much social interaction, I found it harder to fight the sad feelings brought on by my condition. “But having people around me who were going through something similar made me realise I wasn’t alone.” Aishah believes social prescribing can be a leline. “Stress and anxiety can make long-term health conditions much worse, so while medication can help, emotional support is important too. While the NHS is great, there are limits to what it can provide, so putting people in touch with community groups is a great idea.” ■For more information go to sharedharmonies or paracise Comment MORE ON NHSHospitalsMental healthPrescriptionsFitnessSunday MirrorCoronavirusFitness And Health\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Saiqa Parveen, , who refused the jab while pregnant, died after Dua was saved by a ­caesarean. Today Saiqa’s brother begs mums-to-be: “For God’s sake, get the vaccine.The heartbroken family of the unvaccinated mum who died from Covid without getting to meet her newborn daughter have begged all pregnant women to get jabbed, Birmingham Live reports.Saiqa died in intensive care after catching the virus while carrying her fth child and before she went into hospital. Last night her distraught family told the Birmingham Live of their pain as they implored other expectant mums to get vaccinated. Releasing a picture of Saiqa fighting for le in hospital – and the beautul baby she never got to hold – brother Qayoum Mughal, , urged: “For God’s sake, get the vaccine.”Saiqa, from Birmingham, was eight months into her pregnancy when she fell ill in mid-September. She was offered a Covid shot in summer but insisted she wanted to wait until her baby was born. As her condition worsened, Saiqa was placed in intensive care and underwent an emergency caesarean section at full term on September . She died this week – leaving behind her husband Majid Ghafur, , and daughters Noor, , Imaan, , Hibbah, eight, and Ayesha, six – and without ever meeting newborn Dua Maryam. Qayoum revealed how Saiqa’s daughters made a heartbreaking final online FaceTime call just an hour before their mum died on November . He told the Sunday Mercury: “They said, ‘Get up mummy, we are waiting, we are missing you, we love you, why are you leaving us behind  Just get up’. They were praying and in tears.” One in five of the most critically ill Covid patients are unvaccinated pregnant women, NHS figures show.Since July, % of patients on special lung-bypass machines were expectant mums who had not had their first jab. Qayoum, a dad of four, said: “I strongly ask all people please get their vaccination, otherwise you will have a bad situation like we are facing. “Get the vaccine and avoid this sort of tragedy. The family is completely broken. There is such a big sadness.” Saiqa had no underlying health conditions and her pregnancy had been routine until she tested positive for Covid on September . Two days later she developed breathing problems and was taken by ambulance to Birmingham’s Heartlands Hospital. She was discharged six days later only to be admitted to Good Hope Hospital on September  with breathing dficulties. Qayoum said: “She was on oxygen and on September  she called my we at pm and said she had signed documents saying thather condition worsened, the doctors could operate to take the baby out. “My we said she sounded very tired and only spoke for a few minutes. That was the last conversation with any of us. “The next morning her husband phoned us and told us that she was on a ventilator and they were preparing to operate. At pm, the doctor called her husband and told him they had delivered a baby girl. “We did not see her because she was on a ventilator in intensive care. She never saw her daughter.”By now Saiqa was also battling le threatening sepsis, a hole in both her lungs, as well as pneumonia and other infections.Qayoum said: “They allowed her husband to see her on October  and the doctor said she was very ill. “The doctor was telling him to talk to her. She was sedated but could hear. “He was talking to her, telling her that her eldest daughter is asking you to get up and ‘where is her birthday gt’ and she is missing mum. As soon as he said this, there was one long tear coming from her eye. That was the first and last reaction we had from her on the ventilator.”  Saiqa died just before pm on Monday. Her death certicate records respiratory failure and Covid- pneumonitis as the cause. Qayoum, who has had Covid himself, said: “Her daughters ask, ‘When’s mummy coming back ’ Saiqa was the most caring person, she couldn’t live without her family. She was a lady of principle. “She cared for everybody and her mother is still alive. She was very hard working and a helpful lady.” He added: “Her husband is crying but he’s got to be strong for his daughters.” The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation says all pregnant women should be offered a Covid jab after studies proved it is safe. Previously it was offered only to pregnant women in frontline health and care or to the extremely clinically vulnerable. More than , mums-to-be have had a first dose and around , a second. Data from over , Covid vaccinations in pregnancy in England and Scotland, and a further , in the US, show there has been no subsequent harm to the foetus or baby. England’s chief midwery officer Jacqueline Dunkley-Bent said: “The Covid- jab can keep you, your baby and your loved ones out of hospital.”For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here.Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON NHSHospitalsPregnancyGiving birthNewborn babyCoronavirusSunday PeopleCoronavirus vaccine\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Then he dumped her for another nurse – all behind the back of his trusting we. Fuller, , would go on to abuse scores of bodies in two hospital mortuaries. But his mistress only learned of his grotesque offences when he faced court last week. She told the Sunday Mirror today: “To think I’m associated with someone who did something so terrible is awful. I’m very lucky he didn’t kill me.”  As MPs called for an inquiry into Fuller’s hospital access, the woman, whose identity we are protecting, also revealed:She lived in a studio flat just around the corner from his two victims in the Bedsit Murders. Fuller charmed her and seemed the “perfect gentleman”. They met at a hospital social club, he drank Archers and lemonade and once took her to a Beverley Craven pop concert. Fuller always appeared to be ice cool and “would never get angry”.The woman believed Fuller to be an “ordinary, quiet man” – yet he was an arrogant lothario who had affairs with at least two female colleagues during three marriages. She started dating Fuller in  when he was with second we. Three years earlier he had sexually assaulted and killed Wendy Knell, , and Caroline Pierce, , in Tunbridge Wells, Kent.  The woman, now happily married, said: “I was quite aware of the Bedsit Murders and I was very nervous about them. The murders were in my mind and a lot of young women’s minds. “Little did I know I was actually dating the person responsible. In the back of my mind I do still think, ‘Why was I spared ’ “I was in the right criteria in that I lived in the roads near where the girls worked, I had a bedsit and I was in my s.”  Fuller admitted his guilt last week, four days into a murder trial. It was then revealed in court that he had defiled up to  bodies in hospital morgues. His female victims ranged in age from nine to . The revelations have shaken Fuller’s ex to the core. She told the Sunday Mirror: “He was a perfect gentleman with me. I didn’t see a bad side to him at all.  “There was nothing to lead me to believe he’s the person we’ve now found him out to be now. “He never showed any perversion in bed. He was totally ordinary and normal. There was nothing at all. I still can’t believe that he could be capable and part of me still doesn’t want to believe it, but equally I want him to pay for what he’s done. “I didn’t know anything about the mortuary offences until it came out in court. I was really shocked. The police said to me, ‘Be prepared for a nasty shock’, but I wasn’t expecting anything as horric as this. I just thought it was going to be that there were other women like me, or multiple women that he was dating all at the same time. It’s been a traumatic time.”  She went on: “I was  when I began seeing him and I was with him for just over two years. “I was a district nurse and some of us used to go up to the canteen in Kent and Sussex Hospital . I was at a loose end and trying to make new friends, so I started going to the social club. I remember thinking he was quite odd for a man because he drank Archers and lemonade. “He wasn’t a beer man. He was quite a quiet man, but he was quite friendly. He just seemed like a perfectly ordinary person.”  She remembers Fuller being in a cycling club and doing the -mile London to Brighton ride. One of the club routes went directly past the dyke where he dumped murdered Caroline. Of their dates, she said: “The first outing was to the Folkestone Air Show. We once went to a Beverley Craven concert in London and he would visit me at my flat, but most of it was at the social club at the hospital. “He wasn’t the type of bloke to take me out for dinner or offer to take me anywhere particularly, but he was always pleasant and friendly. He would never get angry. It was hard to know what was going on in his head.  “He was an electrician at Kent  Sussex Hospital at the time. Sometimes when he was on call, rather than stay in his house at Broomhill Bank School, he’d stay in the nurses’ home. “I knew he was unhappy with his we. But our relationship ended because he didn’t want what I wanted and he didn’t want to be with me any more. I had to accept that he didn’t want me and he wanted someone . “I remember him saying to me that he had met another staff nurse and he was going to start seeing her.”  The woman called police last December after news of Fuller’s arrest. She explained: “When I saw his name I thought, ‘Well, Fuller is a common surname’. I looked at my phone hours later and there was a photo of him. I recognised him from the fact his eye was turning in. I was really shocked.” Fuller’s arrest came after a DNA breakthrough. A search of his home uncovered hard drives revealing prolic sexual offending of a kind no British court has seen before. Between  and , he had filmed and photographed himself sexually abusing the bodies of dozens of women and girls at the Kent and Sussex Hospital and nearby Tunbridge Wells Hospital. Fuller admitted two counts of murder at Maidstone Crown Court. He previously admitted  sexual offences, including  counts relating to  identiable mortuary victims. MPs have called for a public inquiry. And the daughter of one victim said: “It kills me to think of David Fuller’s hands on Mum in the mortuary.” Meanwhile, his shaken ex is having counselling. She added: “What he did is up there with the Moors Murderers, the Wests and Shipman. If I could eradicate it all, I would. I keep thinking, ‘Why was I so naive and stupid to get involved with someone like him ’” aposFailure to learn lessons of Savileapos - Comment, by Mark Williams-Thomas, the ex-cop who exposed Jimmy Savile The dead deserve as much dignity as the living, but David Fuller denied victims any respect whatsoever. He got away with murder for  years. Evading capture, he convinced himself he was untouchable. And, like all sex offenders, he then sought out vulnerable victims – dead women and children – to fulfil his warped sexual desires. But it is only by luck and the arrogance of Fuller that the police uncovered sexual offending as far back as  at two Kent hospitals because he kept “trophies” of his attacks and records of his abuse. In , I exposed Jimmy Savile – the DJ and TV star who sexually assaulted patients for decades across the NHS. It led to  hospitals undertaking urgent reviews.But it is clear now that lessons were not learned and, yet again, the most vulnerable in our society have been failed. In  Fuller had a criminal records check which revealed he had hidden a string of burglary convictions. Yet he stayed in post. Fuller should have been sacked immediately. So why wasn’t he  Crimes of necrophilia are extremely rare and carry a maximum jail term of just two years. Post-Savile, a review highlighted the need to reduce access to mortuaries, yet this was clearly not the case at two Kent hospitals.  When Fuller murdered Wendy and Caroline he took trophies – something he repeated will all his future victims. That brings with it considerable risk because it’s a forensic link to the victim and compelling evidence. So why take such a risk  I have no doubt Fuller kept trophies so he could relive his attacks and watch footage again, enabling him to get perverse sexual gratication. I’ve no doubt Fuller has abused many more women and young people. His offending will be far wider than hospital mortuaries. I would go much further, given that we have over , unsolved murders in the UK and everything that I know about Fuller and how offenders operate. I say with some confidence that he killed again after .

Her husband works full-time as a lorry driver, but does not work enough to feed his familyA volunteer packs a food parcel at Feedo Needo in BirminghamByZoe ChamberlainChiara Fiorillo:,  Nov Updated:,  Nov A mum has been visiting a food bank every day for almost two years so she can feed her three children, herself and her husband. The woman has gone to Feedo Needo in Digbeth, Birmingham, since the beginning of . Her husband works full-time as a lorry driver, but despite his job, he does not earn enough to feed the whole family.Rafa Ahmed, project manager at Feedo Needo, told Birmingham Live : The parents come every day Monday to Thursday just before pm to collect sandwiches, bread, fruit, salad and snacks for their children’s school dinners the next day.Then on Fridays, they come to collect a larger food parcel that we put together for them for the whole week. It contains things like rice, milk, pasta, tins, packet meals, condiments and fruit for the children.  She added: For them, it’s become part of their daily routine. We have friendly staff and they’ve built up a rapport with them because they see them every day. They are a low income household and the children are very young. The dad works full time as a lorry driver but he doesn’t earn enough to feed the family, it’s not enough to keep the family going. He goes to work but they’re still having to rely on the food bank really heavily. This is the reality for some families. It’s something they’ve come to rely on, even though they shouldn’t have to. Feedo Needo is a charity that supports people struggling with homelessness and financial dficulty.It remained open during the first coronavirus lockdown to ensure no families went hungry.Rafa said she has seen an increase in the number of working parents and parents who have been made redundant, who simply do not have enough money to feed their children. The charity also helps people to overcome feelings of loneliness and isolation. She said: The family say it’s made such a dference to them and that they do not know what they would have done without the food bank. The mum also sometimes comes to our coffee mornings on Mondays where she can talk to others in similar situations. It’s good because people can interact with other food bank users and help each other with tips and advice. It’s nice for people to have that support, it’s good to know you’re not on your own. Feedo Needo recently won the Humanitarian Award at the Charity Today Awards, following a public vote. Rafa said: Itaposs overwhelming to see the small team at Feedo get such prestigious recognition for the amazing work they do across the Birmingham, Manchester, Bradford and London locations, helping the homeless and supporting families who have struggled financially, especially through the pandemic. Everything that we do would not be possible without our incredible volunteers and local partners and we cannot thank them enough for their continued efforts. While the next few months may be challenging, we want people to know that we can offer essential support through free food parcels, essential toiletries and multi-faceted community help.To find out more, and to donate to Feedo Needo, you can click here.Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON HomelessnessCoronavirusFood banks\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Thataposs because according to a former royal chef she has an unusual technique for eating the fruit so she doesnapost look like a gobbling monkey. Unlike the rest of us, Her Majesty refuses to peel and then eat it, instead, she peels it with a kne and fork. According to Darren McGrady, who once worked in the royal kitchens, the Queen would cut the top and bottom off, then slice the skin away -ways. She then chopped it up into small pieces before eating them with a fork.  Being strict about the way she eats bananas isnapost the Queenaposs only food quirk. She will never eat or serve, garlic - even on formal occasions. Although she has good reasons behind this - itaposs because the royal family have to meet and greet so many people so never wants the smell of garlic on her breath. Shellfish is also a no go area as itaposs one of the foods most likely to cause food poisoning. However, it was recently reported the Queen has given up one of her nightly habits when it comes to food and drink.

But it is now thought Her Majesty is shunning alcohol altogether - except for at special occasions. Her decision to give up booze is not linked to any health issues and a palace source said: It is a recent and personal decision by the Queen. Meanwhile, a family friend told Vanity Fairaposs royal correspondent Katie Nicholl: The Queen has been told to give up her evening drink which is usually a martini. It’s not really a big deal for her, she is not a big drinker but it seems a trle unfair that at this stage in her le she’s having to give up one of very few pleasures.” Comment MORE ON The QueenRoyal Family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Laura Evans, and Ed Knight, both , set themselves a challenge of making a Caddy Maxi van into a liveable space. The couple from Kingston-upon-Thames, London, deliberately purchased a small van to show others that home on wheels doesn’t always have to be big. The ‘adventure van’ was once used for workers of an energy and home services provider but now it is kitted out with a kitchen and bed. The couple used repurposed materials such as wood and even made a skyline roof by inserting a square window. Laura, who is a shop assistant, said: “It took four months for us to rip everything out, insulate and convert it into a mini camper. “We wanted to challenge ourselves and be creative as the pandemic put a halt on our international travel plans. “The van was in excess of £,. “And it cost £, on the mechanical work and materials such as reclaimed wood for the , the bed frame and small cupboards.“We tried to cut costs as much as we can by purchasing stuff from Facebook marketplace such as Moroccan tiles for the kitchen.“But we bought the oven brand new to ensure it worked.” All appliances such as the oven with a hob, fridge with freezer, tap with an electric pump, LED lighting, l fresh water and full solar system including a leisure battery were brand new.  But the stone sink was purchased from Facebook marketplace but was too big. Laura adds: The solution was to apossinkapos our basin into the unit and let the countertop form around. We love this finish and we believe it looks better thanwe had just simply placed it on top. Just like the kitchen doors, we used Scottish Elm for our countertops but kept the live edges and Eddy cleverly used a jigsaw to cut a waney edge to follow the curvy doors at the end of each unit.  Eddy made solid Elm shaker doors in the kitchen with close weave Rattan  which is a natural cane woven material. It is a biodegradable material which looks amazing. From the outside, the blue vehicle looks like any other Volkswagen van but inside it is a shabby chic space. With a wooden ceiling and laminate flooring, the van boasts enough room for two people but one cannot stand due to the low ceiling.  Ed said: “This is an adventure van - used for sleeping and eating. Itaposs perfect for curling up in bed and watching a movie but it is built as an adventure van so not one for spending days inside. “We loved seeing people’s reaction when we have opened the door in a public place. “They always had to double-take - especiallythey see us with a meal as you would never think there is a working kitchen in it.  “We wanted to show others that you don’t need a massive van to make a home. “We still have our home comforts such as fluffy pillows and a comfy mattress but you can’t stand up.” Ed, who is a joiner, insulated the van and did most of the handy work whilst Laura focused on bargain hunting and interior. The couple spent eight hours per day over eight weeks transforming the van into a living space.  They went on to travel around Cornwall and Isle of Skye, Scotland, before selling it. Ed said: “Laura did the finishing touches too such as most of the painting, oiling and sanding. It is much better to buy an ex-service van because it has been looking after and the mileage is good. “With clever designs, you can do it cheaper - making it better in the long run. “Laura lost her job in events as a result of the pandemic in December . “She began working part-time so this gave her something more to focus on. “We spent a total of £, and made some profit when selling it on.

It is forecast to bring sustained winds to the UK by Tuesday and a US National Hurricane Centre map shows it headed right for the country. This comes as there is currently a yellow warning for wind in place for northern Scotland until pm on Sunday. The warning states: Strengthening west to north westerly winds will bring gusts of -mph perhaps locally mph, to exposed locations of northern Scotland. “These winds initially across the Western Isles and north west mainland Scotland on Saturday evening, spreading to the north east mainland and Orkney overnight and Sunday morning. “In combination with high spring tides this is expected to lead to large waves around the coasts. Winds gradually easing through Sunday afternoon.” Britain is set for more unsettled next week as remnants of Tropical Storm Wanda arrive from Tuesday. Met Office forecaster Dan Harris said: “Tropical Storm Wanda is not too far from the UK - and may indirectly influence the forecast early next week.”Netweather and STV forecaster Jo Farrow added: “If Wanda gets caught up with another Atlantic low pressure, its tropical energy could help bring wet and windy weather to the UK.”It is currently over the Atlantic Ocean and will move north eastwards during the course of the weekend. On Sunday night Wanda is expected to weaken and be downgraded to a non-tropical feature, and what is left of the storm will become embedded within a larger Atlantic frontal zone, the Met Office said.  This will then move across the UK on Tuesday and Wednesday. The Met Office said it could lead to rainfall and potentially weather warnings - although the timing and track of the system is still uncertain. UK forecast for next five days Today: Windy, especially across northern and eastern Scotland where gales or severe gales and high gusts expected. Many areas will be dry with sunny spells, but some showers are likely in the north and west and the Midlands. Colder than yesterday. Tonight: Daytime showers fading this evening leaving many areas dry and chilly with clear spells overnight. Turning cloudier with rain at times in the west later. Becoming less windy. Monday: Bright at first in the south and east, then turning cloudier later but remaining mainly dry. Cloudier and windier in the north and west with rain at times, especially later. Outlook for Tuesday to Thursday: Cloud and rain moving southeast through Tuesday with blustery showers following in the north. Cloud and outbreaks of rain in the south likely ing north midweek.

Lorraine Scott was out with her dog in Wirral early this morning when she got spooked by a strange man approaching her car. Lorraine, who is from Birkenhead, was taking her German shepherd dog Toby for a run on Leasowe beach at around .am this morning when she got freaked out by a stranger following her.The -year-old told the Liverpool Echo : “I turned into the car park for the beach and I spotted this maroon car on my right hand side.“I carried on driving down towards the steps to the beach because it’s easier for the dog and parked by a vacant car.  “I then started to sort everything out, like get my wellies on and get Toby sorted and noticed that the maroon car must have turned around from the way he was facing when I drove in as it was pulling up beside the vacant car by me. “I knew whoever it was had seen that I was on my own when I drove past, but I didn’t think anything of it at this point.” Lorraine said she continued to prepare for her run when she noticed a man get out from the car and begin slowly making his way towards her. She said he was scanning the area intensely while walking towards Lorraine’s passenger seat. Lorraine said: “At this point I started to get really panicky and I just froze. “I couldn’t really do anything, I just froze.” The man continued to slowly approach Lorraine but it was at this point that three-year-old Toby saw him getting ‘too close’ and began to react to his ‘strange’ presence. Lorraine said: “Toby started barking and going mad at him and then straight away the man jumped and ran straight back into his car and drove away very quickly. “I’m just really happy I had my protector with me. He’s naturally a protective breed and because of our bond he will always protect me.”  Lorraine said the incident freaked her out as she has never been in a situation like that before and despite being trained in kickboxing she didnapost know how to react.Writing about the incident on a community Facebook page, Lorraine said: “If I had been on my own, this might have been a dferent story - luckily my German shepherd is protective of me.“Iaposve been at this beach before and never had anything like this happen and there is always people camping the night there so never usually though anything strange about people being parked up there. “Hopefully this post will make people aware there are some weirdos about and to be extra careful, so glad I have a German shepherd to protect me.” The man was said to be wearing a black tracksuit and and black crew neck t-shirt. He had a shaved head with blonde hair, was of a slim build and approximately ft  in height from what Lorraine could make out. Lorraine says she is still shaken up after the incident and in future she will continue to walk Toby with her husband like she would usually do.

Summer Tatum, , was shot twice in the head following a row with Hunter James Tatum, , at their home, authorities say.

The victim, who had cerebral palsy, begged: Don’t hurt me, please, don’t hurt our baby, please don’t hurt our baby.  According to Mr Clarkaposs testimony, her husband responded: No. Get away from me. Authorities determined the circumstances of the incident from three surveillance cameras outside the Tatumsapos home in Prattville, Alabama, as well as security footage from a neighbouraposs home. Mr Clark added: The video doesnapost show much, but it picks up the audio. You can hear the victim screaming and then two gunshots.

The woman, who is due to marry her boyfriend of five years in , have opted for a child and pet-free wedding something which they had hoped all their loved ones would be happy to oblige. But, this is where things get a little complicated. The bride, , has a younger sister, who adopted a golden retriever as a psychiatric support dog to help aid with her bipolar disorder and depression, a little over a year ago.Generally speaking, people take their service dogs everywhere with them, but the bride has come to a dficult crossroad, due to the fact her fiancé, , was attacked by a golden retriever when he was a child, and was forced to attend therapy so he could learn to be comfortable around animals again.He is now fine around all dogs but golden retrievers, the woman explained on Redditaposs AITA forum. Because of this, my sister always visits us without her dog. Sheaposs usually fine to go outshe is with our mum and doesnapost want to bring the dog, this is what my sister says not me assuming.She continued: When my fiancé sees a golden retriever in public, he usually tries to stay as far away as possible and avoids them until they pass. This is usually extremely distressing and he canapost be in the same area as them. Not always resulting in a panic attack, but having him on edge and in flight or fight mode. Obviously not ideal for our wedding. When planning save the dates, we told our immediate family in person. When telling my family, my sister begun talking about how she would buy a bow-tie for her dog to wear at the wedding. This took place at our home and her dog wasnapost present. My fiancé brought up his discomfort and I backed him up, telling her that her service dog couldnapost come to the wedding. The woman told her sister she should attend the wedding without her dog, just like she does when sheaposs visiting their home, and the bride-to-be was quickly accused discriminating against her sister, with the -year-old telling her the service dog was essential for her ing in le.

I brought up how she was her without her service dog aposingapos fine but she immediately starting crying and having a panic attack. My parents took her side and left quickly with her still crying. My brother took my side but thataposs only because he believes she doesnapost need a service dog. I have no opinion in her dogs validity, the woman continued. My parents called me the next day to tell me that it wasnapost acceptable not to allow my sisters service dog to come along, and that it would mean she couldnapost come. Honestly weaposre not that close and she was only coming as a guest, so I posed the idea that she come for a dinner with me inidually before or after the wedding to celebrate. Now my parents are threatening to not come and claiming disability laws against me. She added: I honestly think my fiancéaposs comfort on our wedding is more important than my sister coming, and selfishly I want my fiancés focus and attention on me and our special day. The woman then turned to Reddit to question whether sheaposs justied in not allowing her sisteraposs service dog to attend the wedding. Why do your sisteraposs psychological issues trump your fianceaposs trauma at his own wedding  According to your post she has visited you multiple times without her service dog, so it doesnapost seem like a stretch for her to be without her service dog for your wedding, one Reddit user commented. If she absolutely feels that she cannot be without the dog for your wedding, then she can just not attend. Also, the disability laws donapost apply here as attending a wedding is not a protected right. Another added: Your fiancée issues do have a priority since he is the one getting married. If your parents are present she shouldnapost need the dog since she goes places without the dog all the time.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

The first report of the true tail dates back to the th Century, according to the journal. The little oneaposs fth limb was the only complication after its birth at  weeks premature around January this year.

Sometimes it can go great, but sadly, thataposs not always the case, and many daters have experienced being catfished, or arguably worse their date not showing up at all. One woman has revealed how she thought her date had done a runner halfway through their date, after he disappeared for  whole minutes after conveniently aposforgetting his wallet.aposTikTok user Ashleigh @hai_im_ashleigh_had been speaking to her date aposPaulapos for several months before they were able to finally meet up, due to conflicting schedules, but when he heard she was hanging out at a shopping centre near where he lived, he offered to come over and meet her.  Since Ashleigh was with a friend, Paul offered to treat them both to dinner and she admits he seemed to be a very nice guy. We met him at a LongHorn steakhouse - he shakes her hand and hugs me, she explained in a TikTok clip. Once we get to the door [of the restaurant], he starts patting his pants and goes aposoh my god, I left my wallet [in the car]. Go ahead and put our name on the waitlist.

More than  minutes later, Paul hadnapost come back, prompting Ashleigh and her friend to believe theyaposd been stood up, so they left and decided to get a McDonaldaposs instead. So I was sitting there, almost in tears, because I really liked this guy, she continued. And me and my friend just decide to leave and go grab some McDonaldaposs because I wasnapost really in the mood to get a steak dinner at that point. But, as they were leaving the restaurant, the pair noticed Paulaposs car parked up nearby, so Ashleighaposs friend decided to march up to the vehicle and confront him. My friend went up to the car and let out a scream, Ashleigh recalled, adding that she quickly ran over to see what all the fuss was about. Me being the nosy a** I am, went up to the car, looked in and saw this man butt a** naked.

Researchers have claimed to find the definitive answer as to why toast always appears to fall on the most inconvenient side, and it’s to do with the height of the table that you’re sat at or the height of which you drop it. You see, after a piece of toast begins its descent, it usually only has time to execute a half-somersault before it lands on the floor. As the side which is buttered will naturally begin facing upwards, this will likely be the side to land flat on the floor. In order to confirm this theory, food expert, Professor Chris Smith and his team at Manchester Met University dropped  slices of toast from a table which was two and a half feet high.  Unsurprisingly, in  per cent of cases, the butter side landed face down on the floor. Following the experiment, Professor Smith concluded thatyou want to ensure that any slice of toast lands butter side up rather than down, you should invest in a higher table of around eight feet high, thus allowing space for the toast to rotate a full  degrees. The most contributing factor is the height of the table but the actual physics of a slice of toast also have an affect. The air pockets in a slice of bread create drag as it falls through the air. Buttering just one side of the bread alters the surface and therefore the levels of drag, and the way in which it rotates.It is a phenomenon that has puzzled scientists and the public for nearly  years, it was even discussed as long ago as , in the New York Monthly magazine.So there you have it.Comment MORE ON Chris SmithMaths-Whizz\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts with news to brighten your daySubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

I met Ben when I was , having just left my husband of  years. We were teaching in the same school and bonded immediately – after I had given him a telling off for not doing his job properly! We moved in together three months later, in the summer of .Our little house was perfect, but odd noises kept us up at night. We’d hear footsteps on the stairs and despite it being a new build, we put it down to creaky floorboards and cooling pipes.Then subtle sounds became a whole lot scarier. One afternoon, Ben was out and I was happily relaxing in the bath when I heard a male voice call my name. I froze – maybe it was the old tenants  Nervously, I called out, “Who’s there ” but the house was silent. I was shaken to the core, but I didn’t tell Ben. We were still in the early days of our relationship and I didn’t want to seem like a madwoman! But that all changed a few weeks later. We’d just finished dinner and popped the telly on, ready for a chill evening on the sofa. Out of nowhere, our pot plant shted across the shelf in front of us and dropped to the floor. We both stared in disbelief – the hairs stood up on the back of my neck. We couldn’t deny it now, our house had a poltergeist. It shattered everything I felt I knew about le. Brought up in a strict Catholic family, I was taught that there’s no such thing as ghosts. But now I know they’re very real.Moving house costs a fortune, we couldn’t afford to just jump up and leave. I felt like I couldn’t talk about what I was experiencing, scared of losing respect at work. We had to come to terms with it and initially had no intention of sharing our story. Then, two years later, we decided to find others who were experiencing hauntings, to help us feel less alone. We thought we’d be laughed at, but it turns out haunted houses are quite common. We started off scared of the ghost but thought, well,it’s gonna get us, it’s gonna get us. It’s massively frustrating when we’re woken up in the night, or when a door slams in our faces, but we cope OK. There are actually two spirits in our house. Dave is always here – he’s thought to be attached to us, not the house. He was the first spirit to reveal himself. A psychic told us his name, and his frustration that we weren’t acknowledging him. But things have calmed down a lot. It’s like living with an invisible housemate, who’s made it known that his favourite food is spam!When we moved in I had really bad headaches. We’ve recently discovered that Dave passed away in a car accident – he had a blow to the side of his head, the same side as my headaches. The other spirit, Andy, is the late brother of the psychic medium who investigated our house – we think Dave and Andy have actually bonded! My scariest moment was when Ben was away. I was startled awake to the sound of growling in my ear. I started recording on my phone to document what had happened and watched as a spirit lted my hair from my shoulder. That felt too close for comfort.I sought advice from experts who told me to set boundaries with the spirits and it hasn’t happened again. I never feel alone in the house and I’ve come to love living with spirits. Sometimes it’s so quiet we wonderthey’ve gone. There’s a lot of activity when we’re stressed or anxious, so they must feed off our negative energy. Using a ouija board, I asked Dave and Andythey’d protect our unborn baby – they said yes. Dave was convinced the baby would be a boy. We recently found out the gender at a scan and he was right. I was gobsmacked! People probably think we’re absolute idiots, that we have demons in our house and we’re putting our unborn child at risk. But there’s no heaviness or bad vibes here. There’s le beyond death, and that’s all I’ve ever wanted to hear.Ben Hubbard says: aposAs a kid, I had a love-hate relationship with horror movies. I liked to get scared, but always had in the back of my mind that they weren’t real – now I’m living in my own version of a Hollywood blockbuster.  I remember seeing shadows out of the corner of my eye, or feeling someone watching me in my own home.But I was a sceptic – I wouldn’t believe it was a ghost, let alone two of them! When objects started moving in the house, I was terried. I’d seen The Conjuring movies – I thought we were going to die. Soon we were coming home to a pigsty – our possessions thrown around in a mess. So we decided to put up motion-activated cameras to capture Dave and Andy in action. One day, I watched a pair of scissors fly out of the kitchen drawer. I don’t want to think about what would have happened we were in the way at the time. A few weeks later, I woke up to use the loo during the night. I looked up to see the outline of a man standing right in front of me. My jaw hit the floor. I was definitely awake and my mind was in overdrive. It couldn’t be real – could it  We speak to Dave and Andy using a spirit board and a ghost-hunting app. They’re the budget options, because it’s not cheap chatting to ghosts! Dave loves winding me up. I was alone one day playing FIFA and saw something move out of the corner of my eye.I leapt up and left the house. Lainey came home hours later to find me sitting barefoot on the doorstep looking sad – I feel way more comfortable when Lainey is with me! Most people say our house feels happy and calm, but a few friends hate it. A mate offered to house-sit while we went away. A few hours into our journey, he rang to say he’d heard footsteps walking across the room. In the early hours, he rang again saying, “I’ve posted your keys through the door. I’m leaving.” Apparently he’d been lying in bed when the duvet was pulled away – that was the final straw. He bolted and hasn’t been back since. Movies show ghosts throwing people down the stairs – I’m so grateful that we don’t have a basement, that would be game over. But it’s not so bad. Weird things happen now and then but it’s OK, we’re not possessed! We post very real footage of our spirits online but not everyone is willing to accept it. We’re not sharing stuff to make people believe. It helps us understand what’s happening and we love being part ofa paranormal community. At first I was very fearful, but now I love our spirits.

The -year-old woman was out enjoying a meal with her family in a restaurant which was catered to families and young children, when a child aged around nine started yelling, running up and down the aisles and doing cartwheels. It was annoying but we just ignored him and carried on with our meal. His mother was sat at their table talking to the adults she was with and completing ignoring her son apart from occasionally telling him to come and finish his food, the woman wrote on Redditaposs Am I The A**hole forum.We were sat in a booth and I had my stuff on the bench next to me, including a hat. One of the many times he ran past our table, he stopped, picked up my hat and put it on. Just as the boy went to run off with the hat, the woman sharply told him, give that back right now, and he obliged, with an embarrassed look on his face. The woman went on to tell him it is extremely rude to take other peopleaposs things without asking, donapost do that again.

The woman then turned to Reddit to question whether she was justied in aposscoldingapos the child, and she was met with overwhelming support. I have four kids and I would be absolutely appalledthey acted this way in public, one Reddit user commented, while another added: Kid needs to learn some manners somehow and it seems like his mum isn’t going to be the one teaching him how to act properly in public. Kids shouldn’t be allowed to run around inside a restaurant for any reason, let alone do cartwheels, a third wrote. They could knock someone’s food over, hurt themselves or someone who’s just trying to do their job or enjoy a meal out.

The men put their lives and those of others at risk by forcing their way off the Airbus A in what police believe may have been a planned to enter Spain illegally. They appeared to push past medical and airline staff at a plane exit door after a brief struggle before running down the aircraft steps and disappearing into the darkness at Majorca’s busy Palma airport. A woman could be overheard shouting: “They’re escaping, they’re escaping, the lads are staying in Spain” as they fled the plane. The drama unfolded shortly after the Air Arabic Maroc-operated aircraft, which was heading from Casablanca to Istanbul in Turkey, made an unscheduled emergency landing in Majorca when a passenger “fell ill” and went into an apparent diabetic coma. The Moroccan man was rushed to hospital with a companion who promptly escaped the medical centre as the “sick” man was given a clean bill of health following a check-up. As he was being taken to Son Llatzer Hospital and the aircraft doors were open,  other passengers took advantage of the confusion to make their daring escape, forcing a shutdown of operations at the airport which lasted nearly four hours and caused chaos. Twelve of the  passengers who left the plane at Palma Airport remained unaccounted for last night after a central government spokeswoman confirmed several men all believed to be Moroccans had been intercepted in dferent parts of the island. Most were held in the municipality of Marratxi, a half-hour drive north-east of Palma, including four detained following a tip-off from a local who had seen them acting “suspiciously” in the street and linked them to the plane escape. The majority of the missing men are thought to be Moroccan although one has been described as Palestinian.  Spanish officials said they could not rule out the possibility the incident was an “orchestrated” coup to enter the country illegally in their first comments yesterday regarding the incident. But they said they had no evidence at this stage to point to the incident being planned beforehand and linked to a “deliberate” attempt by another passenger to fake a medical complaint. Responding to earlier reports a Moroccan man on board the Airbus A from Casablanca to Istanbul had exaggerated the seriousness of a diabetes problem so he could be taken to a hospital with a companion who vanished on arrival, a central government spokeswoman for the Balearic Islands said: “The protocol that is always applied in a medical emergency that the pilot of the plane requested was applied in this case. “It may be that this protocol is revised once the current investigation is concluded in the light of this unique event in our country. Revealing  of the  passengers who had abandoned the plane were still missing, Aina Calvo said: “All options are still on the table but we don’t have any information that enables us to affirm at this stage that we are dealing with an orchestrated operation by people who have entered Spain irregularly and formed part of a pre-conceived plan.”  Contradicting earlier information, she also insisted none of the passengers who had been intercepted had requested political asylum. Police sources said however they believed at least part of the group that fled the plane had planned their mission beforehand, lending support to the theory the unnamed passenger that sparked the medical emergency had invented or exaggerated his desperate state of health to facilitate the coup. Spanish airports authority Aena confirmed business had been resumed as normal in a tweet just before midnight on Friday, some three and a half hours after it revealed all normal airport operations had been suspended following the shock runway invasion. It confirmed yesterday morning on Saturday morning  flights scheduled to land at Palma had been erted - five to Barcelona, four to Ibiza, two to Menorca, one to Madrid Barajas and another to Valencia. Around  incoming and outbound flights, including several international flights, are said to have been delayed. The National Police and the Civil Guard, Spain’s two national police forces, are involved in the hunt for the runaways and are believed to be getting assistance from local town-hall employed police forces across the island.

Terence Darrell Kelly, , allegedly abducted little Cleo Smith at a campsite where she was on holiday with her family in the early hours of October .The girlaposs disappearance sparked a major search operation in Australia until officers found her alive and well on Wednesday this week -  days after she went missing. On Friday the stateaposs Justice Department said suspect Kelly was flown to a maximum-security prison in Perth.  Since his arrest for the alleged kidnapping, a number of fake Facebook accounts believed to be used by the Bratz doll collector to interact with his main accounts - Bratz DeLuca and Terence TezKelz - have emerged. With one of the accounts, he pretended to be a teenage girl and a mum, it has been reported. A woman from Sydney said she was horried to discover Kelly used her pictures and those of her daughter to create his fake virtual family. She said she has no connection with Kelly, as she explained: Of the millions and millions of people, what I want to ask is, why me  What have I done or what has my daughter done  Who is following us for this to happen   The mum added: My daughter hasnapost done anything wrong, and I havenapost done anything wrong, but now it looks like we are friends with this dude.Yesterday, it emerged that Kelly reportedly posted a cryptic message the day Cleo was abducted and that his Facebook profile was following the child’s mum.It is alleged Kelly made a strange post on Facebook at am on October , saying: I canapost accept friend requests from strangers .... I live a private le and I respect those who are on my friend list to ensure their privacy is respected too. Us adults have to be careful online too.  The post stated the person wouldn’t be mates with anyone just because they have a friend or a family member in common. Cleo went missing from her familyaposs tent at the remote Blowholes Shacks campsite in Macleod in Western Australia. Police mounted an extensive search by land and air, set up roadblocks and scoured CCTV footage. Officers found her after breaking into a locked house in Carnarvon, a town about  km south of the campsite on the far northwest coast of the state. Footage released by Western Australia Police shows the moment the little girl was found as an officer brought her to safety.Another officer then spoke to the child who appeared calm and nodded her head.  The first words of the missing four-year-old upon her being miraculously found by police alive and well were: My name is Cleo. In a statement released after Cleo was found, her parents Ellie Smith and Jake Gliddon said: We are so thankful that our little girl is back within our arms and our family is whole again. The suspect is next due to appear in court on December .

Much of North Koreaaposs large conventional artillery force is deployed along the fortied border with South Korea, where they have the range to reach as far as the heavily populated capital city of Seoul.  The drills come at a time when the enthusiasm to undergo intensive training prevails throughout the Korean Peopleaposs Armyfor ushering in a new heyday in strengthening the state defence capabilities under the banner of self-defence”, KCNA reported. They were overseen by Pak Jong-chon, member of the Presidium of the Political Bureau and secretary of the Central Committee of the ruling Workersapos Pary of Korea, KCNA said.  Pak is a general long seen as a rising star in the countryaposs powerful military and a major player in its missile programme who was promoted to his current positions in September. General Rim Kwang-il, chief of the General Staff of the KPA, and commanders of the participating units, observed the drills with Pak, KCNA said. Supreme Leader of North Korea, Kim Jong-un, was not present at the firing.  As soon as the firing orders were given by the commanders of the combined units, gun barrels to annihilate the enemy competitively shelled the target to accurately hit it, the report said. This comes as it was reported that North Korea can get all the uranium it needs for nuclear weapons through its existing Pyongsan mill. Satellite imagery of tailings piles suggests the country can produce far more nuclear fuel than it is, a new academic study concluded. Despite a self-imposed moratorium on nuclear weapons tests since , North Korea has said it is continuing to build its arsenal, and this year it appeared to have restarted a reactor that is widely believed to have produced weapons-grade plutonium. Research published last month in the journal Science  Global Security by researchers at Stanford University and an Arizona-based mining consulting company said: It is clear that the DPRK appears to have substantially more milling capacity than it has been using to date. This means that the DPRK could produce much greater quantities of milled natural uraniumdesired.

now under way, we#ve put together a collection of Covid vaccine tracker charts to monitor the progress of the Covid- vaccine rollout across the UK.How many people have been vaccinated How many people have received the vaccine in my area Which demographics have received the vaccine What is the uptake like during pregnancy The Covid vaccine tracker below shows an at-a-glance view of the current proportion of the Scottish population who have received the first and second dose of either the Oxford AstraZaneca or the Pfizer BioNTech vaccination so far.Data on the number of people vaccinated was initially provided in a weekly report from Public Health Scotland, however there was immense pressure to keep the public more regularly informed so on January  the statistics began to be provided each day.The chart below shows the daily numbers of first and second doses provided.The chart below shows the cumulative number of people who have received each dose since the vaccination programme began on December .It#s also helpful to look at this data as a proportion of the Scottish population so you can see how the percentage of people vaccinated grows over time.The chart below shows the progress for each UK country.On January , Public Health Scotland provided this data broken down by vaccine type which is shown in the chart below.The map below shows the available data on the regional rollout of the vaccination programme.January  saw the release of data by local authority area for the first time, which is shown in the map below.Regional data was originally available on a weekly basis but moved to a daily upload on February . The chart below contains data on the daily number of doses provided and the population covered. Use the drop down box to select your area and the buttons to move between daily vaccinations, cumulative vaccinations and the percentage of the population who have received first doses.Similarly to the regional data, data by demographics were originally provided in the weekly PHS report # however on February  they moved to a daily publication schedule.The chart below shows the daily number of people who have had first doses in each age range as well as the percentage of that population covered.There is limited data available on vaccinations in pregnancy, however we do have monthly data on the number of people vaccinated by pregnancy trimester.Coronavirus in Scotland #

I#ve certainly got my motivation back.#I really enjoyed the Hawick race as I had a great battle with Michael. It#s the most exciting cross country race I#ve been involved in as we were so evenly matched.#Michael was better on the firmer surfaces, but when we moved onto the muddier marshland parts of the course I seemed to get the upper hand.#Although he#s currently doing well in athletics, Chepelin still has a strong passion for orienteering, the sport in which he has represented Great Britain on a regular basis through the age groups.He is keen to secure a place on the team for the  urban sprint world championships to be held in the Danish towns of Kolding, Fredericia and Vejle next June.Chepelin said: #I was in Denmark recently with the GB squad for a high-quality training week, which finshed off with some good sprint races. It was good to be involved again.#And it was great to see the places where the world championships will be held. It gave us a chance to get a feel for the layout of the towns.#The urban sprint championships is a relatively new event and it#s a very exciting format of racing. There#s an inidual sprint, which lasts up to a maximum of  minutes. There#s also a knock-out sprint and a sprint relay.#It sounds like fun and I#m keen to do it. And, looking a bit further ahead, the  urban championships are to be held in Edinburgh, which is exciting.#In the meantime, Chepelin is happy to maintain his progress by tackling a iety of races over the coming months.He said: #I#ve signed up for the Seven Reservoirs trail half marathon at the beginning of December. It#s held in the Pentland Hills, so it won#t be an easy course.#He has also expressed an interest in the Bristow  mile trail race at Balmoral in April, an event he won in .Chepelin said: #That#s certainly appealing. I enjoyed it last time and would be keen to go again.#I just need to sit down and plan what I#m doing for the first part of . The trial races for the orienteering world championships will start at the end of March, so I need to work around that.#British k trail running champion Meryl Cooper is used to competing in mountainous events which last for five hours or longer # but over the next few days she#ll tackle two races which, for her, will seem like mere sprints.The north-east athlete, who recently relocated from Oldmeldrum to Banchory, travels to Fe on Sunday for the Tentsmuir Forest k trail race.Then, on Tuesday evening, she#ll head for Kemnay to compete in the second round of this winter#s Fetternear Shadow series of .k trail races.She said: #The Tentsmuir race is quite a small one, but I just fancied giving it a go. It#s very dferent to the sort of thing I#m used to doing as it#s relatively short and quite a flat course.#But I#m looking forward to finding out where I#m at when competing over that sort of distance. It will be a bit of a marker for me.#And Tuesday night#s race is even shorter. It#s the second of a series of six held over the winter, but I missed the first one.#I think the higher intensity of running over these shorter distances will still help with my ultra distance training.#Chris Hillwon the opening Fetternear Shadow race last month when completing the course in :.

We created two or three good chances but in the second half we conceded early from a mistake and then ran out of steam but overall I was happy with the performance.ldquoWe had four players making their debut, Andrew Mackay, Ben Viola and Lewis Grahame who all signed from Penicuik and Ben Brady, who had just been released by St Mirren played as a trialist.ldquoBenpicked up an injury the second-half and had to go off. Hersquos had issues with his ankle all season and went over on it. He didnrsquot train on Monday night, so wersquoll see how he is for Saturday.ldquoWe have another three players lined up that we like the look of but whether they will be signed and available for Saturday, I donrsquot know right now. Hopefully one or two may be able to play.ldquoSaturday will be a massive game for the club. The Edinburgh Uni and Gretna games probably came a bit too early for us.\"It would have been betterwersquod had three or four weeks with the players first, but it is what it is. I watched Gretnarsquos Scottish Cup game against Berwick Rangers and have received some reports on them but they have a new manager so their style of play may have changed..removeldquoBut Irsquove been delighted with the response of the players so far.

Along with the leboat, the warship HMS Eastbourne, Fishery Protection vessel Vigilant and the US Navy ship Victoria began combing the area between the south of Arran and Kintyre.They were joined later in the search by a Dakota aircraft from Prestwick.An RAF patrol vessel stood by at Campbeltown.Campbeltown leboat reported the discovery of a large piece of timber. It was, however, too heavy to lt aboard and it was not thought to be part of possible wreckage.Then, after six hours, the search was called off.

goal last Saturday after an th-minute strike resigned the Kintyre Park side to a narrow defeat away to St Peter#s.Playing at Renfrew FC#s impressive New Western Park, the McFadyens-sponsored Pupils started the match brightly, despite another y injury list which saw several established first-team players ruled out and others unavailable due to work commitments.The Pupils took the lead before the -minute mark when John McCallum, playing at right wing in a --- formation, reacted quickest to Craig Lamont#s long throw-in, which bounced up on the dry synthetic surface, to guide a deft looping header beyond the reach of the St Peter#s keeper.The Kintyre side had efforts from left winger Scott Souden and lone striker Sean Grady go wide of the target – the latter#s promising effort deflected wide of goal – while McCallum was released by Grady and rounded the hosts# keeper only for his cutback to be cleared for a corner, away from the feet of the waiting Souden.At the other end, the Pupils had a new-look combination in defence, with full backs Craig Lamont and Michael McKinlay, and Ross Souden in central defence partnered by -year-old debutant Antonio Akoulli, studying in Scotland and hailing from Thessaloniki, Greece.The four had to be alert to the efforts of St Peter#s wingers Menzies and Lewis on either flank, and did so very well for the opening  minutes until a lapse in concentration saw Scott Lewis – signed from fellow WoSFL side Benburb FC for a transfer fee – ghost along the edge of the box and slot home a fine finish across keeper Alasdair Ferguson with his weaker left foot, into the young keeper’s bottom left-hand corner to make it -.Impressively, the Pupils rebounded from this setback and scored with  minutes played when Liam Renton, playing as an attacking midfielder, latched onto a ball from Scott Souden just inside the hosts# box, and turned his marker sharply before guiding a left-footed shot beyond the keeper#s grasp.All the while, the Pupils# deep-lying midfield pairing – a real contrast of experience levels between skipper Keith Mitchell, and Conner Brown beside him making his club debut – continued to break up play and keep the Feathers Inn-sponsored side moving forward.Despite this, there was a further scare in the visitors# penalty area when St Peter#s hit the bar from a powerful volleyed shot on the stroke of half time, but the Pupils# lead remained intact.Into the second half, though, the Pupils were pegged back in the opening few minutes of proceedings, a clever turn and precise shot beyond the grasp of Ferguson providing a fine equaliser.Admirably from a Pupils point of view, there was no onslaught from the ision#s third-placed team, also boasting a loan signing from Greenock FC, another semi-professional side, in their midfield ranks, and smatterings of semi-pro experience across their starting .However, what followed instead was a gradual build-up of pressure which the Pupils had to work increasingly hard to contain, the home side#s willing forwards continuing to probe for openings in the visitors# defence.The hard-working pair of Matthew Lang and Calum Houston were introduced in attack for the Pupils with  minutes remaining, with fresh legs required as the embattled visitors# energy levels began to wane.But even the dismissal of Lewis for the hosts, hitting out at Renton in reaction to a robust tackle from the latter, which earned the Pupils man a booking, couldn#t deny the Paisley side a late, late winner, a long ball going undefended in the Pupils ranks, and slotted home in the box by a St Peter#s midfielder to give them all three points, and in turn deny the Pupils a probably deserved draw.The Pupils# management team conveyed thanks to the travelling players for their efforts, even in defeat, and will surely take consolation from giving experience to young talent in the side, with four club debuts made in the space of week – after -year-old Andrew Renton#s appearance against Rossvale on cup duty – and within that clutch, a potentially very useful defensive addition.Tomorrow , the Pupils are at home to Glenvale FC, from Paisley, again on league duty, with kick off at pm.For more information, visit @PupilsAFC on Twitter or Campbeltown Football on Facebook."},{"url":null,"title":"leader october 29 2021","story":"More must be done to prevent the continued spate of

The company acquired services radiating into the region from Edinburgh as well local route networks taking it as far south as Berwick on Tweed.As a result, the West Coast identity is to be found all over the Borders.Combined vehicle strength is now around , a far cry from fewer than  in the s.I#d like to conclude this abbreviated survey with two final observations. Firstly, I wish to acknowledge and applaud the drive and foresight of the Craig family in building the business from its original heartland in the southernmost area of Argyll.Public transport is full of challenges whether air, sea, rail or road and, as in every field of business le, there are never any guarantees of success.Once any business reaches a successful position, it often requires even more effort to maintain it there, let alone continue to grow it in size and influence.The presence of Covid since  has, of course, created major dficulties for every business virtually across the board.Finally, a word of praise for the staff and especially for those who are engaged on the vital long-distance links, particularly the Campbeltown, Oban and Skye services.These routes are not only amongst the most weather prone in Scotland, they operate almost exclusively over ordinary trunk roads, iniably convoluted in nature and of borderline width for the safe transit of long vehicles.A driver myself, though never on any of these routes, I#m familiar with all these roads and have some perception of the extreme challenges drivers frequently face.To them, and to all the company#s staff and management, I, and I#m sure many readers who are users of the services West Coast Motors provide across Argyll and in other parts of Scotland, offer grateful thanks."},{"url":null,"title":"muddy good rugby festival at taynuilt","story":"More than  players from Campbeltown, Lochgilphead, Oban, Fort William, Mull and Taynuilt took part with some fantastic rugby on display across all the age groups from the Micro P-Ps to the P s.Conditions were damp under foot given the amount of rain that has been falling lately.

In adverse weather it is more likely a collection could be missed.ldquoIt is very windy where we are so they will get blown all over the place.Wersquove also got quite a distance between the collection point, so instead of wheeling two bins out, we will now have to carry two boxes, loose cardboard, a food carrier and a sack.ldquoThe council has pushed through these changes without public consultation.He feared the changes would ldquoreduce the number of people recycling and would disadvantage older and disabled residents, who would have to carry the boxes to the kerbside.Mr Booth added: ldquoThis in itself is a health and safety issue. The council may offer an assisted collection but many people are too proud to use that.He also said there were increasing hygiene issues in rural areas, adding: ldquoI live on a working farm and often the lane is covered in cow dung. We are going to end up with manure in the boxes or on ourselves when the boxes are moved.ldquoWill the council collect boxes contaminated with cow dung And he claimed: ldquoldquoMany East Lothian residents have for many years complained about these recycling boxes as being totally unsuitable for their needs and, instead of listening to the taxpayers of East Lothian, the council has forced through the changes and made the system more complex. For people to engage, the collection system must be simple to understand.Another rural resident, Helen Robertson, of Quarryford, near Gford, wrote to the Courier to express her dismay at the loss of the recycling wheelie bins .An East Lothian Council spokesperson said: ldquoThe new recycling collections will be a weekly service rather than fortnightly, which potentially means each household, whilst being able to recycle more, will present less than they currently do on a fortnightly collection.ldquoThis system is a county-wide system and an assisted service is available for householders who, through disability, age or ill health, are not able to present their containers for collection and have no one living at the household who can assist.The new recycling service in East Lothian had been due to launch in September but was pushed back to November due to problems with the delivery of the new weighted bags.The local authority says that the ldquorefreshed recycling service is designed to help residents recycle more than ever before with all materials collected by a single vehicle into separated compartments."},{"url":null,"title":"halloween-gallery-musselburgh-burgh-primary-school-celebrates-style","story":"Children across the school took part in ious in class activities including potion making, pumpkin carving, Halloween science and crafts, alongside lots of singing and dancing.A Musselburgh Burgh Primary Schoolspokesperson said: \"Each class took part in a costume parade where our dinner-lady Linda and our janitor Roddie had the very tricky task of picking their favourite costumes from every class.\"Everyone had a great day and there was lots of smiles to be seen across the whole school.\""},{"url":null,"title":"youths-allegedly-vandalise-house-port-seton-halloween","story":"The home, on Castle Terrace, was damaged by a group of youths ndash mostly young boys ndash on Sunday evening.The homeowner said that five of them approached and knocked on the front door but, as no one was home, there was no answer.Upon leaving the property, two of the five boys allegedly picked up stones from the driveway and threw them at a bedroom window at the front of the property, causing two holes in the double-glazed unit.The estimated damage to the windows is pound.The incident, which was caught on CCTV, has been reported to police."},{"url":null,"title":"former-guides-celebrated-90-years-combined-service","story":"Margaret Craigie and Frances Monaghan, from Musselburgh, have both been members of the guild ndash which offers social opportunities and supports Girlguiding ndash for  years, having joined in .They received their badges from Lorraine Dickson, East Lothian County Commissioner, at a presentation at the Fisherrow Centre on South Street where the guild meets.

Parents, teachers, books, libraries, had all failed them.Times have moved on. In , the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Changes Special Report on Global Warming of .degC jolted many into awareness and there are now multiple campaigns, some of them driven by the kids, for proper climate education in schools. Meanwhile, some of the most enlightening books Irsquove read about climate in recent times have been pitched at children.Picture books often present us with highly original ways of looking at an issue. In The Biggest Footprint: Eight Billion Humans. One Clumsy Giant by Rob and Tom Searsall the humans in the world are put through whatrsquos called a smoosher to create one single giant, ldquothe mega human. When the same is done for ious other species or even the food we eat, the relative sizes are poignantly enlightening. A tiger no bigger than our mega thumbnail. A beef burger as wide as Table Mountain. But big could be useful. Whatwe put the mega humanrsquos whole enormous brain and ldquogalumphing body behind solving the problem, the book asks.There are books out there that provide inspiration for multiple conversations. Many raise issues of consumerism and waste. In The Whale Who Wanted More by Rachel Bright and Jim Field , Humphrey the whale cruises around the ocean looking for the perfect item that will make him feel complete, but ndash picking up so much stuff, from shiny things to flotsam and jetsam ndash he starts to struggle.In The Bongles series of books by Oscar Van Heek and Dean Queazy , the waste of human civilisation washes up on a tiny island occupied by monsters, who, like Wombles, put it to good reuse or upcycle.Somebody Swallowed Stanley by Sarah Roberts and Hannah Peckprovides a glimpse into the impact of waste plastic on ocean le by telling the story of Stanley, a carrier bag who is successively swallowed by a iety of marine creatures.Knowledge is power for this generation as for all of us and there are also books that provide good science as well as tales. James Croll And His Adventures In Time by Jo Woolf , for instance, tells the story of the th-century Scot who was one of the first climate scientists, while also providing scientic explanations of the ice ages.Many childrenrsquos environmental books contain tales of hope and empowerment. Again and again, they tell us about how small voices, small people, can create ndash or be part of creating ndash necessary change in a big and terrying world. The message that small voices can ring loud is there, for instance, in Karine Polwart and Kate Leiperrsquos riotous version of the traditional folk tale, The King Of The Birds, now retitled The Queen Of The Birds , which tells about the wit and ingenuity of a small creature, the little wren.Itrsquos also there, for older readers, in Piers Tordayrsquos The Wild Before , the prequel to his dystopian trilogy The Last Wild, which describes an Earth in which almost no animals still exist. In The Wild Before, Little-Harersquos world has been encroached on by sinister farming methods and when he sees a calfrsquos mother die, it sets him off on a heroic quest. Bull tells him, ldquoA little one must save the mooncalf to avoid what follows, which is, according to legend, ldquoa great Terribleness.Therersquos a notable abundance of girl heroes. Perhaps thatrsquos not surprising given that the most famous young climate voice of our time is a girl. But even before Greta Thunberg came into the public consciousness, some people were telling stories about girls fighting to save the planet. Among them was climate scientist Michael E Mann, whose  ebook, The Tantrum That Changed The Worldfeatured a young girl taking on the powerful grownups. That we find these eco-hero girls in books as well as in real le suggests to me that this is a story that resonates with our time ndash not just with children, but with adults.Plenty of books, of course, exist about Thunberg herself ndash for instance, Greta And The Giants by Zoe Tucker . But there are also fictional tales of great emotional power centred on girl heroes. Two outstanding books for --year-olds that tell of the connections between young girls and wild animals are Hannah Goldrsquos The Last Bearand Kiran Millwood Hargraversquos Julia And The Shark .Bear Island, a remote spot in the Arctic Ocean, is the setting of Hannah Goldrsquos powerful debut tale of mourning and call to protect the planet, The Last Bear. April, whorsquos , and her meteorologist father are the only two on the island, where he is studying climate change at its remote weather station. In this wild place, based on a real Bear Island which sadly no longer has a bear population due to melting of the Arctic ice, April unexpectedly comes across a stranded bear, a last bear, and befriends him. The book is dramatically illustrated in sombre monotone by Levi Pinfold.Julia And The Shark works a similar magic. It is a breath-taking tale, rich with facts and figures, again of a young girl and her scientist parents who move to an island, a lighthouse on Unst, where her mother hopes to spot her favourite animal, the Greenland shark. The bookrsquos beauty is in the way it thrums with an awareness of the connectivity of all le and an expression of its wonders ndash from murmurations of starlings to shoals of fish and the story of the slow growth of a -year-old shark. This isnrsquot just a wildle tale, though ndash itrsquos also one about family, mental health, the interior meteorology of the human body and why both facts and stories matter.One recent study, published in People and Nature, analysed the entire online Project Gutenberg archive and found that since , animal mentions in fiction ndash other than of domestic animals like horses and dogs, or ldquothreat animals like bears and lions ndash had dwindled dramatically. This reduction in the ersity of wildle featured in literature runs parallel to bioersity loss in the world. Such vanishings, alongside the dwindling of knowledge of the natural world, have triggered a wave of books about nature ndash including instant classics The Lost Words and The Lost Spells , by Robert Macfarlane and Jackie Morris.But some books take readers beyond that nature connection ndash they are about how we change the world, incitements to some kind of action. Among those in this territory is William Sutclfersquos entertaining and comic tale of generational dference, The Summer We Turned Green , which follows what happens when some Extinction Rebellion types move in across the street from a family.Some well-known authors of environmental books for adults have also realised the importance of communicating these messages to the generation of upcoming change-makers. Ten years ago, Mark Kurlansky, author of Cod, teamed up with graphic novelist Frank Stockton, to create childrenrsquos book World Without Fish , an urgent and alarming description of how climate change and overfishing are driving fish to extinction. Last year, the tree-advocate Peter Wohlleben published Can You Hear The Trees Talking  , covering the scientic marvels of trees.Many of the childrenrsquos books Irsquove loved best are the ones that have helped me broach the dficult issues with my kids. These books are just the type that can achieve that. They also send out a message of hope, which is not  or misguided. Scientists, after all, are telling us itrsquos still possible to avert the worst of climate crisis. The worst we can do for our children is let go of that hope."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13172478.jpg?type=article-full","title":"gemma-whelan-tower-gentleman-jack","story":"This is Whelanrsquos latest role, mum to a new baby, her second. But wersquore here to talk about another one, as a detective in ITVrsquos new crime drama, The Tower which starts on Monday and is stripped across Tuesday and Wednesday.Itrsquos a big deal for Whelan. After years as one of the most reliable supporting actors on TV, in shows such as Game of Thrones , Gentleman Jackand Killing Eve , shersquos finally the lead.ldquoItrsquos supposed to be the lead, she begins when I say as much. But she is still coming to terms with the idea, it seems.ldquoWe were just talking about women taking the lead and not apologising for it, she says of an earlier chat with another journalist for the Radio Times. ldquoI just find myself always going, lsquoWell, itrsquos an ensemble piece. There are lots of leads really. Itrsquos a real team piece.rsquoldquoBut when it comes down to it is led by me, yeah.She sounds almost convinced. ldquoIt was really nice to be offered my first lead for sure. Thatrsquos something everyone wants.Were you surprised, Gemma  ldquoEither way I answer that I sound pathetic. lsquoNo, I wasnrsquot surprised,rsquo sounds arrogant and lsquoYes, I was surprised,rsquo sounds like I donrsquot believe in myself.ldquoI guess I wasnrsquot surprised because it was a really nice meeting. I really loved the character. I felt like I could bring something to it. It just felt like a fit. And so, I wasnrsquot surprised when my agent called and said it had been offered. I was utterly thrilled and then immediately thought lsquoOh my God, childcare logistics.rsquoIn conversation Whelan is self-deprecating as a matter of course in that peculiarly English way, playing down her talents when shersquos perfectly entitled to play them up. Since she first made a splash playing her own comedy creation, socialite Chastity Butterworth, she has been jumping between comedy and drama with alacrity.The Tower, which tackles sexism and racism in the police force, is very much at the serious end of the spectrum. It sees Whelan play DS Sarah Collins, who is assigned to investigate the deaths of two people an experienced officer and a -year-old girl who appear to have fallen to their deaths from the top of a tower block in south-east London.With a script by Patrick Harbinson, best known for his work on  and Homeland, and based on the novels of Kate London, what quickly becomes clear in The Tower is that DS Collins is a woman in a manrsquos world. And one that looks after its own.Gemma Whelan in Game of ThronesldquoItrsquos dealing with a lot of nuance, a lot of systemic sexism and racism, the way that we judge things, the way that we speak to each other, how we tackle events in dferent ways, whorsquos right and whorsquos wrong, Whelan suggests.And her own character might not necessarily be the best judge of such things, she admits.ldquoSarah Collinsrsquos moral compass is black and white, up and down, Whelan admits. ldquoThere is so much room for nuance and dferent judgements within the police. There is no right or wrong. Itrsquos a fantastic liquid thing to be dealing with.Collins is ldquocompletely wedded to her job, Whelan suggests.ldquoShersquos not hugely successful in love and so she really throws herself into her job. She doesnrsquot have family to speak of and so she lives and breathes her work and doesnrsquot really pay attention to hours of the day. If the work needs doing, shersquoll be there. Shersquos running away from something. Who knows what  Shersquos been doing it a long time, shersquos good at her job and she knows she is. But itrsquos still very much a manrsquos world that shersquos working in.As a result, she has to give as good as she gets. ldquoI like that shersquos not trying to be liked, Whelan suggests. ldquoI think a lot of women do try to be liked and shersquos not trying to be liked at all. Shersquos just trying to get the job done to the best of her ability and get the best out of her team. But not everyone works the way she does. Some of them do have lives outside work.Even from the first episode itrsquos clear the limits of her position in a culture that is defiantly masculine. Machismo is still a thing in Sarahrsquos world. Have you found it to be the same in acting, Gemma ldquoI think early on maybe yes. There was a lot more room for innuendo and things like that, things that now people would never say. What you might dismiss as lsquobantzrsquo. If you hear any lsquobantzrsquo now everyone shuts down. There is not space for it anymore. Itrsquos a great thing.Gemma Whelan in The TowerldquoIrsquove never found myself cornered by any terrible language or situation at work thankfully. Irsquom quite happy to hold my own or shut down or leave the room If somethingrsquos not helpful to my day. Irsquove never felt threatened.The Tower is further proof that women are moving front and centre on our screens. They are no longer there just to support the male lead. Therersquos no greater example of that than the BBC drama Gentleman Jack. Whelan shot the second series of the th-century drama this summer just after The Tower finished filming.ldquoI was quite heavily pregnant by then. I wrapped in the summer before I really, really, really didnrsquot fit into the costume anymore.ldquoBut isnrsquot it brilliant that everyone was so willing to go, lsquoWho caresyoursquore pregnant  Come to work. Yoursquore not ill. Yoursquore not an invalid. Wersquoll work around it.rsquoldquoI think a lot of people handle Preggers with kids gloves, but women are very tough.Gentleman Jack was one of TVrsquos most joyous dramas of recent years. It must be fun playing opposite Suranne Jones at the top of her game, I suggest. ldquoAnd shersquos so sexy in it, so androgynously appealing. And attractive. Shersquos formidable, shersquos brilliant. Itrsquos an exciting thing to watch her.Possibly with the exception of Yara Greyjoy, Whelan doesnrsquot tend to get that kind of showier role, but therersquos a strength to her that deserves to be acknowledged. And not just onscreen.In the past she has spoken about her own teenage struggle with anorexia. I wonder what it took to speak out about it.ldquoI think like many things in a career like this you come from a position of fear and not wanting to stop the flow of your career by introducing the fact that yoursquove had mental health issues, or yoursquove struggled with something, she admits.But things are changing.ldquoI think therersquos a culture of sharing things in order to help each other. It is a fine line certainly. You donrsquot want to be oversharing. But just to say, lsquoThis happened. I went through it andyou are too, there is hope. You can get through it. Itrsquos hard work, but you can.rsquoldquoI think thatrsquos a positive thing to share with people.She pauses before adding, ldquoItrsquos not an unusual story. I think.Itrsquos worth saying that in the middle of this exchange she has to break off to talk to a friend she has just spotted. ldquoIrsquom doing an interview. Irsquom sorry, she tells her, before coming back to me. ldquoIrsquove seen one of my very best friends and her dog. At which point she seamlessly s to her point. Such professionalism.One of the thrills of The Tower for Whelan is the chance to play a detective. She is a huge fan of true crime podcasts, as are many other women. Is it because women are more aware of just how dangerous it is to go out at night than men ldquoI hadnrsquot even thought that true crime fans tend to be women until you just said it, but yoursquore absolutely right. Most of my female friends are really into it and men find it quite weird.ldquoI hadnrsquot seen it from that point of view before. It could well be. Who knows We talk about the murder of Sarah Everard and how men and women reacted dferently to it.ldquoMy brother and I go for evening jogs, and so does my husband. When it happened, he didnrsquot think twice about still going and I thought, lsquoIrsquom absolutely not going out,rsquo which Irsquom sure is an echo of behaviours in many households.In our time together Gemma Whelan tells me shersquod love a career like Olivia Colemanrsquos. She remembers fondly her early days playing Edinburgh, but shersquos not sure she could hack sharing a room with five people these daysShersquos going to film a small role in a new ITV drama in the coming weeks, but other than that shersquos concentrating on being a mum.Her son hasnrsquot woken up throughout our chat. ldquoHersquos still asleep and I can still see my best mate so Irsquom going to go and catch up with her.Itrsquos shaping up to be a good day.The Tower begins on STV on Monday night at pm and continues on Tuesday and Wednesday at the same time"},{"url":null,"title":"t20-world-cup-scotland-bowler-mark-watt-reveals-chat-india-legend-ravi-ashwin","story":"The Scotland spinner presumably had a smile on his face when he told one of cricketrsquos all-time greats he was coming for his wicket, given that India were already well on their way to clinching a comprehensive T World Cup victory.It still speaks volumes, though, for the  year-oldrsquos state of mind that he was willing to make the comment even in jest, a sign of his soaring confidence on the back of what could well be his breakthrough tournament.Scotland finish up their fixtures against Pakistan hoping for a first Super  victory after four successive losses but Watt has emerged from that disappointing run with his reputation not only intact but enhanced thanks to his smart and economical bowling.Kohli and legendary spinner Ravi Ashwin were among those to say they have been impressed with the Scotrsquos performances and that has been music to his ears.ldquoSpeaking to Ravi for a good half hour or so was really eye-opening stuff, he said. ldquoIt wasnrsquot really technical stuff but just about when to bowl certain balls and how much time he puts into looking at what the batters are doing, and how they play against spin etc.ldquoHe was really complimentary about my bowling. He said I was bowling at the right pace for international cricket against big teams, and that I was a really smart cricketer who uses the crease really well.ldquoHe also told me their batters used a lot of analysis work on me which was cool to hear that Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli were looking at videos of me bowling before playing against me. They all rate me quite highly and Irsquoll take a lot of confidence from that.Wattrsquos performances have been fuelled by a mindset of no regrets. Bowling in T can be a precarious business but the Edinburgh player has bucked the trend by frustrating batters with his iations of spin, pace and distance.Pakistan will provide one more test of his credentials but he has thrived in this situation and hopes it may open other doors.ldquoWe had good prep before the tournament and played a lot of cricket in these conditions. I just felt like I was in a really good rhythm. I felt confident. Wersquod been training for the past two years without any games. There was no point in me going home and wishing I had done this or that. Irsquove just been going for it and leaving everything out on the park.ldquoItrsquos just little things like bowling from  yards to keep the batter guessing to get a dot ball here and there. Irsquove practised my yorkers for two years now and Irsquom trying to nail them just to get myself a bit of breathing space.ldquoT franchise cricket would be amazing so I can play more regularly against the guys wersquove been facing in this tournament. I feel I could play at that level and hopefully this tournament will open things up for myself and some of the other boys, too.Scotlandrsquos progression may have stalled after a strong part but their early success has brought messages of support from a number of unlikely sources.Ally McCoist waxed lyrical about the team on his radio show while Hearts-daft Watt received a special comment from one of his heroes.He revealed ldquoI put up an Insta post the other day of Kane Williamson [the New Zealand captain] and I had John Robertson of all people commenting, so that was a bit odd and pretty special. I think I was more excited about that than meeting the Indian boys!ldquoAnd Ally McCoist got all of the terminology right so he is obviously a cricket fan. He said he watched every ball we bowled against England [in ] and that was special.

In other words, this is a settled Scottish side: one which has already shown itself capable of winning big games, but also one which is arguably still some way short of its peak.Victory today would represent another signicant step in this teamrsquos evolution, but it will surely only be achieved by a unormly high level of performance throughout the  minutes. We cannot expect the Wallabies to commit the sort of last-gasp howler that gted Scotland their victory in the Stade de France, and we cannot hope for anything like the amount of space in attack that a very limited Tonga team allowed the home side last week.True, Scotland have won the last two meetings with the Wallabies, and they will be buoyed by memories of the Murrayfield match in , when they ran in eight tries to win - - a record points tally and a record margin of victory in the fixture. But, after a season or two of indferent form, this Australian team is getting back to its formidable best, and has won its last five games, including two against the Springboks.In retrospect it may seem obvious that the Wallabiesrsquo recent slump was bound to end, and that their victories over the past few months simply represent ato normality. But Townsend, for one, is convinced that there is a lot more to their revival than that. For him, the former Glasgow Warriors boss Dave Rennie has not only restored Australian morale since taking over as head coach in the middle of last year, but has imprinted his own style of play on them, in particular giving them a formidable cutting edge in attack.ldquoI think their style has changed, the Scotland coach said. ldquoDaversquos DNA is right throughout that team. They want to play quickly and they want quick ball through the ruck.ldquoThey want to be ambitious. But with the experience that he brought back in, whether thatrsquos Quade Cooper or Nic White and Samu Kerevi, there was a Test-match experience there of knowing what to do in certain situations.ldquoI thought their game plan against South Africa was outstanding. They made sure that they didnrsquot lose any ball in their own half, but then played really good rugby, kept hold of a lot of ball, and found space in that defence. That would have given them massive confidence.ldquoSo yeah, belief, I think. Just evolution. The longer Dave has been there, the games theyrsquove played against the teams theyrsquove played against would have helped them. And theyrsquove got some great players - they always do produce some outstanding players. And now I think people would say therersquos no Kerevi or Quade Cooper, but they brought back Will Skelton, Kurtley Beale and Rory Arnold. So theyrsquove got some quality players that havenrsquot been available to them in the last couple of years that are now back in their squad.ldquoJames Slipper has over  caps, Michael Hooper well over  caps, Kurtley Beale back in the squad - I think hersquos on  caps. So theyrsquove got far more experienced Test players than we have in terms of cap numbers. So while Quade Cooper played really well for them and hersquos an experienced player, theyrsquove got other guys in reserve who can step up.The Scotland team cannot boast comparable numbers, but more and more of them are approaching that --cap threshold that is widely regarded as the mark of a senior, fully-matured international. Captain Stuart Hogg, with  caps, has crossed it already. Finn Russell has , Grant Gilchrist , Ali Price , Hamish Watson .ldquoTherersquos players with a lot of Test experience around the group, and theyrsquore often not that old, Townsend added. ldquoSo we have every belief and faith that over the next two years, as we build to the World Cup and beyond, these guys will bring into camp numbers like we see from our opposition.The one area where Australiarsquos greater experience may prove decisive is the bench, where the likes of Beale, Skelton and Taniela Tupou all await. That is a formidable amount of firepower for Rennie to call on late in the game. Scotland can emerge victorious from what should be a close, absorbing contest, but there will be little or no room for error against opponents who have rediscovered their relish for the fight."},{"url":null,"title":"cop26-glasgow-timely-reminder-sport-needs-step-efforts-go-green","story":"The arrival of COP in Glasgow has ensured that everywhere you look, there is an action plan, a suggestion or a theory about the best way to tackle climate change.Sport, as is often the case, came late to the party but finally, it has arrived.For years, decades even, worries about climate change and the world of sport never collided. But, at last, the sporting world has woken up both to the dangers of climate change and to its responsibility to becoming greener.In Scotland, the threat is becoming all the more apparent. There are a number of sports that are particularly susceptible to the effects of climate change, and the dangers are already all too apparent.The rise in global temperatures means Scotlandrsquos snow sports ndash along with those in the rest of the world ndash are almost certainly going to be badly affected in the coming years.Already the impact of climate change is being felt, and things are only going to get worse.All five of this countryrsquos winter resorts are below ,m leaving them in particular danger to any rises in temperature.Already, Scotlandrsquos winters are becoming less predictable, with snowfall happening later and later each year, and the volume of snow more irregular than in the past.Similarly, Scotlandrsquos golf courses, specically the links courses, are coming under threat from coastal erosion and with sea levels predicted to rise, their existence is under threat.Globally, there is also an awareness of the need for urgent action by the world of sport.Formula One is a particularly serious offender. The international courier service DHL, which is a major F sponsor, revealed that for the  season to happen, it clocked up to , kilometres to deliver cars, teams, broadcast and hospitality equipment, as well as fuel and tyres to races. This is the equivalent of three trips around the world.It has become clear in recent years that, for the sake of the planet, this cannot go on.In response, Formula One has unveiled a climate-action strategy which includes a new engine that aims to use  per cent sustainable fuel and carbon neutral by , incentives for greener travel for fans, more sustainable materials, ultra-efficient logistics, and powering offices, facilities and factories with  per cent renewable energy.While it remains unclear quite how long a sport which is based solely on driving cars, an activity we are all being told to do less of, can be sustained, these new measures are at least a start.Last week at COP, several of the giants of the sporting world made clear their commitment to do their bit for the planet.Both FIFA and the IOC are signatories of the United Nationsrsquo Sports for Climate Action Framework which pledges to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by , as well as vowing to reduce emissions by  per cent by .Sport is in a strange position. The constant travelling theand breadth of the globe to compete is not conducive to being green, but there is, at least, an acceptance now that there is a responsibility to do what it takes to help the planet, or at least stem the speed of damage.So where does sport go from here The impact on many,not most outdoor sports, is likely to become more obvious in the coming years.A report released last year suggested that the disruption already felt is only going to become more severe.In Britain, football grounds, particularly lower league ones, often find themselves flooded, while globally, there are other challenges.In the past two years, bush fires have affected the Australian Open tennis, typhoons have disrupted the Rugby World Cup and the rise in global temperatures has left many countries in no position to host a Winter Olympics.Itrsquos about time that sport did its bit to tackle the climate crisis, and serious action must begin immediately.AND ANOTHER THINGThe revelation that yet another elite-level coach is to be investigated over sexual misconduct claims is worrying but also, in a strange way, heartening.It seems there has been a glut of stories in recent months about the inappropriate and harmful way coaches have treated their athletes, with another to add to the list last week when it was reported that one of the worldrsquos top sprint coaches, Rana Reider, is under investigation by the US Centre for SafeSport after complaints of sexual misconduct were made against him.The American works with the likes of Tokyo  Olympic m gold medallist Andre de Grasse and the world triple jump champion Christian Taylor, and also trains numerous British athletes including Adam Gemili and Daryll Neita at his Florida base.Coaches behaving inappropriately, or even illegally, is nothing new. However, until recently, few,any athletes had the courage or the confidence to raise their concerns or complaints as the assumption was they would not be believed.Things are changing and while it is still hard for most athletes to speak out about any harmful behaviour by a coach, there is, without doubt, a much more open-minded and a less dismissive attitude these days to accusations."},{"url":null,"title":"green-scotland-cop26-climate-investigation-full","story":"Our subscribers will get exclusive accessas we look to answer the pressing questions in Scotlands climate crisis fight.As the COP conference looms on the horizon, we will leave no stone unturned in a bid to stimulate discussion and debate on this crucial topic.Find out more about our exclusive pound for two months offer here.From the hundreds of sites and big-name companies that broke environmental rules, to the most polluted streets in Scotland, readers can expectground-breaking exclusives, in-depth analysis, and interactive content ndash as well as regular live videos, giving you the chance to speak directly with the award-winning reporters behind the stories.Here, you can find every article published in the week-long investigation so far - with this piece being updated daily with new exclusive stories.To make sure you do not miss out on the high-quality insight, join us today by taking out a subscription for just pound for two monthshere.More than  industrial sites across Scotland have been officially damned as ldquounsatisfactory on pollution, according to data from the ScottishEnvironmentProtection Agencyseen by The Ferret.Sepa assessed the environmental performance of two big oilcompanies, ExxonMobil and Ineos, as ldquovery poor in .

Itowed pound.m, including over pound, to his management firm.He was brought in after the last civilian Clyde shipyard under tyoon Jim McColl went into administration following a dispute with Caledonian Maritime Assets Ltd - the taxpayer-funded company which buys and leases publicly owned CalMacs ships on behalf of the Scottish government - and as the price of the construction of two leline ferries under a poundm fixed price contract more than doubled.Ferguson Marines financial collapse in August,  led to a state takeover, while the delivery of two leline island ferries MV Glen Sannox and Hull  which were due online in the first half of  will be over four years late.Mr McColl went on to blame repeated design changes by CMAL for the issues in building the vessels for operator CalMac, which is also publicly-owned.Earlier this year it emerged that Ferguson Marine had racked up poundm of losses in just four months of nationalisation.And last month there was a warning the ferries could be further delayed as Mr Hair flagged up concerns over data systems used to run the nationalised business.He also highlighted a potential vulnerability regarding running gear installed on Glen Sannox, which has been sitting idle in the water at the Port Glasgow shipyard for years.Details of Mr Hairs invoiced fees, including expenses, show that in the nearly two years between August,  and July,  he earned pound,,. It was revealed hereceives costs for living in Scotland.His over pound,-a-year payments towers over the pound,-a-year salary of the First Minister.Just six had been approached for the job, after global consultant group Price Waterhouse Cooperadvised ministers of suitable people with experience of turnaround in comparable industries.The Scottish Government in explaining the recruitment process has admitted that after consideration of CVs, senior officials eventually interviewed three people \"by phone\" and consequently concluded that Tim Hair had the \"requisite skills and experience to perform the role\".It has been confirmed that availability of candidates was \"important\" as some were in existing roles and would not be able to start promptly.But Highlands and Islands MSPEdward Mountain, the former convenor of the rural economy and connectivity committee which branded the ferry management process a \"catastrophic failure\" after an inquiry has strongly criticised the recruitment process.He said: ldquoI find it absolutely bizarre, considering the importance of this job, that the interviews for the shortlisted candidates were not undertaken on a face-to-face basis.\"And it appears that the Scottish Government appointed who was available at the time. Most of the time though, the best turnaround directors are already fully employed.ldquoI am not convinced that the Scottish Government carried out an adequate interview process or obtained sufficient references in their search for a turnaround director.\"The deal to bring in Mr Hair, the former chief of engineering firm Chamberlain, was overseen by a two-man  - acting director of for economic development Richard Rollison and Transport Scotland chief executive Roy Brannen.Both had been briefed by independent specialist advisers PwC which had also advised the Scottish Government over options for action over the perilous state of shipbuilders Ferguson Marine before it fell into administration in August,  and was subject of a state takeover.The appointment was signed off by then finance secretary Derek Mackay.But ministers have said they were unable to list his previous appointments and his accomplishments since  as the exact details were covered by non-disclosure agreements. They will only say that he \"led multiple turnarounds in several industrial sectors\".According to Mr Hairs CV he was interim chief executive of polymer products manufacturers Applied Composites Group for  months between October  and August  It went bust ten months later owing pound.m after he left. Liquidators said there had been no claims made from secured creditors.In its final set of financial accounts for the year to September, , prepared in June , auditors KPMG raised concerns about the business continuing as a going concern saying \"there is an undisclosed material uncertainty that may cast signicant doubt over the use of that basis for a period of at least  months\". It had suffered a pound, loss after tax.During that time, in June, he oversaw a subsidiary Icon Aerospace that manufactures rubber products for the aerospace, defence and industrial sectors and counts the likes of Airbus, Boeing and Rolls-Royce among its clients, to move into a new research and development base in Nottinghamshire. It was expected to secure  jobs and create a further .He said at the time: \"Icon Aerospace Technology supplies critical parts to the aerospace and defence industry and we look forward to continued growth.\"A year later, Applied Composites Group appointed a voluntary liquidator. Mr Hairs company Melville Management Limited was one of those which was owed money to the tune of pound,..Unsecured creditor claims totalled pound, - but all failed to receive any reimbursement, according to liquidators EY, as \"no funds have been realised\".In January, , Icon, which featured on Michael Portillos Great British Railway Journeys, was bought by Integrated Polymer Solutions , a business based in Long Island, Calornia and is still operating.Mr Mountain, a Scottish Conservative MSP, businessman and former soldier added: ldquoI also question whether the Scottish Government prioritised shipbuilding expertise as part of the role. Tim Hairrsquos professional experience working as a marine engineer on a cruise ship some thirty years ago is signicantly dferent from constructing modern passenger ferries. ldquoIt is also clear that the financial package offered to Tim Hair by the Scottish Government saw him receive signicantly more thanhe had been appointed by a recruitment firm, who would have carried out more due diligence.ldquoHaving been in business for forty years, I know that in the first six months of a turnaround directorrsquos appointment they are tackling the problem. After that period, they can become part of that problem.ldquoOverall, I have little confidence that these ferries will be delivered on time and within the latest cost estimates.Ministers have said: \"Tim has signicant experience in the engineering and automotive sectors, has led a number of business turnarounds and transformations and is a member of the Institute of Marine Engineering Science  Technology and the Institute of Turnaround.\"The primary requirement when recruiting the Turnaround Director was experience of turning around engineering businesses with an emphasis on a collaborative approach to re-set the relationship with customers and Tim Hair was selected on this basis. Additionally, Tim Hair had shipping experience in his early career.His contract was for an initial period of two to three months with an option to roll forward on a monthly basis but with a four week notice period.His pay rate was cut by % in February  and is now as pound.In a question-and-answer briefing for Mr Mountain, ministers were asked what Mr Hairs marine engineering experience was and why it was specically relevant to shipbuilding and Ferguson Marine.The Scottish Government stated that he had been a marine engineer between  and  for PO Princess Cruises and that he was a member of the Institute of Marine Engineering Science  Technology.\"Tim has signicant experience in the engineering and automotive sectors, has led a number of business turnarounds and transformations and is a member of the Institute of Turnaround. The primary requirement when recruiting the Turnaround Director was experience of turning around engineering businesses with an emphasis on a collaborative approach to re-set the relationship with customers and Tim Hair was selected on this basis,\" it said.Ministers were also asked in endorsing Mr Hairs appointment, whether PwC confirmed they had direct experience of working with Mr Hair. The Scottish Government responded: \"PwC completed a background check on Tim Hair which raised no concerns and he has been known to PwC Partners in England for over  years.\" PwC were not approached for a reference. Instead references were obtained from non-executive directors covering Mr Hairs career since .A Ferguson Marine spokesman said: \"The recruitment was a Scottish Government exercise and the shipyard canrsquot comment.\"A Scottish Government spokesman said: ldquoThe Scottish Government appointed the Turnaround Director in August  following a competitive and robust recruitment exercise as part of the process to take the Ferguson Marine shipyard into public control.ldquoTim Hair has a track record of stabilising companies in dficult situations. He has a wealth of experience across a range of sectors including oil and gas, manufacturing, aerospace and the automotive sector.ldquoA benchmarking exercise was conducted as part of the recruitment process to identy market rates. The Turnaround Directorrsquos agreed fee was well within the benchmark and consistent with market rates which reflect the highly specialised nature of a role that requires senior level experience and solid track record of transforming struggling businesses.ldquoSince Mr Hairrsquos appointment clear business improvements have been made at the yard, despite the pandemic, and more than  jobs have been created since February .

It is understood that at least one class within every year group except P is affected by the spread.The two authorities confirmed, this Thursday evening, that any decision to shut the school would be a collective one — but it has not yet reached that point. The only caveat to this is in the eventuality that staff numbers are so depleted, the council has no option but to close Papdale, or reduce teaching hours.As of early this afternoon, only two members of staff have been confirmed to have the virus.In a statement this evening, OIC#s executive director of education, leisure and housing, James Wylie, said: “The school remains open, and the situation is being managed and monitored with the advice and guidance of NHS Orkney Public Health.“Our aim is to keep the school open as long as possible to provide learning for those pupils who are well. We are working on a daily basis with Public Health evaluating the numbers and should it reach a point whereby it is felt necessary for a partial or full closure, then that decision will be made collectively.“However,staffing falls to a point whereby it is no longer possible to safely manage the pupil numbers in school — as happened in Stronsay Junior High School recently – then we, as the council, can take the decision to close or offer a rolling programme of reduced hours across the school.“I, again, thank everyone for continuing to answer our plea for children who are well and not displaying any COVID symptoms to still attend at school as this is vital for their education and social wellbeing.”The authorities have confirmed that a further ten PCR tests have also been requested in connection with Papdale Primary at this time, and contact tracing is ongoing. Parents with children attending the school have been urged to undertake twice-weekly lateral flow testing on both themselves and their little ones.Of the  pupils at the school,  pupils were absent on Thursday from the school — a drop from  on Wednesday. According to OIC, the reason many of these pupils remained at home was due to the COVID- situation —  whether for the purpose self-isolating, or because they are symptomatic and awaiting a PCR test. A small number of parents have also chosen not to send their child children to school.Warn and inform letters have now been sent to the parents and carers of children in all affected classes within P, P, P, P, P and P, in line with Scottish Government and Public Health guidance.In addition, Papdale#s head teacher, Wendy Bowen, has written to all parents to reassure that all necessary mitigating steps are being taken.Across Orkney, a total of  new positive cases have been reported in today#s daily figures.According to NHS Orkney, these cases are a mixture of household contacts, travel and working environment contacts amongst others. The health authority has has said that this continued rise in cases is not unexpected.NHS Orkney consultant of public health, Sara Lewis said: “We are continuing to see cases riseand this is another day of high case numbers for Orkney, but we want to reassure the community that we are managing these cases.#Although, we do ask that you continue to follow the guidance in place, ensuring good ventilationindoors, washing hands, wearing face coverings and keeping a safe distance from those out with your household,possible. Vaccinations are underway for both COVID and Flu and these are progressing, but it is a complex and challenging undertaking.#Appointment letters are being sent out for the COVID booster vaccinations and we appreciate your patience during this time.”If you receive a positive lateral flow test result, or you have developed symptoms of COVID-, you must immediately self-isolate with your household and book a PCR test.

We will continue to work with our colleagues at Public Health evaluating the numbers and should it reach a point whereby it is felt necessary for a partial or full closure, then that decision will be made collectively.“I, again, thank everyone for continuing to answer our plea for children who are well and not displaying any COVID symptoms to still attend at school as this is vital for their education and social well-being.”Targeted “warn and inform letters” have been sent to parents of children in the affected classes. Papdale head teacher, Wendy Bowen, has also written to all parents to reassure that all necessary mitigating steps are being taken.Meanwhile NHS Orkney are continuing to report double figure numbers of cases across the county on a daily basis.According to the health authority, these cases are a mixture of household contacts, travel and working environment contacts amongst others.

Schools do remain an area of typically low transmission and a safe place for children.“We ask that you continue to follow the guidance in place, ensuring good ventilationindoors, washing hands, wearing face coverings and keeping a safe distance from those out with your household,possible.”If you develop COVID symptoms, however mild, oryou have a positive lateral flow test, you must immediately self-isolate with your household and book a PCR test.

The reopening could help mend US ties with the Palestinians which were ruptured under Donald Trump. vw,vw,px, px\"Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, right, during a news conference with Foreign Minister Yair Lapid Asked about the consulate at a press conference late on Saturday, Mr Bennett repeated Israelrsquos position on Jerusalem.ldquoTherersquos no room for another American consulate in Jerusalem, he said. ldquoJerusalem is the capital of one state and thatrsquos the state of Israel.Israeli Foreign Minister Yair Lapid suggested the consulate could instead be opened in the Palestinian administrative centre in Ramallah, West Bank. However, the Palestinians reject that idea because it would undermine their claims to Jerusalem.Israel views Jerusalem as its eternal, unided capital. The Palestinians seek the eastern part of the city, which Israel occupied in  and later annexed, as capital of their hoped-for state. vw,vw,px, px\"Israelis hold signs and flags during a protest against the possible reopening of the American consulate in Jerusalem The consulate is emerging as another test between Mr Bennettrsquos government and Joe Bidenrsquos administration, which has moved to restore traditional US foreign policy towards Israel and the Palestinians after the Trump White House largely sided with Israel on issues related to the conflict.Mr Trump had downgraded the consulatersquos operations and placed them under his ambassador to Israel when he moved the US Embassy from Tel Aviv to the holy city in . The embassy move infuriated the Palestinians and led them to sever most ties with the Trump administration.Mr Blinken has not provided a firm date for the reopening and US officials have implied that Israeli resistance to the move could act as a hindrance.Palestinian official Wassel abu Yussef said Mr Bennettrsquos rejection entrenches Israelrsquos ldquopolicy of occupation and that it presents a challenge to the Biden administration to follow through on its promise.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

He should have fessed up to what he has done and then he should have used that money very productively to assist those who were, as it were, on the receiving end ndash victims of that fascist violence.ldquoThen, alsoyou wish to, he could have supported colleges in Oxford in the university.The AMCT was named after Max Mosleyrsquos son, an alumnus of St Peterrsquos College who died of a heroin overdose in . vw,vw,px, px\"Sir Oswald Mosley, leader of the British Union of Fascists Some pound million received by Oxford University will go towards the creation of the Alexander Mosley Professor of Biophysics Fund while a pound million donation will go to St Peterrsquos College to build a new block of student accommodation, thereported.Initially, the block was to be called Alexander Mosley House but the college has confirmed a name will now be chosen through an internal consultation involving students.The suggestion that a building be named after a Mosley drew criticism from Lord Mann, the Governmentrsquos antisemitism tsar, who said it was ldquoabsurd to give credibility to a family who were active fascists.The University of Oxford said the donation, like all donations, passed a ldquorobust, independent process taking legal, ethical and reputational issues into consideration.St Peterrsquos College said the new accommodation would make a ldquotransformative dference to studentsrsquo lives ldquofor generations to come.LMH said the funding had allowed student from ldquovery erse and low-income backgrounds to attend and that ldquothe gt was therefore fully in line with, and helped to deliver on, LMHrsquos commitment to ersity, inclusion, and anti-racism.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Most of the workers are women, since they can get better access to mothers and children.The four-day campaign will start on Monday and take place countrywide, Dr Ebad said. vw,vw,px, px\"A child is given a polio vaccination in Kabul, Afghanistan The estimated target population is Afghanistanrsquos  million children under five, including the more than . million who could not be reached since .Nek Wali Shah Momin, a health ministry official in the polio eradication department, said: ldquoVaccination ofless than five years of age in the country during the national immunisation days is a gigantic task. It is not possible for the ministry of public health alone to complete this task successfully, so we need the support of all linked departments.The Talibanrsquos reported endorsement of the campaign appeared to be aimed at showing the international community they are willing to co-operate with international agencies.The long-time militant insurgent force has been trying to win the worldrsquos recognition of its new government and reopen the door for international aid to rescue the crumbling economy.The World Health Organisation and the UN childrenrsquos agency Unicef said in a joint statement last month that they welcomed the decision by the Taliban leadership supporting the resumption of house-to-house polio vaccinations across the country.Large sections of the country have been out of reach for vaccinations in recent years.In parts of the south, particularly, the ban by the Taliban was in effect. In other areas, door-to-door campaigns were impossible because of fighting between the government and insurgents, or because of fears of kidnappings or roadside bombs.In some places, hardline clerics spoke out against vaccinations, calling them un-Islamic or claiming they were part of a Western plot.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

I sense every step of that journey.In , Borrodale school closed for that last time. And yet,we listen, we can still hear from Borrodale, forever young and in timeless cèilidh.Put in this kind of context we can sense how community relationships are deeply connected to change. The continuity of change, both backwards and forwards, gives us insight, and proximity with dferent and creative ways of being in place.Times change and culture continues. It is important to be hopeful in this and to not perceive the shadows of the past as a fading le force but as an index pointing to future relationships.The second social experience is of course relates to the typical excitement of guising at Oidhche Shamhna. Originally, Oidhche Shamhna was integral toour sense of place and the cultural relationships of le cycles, including time itself.Oidhche Shamhna is ‘the night of summer’s end,’ and in our older understanding of the festival, it reveals that new le begins in darkness and is born into light similarly, just as days used to begin and end at dusk, the move to the darker half of the year is also the continuation of a cycle and is equally about new beginnings.In the deeper memory of Gaelic cosmology, this is the beginning of the new year, and of course, November is still called ‘an t-Samhain’ in Gàidhlig.My earliest memories of guising would be like those of many, our dad taking my sister and I for a few easy visits to long-standing neighbours and family friends. Even though we would only go to a few houses in those early days, the intensity and excitement of the initiation on a cold dark night was largely experienced through the warmth and kindness revealed in the relationships that emerged in the evening.Guising, then, is a form of cèilidh, where the encouraging and nurturing of the gt of exchange is more intangible than we always appreciate. It is that dimension of sustaining or developing relationships that seems most important to me.One of the first homes we would have visited on my first Oidhche Shamhna will have been that of Angus and Effie Ross in Fàsach. In my early years it was a home that we probably had more time in than any house outside of my family.It was a home I visited everyday day walking home from Borrodale school. My errand was to collect our newspapers from the post office, but it wasn’t a job, it was a relationship.Our family had a strong connection with these Rosses. In , Angus Ross’ great-uncle Alexander Ross had been nominated to deliver the prepared statement for the Fàsach croftersto the Napier Commission.In it he testied specically to the clearance of my great-great-grandfather from Ramasaig , who was removed along with all the families from Ramasaig around -, to make way for sheep, congesting further the land in Fàsach. So, it is from at least that time that our family had been friends.Alexander Ross’s brother, Kenneth Ross, also Fàsach, had among his eight children a first son called Neil and a second called Norman, both being young boys during the land wars....I did know Margaret but I never did met James Ross as he had a fatal accident in the early s in Glasgow, outside the BBC.Angus Ross and Seanair worked together on the County lorry . We saw Angus and Effie a lot and my mum credits him with telling her and her siblings about their Cameron origin story in Glendale.A mysterious tale of a man with long grey hair and a beard living in a cave at Scornandaoine on the east side of Loch Poolteil. He had arrived from Lochaber, in the mid to later s, likely a refugee from any number of social problems in the Gàidhealtachd of that time.Even now it still sounds like a good Halloween story. Certainly, my mum has never been a fan of beards in the family, but we were always welcomed by the Rosses in the ceilidh ethic of everyday relationships., Tobraichean a’ Gluasad .Here, ‘Tuam’ talks about his knowledge of local wells the necessity to move between dferent wells for sustenance, and so there will be times when a well in one place becomes dry while water would be plentul in another well.A resource such as Tobar an Dualchais helps us think about our many and ied relationships with culture, place, and time.Part of the intangible gt to be found within the archives, and also with the people and places around us, is how the wells of culture will be found popping up with all their potential, anywhere and everywhere, carried through the voices and relationships we nurture and come to know.Importantly, this can activate new dialogues, experiences, and gestures of cèilidh, and to embrace these for all in our communities, our futures, wherever the wells emerge."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/20211103_133201-scaled.jpg","title":"climate action group to hold skye bridge march and vigil in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine, which formed shortly before the pandemic, is inviting people to show their solidarity with activists across the world in highlighting the need for urgent change to tackle the existential threat of climate change.Speaking to the Free Press during the first week of the COP UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, Skye Climate Action coordinator Anne MacLennan described the summit as “critically important” and was keen to emphasise that Saturday’s event should take place in a peaceful and respectable manner.#Saturday is the Global Day of Action for Climate Justice, and the themes are that we need to act, and act urgently, and there is also the huge justice issue,# she said.“The idea for the march is for us to leave the Kyleakin-end at  noon and to walk over the bridge by the pavements and walk back again.#It is really important that the event is peaceful, family-friendly, and respectful of everyone # I think it is a demonstration of the kind of society we want to head towards being, so we can live in a sustainable and equitable way.

We have confirmed that it will not sanction any of our member clubs to take part in an all-islandFootball League,” he said.“It is important not to lose sight that NI Football League clubs have been improving in European competition and enhancing our standing. We need to do all that we can to improve the local game at all levels and we will launch our new five-year strategy early next year.”Mr Kirkwood said the priority for the organisation was to establish a training centre for the region and said the £ million promised to local clubs as part of the sub-regional stadia funding package had to be delivered.Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey has previously said she is “on target” to deliver the funding programme for local football before the next Northern Ireland Assembly elections.Read MoreI’m disappointed I’ve had to resign from Irish FA Board, admits NIFL Chief Executive Gerard LawlorThe funding was initially allocated in  but was held up by the collapse of Stormont in January .“We need a national training centre. We need to improve the regional stadia — government can help us with that and it is my hope that funding can be released before the next governmental mandate,” Mr Kirkwood added.“Clubs need the money.

The negotiations in support of renewal are ongoing with Ian and his agent.“We will be in a position to say more when those are concluded. For now, like every Northern Ireland supporter, I am looking forward to the next two home games and looking to get behind the team and the manager.”Meanwhile, Mr Kirkwood said the IFA would oppose FIFA proposals to hold the World Cup every two years.The plans promoted by former Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger suggest holding the tournament in June every two years.Mr Kirkwood said the international fixture calendar is “already crowded” and expressed concern such an idea may mean “less engagement with fans and a possibility of losing the prestige of the competition”.“We are one of the oldest associations in football and we do not want people to lose interest in the best competition in the world,” he added.Related topicsNorthern Ireland Football TeamMore On Northern Ireland Football TeamMichael Smith doesn’t want to be considered for Northern Ireland duty at this current time, admits boss Ian Baraclough PremiumDale Taylorcan be Northern Ireland’s main man one day, says David HealyIan Baraclough has a plan for Northern Ireland’s next generation PremiumCritics won’t distract me from doing all I can for Northern Ireland: Ian BaracloughNI squad announcement: Nottingham Forest striker Dale Taylor called up for debutMost ReadCouncil spat as DUP man mispronounces rival’s Irish surnameThieving postie’s six years of crime exposedSam McBrideOpinionSeeing Covid- in apocalyptic terms, some churches are alive with wild fearsShamed yachting tutor admits extreme porn chargesSafety concerns raised after Ballymena woman Aurelia Kelly dies after a collision in BallymoneyTop VideosPlayVan Morrison and Ian Paisley in anti-Robin Swann chants at Europa Hotel eventPlayVideo: Belfast film premiere with red carpet royalty PlayCar with Irish registration plates set alight outside Rangers club on Shankill RoadLatest Northern IrelandLarge fish one of  items donated to NI Ambulance Service staffNew portrait of John Hume to be unveiled at Dublin art fairStormont Health Minister sues Sir Van Morrison over ‘very dangerous’ criticismBusted drugs boss ‘lied about UVF links to scare dealers’Curry house on pest control chargesLatestAndy Farrell savours ‘competition all over the park’ after Ireland thrash JapanNationwide polio vaccination campaign starts in AfghanistanSleaze row ‘storm in a teacup’, minister claims as Labour steps up attackIlkay Gundogan wants to see consistency from Manchester City after derby victoryMarcus Smith excited to be part of a ‘new journey’ for evolving England squad,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Most of the workers are women, since they can get better access to mothers and children.The four-day campaign will start on Monday and take place countrywide, Dr Ebad said.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news world-news da .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_fcac-bde-ca-ae-effe_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news world-news da .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_fcac-bde-ca-ae-effe_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news world-news da .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_fcac-bde-ca-ae-effe_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news world-news da .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_fcac-bde-ca-ae-effe_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"FILE – Shabana Maani, gives a polio vaccination to a child in the old part of Kabul, Afghanistan, March , .

The Taliban-run Afghan public health ministry announced Sunday, Nov. , , the start of a four-day nationwide polio vaccination campaign aimed at inoculating children under age . The estimated target population is Afghanistan’s  million children under five, including the more than . million who could not be reached since .Nek Wali Shah Momin, a health ministry official in the polio eradication department, said: “Vaccination ofless than five years of age in the country during the national immunisation days is a gigantic task. It is not possible for the ministry of public health alone to complete this task successfully, so we need the support of all linked departments.”The Taliban’s reported endorsement of the campaign appeared to be aimed at showing the international community they are willing to co-operate with international agencies.The long-time militant insurgent force has been trying to win the world’s recognition of its new government and reopen the door for international aid to rescue the crumbling economy.The World Health Organisation and the UN children’s agency Unicef said in a joint statement last month that they welcomed the decision by the Taliban leadership supporting the resumption of house-to-house polio vaccinations across the country.Large sections of the country have been out of reach for vaccinations in recent years.In parts of the south, particularly, the ban by the Taliban was in effect. In other areas, door-to-door campaigns were impossible because of fighting between the government and insurgents, or because of fears of kidnappings or roadside bombs.In some places, hardline clerics spoke out against vaccinations, calling them un-Islamic or claiming they were part of a Western plot.Most ReadCouncil spat as DUP man mispronounces rival’s Irish surnameThieving postie’s six years of crime exposedSam McBrideOpinionSeeing Covid- in apocalyptic terms, some churches are alive with wild fearsShamed yachting tutor admits extreme porn chargesSafety concerns raised after Ballymena woman Aurelia Kelly dies after a collision in BallymoneyTop VideosPlayVan Morrison and Ian Paisley in anti-Robin Swann chants at Europa Hotel eventPlayVideo: Belfast film premiere with red carpet royalty PlayCar with Irish registration plates set alight outside Rangers club on Shankill RoadLatest WorldIsrael: No room for US mission for Palestinians in JerusalemEarly-season snow blankets Beijing and northern ChinaIran begins annual war games ahead of nuclear talks with WestUS court blocks Joe Biden’s vaccine mandate planIraq PM unharmed after being targeted by drone attackLatestSleaze row ‘storm in a teacup’, minister claims as Labour steps up attackIlkay Gundogan wants to see consistency from Manchester City after derby victoryMarcus Smith excited to be part of a ‘new journey’ for evolving England squadLarge fish one of  items donated to NI Ambulance Service staffGovernment may need to step in over immoral university donations – Oxford don,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm. When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny. The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland. Isn’t it time we appointed a Digital Innovation Commissioner to do the same and really own this agenda for the NW region of Ireland and its citizens, present and future ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeFamilies moved from homes in Derry security alert overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Cllr Emma McGinley: I am appealing to the whole community to be vigilant and watch out for each other, especially elderly neighbours who are particularly vulnerableLocal NewsCreggan residents urged to stay safe after reports of attempted break-ins overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsKathleen Thompson to be remembered on the th anniversary of her killing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  SportWATCH: County Derry primary school opens new pitch as parish prepares for county final overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  SportWATCH: Celebrations as Steelstown clinch historic first championship title overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Steelstown players celebrate their Intermediate title success over Greenlough.

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics. It’s about the enjoyment of it all and putting smiles on peoples faces.“The Gael Foacutersa range offers high-quality, comfortable and eye-catching men’s and ladies leisurewear. It aims to reinforce the customer’s sense of identity. To be more than just about the game. It’s about being part of something bigger.” googletag.cmd.push For the full range, check out their website: www.gaelforsa.ieADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeFamilies moved from homes in Derry security alert overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Cllr Emma McGinley: I am appealing to the whole community to be vigilant and watch out for each other, especially elderly neighbours who are particularly vulnerableLocal NewsCreggan residents urged to stay safe after reports of attempted break-ins overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsKathleen Thompson to be remembered on the th anniversary of her killing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  SportWATCH: County Derry primary school opens new pitch as parish prepares for county final overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  SportWATCH: Celebrations as Steelstown clinch historic first championship title overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Steelstown players celebrate their Intermediate title success over Greenlough.

The scheme is a recycling initiative which he had championed during his time as Environment Minister and has worked to progress in recent years. In response to an Assembly Question tabled by Mr Durkan, the Minister of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs , Edwin Poots reaffirmed his commitment to introduce the scheme, following the department’s joint consultation with DAERA and the Welsh Government. googletag.cmd.push The Foyle MLA said: “I’m pleased that work is continuing to progress a depositscheme for Northern Ireland. “This is a scheme which began work on during my time as Environment Minister, having seen their benefits in other countries. “Unfortunately, at that time my attempts were met with some resistance, both politically and commercially. “In February , the Executive supported my calls for the introduction of a depositscheme and committed to the North’s participation in a proposed UK-wide rollout. I welcome that the consultation process has been completed and welcome Minister Poots commitment to delivering this scheme and move towards a circular economy. “While awareness in recent years has improved where recycling is concerned, we are still not at the level we need to be. “A cash incentive under a Deposit Return Scheme, in my opinion, is the best way forward and will encourage an uptake in recycling. “Our throw-away culture is completely unsustainable and our planet is bearing the brunt of it. “In recent years, we have witnessed a growing realisation that action must be taken by governments, businesses and iniduals to address the damage being done to our environment. “I would like to see this scheme expanded to include cans and plastic bottles, building on the success of the carrier bag levy, to tackle the scourge of single use plastic on our communities. “I hope the Minister will revisit an all-island approach for this initiative but for now it is crucial that we push forward on implementing this environmentally transformative scheme without further delay. “ ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeFamilies moved from homes in Derry security alert overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Cllr Emma McGinley: I am appealing to the whole community to be vigilant and watch out for each other, especially elderly neighbours who are particularly vulnerableLocal NewsCreggan residents urged to stay safe after reports of attempted break-ins overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsKathleen Thompson to be remembered on the th anniversary of her killing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  SportWATCH: County Derry primary school opens new pitch as parish prepares for county final overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  SportWATCH: Celebrations as Steelstown clinch historic first championship title overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Steelstown players celebrate their Intermediate title success over Greenlough.

The Minister has released funds to provide additional support for housing associationsReporter: Matthew Leslie Nov Email: matthew.leslie@iconicnews.ie  addthis, Foyle Sinn Feacutein MLA Ciara Ferguson has urged all parties to get behind the Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey’s plans to transform housing in the North. Ms Hargey has approved an extra poundmillion towards additional support for housing associations. This comes on top of the increased new build budget of poundmillion. The Minister that the new build programme, along with the additional funds, was there to address the issue of housing stress both in the present-day and beyond. googletag.cmd.push Ms Ferguson backed the Minister saying that everyone had the right to a decent home and urged other parties to give their support to ensure that aim can fulfilled. She said: “Sinn Feacutein Minister Deirdre Hargey is taking forward the biggest transformation in public housing in  years, getting the Housing Executive back to building social and affordable homes. “Everyone should have the right to a decent home, and I commend the minister for her leadership in taking on the issues of affordability, building more homes and equal access to housing which need to be addressed. “Finance Minister Conor Murphy also recently announced the largest house building budget in over a decade and work has started on over , new homes in the last year, surpassing the target by  percent. “She is also taking forward legislative change through her Private Tenancies Bill, to protect renters, while proposals for rent controls and rent freezes are also under consideration. “Minister Hargey has also increased support for Co-Ownership and is consulting on alternative avenues to home ownership which are genuinely accessible and affordable to workers and families. “The Minister has demonstrated a remarkable determination to grasp this issue, but such is the scale of the challenge, that this cannot be left to one minister alone – we need people and organisations working together. “Equality in housing cannot wait. The need for more social and affordable homes, particularly in places like the north west, cannot be ignored and I would hope that all parties could get behind this ambitious plan to deliver real and tangible change for current and future generations.” ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeFamilies moved from homes in Derry security alert overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Cllr Emma McGinley: I am appealing to the whole community to be vigilant and watch out for each other, especially elderly neighbours who are particularly vulnerableLocal NewsCreggan residents urged to stay safe after reports of attempted break-ins overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsKathleen Thompson to be remembered on the th anniversary of her killing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  SportWATCH: County Derry primary school opens new pitch as parish prepares for county final overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  SportWATCH: Celebrations as Steelstown clinch historic first championship title overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Steelstown players celebrate their Intermediate title success over Greenlough.

Governments from across the world are currently attending the conference on climate change in Glasgow with the aim of seeing what can be done to halt global warming. googletag.cmd.push Activists from all over are making sure their political leaders are being held to account and Derry is no dferent with the North West Climate Coalition making their voices heard prior to Saturdays Global Day of Action march in the city. People Before Profit Counicllor, Maeve ONeill – who is also a member of the North West Climate Coalition – said: “Previous Climate Conferences of world leaders has gotten us no where near to taking proper action on the climate crisis. “It is nothing more than a greenwashing opportunity for those in power. “Real change will come from the organising and mass mobilisation of millions of people across this world. “This is people power and its the most effective tool we have in making the transformative change we need.” Ms ONeills fellow People Before Profit Councillor, Shaun Harkin, said that while the parties in the Stormont Executive have been saying all the right things about climate change, their talk has yet to be matched by positive action. He added: “Over the past week, every local mainstream party has paraded its commitment to the environment. “They have all sent representatives to Glasgow to give interviews in an effort to associate themselves with calls for drastic action to save the world. They were just as unanimous back in  in voting at the Assembly for a public inquiry into how more than a million tonnes of toxic waste was dumped on Derry’s doorstep. “But there’s been no public inquiry. The toxic waste still festers there, with nobody held responsible. “Now that the environment is top of the news agenda, they are all out presenting their counterfeit credentials as fighters against the creation of waste and pollution of the land. “The only thing the establishment parties are serious about recycling is empty rhetoric.” The Global Day of Action takes place on Saturday, November  at pm in Waterloo Place, Derry.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeFamilies moved from homes in Derry security alert overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Cllr Emma McGinley: I am appealing to the whole community to be vigilant and watch out for each other, especially elderly neighbours who are particularly vulnerableLocal NewsCreggan residents urged to stay safe after reports of attempted break-ins overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsKathleen Thompson to be remembered on the th anniversary of her killing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  SportWATCH: County Derry primary school opens new pitch as parish prepares for county final overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  SportWATCH: Celebrations as Steelstown clinch historic first championship title overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Steelstown players celebrate their Intermediate title success over Greenlough.

Eighty-eight-year-old Jims career as a postmaster has gone from strength to strength. Jim first took on Carlisle Road Post Office in  after a friend of his announced his retirement and askedhe was interested in taking over. googletag.cmd.push After re-organising the post office and discovering how much he enjoyed the work, he then took on Park Avenue Post Office after its Postmaster also retired. After a third local postmaster retired – this time on Buncrana Road – Jim decided to once again take on a branch because he liked it so much. His service has spanned some of the most turbulent periods Northern Ireland has faced. Serving these communities during the height of the Troubles, Jim said he became the most robbed postmaster in the UK but he continued running his branches through a combination of “stubbornness and great staff”. Besides supporting the community through the Troubles, Jim’s branches were also a leline through the Covid- pandemic. Although the initial impact of the pandemic saw footfall sharply fall, Jim said that with the right precautions in place his customers gradually ed. Jim has lived in Derry his entire le and at the age of  has decided that it is now time “to hang up the date stamp”. Reflecting on the evolution of Post Office, Jim remarked how it has “changed drastically over the years” with the “introduction of computers, online business, emails”. In particular, he noted that post offices increasingly now act on behalf on many banks in supporting customers to withdraw and deposit their cash. Above all, Jim reflected on the people he has both worked alongside and served. He gave credit to those he worked with over his four decades of services, noting “I was lucky to have first class people about me. Without them I would not have remained”. He also admitted that, at one point, he may have known as many as half the people in Derry because he ran three dferent branches and enjoyed talking to people from the local communities so much. His branches in particular served and supported many elderly people and pensioners. The excellent service his work partners provided led to an increase in the number of elderly customers because “we all went beyond the call of duty to give a good service” – and this was particularly true during the pandemic. Local Post Office Area Manager, Sean Docherty, has his own personal connection to both Jim and the post office. Mr Docherty said: “The Branch has a history for me also as I started my career at the age of  in the branch over  years ago and its very near my family home, so it has a real special meaning to me. “Jim and his daughter Geraldine are widely known and very well respected within the city for their tireless dedication, commitment and service to their local community all throughout the Troubles and beyond. I wish Jim all the very best and well deserved retirement and long health for the future.” A framed long service leavers’ commemoration letter from Post Office Chief Executive Nick Read was presented by Post Office Network Provision Lead Janese Sung along to Jim with gt vouchers and a pen to thank him for his loyal service. A bouquet of flowers was also presented to his daughter Geraldine. Jim’s daughter, Geraldine, took over in the day-to-day running of Buncrana Road Post Office some  years ago. Buncrana Road Post Office has shared its space with Centra, one of Northern Ireland’s leading convenience stores, for the last  years and Jim has now passed the baton to Centra to continue running the post office.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeFamilies moved from homes in Derry security alert overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Cllr Emma McGinley: I am appealing to the whole community to be vigilant and watch out for each other, especially elderly neighbours who are particularly vulnerableLocal NewsCreggan residents urged to stay safe after reports of attempted break-ins overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsKathleen Thompson to be remembered on the th anniversary of her killing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  SportWATCH: County Derry primary school opens new pitch as parish prepares for county final overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  SportWATCH: Celebrations as Steelstown clinch historic first championship title overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Steelstown players celebrate their Intermediate title success over Greenlough.

Lyra, a film celebrating her le will be premiered at both the Belfast and Cork Film FestivalsReporter: Matthew Leslie Nov Email: matthew.leslie@iconicnews.ie  addthis, “She loved Derry,” says film-maker Alison Millar on her friend Lyra McKee. “She was so happy there. She had met loads of new friends.” Journalist Lyra McKee had spent the last few months of her young le in Derry before she was shot dead on the night of April ,  while reporting on a riot that had broken out on Fanad Drive in the citys Creggan area. googletag.cmd.push She had moved to Derry from Belfast to live with her partner Sarah Canning, a nurse at Altnagelvin Hospital, and thrived during her time here. Millar added: “Derrys a really creative city so she would be meeting up with other writers, journalists and she enjoyed it. “She really loved it and really took to the city. Belfast was her home but she really settled into Derry. Lyra hadnt been there very long but she loved living in Derry.” Millars film on her friend, simply titled “Lyra”, will be premiered on Sunday evening simultaneously at the Belfast and Cork Film Festivals respectively. This will be the latest in a long line of acclaimed work for Millar who herself has had IFTA, BAFTA and Prix Italia success for her documentaries. Although not yet planned for general release throughout cinemas in Ireland or even broadcast on television, Millar is hopeful that over the next year or so, many others will get to see the film. The film itself opens to window to people who only knew Lyra McKee by her written work or even by the news of her killing two years ago. Rumours aplenty had begun to generate of others planning to make a film about Lyra and Millar knew that being a close friend of McKees, she had to be the one to do it. After all, as Millar says, had anything happened to her, Lyra would be writing about Alison. Millar said: “I knew she loved my films and wrote about them. I knew that she wrote about me in her books. So I came to the conclusion thatanybody  made a film about her, I would be really fed up about it. “Because I knew her family and her partner Sarah and I knew they wanted me to make a film with their help – and they helped me hugely. “I had a team of people who all knew her as well. I knew thatanything had happened to us, Lyra would be writing about us so we just knew we had to do it. It wasnt even like will we or will we not, we had to it because we wanted people to know more about her and her work. “The film was more like a way of trying to get people to know Lyra more. She had already at such a young age just achieved so much and her work was so astonishing that it could not be not talked about. We wanted to give her that voice and thats what we wanted to achieve. “We also wanted to let people know what Lyra was like as a person. She would have given – in fact Ive seen her do this – someone her last five pounds. She had even given people her coatshe saw somebody cold. “She was one of those people who would meet somebody  and talk to them for ages, askingthey were OK,they needed food orthey were cold, where are they staying are they alright. Lyra was literally that person who wouldnt pass people by. “One example of her work was a story she covered about a guy who set himself on fire at Belfasts City Hall. That was a story that she what had happened but wondered why he did that so she set out to try and find out what could have led someone to that horrible place where they felt they had to do that. “She really was that voice for the under-represented and she wanted to make sure that people were treated better and listened to what they had to say. That compassion and real love of people and le was Lyra – and people loved her back. She was very disarming with that great laugh and smile. It was her charm that got her the big interviews. “When she was , she went on a big trip to Canada to attend a conference andAlicia Keys was one of the speakers. The only person or journalist to get an interview with Alicia Keys at that conference was Lyra McKee. “She decided she wanted to speak to Alicia Keys so she made it through the crowds and the barriers and just said to her, my names Lyra McKee and Id love to interview you. And Alicia replied, Of course – no problem.” Miller and McKee had been friends since they first met when Lyra was . What impressed her about McKee was her compassion and ability to relate to people who were cast aside by society and make sure that the voice of the under-represented would be heard loud and clear. She added: “I first met Lyra when she was . Id known her a long time and I was actually due to have dinner with her the next night at my house whenever I got the message that she had been killed. “I had watched both her and her career grow and she was literally flying. She was amazing – she had just signed a two-book deal with Faber, done the TED talks the year before and she was at the top of her game. Everything was there, sitting waiting for her. She had achieved so much. “She was very compassionate. One of those people who cared deeply about people and giving them a voice. She loved to represent the under-represented. “She came from a wee house in north Belfast, brought up by her mum, her sister and her family. When Lyra was a young girl, she had hearing dficulties that made her speech dficult so she started reading books. Her granny used to buy her Harry Potter books, her sister would buy her The Twits by Roald Dahl and she got submerged in books and writing. “She was writing from an early age as it was her space – her happy place. She actually wrote a lot of poetry when she was a young girl. She wanted to be a poet for a while. “Lyra had just won the Sky Young Journalist of the Year award when I met her. She was  but when I met her I thought she was  as she had this wee baby face that meant she never looked her age. “It used to really annoy her that we would go out for a drink – even when she was in her twenties – and she was always asked to produce ID at the door. “I loved her writing – it was really beautul and descriptive and she looked for voices in her community and to break stories for people she felt hadnt been listened to or heard properly. “From a young age,she saw something and she wanted to do it she did. She always said that brick walls were not there to keep you out. But depending on how much you want something, youve got to work out how to get over them. “We want Lyra’s work to live on, we want her writing to live on, we want her voice to live on. She’s a great character, and what we really want is for people to come and spend some time with her through this film.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeFamilies moved from homes in Derry security alert overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Cllr Emma McGinley: I am appealing to the whole community to be vigilant and watch out for each other, especially elderly neighbours who are particularly vulnerableLocal NewsCreggan residents urged to stay safe after reports of attempted break-ins overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsKathleen Thompson to be remembered on the th anniversary of her killing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  SportWATCH: County Derry primary school opens new pitch as parish prepares for county final overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  SportWATCH: Celebrations as Steelstown clinch historic first championship title overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Steelstown players celebrate their Intermediate title success over Greenlough.

Available exclusively in Attitude Black paintwork, the new Sport Black Edition brings a distinctive sporty look to Toyota’s fth-generation RAV, and is available in front-wheel-driveguise only.  googletag.cmd.push   However, for buyers looking for the added security of an all-wheel-drivedrivetrain in their new RAV, there is the option of AWD in Sol, Sport and Platinum iants, while the entry-level Luna model is FWD only.Petrol Electric PowertrainLike every iant in the RAV range, the Sport Black Edition is powered by a .-litre four-cylinder petrol-electric hybrid powertrain, which produces bhp and Nm of torque and enables the five-seat family SUV to sprint from -km h in just over  seconds. Standard across the entire RAV range is a suite of safety features which offer maximum protection for all occupants, while providing the RAV driver with the latest technology in driver assistance systems.     Collectively called Toyota Safety Sense  , features include Pre-Collision Assistance , Speed Assistance , Lane Keepingand Automatic High Beam Assist.Gracious Exterior, Spacious InteriorThe exterior design of the new RAV is more appealing and less anonymous that its predecessor, and this is gained by way of boxy wheel arches, a squared-off nose with a large grille, and angular edges and creases in the bodywork. I feel that Toyota has done a great job of making the new RAV look and feel more ‘premium’ than ever, while also offering more interior space than any of its predecessors.Cabin quality is exceptional, with sturdy and durable materials used throughout, while overall passenger space is generous in every respect. This has been made possible by placing the front and rear axles mm further apart than before, and even tall adults will be able to sit in the rear seats comfortably, with plenty of legroom and headroom on offer.The RAV’s battery is located under the floor, but its boxy dimensions help to hide it well, with a slightly higher boot floor the only clue to what lies beneath.Compared to its predecessor, the RAV’s boot capacity has grown to -litres , with a massive ,-litres available when the rear seats are folded down.The RAV was awarded a full five stars by Euro NCAP in  and that was thanks in part to an upgrade to the second-generation of Toyota Safety Sense for the latest model.Test CarMy test car was a RAV Sport Black Edition which drew lots of admiring glances due to its terric road presence and distinctive design details.An impressive array of standard equipment includes TEX leather black upholstery with heated front seats, powered driver seat, auto-dimming interior mirror, front and rear parking sensors, rear view camera, auto lights and wipers, LED front light guide with daytime running lights, LED projector headlights, electrically operated boot door, ” Toyota Touch multimedia system, dual zone climate control, rear privacy glass, satellite navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, black headliner cloth, paddle sht, light blue ambient lighting, and illuminated entry along with many more comfort, convenience, safety and infotainment features.As is the case across all models in the RAV line-up, fuel consumption as low as .l km is achievable on a WLTP combined driving cycle, while Co emissions of between  and g kmensures low annual road tax in addition to low overall running costs.Toyota’s advanced hybrid technology ensures that the RAV’s petrol engine and electric motor combine seamlessly to deliver extra performance and outstanding fuel efficiency, while remaining ultra-smooth and extremely quiet when driving in electric mode.Toyota claim that up to % of the time you drive a Toyota Hybrid, you are in electric mode, with the added advantage that you never have to plug the car in to charge the battery.Toyota’s self-charging hybrid harvests the energy normally lost from deceleration and braking into a small battery. This unit doesn’t have enough capacity to propel the RAV alone for any considerable distance, but it does offer the convenience of being able to charge itself without any input from the driver.The RAV sits on Toyota’s New Global Architecture, which is also used in the Toyota Prius, C-HR and Corolla models. It brings big benefits in ride and handling, with more sophisticated suspension than the old model, so the RAV is capable of turning into corners with a surprising amount of poise and precision, with plenty of grip while resisting dramatic levels of body lean.The RAV’s CVTtransmission is smooth and slick in its operation, while a well-insulated cabin ensures that on-road refinement is top class. When travelling through towns and cities at low speed, the RAV’s electric motor is barely audible, with the engine shutting off entirely when stationary in traffic. At motorway cruising speeds, the RAV settles into a quiet hum, with only small amounts of tyre and wind noise getting through to the cabin.Verdict, Cost and WarrantyWith its unique and distinctive modern styling, faultless build quality, impressive tally of standard equipment and frugal petrol electric hybrid technology, the new RAV has all the necessary ingredients to comfortably fulfil the needs of a growing family.The new RAV Sport Black Edition represents great value. The new Toyota RAV is backed by a three-year ,km warranty, along with a five-year ,km warranty on hybrid components.Additionally, a hybrid battery warranty of up to an incredible -years is available upon completing an annual hybrid health check through Toyota’s nationwide dealer network.

Hyundai’s newest offering is an appealing small SUV, which slots into position between the new i and new Kona in terms of its exterior dimensions.Hyundai claim that the Bayon is a ‘small on the outside, big on the inside’ urban crossover SUV that is designed to make a lasting impression. Boasting best-in-class safety and connectivity features, the Bayon comes with lots of smart technology as standard.  googletag.cmd.push   Eye-Catching ProportionsWith its sharp lines and eye-catching proportions, the new Bayon really stands out from the crowd. Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.     The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof. Standard features from entry level include a rear spoiler, roof rails, sports-style driver and passenger front seats, driver seat height adjuster, height and reach adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, air-conditioning, auto light control , temporary spare wheel, cargo net, multi- steering wheel controls, central door locking, Bluetooth, DAB radio, cruise control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system, along with a host of safety features for peace-of-mind motoring.Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer. Road imperfections are dealt with swtly, while noises and knocks from the suspension are well isolated from the cabin.For a relatively small car, the Bayon’s motorway refinement and stability are impressive, while the car corners keenly on twisty roads. A precise steering response ensures that the Bayon is a delight to drive around town, while the standard rear parking sensors and rear view camera in my test car made parking a doddle too.The family-friendly cabin space in the new Bayon is impressive, with rear legroom deserving particular praise.Interior storage comprises a of a deep glovebox, front and rear door bins that can accommodate a large bottle, and a flat shelf for a smartphone at the bottom of the well-constructed dashboard.Boot capacity of -litres can be transformed into a ,-litre space when the rear seat backs are folded down, while an intelligent trunk cover can be stowed away safely within the boot when not in use.The new Hyundai Bayon is available in a multitude of stylish exterior colours, along with the option of a two-tone roof and matching door mirror housings in Phantom Black to create a car perfectly matched to inidual taste. The new Bayon truly is ready to reach new heights in the competitive small crossover SUV market segment.Hyundai’s comprehensive -year unlimited mileage warranty comes as standard, as does a -year AA Roadside Assistance and Free Vehicle Health Check package.

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.  googletag.cmd.push   More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.     Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.

On Saturday night, Derry once again flocked to enjoy a night of the Undertones – but this time it wasn’t just their music - but their big screen debut that was getting the masses excited. The legendary band and their family, friends, and fans gathered to indulge in a celebration of their musical careers in the premier of a fitting tribute documentary, featuring the man who made it all possible – DJ John Peel. The documentary, produced by local man Vinnie Cunningham and directed by Tom Collins, traces the band right back to their first performances in school halls, when the lads had barely swapped their nappy rash for pimples.  Dr. Sid Dempsey, third from right, Head Consultant, Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children with members of the Undertones, Billy Doherty, John and Damien ONeill. Also included are Manus and Majella Martin.  The youngsters from Derry, who supported the Clash on their tour of America, never really appreciated how good they actually were, revealed Damien O’Neill - just one of the frank admissions that litter the documentary. The film is liberally interspersed with old video footage of the band as they bopped from the legendary Casbah to Top of the Pops - and features all the greats from ‘Teenage Kicks’ to ‘My Perfect Cousin’ to ‘It’s Going To Happen’. The fundamental ision between Feargal Sharkey and the rest of the Undertones is very apparent, although John O’Neill maintains that there is no real animosity against the singer who eventually caused the band to split. “The way we see it, he was one of our school friends and we eventually drted apart, the same thing that happens to everyone at some stage,” he said. “We really have no bad feelings towards him.” The banter throughout the showing had the audience in fits of laughter as the boys admitted some of their more embarrassing moments, and some revelations came courtesy of others. Caroline O’Neill certainly dropped husband John in it when she let slip that he had dumped her in the hope that fame and fortune would drive the chicks wild. “He’s going to kill me for saying this,” she said. “But he arrived two days later banging on my door and begging me to take him back.” Not so good-natured abuse The laughs were balanced by some more disturbing highlights of the lestyle that saw the boys also abused and often attacked because of their good fortune. “There were nights when we came out of the Casbah and had to leg it up the street,” admits Damien O’Neill. And Feargal Sharkey spoke of the animosity towards them when they were at home: “It was terrible having to face friends in Derry. You couldn’t buy people a drink or wear fashionable clothes because people thought you were being flash.” The Strand Multiplex was packed full of Derry people who have supported the lads over the last  years, and enjoyed reliving the highs and the lows with them all over again. Paul McCloone who now has the job of filling Feargal’s shoes described the documentary as “brilliant, really enjoyable”. John O’Neill, meanwhile, was about as enthusiastic as John gets: “I think it’s great. The most important thing is that the humour really comes across, and the sense that we were just five ordinary guys that managed to make it big.” The screening was held in aid of the N. Ireland Cancer Unit, and donations on the night, along with the money offered instead of an after show buffet, came to over pound. Manus Martin who lost his own son Anthony to cancer last year expressed his deepest thanks to all involved, particularly Vinnie Cunningham and Tony Collins.

Also included are Manus and Majella Martin. uc strong ue uc p ue r n ucp ue u uc p ue r n ucp ueThe youngsters from Derry, who supported the Clash on their tour of America, never really appreciated how good they actually were, revealed Damien O ursquoNeill - just one of the frank admissions that litter the documentary. uc p ue r n ucp ueThe film is liberally interspersed with old video footage of the band as they bopped from the legendary Casbah to Top of the Pops - and features all the greats from  ulsquoTeenage Kicks ursquo to  ulsquoMy Perfect Cousin ursquo to  ulsquoIt ursquos Going To Happen ursquo. uc p ue r n ucp ueThe fundamental ision between Feargal Sharkey and the rest of the Undertones is very apparent, although John O ursquoNeill maintains that there is no real animosity against the singer who eventually caused the band to split. uc p ue r n ucp ue uldquoThe way we see it, he was one of our school friends and we eventually drted apart, the same thing that happens to everyone at some stage, urdquo he said.  uldquoWe really have no bad feelings towards him. urdquo uc p ue r n ucp ueThe banter throughout the showing had the audience in fits of laughter as the boys admitted some of their more embarrassing moments, and some revelations came courtesy of others. uc p ue r n ucp ueCaroline O ursquoNeill certainly dropped husband John in it when she let slip that he had dumped her in the hope that fame and fortune would drive the chicks wild. uc p ue r n ucp ue uldquoHe ursquos going to kill me for saying this, urdquo she said.  uldquoBut he arrived two days later banging on my door and begging me to take him back. urdquo uc p ue r n ucp ue ucstrong ueNot so good-natured abuse uc strong ue uc p ue r n ucp ueThe laughs were balanced by some more disturbing highlights of the lestyle that saw the boys also abused and often attacked because of their good fortune. uc p ue r n ucp ue uldquoThere were nights when we came out of the Casbah and had to leg it up the street, urdquo admits Damien O ursquoNeill. uc p ue r n ucp ueAnd Feargal Sharkey spoke of the animosity towards them when they were at home:  uldquoIt was terrible having to face friends in Derry. You couldn ursquot buy people a drink or wear fashionable clothes because people thought you were being flash. urdquo uc p ue r n ucp ueThe Strand Multiplex was packed full of Derry people who have supported the lads over the last  years, and enjoyed reliving the highs and the lows with them all over again. uc p ue r n ucp uePaul McCloone who now has the job of filling Feargal ursquos shoes described the documentary as  uldquobrilliant, really enjoyable urdquo. uc p ue r n ucp ueJohn O ursquoNeill, meanwhile, was about as enthusiastic as John gets:  uldquoI think it ursquos great.

The comments were made during a Government press conference on Tuesday October th, after the announcement of the countrysrevised reopening plan, where Taoiseach Micheaacutel Martin confirmed all of the restrictions set to ease from Friday,  October and the restrictions that will remain in place. googletag.cmd.push The pandemic isnt over yet. Unfortunately, were going to have to get through at least another winter before we can safely say that its behind us, Varadkar said at the press conference. The situation took a turn for the worse about two or three weeks ago and since then, weve seen rising case numbers, rising hospitalisations and rising ICU numbers.So, were not where we hoped to be or expected to be for  October... were not past the peak of the Delta wave. Later in the press conference, he said the government would be meeting with unions and employer representatives to update the Work Safely Protocol. Well have that done over the next couple of days and essentially what were saying is that a staggered and phasedto the office is possible, he explained. So, people going back to the office for a specic business purpose, like a meeting or a training, for example, or inductions - that is allowed. But certainly people who can work from home and want to continue to work from home, their employer should facilitate that. But bear in mind, there are also people whove been working from home with a laptop on a bed for  months now and they really want to get back to the office. Andthat can be facilitated,they can be in an office on their own or in an office where theyre socially distanced from other people, that should be facilitated too. But the fullto offices as we knew them, that will be next spring, added the Taacutenaiste. The announcement from the Taacutenaiste comes days after Deputy Chief Medical OfficerDr. Ronan Glynn advised the public towork from home where possiblethis autumn and winter.

Triumph Hurdle winner Quilixios faces five rivals including fellow Cheltenham winner Jeff Kidder as jump racing s to Naas for the first time this season. Rachael Blackmore will be aboard the Henry de Bromhead-trained Quilixios as the Cheltenham hero makes his seasonal debut in a race that was won by subsequent Champion Hurdle winner Espoir D’Allen in . googletag.cmd.push After a summer campaign on the Flat, Ballymore Champion Four Year Old Hurdle winner, Jeff Kidder will make hisover hurdles against a field that includes Gowran Park maiden winner An Epic Song and Gordon Elliott’s Grade  winner Teahupoo. Elliott is looking to win the Grade  BetVictor Fishery Lane Hurdle for a third successive year following the victories of Call Me Lyreen and Surin and is hopeful his son of Masked Marvel canto winning ways on his seasonal bow. “Teahupoo showed a good level of form last season which was very pleasing,” Elliott said this morning. “He is a horse that always looked like he would progress with a summer behind him. This Saturday looks a hot race but we are looking forward to getting him started.” Elliott also has a strong hand in the Grade  Poplar Square Chase with Felix Desjy the highest rated of the six runner field and he is joined by stable companion Andy Dufresne. Captain Guinness and Darver Star who were placed in the Arkle and Champion Hurdle at Cheltenham respectively add plenty of depth to the field. Elliott reported: “Both horses showed some quality form last season and they both line up with decent chances. Felix Desjy won a Grade  at Punchestown this time last year which is good form and Andy Dufresne ran a solid race in a Grade  and is a solid horse on his day.” Punters can look forward to a competitive renewal of the BetVictor Brown Lad Handicap Hurdle with  runners declared including the Michael Bowe-trained Sweet Sting who would be a fitting winner after the loss of Solernia this week.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.” For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions  ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeFamilies moved from homes in Derry security alert overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Cllr Emma McGinley: I am appealing to the whole community to be vigilant and watch out for each other, especially elderly neighbours who are particularly vulnerableLocal NewsCreggan residents urged to stay safe after reports of attempted break-ins overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsKathleen Thompson to be remembered on the th anniversary of her killing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  SportWATCH: County Derry primary school opens new pitch as parish prepares for county final overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  SportWATCH: Celebrations as Steelstown clinch historic first championship title overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Steelstown players celebrate their Intermediate title success over Greenlough.

Reporter: Gary Ferry Nov Email: gary@derrynews.net  addthis, Finn Harps  Derry City   There was huge drama at Finn Park as Jamie McGonigle’s late penalty saved Derry City from defeat in a dramatic finale in the Northwest derby. It looked asthe Candystripes were headed to defeat when Ethan Boyle headed Harps into the lead with just  minutes remaining, but McGonigle kept his nerve when presented with a penalty just  minutes later. googletag.cmd.push The point does not help either side, with Harps still in relegation trouble, while City have just won one game in their last six. The first hour gave no hint of the late drama to come. It was all Harps in the early stages, and Babatunde Owolabi could have opened the scoring within two minutes as he shrugged off Cameron McJannet before bearing down on goal and shooting high into the side netting. Harps were only encouraged by that and minutes later Nathan Gartside had to be alert to push away a volley from Ethan Boyle, who tried his luck from  yards as the Derry defence stood off. It took Derry City  minutes to have a shot of any sort at Mark McGinley in the Harps goal, but Ciaron Harkin’s effort from  yards rolled harmlessly wide without bothering the Harps goalkeeper. There was simply nothing between the sides as the game went on but Derry City should have nicked it on  minutes. Harps lost possession in midfield and James Akintunde flicked the ball over the defence to put substitute Jamie McGonigle in on goal. The striker was one on one with Mark McGinley but lobbed it over the goalkeeper and the open goal and the chance was gone. That proved to be costly for Derry as Harps went down the other end and scored within  seconds. Ryan Connolly delivered a free kick into the heart of the City penalty area and it was met by Ethan Boyle who powered a header past Gartside into the net. Harps’ jubilation was cut abruptly short within a minute however as Boyle went from hero to villain as he was adjudged to have handled Jamie McGonigle’s cross and referee Ben Connolly pointed to the penalty spot. It was McGonigle who stepped up and he sent McGonigle the wrong way to score a vital equaliser for Derry City.

Pic by Mary K Burke. Reporter: Gary Ferry Nov Email: gary@derrynews.net  addthis, Greenlough vs. Steelstown Brian Og’s Ballymaguigan, pm Referee – Gregory McWilliams  , ,  and now  – No one knows just what a Steelstown victory would mean today more than Marty Dunne. The veteran goalkeeper has been there through it all over the years, the joy and excitement of reaching Intermediate finals paling in comparison to the pain of losing them, and often in such cruel circumstances. googletag.cmd.push Dunne could only watch on as Paddy Henry’s effort  seconds from the end, won the game for Castledawson at Celtic Park in . He had to wait another six years for a second chance, only for Castledawson to defeat them by a single point again, this time at Owenbeg. Whilst not as dramatic as Henry’s winner, the loss of a last minute Steelstown free kick, due to Mickey McKinney lashing out at Niall Keenan, saw the opportunity for a replay lost, and Steelstown bodies crashed to the ground in dismay at the final whistle. Four years later and it seemed it might finally be Steelstown’s year – they held a good lead against Greenlough at Bellaghy, but they let it slip, and an error by Dunne himself led to a goal for Michael McDonnell in added time. There was no way back. So, in , Steelstown still await their first title, and Dunne, still going strong at , has one more chance to get his hands on a trophy that has eluded his grasp for over a decade. This will be his fth final - fourth Intermediate, one junior - and he knows just how fortunate he is to get another opportunity. “Its one thing you understand when you get older you appreciate them more and you look forward to them,” he said. “You know they are not going to come around all the time. When you’re younger you think ‘we’ll get plenty of these’, but you realise how sparse they are now so it’s good to be in it again and get another chance at it. “We would have killed to be back in this position after last year. A lot of teams could just fade away after something like that and not get back up there again, so we’re lucky in that regard in that we’re straight back where we want to be and we can have another rattle at them.” Last year’s final is still fresh in his mind, and it is he who brings up his short kick-out which led to that late McMullan goal. That is a regret, but he doesn’t lose sleep over it. “These things happen in matches,” he acknowledged. “All you can do is try and put it right again. Once it’s done it’s done. You are a goalkeeper and you’re going to make these mistakes, so these things are going to happen, especially in the heat of a final when you’re trying to rush things and trying to do things. It will not be in my head anyway, that’s for sure. “We were up by three points I think going into the final quarter and we never really kicked on. We kind of sat back and we never pushed on to get that result. You always think you should have won it and my contribution at the end didn’t help. These things happen so I’m looking forward to getting a second chance at it.”  Weight of history Everyone knows by now that Steelstown are still without that elusive first title, but Dunne, who has every right to feel that the club deserves one by now, does not believe that the weight of history should be a factor this weekend. “The first one is always the hardest to get over the line, but it’s a dferent group of players,” he explained. “I don’t think the young boys will be too concerned about that, it’s still just one match against Greenlough who are a good side and it will be hard to win. You would like to experience getting over finals, but the only way you can do that is by winning your first one.” It is impossible not to notice the progress made at Steelstown over recent years- from their senior ladies, to their reserves, to their underage work – the club is synonymous with success in so many ways. Dunne has enjoyed being a part of that, but he knows from the grassroots up to senior, nothing can ever be taken for granted “There’s been ups and downs but you always think it’s going to be a straight line up,” he reflected. “Going into senior was brilliant even though we didn’t win Intermediate, we stepped into senior and that was good, getting a run at senior. I wish we had stayed there, it’s disappointing to be back down in Intermediate, because we could have stayed on there. “This group of players are good enough for senior and that’s where they need to be. In the long term that’s what those guys need. “You always want the trajectory heading up the ways and that’s the next step but you want to win a championship. That’s the point. If we were to get that it would definitely help that group of players push on. It seems that every time Steelstown are in a final it’s a young team, but we probably have a better balance than we ever had there’s plenty of older heads there and younger boys spread throughout the team.” Hugh McGrath’s team were very impressive in Sunday’s semi-final win over the Limavady Wolfhounds. The -, - victory was borne from slick and clinical attacking play and the game was over as a contest by the half time break. Steelstown are going into the final with great momentum. “We made a good start, pegging on the scores and keeping the pressure on,” Dunne agrees. “There was a wide range of scorers so we weren’t relying on one or two scorers. It was good to get it over the line with a decent performance, but obviously Greenlough is going to be a step up again, we’re under no illusions about that. Our heads are pretty level one thing about this group is that they won’t get ahead of themselves in any regard. “We have to go at them and take them on, and get the scores on the board and be confident. We did that in the final against them last year but then we dried up and didn’t really push on, and we sat back a bit which isn’t really our style. You can’t throw away -point leads or -pount leads, you just can’t do it because you can’t stop momentum thenit turns against you. You have to keep pushing on.”  The future Dunne had decided to retire two years ago, but he was convinced by Eamon Gibson tolast year, and as  comes to an end he is still the main man for Steelstown. He knows by now not to look too far ahead, but he would dearly love to get that trophy in his hands before that final game comes. What a fairytale ending that would be for a terric club servant. “I’ll not look beyond Saturday’s match and see how it pans out from there,” he said. “Things could be very dferent depending on the dferent outcomes, so I haven’t given too much thought to it. “That’s why you keep going, because you want to win something. There’s plenty of people out there who don’t even get the chance to get to a final, plenty of players who have played for a lot longer than me and haven’t had much to show for it. As much as you can look back and say it’s disappointing not to win, at least you have got this one more chance, and that’s all you can ever have, that one chance every year, so take it, and I’m just looking forward to that.” ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeFamilies moved from homes in Derry security alert overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Cllr Emma McGinley: I am appealing to the whole community to be vigilant and watch out for each other, especially elderly neighbours who are particularly vulnerableLocal NewsCreggan residents urged to stay safe after reports of attempted break-ins overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsKathleen Thompson to be remembered on the th anniversary of her killing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  SportWATCH: County Derry primary school opens new pitch as parish prepares for county final overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  SportWATCH: Celebrations as Steelstown clinch historic first championship title overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Steelstown players celebrate their Intermediate title success over Greenlough.

It is now seven games without a win for ‘Stute who overcame a half time deficit, but despite some good chances, could not turn the game in their favour. A ‘Stute mistake gave Derview the lead early on. Goalkeeper John Connolly yelled for his defender to leave it as Cathal Farren’s cross came in, but he dropped the ball straight into the path of the league’s top scorer Benny Igiehon, wo simply put the ball into the empty net to make it -. googletag.cmd.push It should have gotten worse for the home side on the half hour when Niall McGinley broke down the left, and he picked out Farren in the middle, but the former Derry City striker scuffed his effort wide of the target with just Connolly to beat.

Both McLaughlin and goalkeeper Buchanan went for the loose ball and it looked asthe goalkeeper got there first, but not according to referee Harrigan, who pointed to the spot.

Those missed chances almost cost ‘Stute as Dergview began to get on top for the first time in the second half as the game entered the final ten minutes. Jamie Browne had his head in his hands after he dispossessed Jamie Dunne just outside his own area, but the striker was denied at the last second by the ‘Stute man, who made amends by deflecting the shot behind for a corner. From that set-piece, ‘Stute were lucky to survive as the ball bounced around the area, and it took a few brave blocks to keep the ball from reaching Connolly’s goal with Dergview players lining up to put it in.

Pic by Mary K Burke. Reporter: Michael McMullan Nov Email: sport@derrypost  addthis, Relief. That was Hugh McGrath’s take on finally getting over the line as Steelstown won their first Intermediate title at last.He admitted it wasn’t this side’s best showing of the season. Nor were they cohesive. And they didn’t play the brand of football they wanted. But there was only one currency Steelstown were dealing in. Silverware. That’s all Saturday was about.“It just matters that you are ahead at the end of the game,” said McGrath.“I wasn’t nervous in any way,” he told his side before the club’s historic hour. “I was jealous that they got to get the chance to go out and show what they were worth and show what was inside them.”And, coming back from last season’s defeat and in the manner which they did, that – in McGrath’s opinion – is the Steelstown’s calling card.“It tells you all you need to know about the group,” he said.The burden of three final defeats didn’t come into the narrative. It was a new management team, with a sprinkling of new players.At dferent times this year, McGrath beat the drum of a new beginning. Donncha Gilmore is now an All-Ireland winner. Five championships goals later, Morgan Murray has arrived on the scene and like Oran Fox, he benefitted from a league campaign that McGrath treated as gloried friendlies.It wasn’t about hard luck stories or flashbacks from yesteryear.“All we could base any chat around was what we done this year so far,” McGrath again stressed.“We were confident that we’d get ourselves in enough positions to take chances, that we’d create enough chances to get ourselves over the line.“We knew it would be tough, you don’t play the champions and get it easy. We knew it would be tough all the way through and it was about grinding it out.”Points from Jason McAleer and Eoghan Bradleyhad Steelstown three points clear after eight minutes, but the sides were levelat the break.“We weren’t panicking because we knew these things happen,” insisted the Steelstown boss. We went a couple down at the start of the second half. Maybe there was a bit of panic and you are going to feel that pressure when you have a couple of forwards like Greenlough have.”But McGrath trusted their leaders. Skipper Forester. Impact man Mickey McKinney. Midfielder Ryan Devine. All players from the  minor team he coached when he arrived at the club.“You have confidence that you have a group that will drive you on and get you over the line and that’s the way it panned out,” McGrath said.The fact they were still at the coal face of their title bid spoke volumes. McKinney was crying with total elation. “Is this real ”, bellowed Forester amid the pandemonium.“To go so long until now, it shows the type of characters that they are. They hung in there and had the belief in the group that was coming behind them,” McGrath added.“They are emotional. It shows how much the clubs means to them they have a desire to win.”And on the weekend that marked the thanniversary of Brian Oacuteg McKeever’s death. The club now carries his name.For McGrath, the final quarter told the story of the McKeever family.“That’s the way he would’ve played his game. If you look at the way Neildrove out, Eoghan Concannon hammered everything that was near him.“That was Brian Oacuteg McKeever, that’s what he did and there are plenty around here that know that’s what he did.“They were part of him, they saw him do it and the young people coming through are now aware of it too.”“He is never too far from our thoughts and Charleneas well, she played exactly the same way. For us to be able to do this for the McKeever family and give them something to celebrate, we are proud do to that.” googletag.cmd.push ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeFamilies moved from homes in Derry security alert overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Cllr Emma McGinley: I am appealing to the whole community to be vigilant and watch out for each other, especially elderly neighbours who are particularly vulnerableLocal NewsCreggan residents urged to stay safe after reports of attempted break-ins overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsKathleen Thompson to be remembered on the th anniversary of her killing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  SportWATCH: County Derry primary school opens new pitch as parish prepares for county final overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  SportWATCH: Celebrations as Steelstown clinch historic first championship title overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Steelstown players celebrate their Intermediate title success over Greenlough.

Pic by Mary K Burke. Reporter: Michael McMullan Nov Email: sport@derrypost  addthis, Relief. That was Hugh McGrath’s take on finally getting over the line as Steelstown won their first Intermediate title at last.He admitted it wasn’t this side’s best showing of the season. Nor were they cohesive. And they didn’t play the brand of football they wanted. But there was only one currency Steelstown were dealing in. Silverware. That’s all Saturday was about.“It just matters that you are ahead at the end of the game,” said McGrath.“I wasn’t nervous in any way,” he told his side before the club’s historic hour. “I was jealous that they got to get the chance to go out and show what they were worth and show what was inside them.”And, coming back from last season’s defeat and in the manner which they did, that – in McGrath’s opinion – is the Steelstown’s calling card.“It tells you all you need to know about the group,” he said.The burden of three final defeats didn’t come into the narrative. It was a new management team, with a sprinkling of new players.At dferent times this year, McGrath beat the drum of a new beginning. Donncha Gilmore is now an All-Ireland winner. Five championships goals later, Morgan Murray has arrived on the scene and like Oran Fox, he benefitted from a league campaign that McGrath treated as gloried friendlies.It wasn’t about hard luck stories or flashbacks from yesteryear.“All we could base any chat around was what we done this year so far,” McGrath again stressed.“We were confident that we’d get ourselves in enough positions to take chances, that we’d create enough chances to get ourselves over the line.“We knew it would be tough, you don’t play the champions and get it easy. We knew it would be tough all the way through and it was about grinding it out.”Points from Jason McAleer and Eoghan Bradleyhad Steelstown three points clear after eight minutes, but the sides were levelat the break.“We weren’t panicking because we knew these things happen,” insisted the Steelstown boss. We went a couple down at the start of the second half. Maybe there was a bit of panic and you are going to feel that pressure when you have a couple of forwards like Greenlough have.”But McGrath trusted their leaders. Skipper Forester. Impact man Mickey McKinney. Midfielder Ryan Devine. All players from the  minor team he coached when he arrived at the club.“You have confidence that you have a group that will drive you on and get you over the line and that’s the way it panned out,” McGrath said.The fact they were still at the coal face of their title bid spoke volumes. McKinney was crying with total elation. “Is this real ”, bellowed Forester amid the pandemonium.“To go so long until now, it shows the type of characters that they are. They hung in there and had the belief in the group that was coming behind them,” McGrath added.“They are emotional. It shows how much the clubs means to them they have a desire to win.”And on the weekend that marked the thanniversary of Brian Oacuteg McKeever’s death. The club now carries his name.For McGrath, the final quarter told the story of the McKeever family.“That’s the way he would’ve played his game. If you look at the way Neildrove out, Eoghan Concannon hammered everything that was near him.“That was Brian Oacuteg McKeever, that’s what he did and there are plenty around here that know that’s what he did.“They were part of him, they saw him do it and the young people coming through are now aware of it too.”“He is never too far from our thoughts and Charleneas well, she played exactly the same way. For us to be able to do this for the McKeever family and give them something to celebrate, we are proud do to that.” googletag.cmd.push ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeFamilies moved from homes in Derry security alert overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Cllr Emma McGinley: I am appealing to the whole community to be vigilant and watch out for each other, especially elderly neighbours who are particularly vulnerableLocal NewsCreggan residents urged to stay safe after reports of attempted break-ins overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsKathleen Thompson to be remembered on the th anniversary of her killing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  SportWATCH: County Derry primary school opens new pitch as parish prepares for county final overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  SportWATCH: Celebrations as Steelstown clinch historic first championship title overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Steelstown players celebrate their Intermediate title success over Greenlough.

There hasn’t been enough gigs this past year to have a best live act, how they arrived at a conclusion last year is strange but then I may be misinformed. There’s obviously no new bands to speak of so it’s just the two awards this year. I suppose it’s as close to democracy as we can get, but as with everything in the parish, the archaic powers that be hold way too much influence and are too stuck in the past. I’m the guiltiest and have no real business having a say and will keep my opinions to myself from now on. Well after I say that to my ears Andrew McGibbon’s Northern Gothic and Verse Chorus Verse’s What If We Won are the best albums on that list to me and Waldorf  Cannon’s We Are Your Government is the best single. I think we should all sit back and appreciate that Hannah Peel’s Fir Wave was recently up for the Mercury Music Prize kiss of death, sadly not winning butit was two out of two losses an outsider would be thinking that there is something really weird going on within the chambers of power up at the Oh Yeah Centre. I named the  nominators to remind myself that my taste really isn’t that important, and I should read my above statement about keeping my opinions to myself. Waiting for things to change in the parish is just something we are great at here. What next, I hear you ask, well there is a group that meets around a table and weighs up the options for the best albums, I’d like to think they do this in a fair manner and once they reach a consensus then the world, who will undoubtedly be waiting with bated breath, will get their answer The same is not true for the single, that is voted for by the public, you, and that’s why those bands were urging you to vote recently. The public vote is now closed so I suppose they know who’s won it by now but they’re not letting on. Rascals.

Here are  to choose from....enjoy! Miami Vice: Saturday, TCM @ pm Michael Manns stylish and action packed update of the famous s TV show about cops taking on drug dealers. Bristling with testosterone, its a moody grown up thriller full of suspense, action and neo-nazis getting shot in the face. Whats not to like about that  Colin Farrell  Jamie Foxx are solid as the leads but Naomie Harris steals the film with one small scene in a mobile home. The soundtrack is wicked too. googletag.cmd.push Portrait Of A Lady On Fire: Saturday, BBC @ pm In Brittany at the end of the th century a painter called Marianne is commissioned to paint a portrait of a woman calledHeacuteloiumlse who is due to be married off to an Italian nobleman. A marriage she wants no part of. Do you fancy a romance that will both uplt you and leave you in absolute shreds  Well here you go. Magnicent turns from Noeacutemie Merlant and Adegravele Haenel carry a sublime story. Rain Man: Saturday, TG @ .pm Charlies father has died and left his fortune to an autistic brother he never realised he had. To get the money him and his brother tear off on a road trip where he finds out about both his sibling and himself. Aspects of Rain Man have dated these days but its still a lovely story of discovery and reunion buoyed by a couple of memorable performances from Dustin Hoffman and Tom Cruise. Pawn Sacrice: Sunday, BBC One @ .am  Bobby Fischer vs Boris Spassky. . The chess game to end all chess games. Two grandmasters. West vs East. Some said it was only a game but in a time of cold war its also something far more important than that. Tobey Maguire does fine work as the tragic lead of a well crafted film riddled with paranoia and suspense while Liev Schrieber uses his trademark brooding to intense effect. Walk Like A Panther: Sunday, Channel  @ .am  Their local pub is closing and the only way to make money is toto the lycra and capes. But these folks arent superheroes, nope, they are s wrestlers and aching hips and shoulders arent going to stop them. An entertaining slice of fluff and whimsy from  that will make you feel nostalgic for Saturday morning television. Stephen Graham, Sue Johnston, Robbie Gee and Julian Sands are among the familiar faces having fun. Ladyhawke: Sunday, Talking Pictures TV @ .pm Nare and Isabeau are in love but they have a wee problem. There was a curse placed on them making him a wolf during the night and her a hawk during the day ensuring they can never be together. The only person who can help is a thief called Gaston. Richard Donners  fairytale is a likable, well made, glorious looking romantic escapade. Michelle Pfefer and Rutger Hauer play the lost lovers and Matthew Broderick has a good time as their only hope. St Vincent: Sunday, Film @ .pm After an incident with his next door neighbour a grumpy old Vietnam vet begins to babysit her bullied son and soon they begin to see the best in each other. A funny, bittersweet comedy that will make you laugh and upset you in equal measures. Bill Murray in the lead is better than hes been in years and Melissa McCarthy as his neighbour does well in a role thats a lot more dramatic than her usual parts. Bridge to Terabithia: Monday, Great! Films @ .pm Jesse and Leslie become fast friends when she moves in next door to him. Soon their childhood imaginations are running riot and the kingdom of Terabithia is created. Real le is sadly never far away though. A little beaut of a movie, one full of lessons about le, both the lovely and tragic sides of it. Anna Sophia Robb and Josh Hutcherson are both amiable leads. Be warned, this could might will make you cry. Doubt: Monday, TG @ .pm A well liked priest is accused of child abuse. But did he do it  Thats the crux of the tale in an excellent adaption of the famous Broadway play. Philip Seymour Hoffmanis the priest in question and Meryl Streep is the nun investigating him. We get immense performances from both. The subject matter might be hard to take but its compelling and gripping stuff that will stay in your head for days after. Dog Soldiers: Monday, Film @ . A group of soldiers on routine training in the Scottish highlands find themselves under siege from a pack of beasts that should not exist. Neil Marshalls debut film is awesome. Hilarious, horric, quotable, disgusting and damn scary. A rare horror comedy that gets its blend just right. All this and we get a wicked cast too with Sean Pertwee, Kevin McKidd, Liam Cunningham and Darren Morfitt whos just deadly as Spoon. All The Kings Men: Tuesday, Great! Movies Action @ .am Wille Stark. A real salt of the earth fellow. Liked by all. Well...... Hes a politician, a self taught kind of guy. Hes a decent man, at least he was once, back when he hadnt sold his soul. A deserved Best Picture winner back in , this portrait of the rise and fall of a famous face mixes politics and noir to brilliant effect.Broderick Crawfordand Merceded McCambridge both put in first rate performances. Journeys End: Wednesday, BBC Two @ .pm France. . The trenches of Aisne. A young soldier called Raleigh once who once believed in the importance of war sits surrounded by his comrades in a filthy, rat infested trench as the German army only metres away get ready to attack their front lines. A powerful watch that shows us bullets make no distinctions when it comes to class and social status. Asa Butterfield, Paul Bettany and Sam Clafin do strong work. Nebraska: Thursday, Film @ .am A father and son called Woody and David are taking a trip from Montana to Nebraska to claim a prize. Woody is slowly losing his memory to dementia and David is dragged into the mess. Alexander Paynes comedy drama is a beautully written and crafted look at the complexities of family relationships. Plus it has a couple of wicked belly laughs hidden away. Bruce Dern, Will Forte and especially June Squibb are all on fire. Paths Of Glory: Thursday, BBC @ .pm The men of B-company refuse to make a suicidal run at a German hill during World War . Their general is embarrassed by his perceived failure and sets out to make someone pay. Stanley Kubricks masterful anti war film is an enraging watch, one that shows the toll military le can have on humanity even when the fighting is over. Kirk Douglas as Colonel Dax has never been better while George Macready as General Mireau will make you despair. Sam Whiskey: Friday, TG @ .pm Her husband is dead and Laura has a problem. The gold he stole is sitting in a boat at the bottom of the Colorado river and she needs someone to find it andit to its rightful place. Unfortunately she hires the rogue Sam Whiskey for the job. A charming. amiable western is just what you need for a Friday evening and this one led by Burt Reynolds and Angie Dickinson is just the ticket. Youll instantly guess how its going to end but it will keep you smiling throughout. American Mary: Friday, The Horror Channel @ .pm A broke medical student discovers an unusual way to make extra money and finds herself in some very very dark places as a result. This  dark drama horror film starring Katherine Isabelle is a highly effective piece of work. Be warned though, it should probably only be watched by those with a strong constitution butyou can go with it you discover a unique little story that will open your eyes to a whole other world. The Belly Of The Whale: Friday, RTEacute One @ .pm Joe and Ronald. Two loners in a miserable, run down seaside town in Donegal. One has come home after a long time and the other is already there scratching out a miserable existence. They come together with a plan but theres someone venal in their way. A dark dark dark Irish comedy from  that went under the radar at the time but its still worth your time. Michael Smiley, Peter Coonan and Pat Shortt do nice work as three men youd cross four fields to avoid.

Here are  to choose from....enjoy! Miami Vice: Saturday, TCM @ pm Michael Manns stylish and action packed update of the famous s TV show about cops taking on drug dealers. Bristling with testosterone, its a moody grown up thriller full of suspense, action and neo-nazis getting shot in the face. Whats not to like about that  Colin Farrell  Jamie Foxx are solid as the leads but Naomie Harris steals the film with one small scene in a mobile home. The soundtrack is wicked too. googletag.cmd.push Portrait Of A Lady On Fire: Saturday, BBC @ pm In Brittany at the end of the th century a painter called Marianne is commissioned to paint a portrait of a woman calledHeacuteloiumlse who is due to be married off to an Italian nobleman. A marriage she wants no part of. Do you fancy a romance that will both uplt you and leave you in absolute shreds  Well here you go. Magnicent turns from Noeacutemie Merlant and Adegravele Haenel carry a sublime story. Rain Man: Saturday, TG @ .pm Charlies father has died and left his fortune to an autistic brother he never realised he had. To get the money him and his brother tear off on a road trip where he finds out about both his sibling and himself. Aspects of Rain Man have dated these days but its still a lovely story of discovery and reunion buoyed by a couple of memorable performances from Dustin Hoffman and Tom Cruise. Pawn Sacrice: Sunday, BBC One @ .am  Bobby Fischer vs Boris Spassky. . The chess game to end all chess games. Two grandmasters. West vs East. Some said it was only a game but in a time of cold war its also something far more important than that. Tobey Maguire does fine work as the tragic lead of a well crafted film riddled with paranoia and suspense while Liev Schrieber uses his trademark brooding to intense effect. Walk Like A Panther: Sunday, Channel  @ .am  Their local pub is closing and the only way to make money is toto the lycra and capes. But these folks arent superheroes, nope, they are s wrestlers and aching hips and shoulders arent going to stop them. An entertaining slice of fluff and whimsy from  that will make you feel nostalgic for Saturday morning television. Stephen Graham, Sue Johnston, Robbie Gee and Julian Sands are among the familiar faces having fun. Ladyhawke: Sunday, Talking Pictures TV @ .pm Nare and Isabeau are in love but they have a wee problem. There was a curse placed on them making him a wolf during the night and her a hawk during the day ensuring they can never be together. The only person who can help is a thief called Gaston. Richard Donners  fairytale is a likable, well made, glorious looking romantic escapade. Michelle Pfefer and Rutger Hauer play the lost lovers and Matthew Broderick has a good time as their only hope. St Vincent: Sunday, Film @ .pm After an incident with his next door neighbour a grumpy old Vietnam vet begins to babysit her bullied son and soon they begin to see the best in each other. A funny, bittersweet comedy that will make you laugh and upset you in equal measures. Bill Murray in the lead is better than hes been in years and Melissa McCarthy as his neighbour does well in a role thats a lot more dramatic than her usual parts. Bridge to Terabithia: Monday, Great! Films @ .pm Jesse and Leslie become fast friends when she moves in next door to him. Soon their childhood imaginations are running riot and the kingdom of Terabithia is created. Real le is sadly never far away though. A little beaut of a movie, one full of lessons about le, both the lovely and tragic sides of it. Anna Sophia Robb and Josh Hutcherson are both amiable leads. Be warned, this could might will make you cry. Doubt: Monday, TG @ .pm A well liked priest is accused of child abuse. But did he do it  Thats the crux of the tale in an excellent adaption of the famous Broadway play. Philip Seymour Hoffmanis the priest in question and Meryl Streep is the nun investigating him. We get immense performances from both. The subject matter might be hard to take but its compelling and gripping stuff that will stay in your head for days after. Dog Soldiers: Monday, Film @ . A group of soldiers on routine training in the Scottish highlands find themselves under siege from a pack of beasts that should not exist. Neil Marshalls debut film is awesome. Hilarious, horric, quotable, disgusting and damn scary. A rare horror comedy that gets its blend just right. All this and we get a wicked cast too with Sean Pertwee, Kevin McKidd, Liam Cunningham and Darren Morfitt whos just deadly as Spoon. All The Kings Men: Tuesday, Great! Movies Action @ .am Wille Stark. A real salt of the earth fellow. Liked by all. Well...... Hes a politician, a self taught kind of guy. Hes a decent man, at least he was once, back when he hadnt sold his soul. A deserved Best Picture winner back in , this portrait of the rise and fall of a famous face mixes politics and noir to brilliant effect.Broderick Crawfordand Merceded McCambridge both put in first rate performances. Journeys End: Wednesday, BBC Two @ .pm France. . The trenches of Aisne. A young soldier called Raleigh once who once believed in the importance of war sits surrounded by his comrades in a filthy, rat infested trench as the German army only metres away get ready to attack their front lines. A powerful watch that shows us bullets make no distinctions when it comes to class and social status. Asa Butterfield, Paul Bettany and Sam Clafin do strong work. Nebraska: Thursday, Film @ .am A father and son called Woody and David are taking a trip from Montana to Nebraska to claim a prize. Woody is slowly losing his memory to dementia and David is dragged into the mess. Alexander Paynes comedy drama is a beautully written and crafted look at the complexities of family relationships. Plus it has a couple of wicked belly laughs hidden away. Bruce Dern, Will Forte and especially June Squibb are all on fire. Paths Of Glory: Thursday, BBC @ .pm The men of B-company refuse to make a suicidal run at a German hill during World War . Their general is embarrassed by his perceived failure and sets out to make someone pay. Stanley Kubricks masterful anti war film is an enraging watch, one that shows the toll military le can have on humanity even when the fighting is over. Kirk Douglas as Colonel Dax has never been better while George Macready as General Mireau will make you despair. Sam Whiskey: Friday, TG @ .pm Her husband is dead and Laura has a problem. The gold he stole is sitting in a boat at the bottom of the Colorado river and she needs someone to find it andit to its rightful place. Unfortunately she hires the rogue Sam Whiskey for the job. A charming. amiable western is just what you need for a Friday evening and this one led by Burt Reynolds and Angie Dickinson is just the ticket. Youll instantly guess how its going to end but it will keep you smiling throughout. American Mary: Friday, The Horror Channel @ .pm A broke medical student discovers an unusual way to make extra money and finds herself in some very very dark places as a result. This  dark drama horror film starring Katherine Isabelle is a highly effective piece of work. Be warned though, it should probably only be watched by those with a strong constitution butyou can go with it you discover a unique little story that will open your eyes to a whole other world. The Belly Of The Whale: Friday, RTEacute One @ .pm Joe and Ronald. Two loners in a miserable, run down seaside town in Donegal. One has come home after a long time and the other is already there scratching out a miserable existence. They come together with a plan but theres someone venal in their way. A dark dark dark Irish comedy from  that went under the radar at the time but its still worth your time. Michael Smiley, Peter Coonan and Pat Shortt do nice work as three men youd cross four fields to avoid.

We wanted to celebrate that and also remember our dear friend and past pupil, Sonia Kinsella, who died of cancer last year.ldquoWhen we think of her strength and her courage and more importantly, her optimism, this play seemed so appropriate. We hope it pays tribute to Sonia as I think the sentiments this play evokes were embodied in that remarkable lady.ldquoThe play celebrates the strength of female friendship and the incredible support women experience from each other. I think our audiences will find themselves laughing one minute and crying the next.I am so proud of what has been achieved not only in the fact we havenrsquot fallen out despite the dficulties you face when you are trying to work with friends but also the time these busy women have devoted to learning lines and rehearsing while working full time and coping with family responsibilities. It has been hard work but I truly feel audiences will really enjoy the performance.Proceeds from the performances will be in aid of Marie Curie and Assumption Grammar Schoolrsquos sister schools in South Africa.Marcelle said: ldquoThese schools struggle financially anyway but they are experiencing great challenges during lockdown. The money we raise will make a huge dference to many lives there, allowing girls to get access to education and to be offered a meal each day.The provision offered to these students in South Africa can make all the dference to their future.She added: It is wonderful to see the fruition of all our hard work that all stemmed from a conversation during lockdown and that will hopefully benefit others in dferent ways.To purchase a ticket the production, please contact the school reception on   .

The website is now live. It is www.redkiteretreat and we are regularly updating our Facebook page @redkiteretreat. For more information please pay us a visit on Facebook, like and share the page.Red Kites were in the area and over a year ago and Stephen started feeding them and as this continued more and more started turning up daily.Red Kites are a bird of prey and have a huge wingspan of up to . metres they are reddish brown with black wingtips and a grey head.They have a distinctive V-shaped tail which they use like a rudder as they twist and turn through the air on thermals and their call is a long whistle.Red Kites are primarily scavengers and a big part of their diet is made up of dead animals , including road-kill. They also follow tractors when ploughing and swoop down to grab any small animals that have been killed by the mowers or brought to the surface.They are no threat to livestock and the largest animal they have the power and speed to kill is a young rabbit. Red Kites, like all other birds of prey, are protected by law and to harm, disturb or kill them is a criminal offence.The new Red Kite Retreat bird hide has already become very popular with wildle photographers and bird watchers and booking a slot is essential.Three generations of the Malcomson family have also helped to plant some of the first of , native trees on a -acre site to create The Warriorrsquos Wood on Dechomet Mountain.The main contractor, Scottish Woodland Ireland Ltd, managed the forest expansion and farm ersication project and planted Irish Oak, Hazel, Holly, Scots Pine and Downy Birch. Stephen and Karen also created two new ponds to encourage wildle and sowed a new wildflower meadow.Warriorrsquos Wood is the initial habitat enhancement works which form part of the new eco-tourism development known as the lsquoRed Kite Retreatrsquo.Stephen and Karen are the projectrsquos co-founders and wanted a means of ersying their farm business to ensure future sustainability.Currently, Stephen has a pig and beef unit on the farm but said ldquofarming enterprises have to adapt and evolve to ensure sustainability for future generations of farmers. I see no reason why modern farming practices cannot go hand in hand with conservation, environmental enrichment and encouraging bioersity.The Red Kite Retreat project aims to create a unique tourist and visitor facility and focuses on conservation and education about the Red Kite bird of prey, with the creation of the Warriorrsquos Wood the first step in the project.The Wood has been designed to mimic ancient woodland with species adapted to grow in elevated and exposed locations, with the planting including Scots pine, oak, birch, aspen, rowan, hawthorn and juniper.The Scots pine is favoured by native red squirrels which it is hoped will be reintroduced once the woodland has matured, while Juniper is also being established on the site.Updates in the Red Kite retreat are available on Facebook @redkiteretreat, by logging on at www.redkiteretreat or telephone .prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/3November2021_espie.jpg","title":"Castle Espie receives plaudit  ","story":"THE Castle Espie Wetland Centre on the shores of Strangford Lough, which recently hosted the popular BBC wildle programme Autumnwatch, has been praised for its ongoing conservation work.Ards and North Down deputy mayor Robert Adair visited the centrersquos base recently and met BBC programme presenter Gillian Burke and Castle Espie manager Paul Stewart.Cllr Adair said after the huge success of Springwatch at Castle Espie, the television programmersquosfor Autumnwatch has shone the spotlight on the rich wildle of the borough and Castle Espie as an icon of sustainable green tourism.In addition to hosting Autumnwatch, the visit comes as the charity is currently celebrating with a Winter Migration Festival at Castle Espie which includes a series of bespoke events for adults and children alike and runs until November .Cllr Adair said the international importance of Strangford Lough and its exceptional bioersity is a real asset to the environment.ldquoCastle Espie provides a window on the lough with the Winter Migration Festival and filming of Autumnwatch being a fitting way to introduce people to this wonderful asset on our doorstep, he added.Mr Stewart said the centre has been celebrating the natural resource and theof the Brent geese with events in and around Autumnwatch aimed at connecting people with nature.ldquoFrom sunrise yoga, art workshops, walks and talks, to nature focused activities for children, they are all aimed at connecting people to this wonderful place, he explained.ldquoThe worldrsquos wetland habitats like those at Castle Espie actually sequester more carbon than all the worldrsquos forests despite occupying only a fraction of the area around the globe.ldquoAs well as helping to deal with the effects of climate change, wetlands are one of the most bioerse habitats on Earth, protect us from flooding, filter pollutants and help improve our mental health.The Wildle and Wetlands Trust works around the globe, protecting wetland habitats and migratory bird flyways and operates  wetland centres across the UK with Castle Espie the only one in Northern Ireland.The charity recently launched a new lsquoWetlands Can!rsquo campaign, urging people to get behind the leading conservation charityrsquos call for creating , hectares of healthy wetlands in the UK to help combat the climate crisis.Mr Stewart added: ldquoIf the Covid crisis has taught us one thing, itrsquos that we canrsquot go back to how things were before.

The manager of the local service has confirmed that the incident is the first deliberate attack against an on-call GP service in Northern Ireland in the past five years.Mr Mark Armstrong described the Downpatrick attack as a ldquofrightening new development because the vandals deliberately put the emergency car off the road by puncturing both tyres.He also confirmed an immediate review of security

Hynds produced a peerless display aside from that concession, a former Poc Fada competitor, her restarts were struck with precision to wing forwards Katie Black and Niamh Galloway, who in turn fed team captain Joanne Sloane.Straight away, Sloane would angle deliveries into the mobile Maguire. Sloanersquos slick stickwork was impressive, and she had a fine contest versus Bernie Convery throughout.The key battle however, was the dual between Dearg centre back Grainne Glendenning and Belfastrsquos Jessica Rush.With her luminous green boots and helmet, Rush would stand out in any game, but she has the class to back up the bright colours.Winning a huge amount of primary possession, Jessica lsquos jinking, probing runs and vision to find Nicole Clerkin and Niamh Dolan was causing huge headaches for an experienced Ben Dearg defence.Kilcliefrsquos breakthrough goal came in the th minute with Burns finishing brilliantly past Lara OrsquoHare.Clare Kelly and Aacuteine Moynan made timely and brave blocks from Nora Maguirersquos goalbound efforts. The midfield battle was an intriguing and crucial one.Dual star Cara Doran has been on a scoring spree in the football championship this year and she continued her hot streak, with some exceptionally well taken scores from tight angles.Eimear Dorrian was everywhere, covering every blade of grass, never static, always roving, trying to create and make things happen. Dorrianrsquos dynamism and Doranrsquos deadliness contributed hugely to the green and reds display.Niamh McGuigan produced an equally impressive display for the Belfast side. McGuiganrsquos magnetic ability to gain possession in the tightest of spaces is remarkable.Never rushed, despite the chaos around her, she has that precarious talent of always having time, allowing her to scan and assess options, a luxury that only the very top operatorrsquos have.All season, Niamh Daly has also operated at centre field, but cruelly missed out on this final through injury.Brigid Scullion cleverly ped deep to forage for possession, picking up loose ball and linking well with half backs McErlain and Mathers. Kilclief thundered into action with another brace of points from deadly Doran.Her score in the st minute was worthy of the admission fee. Still only  years of age, a career in county colours surely beckons for this gted youngGael.Eimear Breen was a constant outlet for her defence to hit, a player who uses her pace effectively at the right times.With  minutes remaining, Kilclief were edging the contest with a five point cushion. Management Brendan Breen and Seaacuten Paul Doran madetactical tweaks to thwart the increasingly dangerous Clerkin and Dolan axis up front.A double sweeper system was swtly put in place, Cliona Shields and Catherine Deegan were tasked with shutting up shop forming a highly effective shield in front of Ballinascreen stalwart Nicole Clerkin.Nicolersquos space was greatly reduced, but still she battled as hard as possible to cut the deficit. McMullan and Mastersonrsquos masterclass in creating space for goalkeeper Hynds to aim towards, were signicant.McMullan typied the fight and character within the Ben Dearg outfit, as did the industrious Catherine Deegan. Yet, East Belfast pressed with an astounding intensity and relentlessness.That huge work rate comes from having dual players with fierce commitment and blocks of fitness from constant competing, but also from their Bainisteoiriacute Ciaran Hughes and Seaacuten Coulter who encourage their team to play with flair, and they certainly do that, but intense work ethic is paramountyou are to retain a place in this highly motivated team.That competition for places has ensured consistent performance levels all season.Niamh Dolan cleverly created precious space in the congested final third in the th minute, but her angled drive was superbly blocked by Cliona Shields, then swept up bravely by the heroic McMullan, who swtly transitioned to the always available Dorrian.Testament to the synchronisity that is within this Ben Dearg side, Dorrian didnrsquot have to look up to spot the expertly timed run of Burns who showed a deftness of touch to control the sliotar and sail it straight over the black spot.It was a score that comes from playing training together over many seasons. At the other end Aacuteine Moynan and Shannon McWilliams made important blocks, just as Joanne Sloan and Niamh Galloway were about to raise green flags.Clodagh Hanvey made a strong contribution after entering the fray. Maguirersquos maturity and decision making is exceptional for a Gael just turned .With Cara Doran the same age, the future is bright for this Kilclief team. Breen too, displays a shrewd tactical brain, dropping into spaces, covering runs, causing havoc.Doran was awarded player of the match, for her scintillating display, though a case could also have been made for East Belfastrsquos Niamh McGuigan.Niamhrsquos link up play with Jessica Rush was a joy to watch, but equally impressive was her willingness to help team mates in trouble, a true team player.With both teams featuring strong and dynamic forward units, this game was always going to be decided by which defence came out on top.Ultimately, the craft, guile and experience of the Kilclief reargaurd ensured that they closed the game out and got the Championship title they so craved, especially after last yearrsquos heartbreaking defeat to Attical.Euphoric scenes and emotions were unleashed as referee HP McCusker blew his final whistle.Team captain Joanne Sloane spoke from the heart, with a speech that did her club proud. A huge roar went up from the Ben Dearg support whenever she lted aloft the Liam Mac An Ri championship trophy.Each age group at juvenile and now senior level has collected silverware this season, testament to the solid work taking place at their fantastic new facilities in St Malachyrsquos Park.Lorraine MacCartanrsquos priceless contribution in the development of players at the club was highlighted, and deserved praise was duly given to this exemplary East Belfast side.The Ulster Championships now beckon for Kilclief.Referee: H P McCusker .prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/3November2021_kilmore.jpg","title":"Kilmore navigate their way past Maze  ","story":"KILMORE Rec welcomed Lower Maze to Robert Adams Park in the third round of the Peaky Blinders Irish Cup and produced a barn storming second half comeback to progress to round four.With Kilmore two goals down at half-time, having been harshly reduced to ten men after  minutes, the odds were stacked against them.However, a tactical change and a second half performance full of hard work and passion epitomised by man of the match Paddy Grant saw Michael Carvillrsquos men defy those odds and produce one of the most memorable comebacks seen at Robert Adams Park in recent times.Kilmore started brightly but after just eight minutes they failed to clear their lines from a corner, allowing Lower Mazersquos Alex Scott to pick up the ball  yards out and fire through a crowded goal mouth past an unsighted Chris Turley in the Kilmore goals.The task in hand got harder when the referee adjudged Kilmore captain Niall McCarthy to be the aggressor in a midfield confrontation and, to the astonishment of all in the ground, deemed it a red card offence.The injustice of the sending off galvanised Kilmorersquos ten men and they took the game to Lower Maze, dominating possession and creating chances.The first of these saw Caolan Conlon burst through from midfield. His shot was well saved and the rebound fell to Gary Kennedy who fired towards the net only to see Maze lsquokeeper Heron produce a great double save.Cai Gemmel, who was magnicent throughout, saw a goal bound effort deflected wide of the head of a Maze defender as it seemed destined for the top corner.As the chances came and went Kilmore got caught with a sucker punch in the nd minute.Bradford made his way down the left and his mis-cued cross beat a stranded Turley to leave Kilmore two down at half-time and up against it.Carvill changed the shape of the team at half-time and went with a front two of Paddy Grant and Josh Smyth.This change paid idends in the th minute when Grant weaved his way into the box, although it appeared he had been forced too wide, but the forward still managed to fire a rasping drive to the roof of the net.In the th minute a sustained period of Kilmore pressure brought the equaliser, with Grant again involved when his clipped cross was nodded in at the back post by the energetic Josh Smyth.Kilmore continued to dominate and press for the winner, as it seemed as though the game was destined for extra time.In the th minute the pressure finally paid off when Carvill whipped in a corner and that man Grant was on hand to hook the ball home from close range to send the Kilmore faithful into raptures.As Lower Maze then threw everything at Kilmore in injury time, the Blues defence of Magee, Larkin, Kennedy, Stewart and lsquokeeper Turley remained steadfast.Kilmorersquos substitutes of Dagen and Lynas had a chance each on the break for a fourth, but it wasnrsquot to be.Carvill spoke of his ldquoimmense pride in the resilience and determination shown by his side after the match.It came as no surprise that the Kilmore supporters man of the match went to Paddy Grant for his two goals and an assist in a match winning performance.This win sealed double delight for Kilmore, as the club recently secured approval for the installation of a new G football pitch, complete with floodlights, dug-outs, pitch side fencing and associated pathways.Kilmore: Turley, Smyth, Stewart, Larkin, Magee, Gemmell, Conlon, McCarthy, Kennedy, Carvil, Grant.

Even though not all are called foodbanks, all are there helping families regardless.Each foodbank or ministry tells a dferent story and each provides help in dferent ways.

A UUP spokesperson said the party was sorry that Mr McKee had decided his political future no longer lay with the UUP.ldquoWe would like to thank Harold for his service and wish him well for the future, the spokesperson said. ldquoThe party will continue to hold out the hand of friendship as Harold takes a new path.Slieve Croob Ulster Unionist councillor Alan Lewis has described the decision by his former colleague to quit as ldquodisappointing.He continued: ldquoThere are many things that I find myself disagreeing with in all parties, not just my own and sometimes I find that it is better to continue to lobby, talk through and progress these issues from the inside, rather than walk out the door.ldquoThatrsquos democratic politics. Nobody is going to call for the gallows just because your opinion dfers, no matter how rigorous the debate. Unionism demands cohesion with the avoidance of ision.Cllr Lewis also thanked his former colleague for his ldquohelp, support, wisdom and guidance since he was elected to Newry, Mourne and Down Council.He added: ldquoI will always consider Harold a friend and fellow unionist. He has overcome personal turmoil and, like many of us, has a strong faith which has encouraged and supported him through dficult times.ldquoI genuinely wish him all the best in whatever he chooses to do next.Earlier this year, DUP councillors Glyn Hanna and Kathryn Owen quit their party over concerns following the election of Edwin Poots as leader.Mr Poots was subsequently replaced by Sir Jeffrey Donaldson MP and a short time later Cllr Hanna, who also represents the Mournes area, and Cllr Owen, who represents the Rowallane area, rejoined the party..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/3November2021_pitch.jpg","title":"New £12m sports pitch at Ballyhornan ‘fantastic facility’ for local community  ","story":"BALLYHORNANrsquoS new G sports pitch has been officially opened.The pound.m investment mdash which includes floodlights and ultra-modern changing facilities mdash has been funded by the Northern Ireland Executiversquos Social Investment Fund and Newry, Mourne and Down Council.Located adjacent to the Ballyhornan Family Centre, the new pitch is already widely used and has brought a number of benefits to the community.The Social Investment Fund contributed pound.m to the new development with the remainder provided by the local authority, with the Ballyhornan Community Association playing a pivotal role in helping secure the funding for the new pitch which was completed in October last year.Designed to increase access to community and leisure services by providing a fit-for-purpose, safe and structured environment to meet the needs and expectations of the Ballyhornan community and surrounding area, the new pitch will make a major contribution to help improve the health and well-being of people in the area.Ballyhornan and District Community Association chairwoman, Patricia Curran, expressed her delight to finally have a completed facility after years of rallying to secure funding for the G pitch which can be used all year round.ldquoWe are very grateful to all the statutory bodies and the local council who supported us throughout this campaign. Without them, we would not have achieved our goal, said Mrs Curran.ldquoThis pitch will be a great asset to Ballyhornan and outlying communities and we are very appreciative of this opportunity to provide a top of the range sports facility.Mrs Curran extended thanks to several people who worked with community officials to secure agreement for the new pitch and deliver it.Special thanks were extended to former local council officer Liam McLernon, Cllr Dermot Curran and former councillor Naomi Bailie for their ldquoimmense support.Mrs Curran also highlighted the support of Celtic Bhoys Football Club which uses the new pitch for its home games. She said the clubrsquos support was essential ldquoin making the project a success.Council chairwoman Cathy Mason, who performed the official opening, said one of the organisationrsquos key objectives was to improve the health and wellbeing of everyone in the district and reduce health inequalities.ldquoThis new facility will become a thriving hub that will have a hugely positive impact on the local area, benefitting the health and wellbeing of people of all ages by offering improved access to modern sporting facilities, she said.ldquoThis fantastic new facility is an excellent example of partnership working between statutory and voluntary groups and the health and wellbeing impact on our community will be immense.South Down MLA Colin McGrath said the official opening of the new pitch was ldquotestament to the work done by Mrs Curran and the team at Ballyhornan, working alongside officials from a number of organisations and elected representatives.ldquoItrsquos a real joy to see a picture of the late Eddie McGrady in the community centre in Ballyhornan who officially opened the building, he continued.ldquoThis latest development should serve as a reminder as to what can be delivered when communities, political representatives and government bodies work together in a common effort.

However, none of this would have happened without the hard work and determination of Patricia Curran and her team, he continued.ldquoGetting to this point over the past  years was a hard road with plenty of potholes, but Patricia never gave up.

The nearby Saintfield High School, a school supported by the entire community, is in dire need of funding for expansion and refurbishment.ldquoI would call on the EA to listen to the local community and support a truly cross community educational establishment that is already in existence.Cllr Billy Walker, who represents the area, said he will not supporting the development proposal, which he described as ldquoill-thought.ldquoAs an elected representative, I will not be supporting the call for an integrated college in the Mid Down area, he told the Recorder.ldquoFirst and foremost, I want to put on record that I am not opposed to integrated education in any shape or form.Cllr Walker said along with Strangford MP Jim Shannon, they lobbied for a new integrated primary school at Drumlins in Ballynahinch and were also instrumental in helping to get the funding to turn Killyleagh Primary School into an integrated school.He continued: ldquoMy credentials speak for themselves. My concern is that we have four post-primary schools in the Rowallane area that have been very successful in the last number of years.ldquoThe four schools are totally opposed to it as this will put serious pressure on these schoolsa new integrated college opens.ldquoThese schools have an excellent track record in working together in a cross-community basis which I have seen at first hand.The councillor claimed he had seen figures to show that Blackwater College was under-subscribed by pupils and local people have made representations to him about the development proposal.He and Mr Shannon recently met with the principals of the four local schools, including The High School Ballynahinch, to hear their concerns.ldquoHow can you honestly push for another integrated school in the Mid Down area when you have another one already under-subscribed, Cllr Walker continued.ldquoIf Blackwater wants to expand, hopefully in the near future Down High will get the go-ahead for its new build which would leave a site for Blackwater to move to. Thatrsquos something I could add my support to further down the line.ldquoBut I will not be quiet on this any longer. I have given a commitment, as has Mr Shannon, to the four schools we have visited that we are % behind their very robust case against which has been submitted to the Education Authority.Tim Jackson, co-chair of the MDIC steering group, said that the development proposal was looking at the future need for an integrated college.The group had already collected  expressions of interests from parents who would send their children to the school,along with  parents who are supportive but donrsquot have children of school age year.He also stressed that the schools had been consulted before the end of the last school year and the public consultation completed by September.ldquoWe feel that people have not understood what our approach and what our proposal is trying to achieve, continued Mr Jackson.ldquoWe are very much about increasing the provision of integrated education in the area, not at the expense of other schools but to support and reflect the support for it in the area and Northern Ireland as a whole.ldquoWe are not about trying to compete with other schools but are trying to deliver something that supports that demand of integrated education. We have had lots of support from local primary schools, many of which are integrated themselves and from other integrated colleges, who you could argue we would be in more competition with.He said that the group had written to every MP and MLA in the area and pointed out that Cllr Walker had not yet been briefed by them.ldquoHe did not take up the opportunity for us to brief him which might have assuaged some of the concerns he has highlighted, said Mr Jackson.ldquoAnd while we are hoping to establish a sixth form, we are not aware that the other local schools have also applied to do something like that.He added that the group were looking at the EArsquos response to the development proposal ldquoin detail as we think that some of our assertions have not been fully understood or appreciated as the EA looks at historical data while we are looking into the future as the urban and geographical landscape changes.Mark Morgan, principal of St Colmanrsquos, described the proposal as a ldquosolo run that disregards accepted protocols and should be dismissed.He added: ldquoIt is imperative that any proposals for change in any sector of the education system must be aligned to the area planning process.Saintfield High School principal Sarah-Lucy Hynds pointed out that irrespective of the proposal, her school would continue to strive for its own expansion.She said: ldquoSaintfield High Schoolrsquos campaign to grow has remained the same for decades. The challenges we face as a result of our capped enrolment at Year  must now be addressed as a matter of urgency.Mr Seamus Hanna, principal of St Colmcillersquos, said he was disappointed with the lack of ldquoproper consultation.ldquoOn a very basic level, the proposal ignored the reality that our staff and students already come from erse faith backgrounds and our ethos is and always has been, pupil centred, welcoming and respecting every pupil, regardless of faith or academic ability, he said.ldquoOn a higher level, it ignored the reality that schools must work in partnership to place student needs above institutional interests.

Those who perished in the terrible th century wars interconnect under the schism of Orange and GreenIn relation to the war dead especially those who perished in the terrible global conflicts of the th century those roots interconnect deeply under the great schism of Orange and Green that ides this society.Researching and then writing a new novel based in large part one of my ancestors who fought on the Somme and later at Ypres those shared roots have become more apparent than ever.The book shuttles back and forward from the Western Front battlefields in  to a haunted London Underground station in the st century. Its two main principal characters are fictional versions of my great grandfather Samuel Stewart and one of his great grandsons who like the old veteran had also served in the British Army.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Henry McDonald is a formerand Observer Ireland correspondent and author of books including a biography of David Trimble and INLA: Deadly DivisionsAlthough Samuel becomes Elijah in the narrativethis man’s home was the same one as my great grandfather’s – in Lower Urney Street off Belfast’s Shankill Road.In one scene I imagined Samuel Elijah ing on home leave to visit his we, a reunion that doesn’t go to plan for him.As he departs from the house and makes his way towards the Shankill Road to catch a tram that will deliver him near Belfast docks Samuel Elijah spots a little girl hiding in the shadows. Barefoot she scurries across the gas lit street and hammers on the door of a house. As the child frantically wraps on the knocker Samuel Elijah notices that the front window has been smashed and replaced with thin cardboard. Beneath this act of vandalism someone has scrawled in chalk: “Rebels Out”. When the girl finally goes inside my main character observes a little trail of blood in parallel with fragments of broken glass leading to the door.It is only a few months after the Easter Rising in Dublin and Samuel Elijah remembers that a Catholic soldier lived with his family also in Lower Urney street and that this brave man was serving over in France with the Connaught Rangers. Samuel Elijah leaves the Shankill even more depressed now than when he left his home a few minutes earlier. The Connaught Rangers’ family were targeted for something that happened  miles south, for something they had nothing to do with and knew little about.This particular scene was in my head long before I picked up and read another far too neglected book about the Irish experience of the Great War.Richard S.Grayson’s ‘Belfast Boys: How Unionists and Nationalists fought and died together in the First World War’ was first published in  and deserves to be deemed a classic in the city’s Great War history. It charts the fate of men from either side of West Belfast’s sectarian ide including the untold stories of Catholic soldiers who fought on the Somme and other battlefields in the th Irish Division. Among Grayson’s superbly researched accounts of Catholic veterans was Connaught Ranger Patrick O’Hare who served a total of  years in the regiment. His service however did not spare him and his family from armed sectarian attackers who trashed their house in Urney Street and drove the O’Hares out of the area they had lived in.This attack occurred on  June  rather than the fictional assault on the family home five years earlier. The context were the sectarian pogroms against northern Catholics as partition became a reality and the state of Northern Ireland was born. Patrick O’Hare survived being told by the ransacking gang that they were going to shoot the ex-British soldier. His grandson Sean explained to Grayson that Patrick was saved by regular British troops manning a peace line between the Shankill and the Falls. The troops acted after one of Patrick’s daughters showed them her father’s military paybook and they intervened to exfiltrate him and his family out of Urney Street.Patrick’s grandson Sean is my uncle having married the sister of my mother in the s. The startling coincidence between the shameful real le targeting of a Great War veteran in  and the attack on the home of the fictional family in the same street following the Easter Rising is uncanny.Moreover, the real ‘Elijah’ lived in the very same street as the Catholic man whose grandson would later marry one of Samuel Stewart’s granddaughters. Who was it who said there are no coincidences!Among other books I devoured while researching the novel was ‘Journey of Remembering’ which lists in alphabetical order the Great War dead of Belfast. It includes Samuel Stewart and also Private Andrew McDonald, a Catholic great uncle on my father’s side of the family.Andrew’s story is particularly poignant as we approach this week’s Armistice Day.He was born in Scotland but grew up in Saul Street in the Short Strand Ballymacarrett district of East Belfast. He served in the Highland Light Infantry and was killed on  October , just almost exactly before the guns fell silent and the slaughter was over.• Other comment pieces below, and beneath that information on how to subscribe to the News Letter• Ben Lowry: A poll that finds support for UK, DUP and ending protocol checks – not something you hear often• Ruth Dudley Edwards Nov : Stephen Nolan seen as a hero in GB for his reports into Stonewall• Henry McDonald Nov : Touching novel raises the plight of Irish world war veterans• Owen Polley Oct : Unconvincing poll was twisted by pundits to support the NI Protocol• Writers Oct : We probe Irish nationalist myths in our new book which defends the Union• Ben Lowry Oct : Theof inflation will suit debtors and punish savers• David Montgomery Oct : Put NI politicians at heart of the talks to resolve the dispute over the protocol• Baroness Hoey Nov : Montgomery article fails to recognise that SF won’t work for the interest of NI• Peter Robinson Oct : SF finance minister’s fiscal policy is to hold out his hand for more UK cash• Henry Patterson Oct : Terror is being legitimised in Basque Country as it is in NI——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

The PSNI stated that they did not think so.Before Lord Alderdice lectures others on a more “moderate approach” he needs to reconsider his refusal to apologise for those words which many of his fellow Prebyterian elders found so wounding and unnecessary.It is entirely appropriate therefore that his book is being launched in a denomination which does not subscribe to the subordinate standards of the PCI.Ronnie Crawford, Dromore——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Those relations were already strained due to relentless nationalism from Dublin, over matters including legacy.

While all babies are dferent, it can be helpful to think about working towards a routine by doing the same things in the same order each night so that baby learns what is coming next.Think about your little onersquos sleep environmentIt can be helpful to black out bedrooms, something that can be especially important in the summer months. Temperature is also important the Lullaby Trust, the baby sleep charity, say that the safest temperature for our little ones is - degrees celsius.Looking at how your little one falls asleep can help them get a more settled nightIt is very normal for your little one to be fed, rocked or cuddled to sleep, however this can be dficult to maintain. Practice other ways of getting your baby to sleep in their own sleep space to help find a method that suits you, your baby and your parenting style.Watch out for signs of tirednessWhile there are typical s of time that babies will happily stay awake for, the most important thing is getting to know your baby. By observing your baby, you can try to get them down for naps during the day before they get overtired. It is also important not to try to force naps when they are under tired.Fresh air and exerciseGetting out of the house for a bit will blow the cobwebs away and help your little one to burn off some energy. Inside the home your little one will also benefit from lots of time on the floor to keep them moving, while for small babies practising a bit of tummy time can be really helpful.Donrsquot always rush inhellipSometimes your little one will babble or make noise while they are asleep, and by going in too quickly we can disturb them. Equally they can sometimes wake and be happy in their sleep space. If your little one doesnrsquot need your assistance it is important to give them the space to get themselves back to sleep independently.Take care of yourself and donrsquot be afraid to ask for helpTherersquos no shame in not being able to do it all, all of the time. Being sleep deprived can be incredibly challenging and feel very lonely. Please know that is very normal for sleep to be dficult, especially in those early days. Please remember being a parent doesnrsquot always feel easy, because itrsquos not!

While acknowledging the work led to delays for motorists, Councillor Lavelle McIlwrath said they were viewed as a necessaryevil in order to deliver services to the area.However, he criticisedthe condition of the repair work between the traffic lights at Mahon junction an Ridgeway Park, describing it as “diabolical”.“I have had numerous complaints from motorists about the way the Armagh Road has been left.“The section of roadway that was dug up cannot now be avoided as you drive towards town and the uneven way the repaired carriageway has been left is shocking.“The irony is that this stretch of roadway was one of the better ones in the area prior to the roadworks and is now one of the worst.”Cllr McIlwrath confirmed he had raisedthe matter with both Firmus Energy and the Department for Infrastructure and said they energy firm has agreed tothe road to its original standard.“I raisedthe matter directly with Firmus Energy as well as the Department for Infrastructure,” he said.“I am pleased to confirm that Firmus Energy has agreed to revisittheir repairs at the Armagh Road and ensure that this stretch of carriageway is ed to its original standard.“The work will take several weeks to plan and coordinate.”Speaking to the Local Democracy Reporting Service, a spokesperson for Firmus Energy confirmed the road surface will be repaired.“We have been liaising with Councillor McIlwrath, the Department for Infrastructure and our contractors to agree a plan to repair the road surface and hope to have that work completed as soon as possible.”Editor’s message:Thank you for reading this article.

Photo: PacemakerUpper Bann MLA Mrs Kelly was quoted in a newspaper article as saying this week’s PSNI th anniversary was the perfect opportunity to recommit to the principle of a shared police force. The SDLP policing board member also said the creation of the PSNI was a “signicant departure from the institutionalised sectarianism represented by the RUC”.Those comments led to the NI Retired Police Officers’ Association penning an open letter to Mrs Kelly, in which the NIRPOA chairman called on the MLA to withdraw her remarks, and to apologise for the “gross offence” caused.The letter states: “I am writing to seek your immediate withdrawal of that remark, and an apology for the gross offence you have caused to the thousands of members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary GC who served this community in the most challenging of times.”Mrs Kelly responded, saying: “The SDLP has previously paid tribute to the sacrices made by many RUC officers and their families.“The fact remains that there were severe institutional problems within the RUC and this is a matter of public record. That many retired police officers continue to refuse to cooperate with legacy investigations to this day speaks for itself.”Mrs Kelly added: “The transformation of the RUC to the PSNI has been an outstanding success and whilst policing continues to be challenging I think the hard work and efforts of the those involved in implementing Patten’s recommendations deserve credit.”Ulster Unionist policing board member Mr Nesbitt said he believes his SDLP counterpart should “reflect on her comments and the hurt they have caused and apologise”.He said: “The RUC were the barrier between Northern Ireland and complete anarchy. They bravely held the line throughout the Troubles.“Dolores Kelly’s comments have caused great hurt to former officers, their families and friends. Police officers didn’t wake up hoping to hurt someone, but every terrorist did, and it was police officers who were targeted simply because they were trying to protect society and save lives”.Mr Nesbitt added: “Nobody disputes that the RUC could have done with more Catholic officers within its ranks.“I have no doubt that many more would have come forward had it not been for the fact that the IRA made a special effort to target those Catholics who did join the RUC”.Mike NesbittPSNI  \"       \"  Most PopularMike Nesbitt joins calls for apology over MLA’s ‘sectarian’ RUC commentsRoad repairs branded ‘diabolical’Man and woman arrested after woman seriously injured in CraigavonMP Carla Lockhart backs new law to ban illegal ‘puppy farming’ in NIJake Bailey-Sloan: Tributes to young Portadown businessman ‘one of the kindest souls you could ever meet’Most PopularBuilding firms from across NI offer jobs after JMC Mechanical and Construction Ltd, goes into liquidationPSNI spend  minutes ‘holding’ person sitting on Bann River Bridge in PortadownArtists, young and older, exhibiting at Portadown’s Millennium CourtNigel Dawson appointed District Master of Portadown LOL NoHalloween hooligans’ rampage in Lurgan ‘terried’ residents                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since News\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisCoronavirusSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessPublic NoticesFree Happy AdsFollow us      "},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1632989885154.jpg--top_tips_for_safe_student_accommodation.jpg?163298989300","title":"top tips for safe student accommodation ","story":"With freshers week around the corner and thousands of young people in Northern Ireland set to start University or new career paths, many will be on the hunt for rented accommodation. Northern Ireland has experienced a .% increase in average rental values this year[]. With the price increase, OFTEC, representing the liquid fuel industry in Ireland, is concerned that students may take cheaper accommodation options without properly inspecting the property. With this in mind, OFTEC has issued advise to help students ensure their accommodation is safe before they sign the dotted line. Raise the alarm – Currently, it is not a mandatory requirement for private landlords to provide smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, but the HSENI recommend that they do. It is a legal requirement to fit a carbon monoxide detector when a fossil fuel appliance has been replaced. Carbon monoxide is potentially lethal as it has no smell, taste or colour. Without a working alarm, it is impossible to identy carbon monoxide leaks. OFTEC’s advise is to ensure that there are working fire and CO alarms in the property, and that they are tested on a regular basis.Heating requirements - The Health  Safety Executive recommend that all boilers should be serviced annually and tenants should ask for evidence of recent servicing. If you have concerns, ask for a CD  Landlord Oil Installation Check which is carried out by an OFTEC registered technician and will give you peace of mind. For a gas heated property, ask for a copy of the annual gas safety check.Look for damp – It is easy to hide damp patches with a coat of paint, soyour house smells musty or you see evidence of mould, find out how the landlord is planning to fix the problem. Mould has no place in the home as it can cause respiratory problems and headaches.Furniture and fittings – Ask the landlord for a list of everything that is included and make note of any damage that is there before you move it. Check any beds, sofas and chairs are in good condition.Secure your home – burglars may target student areas because of lax security. Ask your landlord to fit key operating locks on the windows and lever deadlocks on external doors.  OFTEC Ireland Manager, David Blevings, said: “Quite often the excitement of moving in with friends can overshadow the concerns about the accommodation itself. We are urging students to play it safe this year and carry out these essential checks before signing a lease and moving in. “Asking a landlord about safety may seem awkward, but it could prevent you from living in a potentially dangerous property for the next  months. It’s vital that your new home is not a burden as you start your time at university.
