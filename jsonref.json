Bush.In the United States, more rural areas tend to favor the Republican Party while more urban, erse areas typically favor the Democratic Party.When are the 2018 midterm elections?The 2018 midterm elections will be held on Tuesday, November 6.          The election will soon have a major impact on political issues like taxes, immigration and moreSenateThe Republicans currently hold a narrow 51 seat majority in the Senate and are facing strong headwinds, though have one clear advantage: the Democrats will be on the defensive. The Democratic Party is currently defending 26 seats while the Republican Party is only defending nine, possibly giving them an edge going into the election.The Senate will see a number of key elections to watch closely as the 2018 midterms draw near.One key race is in Arizona for the seat held by the late Senator John McCain, which is currently being targeted by the Democrats for a potential pickup. Republican candidate Martha McSally is thought to face a tough challenge from Democratic candidate Kyrsten Sinema.The state’s shifting demographics, notably its large and growing Latino population, and isions between traditional Republicans like McCain and pro-Trump populists have threatened to weaken the Republicans’ long-held grip on the state.Other key Senate races to keep an eye on include a surprisingly competitive race between sitting Texas Senator Ted Cruz and Democratic challenger Beto O’Rourke, who only narrowly trails Cruz according to most polls in the traditionally-Republican state.In Nevada, Democrat Jacky Rosen and Republican Dean Heller are locked in a tight race, as are Republican Josh Hawley and Democrat Claire McCaskill in Missouri and Democrat Phil Bredesen and Republican Marsha Blackburn in Tennessee, another traditionally-Republican state.In Florida, one of the most famous bellwether states in the U.S., the race between Democrat Bill Nelson and Rick Scott is also extremely competitive.House of RepresentativesThough the Republicans currently control the House of Representatives, the Democrats are seen as having a strong chance to retake the congressional chamber, needing 24 seats to gain majority control of it.Republicans currently hold 240 seats compared to 195 for the Democrats.However, over the past 50 years, the Democrats have only gained more than 24 seats twice: in 1974, in the wake of the infamous Watergate scandal, and in 2006, when opposition to former President George W. Bush over the Iraq War reached a fever pitch.Fortunately for the Democrats, a record 39 sitting Republicans in the House of Representatives have opted to not seek reelection, giving them a chance to pick up seats in many states, including longtime swing states like Pennsylvania and Florida.A key race to watch closely is in Pennsylvania’s 17th district, where Democrat Conor Lamb stunned observers to win a special election in March 2018 for a seat that had been held by Republicans from 2003 to 2017 and was considered to be in Trump-friendly territory.Lamb will now be facing off against Republican Keith Rothfus after court-ordered redistricting in a new district that’s thought to be considerably friendlier to the Democrats.          Democrat Beto O\u0027Rourke is putting up a very strong challenge against Texas Senator Ted Cruz GovernorsKey races are also slated to get underway at the gubernatorial level as Democrats and Republicans face off in key swing states like Florida, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Colorado.Republicans currently hold 33 governorships, although the Democrats are looking to build on their anticipated momentum and make gains at the state level as well as in Congress.A key race to watch is in Florida, as Democrat Andrew Gillum, fresh off an upset victory in the primaries, is looking to become the first African-American to become governors of the state. The outspoken progressive and Tallahassee mayor will face off against Republican Representative Ron DeSantis, a vocal proponent of Donald Trump’s policies.Other notable races to watch closely include competitive elections in Georgia, where Democrat Stacy Abrams is looking to become the first African-American woman to win a gubernatorial race in the U.S. as she faces off against Republican Brian Kemp and in the swing state of Iowa, where Republican Kim Reynolds is locked in a tight battle with Democrat Fred Hubbell.2018 midterm election predictionsThough the 2018 midterm election is still several weeks away, both historical and current trends have helped pollsters and election prognosticators draw up what they believe is a likely scenario for the outcome of the election.Given the fact that the sitting President’s party generally loses seats in midterm elections and President Donald Trump is hobbled by fairly low approval ratings, many election forecasters believe that the upcoming election will produce strong results for the Democrats and favor them taking at least one house of Congress, both of which are currently controlled by the Republicans.According to FiveThirtyEight, the Senate has a more than 67 percent chance to remain in Republican hands as of September 17. This is largely due to the fact that the Democrats have to defend a much wider range of seats during the election, including ones in states won by Trump in the 2016 election.Having to defend so many seats could blunt the ‘blue wave’ that many election forecasters have predicted for the Democrats and possibly leave the Senate in Republican control, though many races are thought to be especially competitive and could easily swing one way or another.The Democrats are thought to have much better odds in the House of Representatives, where FiveThirtyEight is forecasting the Democrats’ chances of retaking the chamber of more than 82 percent as of September 17.Although the Republicans currently have a solid majority of 240 seats, the Democrats have a clear historical advantage and are also buoyed by strong and persistent opposition to Trump, meaning that their odds of retaking the chamber are considerably higher than in the Senate.Playing For Keeps: All you need to know about the new Network Ten TV seriesPrince George\u0027s latest obsession revealed by father Prince WilliamNational lottery numbers: Results for Wednesday September 19Julie Chen\u0027s net worth revealed as Les Moonves\u0027s wife confirms she\u0027s staying on as Big Brother hostAmerica\u0027s Got Talent 2018 winner: Who is expected to take home the grand prize?International Talk Like a Pirate Day 2018: All you need to knowWho is Orla Kiely?

Two ladies on the ground floor were fairly tidy in comparison.\u0027We had to clear all the junk that had been left so we could see the wood from the trees. Then we stripped it back to the bare walls and plasterboard, and removed some old lime plaster that was falling from the ceiling.\u0027           The rubbish-strewn property had not been renovated in up to 30 years, had damp, and housed a drug den on the top floor but is now worth an estimated 3.5million           The house includes a long, open-plan ground floor which, like the rest of the property, has stylish walnut floors.

They are kind of pro whatever is authentic to you. \u0027And I like that. Because it\u0027s authentic for me to be pro-Christian, pro-Jesus. That\u0027s my thing. I like it. \u0027And I\u0027ve never had anyone try to shame me, to my face. Maybe they go say it behind my back. But if that\u0027s the case, go ahead. You can say whatever you want about me - to my face or behind my back. I\u0027m not going to change.\u0027Aside from his Christianity, Pratt said that exercise way a major motivator in his life.     The couple that exercise together: Chris Pratt, 39, and girlfriend  Katherine Schwarzenegger, 28, were spotted out for a walk on a sunny Saturday in Los Angeles           Old love: Chris with his wife of eight years, actress Anna Faris, and their son Jack, six , at his Hollywood star ceremony in 2017. They filed for orce last DecemberThe interview with The Associated Press, took place after Michelob Ultra, which Pratt is a spokesman for, announced it was sponsoring seven athletes with disabilities, part of the nonprofit group Achilles International, to run in the New York City Marathon. \u0027It\u0027s hard enough to do a marathon or to do a triathlon. But to do it when you have physical limitations and disabilities, it\u0027s pretty awe-inspiring,\u0027 he said, adding that fitness is \u0027a great common denominator.\u0027The 39-year-old actor, who enjoys biking, running and ocean swimming when at his farm in the San Juan Islands off the coast of Washington state, says that he feels he was \u0027genetically made for... moving refrigerators or something.\u0027\u0027But now I\u0027m doing a job that really isn\u0027t that physically demanding. So having something that I can just shut my mind off and do physically every day is good for me.\u0027The Jurassic World actor added that he is a little self-conscious about his running skills, after breaking his leg as a child left one of his legs crooked, and so he was in awe of actors like Tom Cruise who could sprint flawlessly on screen and did their own stunts.\u0027When I run, I run a little crooked. And if I run at top speed, there\u0027s a high likelihood I will fall down,\u0027 he said.\u0027Tom Cruise. \u0027Mission: Impossible\u0027 - he ran across London, across bridges, over buildings. Yeah, Tom is a great runner. He did all his own jumping, he was flying the helicopter, he really was like - oh, if there\u0027s a question of whether or not I\u0027m the best at this, let me put that question to bed. He\u0027s the best.\u0027But it was Cruise\u0027s reputation that Pratt said he most admired.          The 39-year-old actor, who enjoys biking, running and ocean swimming when at his farm in the San Juan Islands off the coast of Washington state          Pratt has erected crosses on his land \u0027One of the career goals that I have based on Tom Cruise is his reputation as being a really nice, positive guy who works hard. I\u0027ve never actually met him, but I would like - if you\u0027re going to leave a legacy, it\u0027d be nice to have it be that people thought you were nice and easy to work with and you worked hard. I think that\u0027s pretty cool.\u0027Prat split from his wife Anna Faris last year, but has found love again in Katherine Schwarzenegger, 28.They came out as a couple in June and have been spotted enjoying a sunny Saturday day in Los Angeles last weekend.Proving that couple that exercises together stays together, they enjoyed a walk. At one point the beautiful 28-year-old daughter of Arnold Schwarzenegger and his ex-wife Maria Shriver reached out to lovingly stroke her beau\u0027s arm. Chris and Katherine are reportedly serious, a source dished to People, even though they\u0027ve only been together a few months \u0027They\u0027re both serious about the relationship and hopeful for the future,\u0027 the source revealed. \u0027Chris doesn\u0027t just date to date, and neither does Katherine.

Karan\u0027s mother, Rina Cheema, with family outside St Pancras Coroner\u0027s Court in London today          Karan, pictured with his father Amarjeet Cheema, died in hospital ten days after the incidentMr Oppatt said: \u0027I went to the vehicle and called the communications centre and informed them that our patient was in cardiac and respiratory arrest.\u0027And that I required the assistance of an advanced paramedic and additional crews at the job.\u0027 He then returned to help his colleague and said: \u0027I was in the process of drawing up inter-muscular adrenaline when I was informed by my colleague that Karan had stopped breathing.\u0027The pair began to perform CPR on Karan, gave him adrenaline and Mr Oppatt used a defibrillator while they waited for back up to arrive.He said: \u0027From there I turned around and took his shirt off and placed the defibrillator pads on his chest.\u0027After this he began compressions. When additional crews arrived, Karan was taken on a stretcher to the ambulance and was unconscious throughout.He died with his parents by his hospital bed in Great Ormond Street Hospital ten days later on July 9.  Karan was severely allergic to wheat, gluten, all dairy products, eggs and all nuts and eggsAnother boy, also 13 at the time, was later arrested on suspicion of attempted murder but has not been charged.Detective Sergeant Christian Rodgers while going through a list of potential witnesses with the coroner ahead of the full inquest said: \u0027The person involved is no longer at the school.\u0027Outside court he said: \u0027It was pupil on pupil.\u0027 Karan\u0027s mother Rina Cheema, a qualified accountant, his two brothers and sister were at court today.Earlier it was reported the 13-year-old Manchester City fan even had his own fridge and microwave at the home he shared with his mother and grandfather. Speaking outside St Pancras Coroners Court where part of Karan\u0027s inquest was held, Rina Cheema, 52, said: \u0027I am devastated as a mother after losing my son and my family have lost their brother.\u0027He was a very, very bright young boy. He was so bright he could have been anything he wanted. I brought him up by myself. I trained him to read all about his condition. We want answers.\u0027  Karan attended William Perkin Church of England High School in Greenford, West LondonA family member, who did not wish to be named, said: \u0027I\u0027ve never met anyone like him in my life. He would have done anything for anyone. He could have been anything.\u0027He loved taking things apart and putting them back together, he loved music. He would have done something out of this world, he was an extraordinary child.\u0027He was extremely bright - he knew very well how to manage his condition. He wanted to be a barrister but then changed his mind when he saw the size of the books.\u0027Ms Cheema plans to highlight awareness around anaphylactic shock following the tragic death of her son."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/19/09/14BD894100000514-6184027-image-a-8_1537346917454.jpg","title":"Brave dog Tay Tay lost legs traffic accident","story":"    Survivor: Tay-Tay the dog lost his hind legs and part of his lower body in a traffic accident four years agoVideo footage shows the dog making his way around the shelter using his two remaining legs. Tay-Tay has been living in the shelter for the last four years and the owner says she has not put him up for adoption as he \u0027seems happy\u0027 there.Four-year-old girl is gang-raped by pupils in school toilets...Thai police show off seizures of meth, heroin, marijuanaTiny Pomeranian pooch goes loco over a coconut as she growls...Share this articleTay-Tay recently earned himself a royal supporter, after an animal charity called Watchdog Thailand posted a photo of him on social media.King Maha Vajiralongkorn, also styled Rama X of Thailand, saw the photo and became Tay-Tay\u0027s patron.

Two ladies on the ground floor were fairly tidy in comparison.\u0027We had to clear all the junk that had been left so we could see the wood from the trees. Then we stripped it back to the bare walls and plasterboard, and removed some old lime plaster that was falling from the ceiling.\u0027           The rubbish-strewn property had not been renovated in up to 30 years, had damp, and housed a drug den on the top floor but is now worth an estimated 3.5million           The house includes a long, open-plan ground floor which, like the rest of the property, has stylish walnut floors.

Orla Kiely, pictured in 2014, said she started the company while she was caring for her newborn son, RobertThe designer has collaborated with Heal\u0027s, the Tate and Harrods and her fashion brand has become a favourite among royals.  Kate Middleton has been seen wearing the label\u0027s dresses on several occasions, for example in February this year when she wore a floral outfit to London\u0027s National Portrait Gallery. Her sister Pippa has also used the brand, wearing a Kiely cardigan when she watched tennis at Wimbledon with her brother, while Carole Middleton wore a blue printer Orla Kiely dress when she went to visit the newborn Prince George in 2013. Ms Kiely and her husband Dermott Rowan, 60, who started the business from a first-floor flat in London, remained its directors.      The company, which Irish designer Orla Kiely founded with her husband Dermott, was known for its colourful floral pieces (pictures posed by models)             A selection of Orla Kiely-designed items including handbags and cushions seen in London     Radios and garden chairs were among the items to feature an Orla Kiely floral designMr Rowan helped to run the financial side of the business while Ms Kiely focused on designing, she said. She would look over the designs herself with her handwritten word \u0027approved\u0027 written on numerous drawings at a recent exhibition.Describing her personal style she said that \u0027colour and pattern are at the heart of everything\u0027. After taking a degree in print for fashion, she took an MA in knitwear at the Royal College of Art and later worked as a consultant with Marks \u0026amp Spencer In 2010, she featured on an Irish postage stamp, and in 2011 she was awarded an OBE.

The flower-like graphic she created in the Nineties became the company logo and featured on almost every product she made — most iconically on the line of laminated handbags which propelled her to fame.Her prints and patterns also made their way onto womenswear, with the Orla Kiely clothing line worn by everyone from Alexa Chung to Kirsten Dunst, but particularly championed by the royals.  Although Orla Kiely\u0027s prints are a royal favourite (pictured left Carole Middleton and right Kate Middleton) they had become \u0027licensed too widely\u0027 meaning the graphic prints were on everything from £300 dresses to £2 hand towelsIn fact, her prints became so reconisable that she was recently celebrated in an exhibition at the Fashion and Textiles Museum in London.But this signature also was her undoing.You know the feeling of turning up to a party and someone\u0027s wearing the same dress as you? For a while you didn\u0027t need to be at a party to find an Orla Kiely print — you\u0027d match your friend\u0027s kettle, or the car in their driveway. Because Orla licensed her print too far and it started to appear on everything - from £30 blinds to £7.49 coasters to £2 hand towels. Those graphic prints were everywhere on everything, and women simple didn\u0027t want the same print on their biscuit tins and their blouse - it appeared on the back of buses and even a Citroen DS3.

I’m not sure how true it is, but I think that regardless of whether he did do it or not, it’s one of those albums that mixes very traditional Caribbean approaches to music and jazz.Saxophone player Cedric “Im” Brooks features really prominently throughout the album, and hearing him play, it’s like Rastafari devotional music but with jazz improvisation and spoken word on it. There’s a lot of historical chanting, talking about aspects of history like Jamaican colonisation and the independence movement. And it was the first time I’d heard an album that had all of these things: traditional aspect as the basis of it, the nyabinghi rhythm, the very advanced jazz soloing in the midst of all this, and spoken word that reminds you of Gil Scott-Heron.Even before I started Sons of Kemet, I was listening to it constantly. It wasn’t that I wanted to replicate the music specifically, but to replicate the atmosphere of the music, not as a commodity but almost for a devotional purpose. I was influenced by the atmosphere of it – I want to make something as epic as this sounds, in the same spirit. When I’m writing for Sons of Kemet, I want to write music that is in some way connected to the past, but is in some way looking forward.Shortlisted Hyundai Mercury Prize album: A Fever DreamAlbum that inspired me: The White Album (1968) by the BeatlesPicking The White Album by the Beatles is not very original, but it’s a big fat classic. This album has a sense of amazing creativity. I remember reading that Paul McCartney said that when they wrote together, they never had a bad session. And that sounds amazing – as a songwriter, that never happens!You can tell the whole record is festering with ideas. It’s insane, you can hear the fact that they’re writing continuously, it’s just pouring out of them, and that is so inspiring. On Helter Skelter, they accidentally invent heavy metal – it’s like, here’s heavy metal for you, bye! And every song seems to be written for a different set of instruments, like they’re so full of ideas and creativity that they just pick up anything, do something amazing with it, chuck it away and pick up the next thing. I love that. My parents introduced me to the Beatles, and I think it was appealing because, as a child, there are so many moments that are quite scary, actually. There’s Revolution 9 on there, which, if you’re a child, is really disturbing with those disembodied voices and strange sounds. It sounds like people are in trouble. Even something like Helter Skelter or While My Guitar Gently Weeps, there’s a strange sadness and darkness to it. In Rocky Raccoon, someone gets shot and in Bungalow Bill, he shoots an elephant right between the eyes. It’s scary. There are obviously moments of beauty, of silliness, of joy and so many emotions, but that feeling of “the world is a scary place full of unknown things” really comes to life on this record. As I get older, my ears change and I can appreciate why it was so affecting, and it makes me think about my own music and how I can steal their atmosphere. It’s very influential.Shortlisted Hyundai Mercury Prize album: Novelist GuyAlbum that inspired me: Boy in Da Corner (2003) by Dizzee RascalBoy in Da Corner inspired me to make my last album. I can’t remember the exact first time I heard it, but I remember how I felt. The beats didn’t sound like anything else. They put that album under the umbrella of grime but I still don’t think it sounds like the other beats that you’d affiliate with that music. It really stood out to me. I thought: I want to make something on that level.It was one of those albums that was everywhere. You’d hear the songs on the radio – I used to listen to pirate radio when I was young and sometimes I might hear Dizzee Rascal’s bars. It wasn’t so much the lyrics or the things he’d talk about – I didn’t really care about that when I was younger – but the beats.When I was making my last album, it was a big influence. It wasn’t necessarily that I wanted to replicate the sound, but I wanted to actually be that fresh. I wanted to make something new, completely new. That was my main thing. When I was producing my album, I was thinking: how can I make something that doesn’t sound like anything else? If I’m making an album, I don’t listen to any other music. I’ve taken in so much music in my life already that I just want to let whatever is seeping out of my pores come out.I’ve never met Dizzee Rascal in person but I have messaged him in the past to tell him: “I respect you man, and big up.” He was cool about it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9cf00e56fd504a3665add2da587d9b975c4119e6/0_0_3764_2259/master/3764.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1b781d9b64c850f5e2b54bab91a1dbfe","title":"quiz how well do you know the hyundai mercury prize","story":" Only one artist has won the prize twice, while one has been shortlisted six times and never won.

Here are 10 of the most mind-meltingly, brain-bogglingly, heart-stoppingly creative records to have ever been nominatedPrimal Scream (1991) For the two albums that came before Screamadelica, Primal Scream were just another fey and jangly Scottish indie band. Enter DJ and producer Andrew Weatherall, who harnessed Bobby Gillespie and co’s interest in London’s buzzing late-80s acid house scene and helped turn it into a euphoric, hedonistic and era-defining record. Loaded is the hit, Slip Inside This House the inspired cover version and Don’t Fight It, Feel It the definitive instruction on how to do ecstasy-inspired raving properly.Spice Girls (1996)A short list of people who grew up listening to the Spice Girls: Little Mix, Charli XCX, Katy Perry, Adele. And Spice was the wildly enthusiastic in-yer-face dance-pop record that – thanks to enormohits Wannabe, Say You’ll Be There and Who Do You Think You Are – launched Ginger, Posh, Scary, Sporty, Baby and the “girl power” slogan into the mainstream quicker than you could say “zig-a-zig-ah”.Massive Attack (1998) Deep, dark, doomy and graceful, Mezzanine is trip-hop’s crowning glory. Teardrop is the most famous track, but Inertia Creeps, Risingson and Angel are just as harrowingly atmospheric. Made at a time when the mood within the Bristol band was terse, Massive Attack’s third album pongs of alienation, isolation and fear, and the trio became a duo shortly after the release when Andrew Vowles, aka Mushroom, jumped ship (or was pushed off).The Streets (2002) On which 23-year-old Birmingham boy Mike Skinner takes the sound of two-step UK garage and decorates it with often funny, frequently poignant and always relatable raps about, as he puts it on Has It Come to This?, a “day in the life of a geezer”. Booze, drugs, clubs, pubs, PlayStations, heartbreak, the quantity of fried tomato a fry-up requires – it’s all on there, still sounding fresh. Put on your classics and have a little dance. Dizzee Rascal (2003)Until the release of Skepta’s Konnichiwa in 2016, Dizzee Rascal’s Boy in Da Corner was the grime album. Released when the genre was still relatively young, it’s a frighteningly raw and angry take on the realities of growing up as a working-class kid in east London. Looking at the artist Dizzee has become, it’s hard to remember the shy teenager who raps so furiously about knife crime (Stop Dat), underage sex (I Luv U) and everyday violence (Seems 2 Be) over ice-cold beats that reflect the hopelessness of his situation. But he’s there, and he’s a genius.MIA (2005) There’s a lot to get your head round on the debut album from the London via Sri Lanka rapper. The title: MIA’s dad’s codename when he was in the Tamil Tiger militant group, given to the record in the hope he would one day Google himself and see what his daughter had made (he did). The sound: multicultural trans-global party music that nicks bits from all over the world, most notably hip-hop and dancehall. The lyrics: explorations of politics, culture, food, sex, war and revolution. Truly invigorating.The xx (2009)Listen to this debut album now, and you might think you’ve heard it all before. But none of London Grammar, Banks, Alt-J, Lorde or James Blake sounded like that before xx. Really, the only band that sounded remotely like the xx before the xx were late-70s Welsh post-punks Young Marble Giants. But the genius of the London band’s update on YMG’s minimal guitar sound is the use of cutting-edge production to create 11 spooky mini-epics that tell late-night tales of love, lust and longing.PJ Harvey (2011)From the moment she announced Let England Shake on the Andrew Marr Show in April 2010, telling the presenter: “My biggest fear would be to replicate something I’ve done before”, you knew Polly Jean Harvey’s eighth album would be special. Suspicions were confirmed when, 10 months later, an ambitious portrayal of the horrors of world war one and its aftermath appeared, featuring lyrics about soldiers falling “like lumps of meat” (The Words That Maketh Murder) and a country whose “fruit is deformed children” (The Glorious Land) in songs that took in folk, rock and pop, mostly made with guitars but with dashes of harp and sax in there too. PJ wasn’t done there though, and asked war photographer Seamus Murphy to make a video for every track to complete a fantastically creative vision.FKA Twigs (2014)Four years since Tahlia Barnett released her debut album, there’s still nothing quite like it. In a way it’s doomy alt-R\u0026ampB but just like, say, Bjork in her pomp, there are so many risks, ideas and moods on LP1 it would be unfair to label it. There are sad songs (Pendulum), sexy songs (Two Weeks), romantic songs (Hours) and vulnerable songs (Closer), a mega list of producers (Clams Casino, Sampha, Twigs herself and more) and a whole load of vocal experimentation. Yet it comes together because FKA Twigs, alien pop star extraordinaire, is right at the heart of all of it.J Hus (2017) The way J Hus’s debut brings together grime, garage, bashment, dancehall, afrobeat and early 00s hip-hop is as exciting as British music gets. Tunes like Bouff Daddy, Did You See and the title track are carnivals of ideas, and the east Londoner is comfortable rapping sensitively, playfully or aggressively over any style he’s given. The focus, though, is always on his extraordinary life that’s featured a multiple stabbing. It’s the unique sound of modern multicultural London."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee9512d026a2e0b123ac243ca373c965ddf3c218/0_84_4240_2544/master/4240.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7c1de4d73ccdc6d2810e72b271b3c81e","title":"my thoughts exactly lily allen review","story":"No detail is deemed too personal in the singer’s affecting account of her rise to fame and being constantly under scrutinyAnyone familiar with Lily Allen’s songs will know all\u0026nbspabout her capacity for bluntness. In 2009’s “Not Fair” she grumbled about rubbish sex and being left lying in the wet patch, while in “As Long As I Got You”, an ode to new love, she sang: “Staying in with you is\u0026nbspbetter than sticking things up my nose.” So it’s not surprising to find that her first\u0026nbspmemoir has a tendency towards oversharing. In\u0026nbsprecalling her childhood, her rise to fame and her travails as a pop star, daughter, wife and mother, no detail is deemed too personal.In the introduction, Allen, 33, says she’s too young to write her entire life story instead she’s interested in “the things in my life that changed events, upended things, upset the cart”. Her father, the actor Keith Allen, is the first to turn things upside down, leaving his wife and children when his daughter was four. On the rare weekends that he saw his children, he would plonk them in a room at the Groucho Club while he got smashed in the bar downstairs. “I’ve learned over the years that everything is about him, so fine, that’s the deal,” Allen says. “I’ve stopped trying to fight or bustle about trying to find a spare slot in his universe.”Her mother, the film producer Alison Owen, began a relationship with Harry Enfield, which brought a period of stability. But Owen went on frequent work trips abroad, where she partied and took drugs. Soon she was doing the same at home. After five years Enfield ran out of patience, and Owen and her children moved out. The result was to create longstanding abandonment issues in Allen, along with what she calls a “raging co-dependency” – a desire to be loved and looked after, whatever the cost.If she is tough on the failings of those close to her, she is brutal when it comes to herself. She attends nine schools – some state, some private – eventually leaving at 15 with no qualifications. She drinks, takes drugs and has lots of sex, sometimes with men she likes but often with those she doesn’t. When she isn’t the life and soul of the party, she has tantrums and meltdowns and, at one stage, a breakdown. She endures untold trauma, from the stillbirth of her son\u0026nbspGeorge, to an attempted rape by a man she calls “Record Industry Executive”, to a stalker breaking into her home in the middle of the night. There are intermittent moments of joy, but more often there is sadness, shame, self-loathing and fury, all of which makes for compelling but discomfiting reading.The book serves as a cautionary tale for young women thrust into the limelight before they have fully understood who they are. You would struggle to find a more lucid and heartfelt account of how constant press attention – which, in Allen’s case, involved waking up to find 30 photographers watching the front door – can warp one’s sense of reality. She talks about the disconnect between her loudmouth public persona, whom she calls “Cartoon Lily”, and the quieter, insecure person at home, and how, when you read enough about your car crash life, it becomes self-fulfilling. She reveals the shock of old lovers selling their stories, the creeping paranoia that comes with anonymous sources leaking details of your private life, and the daily abuse from online trolls. It’s with palpable rage that she recalls her bulimia that was, she says, “a direct result of having my body constantly scrutinised. I’d sit in restaurants and as soon as I had finished eating, I’d be, like, ‘Fuck, how soon can I get to the loo?’”Elsewhere, Allen insists that her background as the\u0026nbspdaughter of well-known, comfortably off working-class parents makes her neither posh nor privileged. It’s the only moment in the book when her characteristic self-awareness deserts her. “Sure, I\u0026nbsphad media connections through my parents and an entrée into the Groucho fucking Club, but I\u0026nbspmanaged to get a career in spite of that and my education – not because of them,” she says, misunderstanding how privilege works.This isn’t to say that Allen hasn’t worked hard, or that her achievements haven’t sprung from a rare talent. In\u0026nbspher songs, she funnels dark themes into bracingly acerbic couplets and sets them against a jaunty soundtrack. In this visceral and affecting memoir, she seizes the opportunity to fill\u0026nbspin the gaps and create a\u0026nbspthree-dimensional self-portrait that is far removed from Cartoon Lily. “Telling stories is important, especially if you are a woman,” she says. “When women share their stories, loudly and clearly and honestly, things begin to change – for the better. This is my story.”• My Thoughts Exactly is published by Blink. To order a copy for £17.20 (RRP £20) go to bookshop or call 0330 333 6846. Free UK p\u0026ampp over £10, online orders only.

The first section elaborates what the authors call the “Great Untruths” that supposedly dominate college campuses: What Doesn’t Kill You Makes You Weaker Always Trust Your Feelings Life Is a Battle Between Good People and Evil People. Their targets are “safetyism”, the language of microaggressions, identity politics and intersectionality. Generation “iGen”, the one that comes after millennials, is, according to the authors, suffering a mental health crisis because of smartphone addiction and the paranoid parenting style of the upper middle class.Their title echoes The Closing of the American Mind, Allan Bloom’s 1987 bestselling attack on the “relativism” that he said threatened the achievements of western civilisation. As if paying homage to Bloom’s love of classics, the new book opens with a pilgrimage to Misoponos, a Greek oracle who serves Koalemos, preaching the three great untruths. This excursion turns out to be a bit of mischief (misoponos means “lazy”, and Koalemos is an obscure god of stupidity). “We didn’t really travel to Greece to discover these three terrible ideas,” the authors reveal. “We didn’t have to.” They did not write this book because of an oracle they wrote it, perhaps, because an article that they published in the Atlantic went viral.The bait and switch might seem like a strange way to begin fighting dogma on behalf of facts. But the “tenured radical” is a long-standing enemy in the culture war industry. Lukianoff and Haidt update the themes of neoconservatives such as Roger Kimball and Dinesh D’Souza, whose 1991 Illiberal Education also first appeared as an Atlantic cover story. But if they are clearly hoping to tap into the forces that made Bloom and his successors bestsellers, this is a repetition with a difference. Rather than Plato they want data. Rather than a canon, they want to preserve mental health. They say health will save democracy.The methods they teach come from cognitive behavioural therapy, which Lukianoff credits with having saved his life when he suffered from depression. He and Haidt argue that student demands for social justice are expressions of “cognitive distortions” that CBT can correct, and that the problems that young people and their parents worry about are not as grave as they think they are simply, as Steven Pinker writes, “problems of progress”. Despite the title, which suggests cultural or civilisational diagnosis, the checklists and worksheets distributed throughout this book make clear that its genre is self-help.The tips it contains may benefit upper middle class parents. They may benefit students from minority or working class backgrounds who arrive on elite campuses to find that, despite good intentions, those campuses have not fully prepared for them. But the framing leaves no room to consider how historical and social change might legitimately change institutions or iniduals, or that iniduals might want to change their world. (This framing also explains how they can write hundreds of pages about what’s wrong with contemporary higher education and not mention debt or adjuncts.) The authors cite the “folk wisdom” “Prepare the child for the road, not the road for the child”. They call this attitude “pragmatic”. The prospect that a group of children might get together to build a new road themselves is not one they can countenance.The Coddling of the American Mind is less interesting for its anecdotes or arguments, which are familiar, than as an epitome of a contemporary liberal style. That style wants above all to be reasonable. Lukianoff and Haidt include adverb after adverb to telegraph how well they have thought things through. Following the 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, where a white supremacist drove a car into a crowd of people, killing Heather Heyer, “levels of fear and anger were understandably elevated”. “Members of some identity groups surely face more frequent insults to their dignity than do straight white males.”Elaborate syntactic balancing acts even out at meaninglessness. In a passage likening recent “witch-hunts” on American campuses to atrocities perpetrated during the Chinese Cultural Revolution, Lukianoff and Haidt write: “As historical events, the two movements are radically different, most notably in that the Red Guards were responding to the call of a totalitarian dictator, who encouraged them to use violence, while the American college students have been self-organised and almost entirely nonviolent.” Those are big differences! “Yet, there are similarities, too. For instance, both were movements initiated by idealistic young college students.”The point of the style is to signal the distance between the authors and the partisans of identity who are too emotional to think clearly. The fact that Lukianoff and Haidt claim the authority to police discourse becomes clear the first time they discuss the role “overreaction from the right” has played in recent campus wars – at least halfway through the book. They quote death threats that Princeton professor Keeanga Yamahtta-Taylor received in 2017, including “lynching and having the bullet from a .44 Magnum” put in her head. “One might conclude,” Lukianoff and Haidt write, that if she and two other professors who received such threats “had spoken in a more deliberative style, befitting a professor, they would have had no trouble”. Should black female scholars really believe that the lynch mob would leave them alone if they just spoke in a more “reasonable” way?The style that does befit an expert, apparently, is the style of TED talks, thinktanks and fellow Atlantic writers and psychologists. The citations in this book draw a circle around a closed world. In offering a definition of “identity politics”, a term coined by the black socialist lesbians of the Combahee River Collective (and the subject of a recent book edited by Yamahtta-Taylor), Lukianoff and Haidt quote “Jonathan Rauch, a scholar at the Brookings Institution”. They tell their readers to read Pinker, whose fulsome blurb appears on their book jacket.The book ends with a list of recommendations for fixing young people and universities. “We think that things will improve, and may do so quite suddenly at some point in the next few years,” they conclude, suddenly cheery. Why? “As far as we can tell from private conversations, many and perhaps most university presidents reject the culture of safetyism,” even if “they find it politically difficult to say so publicly”. Based on conversations with high school and college students, the authors believe that most of them “despise call-out culture”.“Private conversations” that they cannot describe seem like thin evidence from a social scientist and a lawyer whose motto is “Carpe datum!” A few chapters earlier, they bewail the ethos of “customer service” that has led universities to coddle students, but here they are confident that “if a small group of universities is able to develop a different sort of academic culture … market forces will take care of the rest”.Who will fix the crisis? The people who are already in charge. How? Simply by being open about what they already secretly believe. The rhetorical appeal, here, shares a structure with the appeal that carried the enemy in chief of political correctness to the White House: “That’s just common sense.”Lukianoff and Haidt go out of their way to reassure us: “Neither of us has ever voted for a Republican for Congress or the presidency.” Like Mark Lilla, Pinker and Francis Fukuyama, who have all condemned identity politics in recent books, they are careful to distinguish themselves from the unwashed masses – those who also hate identity politics and supposedly brought us Donald Trump. In fact, the data shows that it was precisely the better-off people in poor places, perhaps not so unlike these famous professors in the struggling academy, who elected Trump but never mind. I believe that these pundits, like the white suburban Dad in the horror film Get Out, would have voted for Barack Obama a third time.Still, they may protest too much. In the midst of what Fukuyama, citing his colleague Larry Diamond, calls a “democratic recession”, the consensus that has ruled liberal institutions for the past two decades is cracking up. The media has made much of the leftward surge lifting Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. But as this new left-liberalism gains strength, a growing number of white men who hold power in historically liberal institutions seem to be breaking right.As more and more Americans, especially young Americans, express enthusiasm for democratic socialism, a new right-liberalism answers. Its emerging canon first defined itself in reaction to new social movements highlighting the structural or systemic elements of identity-based oppression. By deriding those movements as “clicktivism” or mere “hashtags”, right-liberal pundits also, implicitly, expressed frustration at how web platforms were breaking up their monopoly on discourse. In January 2015, weeks after a wave of massive Black Lives Matter protests, Jonathan Chait decried Twitter as the launch pad of a “new pc movement”. In the conclusion of The Once and Future Liberal, Lilla also singled out Black Lives Matter for special condemnation, calling it “a textbook example of how not to build solidarity”. Andrew Sullivan has criticised “the excesses of #MeToo”. Just last week, Harper’s and the New York Review of Books published long personal essays in which men accused of serial sexual harassment and assault defended themselves and described their sense of persecution by online “mobs”.Lukianoff and Haidt share some benefactors and allies with the well-established right that funded Bloom and D’Souza. (Lukianoff works at the Foundation for Inidual Rights in Education, a nonprofit group funded by the Scaife and Olin families.) But, reading The Coddling of the American Mind, I was more struck by their points of proximity to the newer Trumpist right. Like Trump, the authors romanticise a past before “identity” but get impatient when actual history itself comes up. “Most of these schools once excluded women and people of colour,” they reflect. “But does that mean that women and people of colour should think of themselves as ‘colonised populations’ today?” You could approach this question by looking at data on racialised inequality in the US, access to universities, or gendered violence. They don’t. Seize the data evidently means not all data. They leave it as a rhetorical question for “common sense” to answer.Their refusal of history severely limits the explanations Lukianoff and Haidt can offer for the real problems they identify. Can you understand the “paranoia” middle-class parents have about college admissions without considering how many of their children are now downwardly mobile? How are college teachers supposed to confidently court controversy when so many of them have zero security in jobs that barely keep them above poverty level?Just as they lack a clear explanation of why the “terrible ideas” that are “harming students” have taken hold, they have no theory of how good ideas cause change. At one point, they note that Pauli Murray, one of their exemplars of “common humanity identity politics”, recently had a college at Yale named after her, as if this proved that in an unregulated market, the right ideas do win in the end. But Yale did not just happen to remember this law school graduate, half a century later Yale named Pauli Murray College following countless student protests around Black Lives Matter – and after a cafeteria worker named Corey Menafee, who got sick of looking at pictures of happy slaves in Yale’s Calhoun College, put his broom through a stained glass window, and his union came to his defence.For all their self-conscious reasonableness, and their promises that CBT can master negative emotion, Lukianoff and Haidt often seem slightly hurt. They argue that intersectionality theory ides people into good and bad. But the scholars they quote do not use this moral language those scholars talk about privilege and power. Bad is how these men feel when someone suggests they have had it relatively easy – and that others have had to lose the game that was made for men like them to win. Their problem with “microaggressions” is this framework emphasises impact over intentions, a perspective that they dismiss as clearly ludicrous. Can’t these women and minorities see we mean well? This is the incredulity of people who have never feared being stereotyped. It can turn to indignation, fast.If there is a new right-liberal dispensation, the two-step from shame to rage about shame may be what brings it closest to the Trumpists. Hints of elective affinities between elite liberalism and the “alt-right” have been evident for a while now. The famous essay that Allum Bokhari and Milo Yiannopoulos wrote in 2016, “An Establishment Conservative’s Guide to the Alt-Right”, cites Haidt approvingly. At one point Lukianoff and Haidt rehearse a narrative about Herbert Marcuse that has been a staple of white nationalist conspiracy theories about “cultural Marxism” for decades. Nassim Taleb, whose book Antifragile Haidt and Lukianoff credit with one of their core beliefs and cite repeatedly as inspiration, is a fixture of the far right “manosphere” that gathers on Redditpol and returnofkings.The commonality raises questions about the proximity of their enthusiasm for CBT to the vogue for “Stoic” self-help in the Red Pill community, founded on the principle that it is men, rather than women, who are oppressed by society. So, too, does it raise questions about the discipline of psychology – how cognitive and data-driven turns in that field formed Haidt and his colleagues Pinker and Jordan Peterson. Lilla admits to envying the effectiveness of the “right-wing media complex”. It is hard to imagine that Haidt does not feel some such stirrings about Peterson, who is, after all, selling more copies of self-help books marketed as civilisational critique. Lukianoff and Haidt quote Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn’s The Gulag Archipelago as an epigraph and key inspiration Peterson, who frequently lectures on the book, wrote the introduction to the 50th-anniversary edition Penguin will publish in November. Predictably, Lukianoff and Haidt cite Martin Luther King as a spokesperson for “good” identity politics – the kind that focuses on common humanity rather than differences. But there was a reason the speech they quote was called “I Have a Dream” and addressed to people marching for jobs. Keeping faith with the ideal that all humans are created equal means working to create conditions under which we might, in fact, thrive equally. In the absence of this commitment to making the dream come true, insisting that everyone must act as if we are already in the promised land can feel a lot like trolling. Why are you making such a big deal about identity, Lukianoff and Haidt ask again and again, of people whose identities, fixed to their bodies by centuries of law and bureaucracy and custom make them vastly more likely to be poor or raped, or killed by the police, or deep in debt. Seize the data! But not all data.In his book, The Reactionary Mind, the political theorist Corey Robin paraphrases Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa: since Edmund Burke, effective reactionaries have been the ones who recognise that in order to stay the same, things will have to change. By contrast, the new right liberals say that things must stay the same in order to progress. America is already great.The core irony of The Coddling of the American Mind is that, by opposing identity politics, its authors try to consolidate an identity that does not have to see itself as such. Enjoying the luxury of living free from discrimination and domination, they therefore insist that the crises moving young people to action are all in their heads. Imagine thinking that racism and sexism were just bad ideas that a good debate could conquer! (As if a person did not need a minimum level of material security to participate in the kind of disinterested debate David Remnick and Steve Bannon might have enjoyed at the New Yorker festival.)As the right liberals insist that students are suffering from pathological “distortions”, a sense of unreality prevails. In their safe space of TED talks and thinktanks and think pieces, the genteel crusaders against “political correctness” create their own speech codes. As their constituency shrinks, their cant of progress starts to sound hysterical. The minds they coddle just may be their own.• The Coddling of the American Mind by Greg Lukianoff and Jonathan Haidt (Penguin, £20). To order a copy for £17.20 go to bookshop or call 0330 333 6846.

On the other hand, household goods grew strongly.”Andrew Wishart, an economist at consultancy firm Capital Economics, said: “Despite inflation ticking up in August, prolonging the squeeze on real incomes, retail sales volumes increased."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4375b7a01d66ee089d2073baeea5340b9506b999/0_36_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=59ba1e3baf35053180fd09fce6f66e83","title":"wetherspoons and mcdonalds staff to strike together","story":"Hospitality industry workers mount unprecedented action to fight ‘poverty wages’Staff at JD Wetherspoon, McDonald’s and TGI Fridays are to strike next month in an unprecedented action by employees in the hospitality sector, where a campaign to recruit new trade union members is gathering pace among workers who have traditionally not been organised.The co-ordination and scale of the action – which takes place on 4 October and includes staff from a number of McDonald’s branches in London and two branches of the pub chain on the south coast – is the first of its kind and engages often young, newly unionised workers who will be striking for £10 an hour and union recognition.Workers from The Bright Helm and The Post \u0026amp  pubs in Brighton told the  securing a wage rise would alleviate their mounting personal debts and lift them out of subsistence living.They have taken a move by Wetherspoon’s to bring forward an annual pay rise for workers from April next year to this November as a sign that the company is sufficiently worried about the possibility of the action spreading. According to the chain, the minimum starting rate for bar staff over 18 is £8.05 an hour while kitchen staff receive £8.25 an hour – increasing by 10p in each case after a probation period.Chris Heppell, a 29-year-old working in one of the pub chain’s kitchens, said that every penny counted when he and his colleagues were struggling to get by. In his own case, more than half of what he earned each month went towards paying £450 in rent to share a cramped one-bedroom apartment.“It’s impossible to save and you find yourself taking on more and more hours just to keep on top of the debt,” said the politics graduate who has worked in the hospitality sector since graduating, spending the last four years on what he described as “poverty wages” at Wetherspoon’s.“Up until recently I haven’t thought very much about the future because it is genuinely scary, but that has started to change.”Heppell is among workers at the pub chain who have joined the Bakers, Food and Allied Workers Union (BFAWU) after being inspired by the strike action taken last year by McDonald’s workers in a dispute over zero-hours contracts and conditions.Another Wetherspoon’s kitchen worker, 19-year-old student Alex McIntyre, described working for the company as the most “emotionally and physically draining” job he had undertaken after working extensively in the hospitality sector.McIntyre said over the course of a 30-hour week, he worked in a small kitchen that was often understaffed, and put more than half of his wages towards renting in shared accommodation with five others.“I have an overdraft and rarely have a full fridge. I just thought that was what student life was, but there’s a sense now that this could change. Being paid £10 an hour would mean that I literally don’t have to choose between a food shop or getting a long needed haircut – basic things that people take for granted,” he said.“Now though, I’m being asked about union membership by friends and people from my generation on social media who wouldn’t have considered it before. The cards we have been dealt mean that a lot of us have tended to keep our heads down until now.”Wetherspoon’s spokesman Eddie Gershon said that rates of pay have come under review at most pub and restaurant companies and the chain had announced on 14 September that it was increasing pay rates in the last financial year (to July 2018) by £20m and would be increasing rates this year by £27m.“We also decided several months ago that management will work a 40-hour week instead of the current 42.5 hours from April 2019. We are also moving to the same rate for 18-21s as we already have for over 21s from 5 November 2018,” he said.TGI Fridays, which was named and shamed earlier this year by the government for failing to pay workers the legal minimum wage, said at the time of a walk-out in August by staff in a dispute over tips and pay that it believed all of its workers were treated and paid fairly."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a65bc9e8820710fc301989db3a35c975abc95eec/52_363_3165_1899/master/3165.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eb3f25700699fe9cdd8ba87014f1e8ac","title":"everday memories of addis ababa a photo essay","story":"Beginning as a Tumblr page, website VintageAddis invites Ethiopians to share old photographs from family archives, and aims to document the lives of communities throughout the 20th century. The web project and Instagram feed started by Philipp Schütz, Wongel Abebe and Nafkot Gebeyehu, reveals an intimate view of the city.Terefe Berlie Asmare moved to Addis Ababa in 1980 and spent much of the next decade driving. He worked at a garage in the Ethiopian capital by day, and studied engineering by night. At weekends he would roam the countryside in his father’s car, with a tent bought from the German embassy in the boot, and a Konica in his pocket.“I always took the camera with me,” he says, standing in the garden of Addis Ababa’s iconic, though fading, Wabi Shebele hotel, which is still owned by the family of Haile Selassie, Ethiopia’s last emperor. Asmare, now in his 60s, documented his road trips extensively, being one of the few people he knew with a camera – he was the lucky owner of the world’s first commercial autofocus. “There were no photographers at that time,” he recalls. “So I did most of the pictures myself, often with a self timer.”In one carefree shot he leans cockily against his Mazda car in view of Lake Langano, a spot popular with Addis Ababa’s middle classes then and now. His white socks are pulled up high and a red baseball hangs nonchalantly from his fingers. It’s a world away from the land of famine and war that foreign photojournalists etched in the popular consciousness of the 1980s.Terefe’s photos – he believes has more than 1,000 from this period – might have disappeared were it not for Vintage Addis Ababa. A website that started in July 2017 as a Tumblr page, the project Vintage Addis Ababa invites Ethiopians to share old photos from family archives as a part of an effort to document the lives of various people throughout the country’s tumultuous 20th century of empire, war and revolution.Vintage Addis Ababa is the brainchild of Philipp Schütz, a Swiss publisher and photographer based in the city, of Wongel Abebe, an Ethiopian photographer, and of Nafkot Gebeyehu, a documentary photographer. The project peels away the popular cliches to reveal a more innocent city with an intimate and familiar past.Schütz says, referring to some of the 1,800 plus photographs they have amassed so far: “They look exactly like my parents’ family archive, of the photos of my grandparents in the 1950s.” He and Abebe were surprised by the enthusiasm with which the city’s residents accepted the idea. “It was totally unexpected,” he says. “We’re not digging out 100-year-old photos. These are just everyday, family, stories from a time which a lot of people still remember.”Abebe thinks the project taps into a latent frustration with the way the Ethiopia has been represented over the years. “People are sick and tired of the famine and all that,” she says. “This is about how people want to be remembered.” Many of the photos they have received were submitted by friends and relatives wishing to commemorate their departed, or ageing, loved ones.Photographs belonging to the late Kassa Gebru, an engineer-turned-businessman who built Addis Ababa hotel in the 1950s, were given to Abebe by his daughter, who felt he deserved recognition for founding the city’s first venue for live jazz.The project also appeals to the occasional nostalgia some Ethiopians feel for their past, even for a period like the 1980s, a decade stained by bloodshed and economic privation under the communist regime known as the Derg.“I was a bachelor,” says Asmare. “I spent most of my time travelling and I really enjoyed it. In Addis there was less traffic because nobody had cars – the Derg had banned imports – and on Saturday nights there would be parties in Ras hotel, in Ghion hotel, and of course here in Wabi Shebele. When I look at the photos in my albums it’s like a dream.”“Genet’s father was very strict, like most fathers at the time. She wasn’t allowed to go out of the house besides go to school she was expected to come straight home afterwards and would be in trouble if she didn’t arrive within 30 minutes after home-time.” Girls at the time were expected to be timid and walk with their heads tucked down. They weren’t allowed to leave their house for just recreation. “One time, a few girlfriends and I took a photo as we celebrated a friend’s graduation at Addis Ababa university, as she earned her business degree. I had to hide that picture for years so my father wouldn’t see it.”Vintage Addis Ababa is part of a broader trend towards revisiting and rethinking Africa’s recent history. Schütz was inspired by a project that digitises old Ugandan photographs, though his focus was narrower and with more emphasis on family and private lives.Calling to mind the work of the late Malian photographer Malick Sidibé, and Burkina Faso’s Sory Sanlé, both of whom captured the colourful optimism of post-independence west Africa, these photos of mid-century Addis Ababa evoke a similar mood. They chart the evolution of fashion, hairstyles, and even the city’s physical environment, making Vintage Addis Ababa a rich exercise in cultural history. Some of the districts seen here have long since disappeared, or, like the old Italian quarter known as Piassa, are now on the brink of demolition.The project started out as a website aiming to reach as many Ethiopians as possible, but it is soon to be published as a book. The team also hope the idea will eventually spread to other Ethiopian cities.As it stands, Vintage Addis Ababa offers a glimpse into the past but only a fleeting one. “We don’t want to be misleading,” says Abebe, of the project’s title. “You can never represent the whole of Ethiopia in pictures.”“We learned everything, starting from shooting and marching, to office administration and finance,” she remembers. After an intensive training that took well over a year, the women were graduated by the emperor himself. The newly inaugurated women army never went to a battlefield. “We were always invited to shows and asked to make appearances at official events,” Tsehay chuckles, “We were treated more like celebrities.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b59ab1d0442a5293d5895a7564da8def3edbd8f0/0_216_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4256cdaaa63382d8961e6dd69a120c71","title":"dont walk this way why hong kong reopened a pedestrian street to cars","story":"When residents complained the noise from a pedestrianised street was causing sleeplessness and psychological distress, city authorities reopened it to cars. Was there a better way?Trying to walking through the pedestrian zone of Sai Yeung Choi Street South, walkers were always shoulder-to-shoulder, bumping into every other passing person. There was simply no way to avoid fellow pedestrians.Hong Kong’s Mong Kok area – “busy corner” in Cantonese – is a sea of people, shops and chaotic energy in the heart of the city’s most densely populated district.Within that, Sai Yeung Choi Street South was the street that never slept. After it was pedestrianised in 2000, the only islands in the sea of people were buskers, singers and dancers, all competing to drown each other out. Commonly known as “noisy street”, you could hear it long before you saw it.Complaints from residents led the government to restrict the pedestrianisation scheme to weekends and public holidays. Finally, this summer, it was scrapped entirely after more than 1,000 noise complaints motor vehicles were allowed back 24-7.With the buskers gone, vehicles are now the noisiest things on the street. The number of people seems the same, though – they’re just squashed onto the pavement to allow the cars through.“It had become a sort of poor man’s nightclub where competing performers, dancers and karaoke singers were blasting their music at 90-100 decibels,” says Carine Lai, senior researcher of Civic Exchange, an independent Hong Kong public policy thinktank. “To make things worse, there were residential buildings upstairs, so people were complaining of sleeplessness and psychological distress.”But Lai and others feel that closing the pedestrianised section of Mong Kok is not a long-term solution and does not address the root issue of street management problems in Hong Kong.“Whenever there were conflicts in the pedestrian zone in Mong Kok, the government always refused to consider alternatives or improvement measures, but simply avoided it by closing the street instead of finding better ways to manage it,” says Kathy Ip, the secretary general of Hong Kong Public Space Initiative.As cities around the world close central streets to cars to mark World Car-Free Day,  Cities is looking at the joys and trials of urban walking.The US humourist and writer David Sedaris tells us about walking in cities from Raleigh to Reykjavik. Will Self explains what he learns from perambulations in London, there’s Fran Lebowitz in New York, Helen Garner in Melbourne, “natural navigator” Tristan Gooley in Portsmouth, and writers on Delhi and Newcastle, Cairo and Wellington.Laura Laker casts a critical eye on the performance of Vision Zero, the global city scheme to eliminate traffic deaths. London has signed up – will it enjoy the success of New York, or the delays of LA? The recent blocking of Sadiq Khan’s plans to pedestrianise Oxford Street does not bode well.Correspondent Stephen Burgen samples the newfound silence in the Spanish car-free city of Pontevedra, and Matthew Keegan discovers what prompted Hong Kong to reopen a popular pedestrian street to vehicles.Renate van der Zee looks at the rise, fall and rebirth of the Lijnbaan in Rotterdam – Europe’s first pedestrianised street – while Rachel Aldred at the University of Westminster crunches the numbers to identify the most dangerous London boroughs for people on foot.Oliver Wainwright explores the City of London’s forgotten Pedways – and asks whether these 1960s walkways can make a comeback.We consider the phenomenon of “desire lines”, examine the art of following a stranger in the hope of seeing a city in a new light, and much more.Ip and other community groups believe the case of Mong Kok highlights the way Hong Kong is lagging behind major world cities in managing pedestrian areas: “We have suggested different modes of street management policy such as performance licensing and sound equipment control guidelines. The government needs to devise a holistic plan, instead of piecemeal approaches towards street management.”Paul Zimmerman, the CEO of Designing Hong Kong, a nonprofit devoted to improving urban planning in the city, describes the Mong Kok closure as “an absolute failure in walkability”. “The case has dramatically highlighted the failures in Hong Kong’s regime of street management,” he says. “These need to be resolved.”Hong Kong is renowned for its multi-layered pedestrian networks – at street level, below ground and above ground. These provide the necessary capacity in crowded high-density areas, and provide options that are especially relevant during typhoon season and throughout the city’s hot and humid summers. They also provide great connectivity to mass transit stations.“Pedestrians always come as a second thought during development,” adds Ip. “For a better living environment in Hong Kong, the needs of pedestrians should be the priority over the traffic.”Although it has been slow to come, there are some signs of change. Last year the government announced its commitment to strengthening Hong Kong’s position as a world-class walkable city.So far, projects have focused on ensuring the majority of future residences and workplaces are situated within walking distance of transportation nodes, services and other amenities, which will be connected by pedestrian-friendly or pedestrian-only walking environments such as precincts and station squares. Areas to benefit from this include the Kai Tak development area, Kwun Tong North and Hung Shui Kiu.The retrofitting of densely developed urban areas has also been a priority. A number of quick-win pedestrian improvement measures – such as footpath widening and pedestrian signals – have been installed in the Kowloon Bay and Kwun Tong business areas. The government also worked with Transport for London on a HK$3m (£293,000) project to display street signs showing maps and walking guides in the city’s bustling Tsim Sha Tsui shopping district.Pedestrianisation schemes in other parts of the city – busy neighbourhoods like Causeway Bay, Central, Jordan and Stanley – have been less controversial than Mong Kok. The temporary transformation of a 200-metre section of Des Voeux Road in Hong Kong’s Central Business District into a pedestrian precinct was also well received, with 50,000 people enjoying street soccer, a library, gym, picnic area and music.Planners like Ng believe the government should trial these types of schemes more frequently. “I don’t think the government or authorities should just close a pedestrian zone down,” says Ng. “I think our government needs to be more courageous and experimental in allowing the community to experiment with trial and error.”David Sim, a creative director of Gehl Architects, and his team have worked in China for 10 years designing pedestrian routes in cities like Beijing, Chongqing and Shanghai. “I think it’s important to experiment with this kind of urban change,” he says. “The city and its citizens need to be taken on a journey, and that might be easier if you take smaller steps. It might start with an exceptional event to give people a one-off, new experience – like a street party or sports event – then continue as a more regular but still temporary change, and as the culture and behaviour evolves, the changes can develop further and perhaps become more permanent.”Sim is quick to add that projects can be quite modest too: “Even a low cost project can make a dramatic difference to urban life. It can actually be cheap to be nice to people.”We’re eager to hear your thoughts and experiences of walking in cities.

So if we seek forgiveness for our own frailties, why should we not bestow it?At a literary festival not so long ago, I interviewed the novelist Sophie Hannah – known particularly for her twisty psychological thrillers – and the subject of grudges came up. Hannah’s forthcoming book is a non-fiction study of the power of the grudge to transform our lives, if we work out how to deal with them sensibly and effectively. To be clear, I don’t believe she is advocating tracking down the schoolmate who stole your best marble when you were seven and exacting revenge more along the lines of working out what your grievance is telling you about yourself and how best to deal with it. I nearly forgot to ask another question because I found myself marooned in the memory of a decades-old dispute over a parking space.To this end, she had given each audience member a slip of paper, on which they could fill out their most deeply held grudge and return it to her. Bookish event-goers can be a little wary of audience participation, but her request prompted a flurry of activity: ruminative looks, darkened brows and feverish scribbling.All of which frenzied fulmination is fascinating in the light of the findings of psychologists at Yale, the University of Oxford and University College London, who reported that we’re actually rather better at thinking good of people than writing them off as rotten apples. Molly Crockett, one of the authors of the paper, explains that our brains form “social impressions in a way that can enable forgiveness”, and that this is useful because “people sometimes behave badly by accident” and that “we need to be able to update bad impressions that turn out to be mistaken. Otherwise, we might end relationships prematurely and miss out on the many benefits of social connection.”It’s quite true that the greatest friend is the one who will provide unasked-for reassurance the morning after the night before, as the novelist Beryl Bainbridge once described of her pal Bernice Rubens: “I got drunk at one of her dinner parties and she rang me the next day because she knew I’d be feeling remorse, to tell me I behaved beautifully, which wasn’t true.” The helpful ones who make contact to give you advice about drinking apple cider vinegar and respond to queries about indiscretions with a hesitant “We-ell” are asking to be given the bum’s rush, in my opinion.However, these are trifles compared with the more serious stuff of life as the scientists suggest, it’s one thing to weigh up the positive and negative aspects of a person’s behaviour, but quite another to bend so heavily towards forgiveness and second chances that another’s harmful actions are tolerated, and even normalised, to the detriment of those around them. The report acknowledges, for example, the danger that forgiving can present in the context of bad relationships and, while we know that women in abusive domestic situations frequently stay in them because of an entirely justified fear of violent reprisal should they leave, the emotional consequences of hoping for behavioural improvement that will likely never come can also be highly destructive.Forgiveness is both complex and personal: if we set the bar for casting miscreants into the outer darkness too low, we risk the isolation of perfectionism if we set it too high, we might well find ourselves seething with suppressed resentment. And there is also the issue of projection. None of us is without flaws, nor past incidents in which we know we have behaved less than well if we seek forgiveness for our own frailties, why should we not bestow it? How many times have you raged about the ignominies visited upon you, only to realise you might perhaps be better off looking in the mirror? As the late Josephine Hart, author of the novel Damage, once said to me: “It’s like Medea out there.”On a macro level, traumatised communities that have been through processes of truth and reconciliation generally find it easier to face the future than those that haven’t. But such processes also rely on a basic willingness to admit wrongdoing and culpability as we watch the horrendous unravellings prompted by the #MeToo and other social justice movements, it’s evident that the impunity that abusers have shown and continue to cling to inflicts serious consequential damage.But we can derive something of great potential value from the idea that we are, as human beings, capable of setting the past aside. The propensity of social media to encourage a discourse of denunciation, in which a person’s transgressions co-exist with their present lives, in which the line between “calling out” and futile, zero-sum bullying is ever blurrier, is not, ultimately, a pathway to happiness. There is much to be angry about, and there are many perpetrators of cruelty and malfeasance to confront. But in the week of Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement, it’s reassuring to see a study confirming the reparative power of admitting our imperfections, saying sorry and moving forward.• Alex Clark writes for the  and the Observer"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff69f1516ec6e5b63716c2050c865c0ba3ae0c34/0_131_2731_1638/master/2731.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=52b98f4e403e9e08ed6e9062286223f5","title":"rational approach immigration labour mac report","story":"After years of Tory hysteria, the Migration Advisory Committee report provides evidenceThe Migration Advisory Committee (MAC) has done a great service with its latest report into the effects of European migration. We have been accustomed to unsubstantiated assertions, wild generalisations and dog-whistle politics about migrants, including from the EU. The Mac provides analysis and evidence.It would be a major departure if this government based immigration policy on evidence or expert advice. Its current policy is designed to create an artificial panic about migration and migrants, despite their positive contribution to our society, our culture and to our economy and public finances.The government’s never-achieved net migration target of below 100,000 is not a workable policy. Any serious efforts to achieve it would hugely disrupt important sectors of our economy and exacerbate the crises in the NHS, social care and other areas.But the target does allow a permanent campaign against migration and migrants in general. Philip Hammond talked of “marauding” migrants threatening standards of living, Theresa May introduced “Go home” vans and the entire Tory party supported the 2014 Immigration Act and the “hostile environment”.The Mac report reveals this campaign is based on falsehoods. The evidence shows that migrants have little or no impact on the employment or wages of UK-born workers. It is not clear, according to the report, that there is even any impact on lower income groups.The report goes on to say that migration is not a major determinant of wages, it may have a positive impact on productivity and there is no evidence that it blocks training it may actually increase it. On public services and public finances the report is unequivocal: European migrants pay more in taxes than they receive in benefits and public services. Through their work in the NHS and elsewhere, it is also clear that they are net contributors to our key pubic services. Finally, the Mac shows there is no increase in crime resulting from this migration.The government is due to produce another immigration bill before the end of the year. Far from “never talking about immigration”, this will be the third such piece of legislation since 2010. The government suggests that it this will be based on evidence. This would indeed be a first. We shall see.Recently, I set out Labour’s new, fairer, simpler immigration policy. It is designed to address our economic needs in a post-Brexit world. The government has numerical targets (which it never even nears). We will have rational criteria. You cannot have both, and numerical targets led this government to blocking much-needed doctors and nurses from coming here, and deporting our own citizens in the Windrush scandal.The criteria are simple. First, we have existing moral and legal obligations to all Commonwealth citizens. We have similar obligations to the 3 million who came here in good faith under freedom of movement, as our citizens did the same in the EU. The final Brexit deal and future trade deals will probably include some measure to allow migration between our country, the EU and those other countries. Our immigration system cannot be an obstacle to striking those deals. Unlike the Tories, Labour will always put the living standards of our population first. I also set out how we will provide work visas for doctors, nurses, social care workers and any other areas where we might still have labour or skills shortages after those Brexit and trade deals have been struck. Each of these categories will be subject to agreed access, based on what is right and what benefits us all.The term “preferential treatment” is not really a helpful one. It conflates movement of people with their rights and obligations once they are here. Instead, Labour will have agreed access to determine who is entitled to be here, and equal treatment of all citizens once they are here.The Mac has come under attack from some business groups for making a distinction between high-skilled and low-skilled workers. Yet we will almost certainly need social care workers and others in future. And when business says it needs workers in other sectors, we will definitely listen. We will also insist on more training, better rights and higher minimum wages for workers already here. This is rational immigration policy, determined by our needs and that works for all of us.• Diane Abbott is Labour MP for Hackney North and Stoke Newington"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c45a1575ffcb03dbd75b2a67cf2bc445e014d24c/0_210_5897_3540/master/5897.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=60a1c85a5fc1bb46b2a809951a0b0473","title":"seven routes peoples vote brexit europe eu","story":"When Theresa May says MPs will have the choice between her Brexit deal and crashing out of the EU with no deal, as she did this week in her Panorama interview, she is being neither honest nor democratic. After all, it is parliament, not the prime minister, who is sovereign – and MPs could well decide to ask the people whether they still want to quit the EU.It’s hard to be sure how the unfolding political crisis over Brexit will play out. But one thing is clear: if MPs want to impose their will on the prime minister, they can, as John Kerr, the former civil servant who helped write article 50, outlines in a new report for the People’s Vote campaign. Although no route to a “people’s vote” is on its own terribly likely, taken together the various scenarios add up to a fairly high chance.If May gets a deal, she has to ask MPs to vote for a motion backing it. They could then amend this motion, saying the deal will only go through if the people support it. For this to happen, Labour would have to back a people’s vote. It is edging in the right direction. About 20 Tory MPs would also need to break ranks. So far there are fewer than 10 – including people such as Dominic Grieve and Anna Soubry. But by the time the crunch vote happens, perhaps in the run-up to Christmas, their ranks could swell.Another option is for MPs to reject the motion supporting a deal. The prime minister then has to present alternative plans to parliament. If she proposes that we should crash out with no deal, MPs could force her to hold a referendum. For this scenario to play out, MPs first have to reject a deal. That looks quite likely – since Labour is committed to vote against anything like what May is proposing, and hardline Tory Brexiters such as Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg are too. But the Mogglodytes probably wouldn’t support a people’s vote. So to get one, a different majority – bringing together the opposition plus pro-European Tory rebels such as Grieve – would probably be needed. That seems quite realistic.Even if MPs vote for the motion backing a deal, they could amend the legislation that would be required to implement it – and demand a new referendum. While it might seem odd for MPs to amend the legislation if they had already backed the motion, some pro-European Tories might prefer to do this as it would look less disloyal to the prime minister. They could also warn, as they voted for the motion, that this was exactly what they were going to do.The prime minister herself could decide to put her deal to the people, either because MPs had rejected it or because she feared they would. This might seem a strange thing to do given how adamant May has been that there won’t be a new referendum. But she used to be equally clear that there wouldn’t be a new election – and she called one last year. So she has form when it comes to U-turns. What’s more, it is not clear what better options the prime minister would have in such a situation. She doesn’t want to crash out of the EU without a deal, despite threatening to do so.What if May can’t get a deal? Parliament has already passed legislation ensuring she can’t just let Britain crash out of the EU. If there’s no deal by 21 January, she has to present alternative proposals. MPs could then amend the motion approving those plans, making them subject to a people’s vote. If there is no deal, this is quite a likely scenario. After all, the number of fanatic Tory MPs who are genuinely happy to crash out of the EU may be only about 30.May could herself ask the people what to do if there’s no deal. After all, she may prefer to get the people to share responsibility for doing anything so crazy.Yet another scenario is a snap general election. That doesn’t seem very likely – even if May can’t get MPs to support a deal. Although Rees-Mogg and his gang might vote against a deal, they are unlikely to join Labour in voting down a Tory government. Still, if they were so hopping mad that they did bring down the government, there would probably be an election. Labour might then say it would negotiate a different deal and put it to the people in a referendum. If Jeremy Corbyn did that, he’d probably win the election as pro-Europeans would flock to his banner.So there are plenty of ways of getting a people’s vote if MPs want one. The snag is that most are still parroting the line that they have to deliver Brexit because that is the “will of the people”. But public opinion is changing – as people see what a pig’s ear the Tories are making of Brexit and realise it is going to be nothing like what Johnson et al promised two years ago.As the Brexit talks reach their finale, it will be increasingly clear that what is on offer isn’t nearly as good as the deal we have got. At that point, MPs must have the courage to ask the people whether they still want to quit the EU.• Hugo Dixon is chair of InFacts and one of the founders of the People’s Vote campaign"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8dac39ad7aebc38ea19ff73f3d86d3f3eb0e3b4a/0_242_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b26b5e42d4eeb4ec4314a9d65ba04716","title":"could means tested fees help poorer students get into university","story":"The government is reviewing the future of tuition fees. Lowering costs for low-income students could be the answerIn most countries, there is a chasm between the proportion of richer people who make it to higher education and the proportion of poorer people who do so. Introducing means-tested fees could be a way to address this.Means-tested fees offer a “third way” between systems with no fees but tightly-controlled student numbers (like Scotland) and systems with fees that are so high they could be squeezing out good students (as in England).We know poorer families tend to be more debt-averse, and that graduates from poorer families typically earn less than those from richer families. Means-testing is also cost-effective to governments because it focuses help on those least likely to repay all their student debt.This is why the policy is spreading like wildfire across five continents, in Canada, Chile, Italy, Japan and South Africa. On closer inspection, it’s clear that each country stumbled across it independently.That shows how powerfully attractive the concept is. But it also makes the policy harder to explain as different jurisdictions have adopted different approaches to getting the reduced fee into the hands of students, which changes precisely who benefits and which sorts of institutions are covered.The UK has already experimented with means-tested fees. In 1998, Tony Blair and David Blunkett imposed a means-tested upfront tuition fee of £1,000, which students from poorer households were not expected to pay. It lasted less than a decade before higher fees for all students, backed by income-contingent loans, became the norm in England from 2006.There are plenty of reasons why the time is right for policy makers in the UK to look at the concept again. England is currently awaiting the outcome of the Augar review of post-18 education and funding. Rumours suggest the review team and the Department for Education remain interested in some sort of reduction in student costs. The Labour party is also committed to reducing the tuition fee burden. Means-tested fees might provide a sensible starting point, as it has done in Chile.Student finance is a live political issue in Scotland too, where means-tested fees could be an option for improving university finances and increasing student places without imposing high fees on everyone.The review by the Office for National Statistics may result in some of the student loan book – most likely, the part expected never to be repaid by graduates – appearing in government accounts as current public spending, rather than being deferred to the future. If that happens, it would remove some of the government’s logic for the existing high-fee systems in England and Wales. We may as well reduce the headline fee for some students and pay the cash direct to universities without pretending it is a repayable loan.We mustn’t ignore the challenges that means-tested fees pose. One downside is that people who start poor but end up rich will owe much less than people who start rich but end up poor. Means-tested fees are also a complexity that some people might find hard to understand, and they could be costly to administer. The money assigned to means-testing fees could arguably be spent more efficiently on other things, such as top-notch outreach programmes.There are obvious counter-arguments, but they must be weighed against the advantages of providing a clear, generous and progressive system. Whatever the outcome, targeted tuition fees should be on the menu of options under consideration by the government’s tuition fee review.Join  Universities for more comment, analysis and job opportunities, direct to your inbox.

We started quite slowly, we lost too many duels and twice in the first half we gave away the ball in dangerous areas and allowed Lyon to score both times.”Arteta claimed his side’s reaction in the second half was superb, not an adjective that many Mancunians present would have selected, although he was probably correct in saying City created more chances after the interval than before it, even if that was not saying a lot.“At half-time we had to react, but that is normal, whether Pep is in the dressing room or not,” Arteta said. “That happens almost every half-time, it is not a new thing, we just had to try and improve what we were doing.”For a coach with managerial ambitions, this first-hand experience was a considerable disappointment. “I can’t really explain why we began so slowly, but sometimes in a new competition it takes a while to get on track,” he said. “We were finding it hard to come up with the right pass, we couldn’t build up any consistency and Lyon were able to take advantage.The Lyon coach, Bruno Génésio, smiled politely when asked whether beating the early favourites for the Champions League constituted the greatest result in the club’s history. “We have some history and I’m not sure I would call this the greatest feat,” he said. “But it is an achievement and we should be proud of it.“We decided to play as high as possibly to prevent Manchester City building from the back and it seemed to work.

The border with France is a mile away but this is “Little Italy”, where migrants from Piedmont began arriving in the 1880s to make a living at the steelworks below. These days the factory is empty, rusting and a symbol of the days before Luxembourg nimbly recalibrated to create its wealth via the financial services the Italian influence remains vivid, though, and will come to the fore on Thursday in a way nobody could have foreseen.F91\u0026nbspDudelange against Milan presents the kind of European tie the modern-day system is designed to avoid. But the 14-times national champions have, against every expectation, reached the Europa League group stage and the identity of their first opponents has hefty historical resonance.Back in 1916, a club named Alliance Dudelange was created by some of the same workers who had settled on the slope they opted for the red and black colours of their favourite club from back home and that link with the Rossoneri has never quite disappeared. The current club was formed in 1991 through a merger with the two other teams operating in a town of 20,000 inhabitants that Milan should be visiting now sparks senses of destiny and disbelief.“Now and then, you wake up in the morning and think: ‘Is this … is this real?’” says F91’s president, Romain Schumacher, sitting in the offices of the insurance broker for which he is CFO in Luxembourg City, 12 miles to the north. “When we drew Milan I was sitting in a chair and looking like this for 15 minutes” – he mimics open-mouthed shock – “but then you have to get to work.”Schumacher was a player when F91 took their early steps, starting out in the second ision. A photo on the wall of the club’s training ground shows a tall, flaxen-haired footballer wearing their first, bright yellow and red, shirt. Earlier in his career he had played against Barcelona for the now-defunct Aris Bonnevoie in the Cup Winners’ Cup, at a time when it was easier for minnows to take a shot at the best. Nowadays, Schumacher, a charismatic character to whom anecdotes come naturally, runs F91’s operation and is a self-confessed Milan fan who used to visit San Siro up to a dozen times a year. “My sons’ bedrooms were always decked out in their colours,” he says. “But eventually I had no time to go as there was so much to do at this club.”Now he hopes the tools are in place to give his other love a fright. It has been some off-field effort since F91, who had already defeated Legia Warsaw in the third qualifying round, beat CFR Cluj 5-2 on aggregate in the play-offs a month ago. Several of the team are still semi-professional and the club had to swiftly contact eight of their employers to secure full-time release for the frantic months ahead Schumacher has also seconded staff from his own firm to assist an administrative team almost entirely manned by volunteers.Aside from the players and coaches, F91’s two full-timers are a groundsman and a laundry worker. Preparing for Milan’s arrival has required many fresh hands but the work has been done and 8,000 tickets have been sold for the match, which will take place at Luxembourg’s national stadium, Stade Josy Barthel.F91 have never been so popular. “We were not very well loved in Luxembourg until now,” says Schumacher, who proudly points out that they received a letter of congratulations from Grand Duke Henri after defeating Cluj. The lack of affection has obvious roots. Every serial winner, however small, tends to have a backer F91 happen to have a Becca.Flavio Becca, a real estate mogul and serial rattler of cages locally, began sponsoring the club in 1998 on the proviso that they were serious about winning things. They have missed out on the title six times since and although Schumacher says Becca has changed the face of Luxembourgish football there are plenty on a conservative domestic circuit who balk at the foreign players he has brought in and at his sizeable contribution to propping up a club budget that, at €3.3m last season, is nothing by European standards but deals them an advantage at home.Although the country’s football scene is developing at a quicker rate than that of almost any comparable nation in Europe – emphasised when Progrès Niederkorn knocked Rangers out of last season’s Europa League – there is a concern that F91 are growing too big for it and they have in recent years shown interest in joining the Belgian league only to be knocked back by their own federation.“I want Luxembourgish football to profit from our success,” Schumacher says. “It makes no sense to me if the other teams are all 20km behind. We want to help bring the country to its best level. If you look at the infrastructure of the stadiums, it is catastrophic.”F91’s own home ground, Stade Jos Nosbaum, would not pass muster in England’s top five tiers but serves as a reminder that this is, local gripes aside, a club achieving remarkable things. Inside what passes for the office, officials crack open bottles of dark Diekirch beer and reminisce over adventures past and present. Until this season, Red Bull Salzburg, defeated in 2012, were their biggest scalp now mobile phone footage is passed around of the current side bouncing up and down a bus at Cluj airport to the strains of “Sweet Caroline”.The setup is rudimentary but an attack-minded team – coached by the 37-year-old Dino Toppmöller, son of the ex-Bayer Leverkusen manager Klaus – has tools complex enough to trouble Milan and their other two group stage foes, Real Betis and Olympiakos.“At the moment it’s incredible,” Schumacher says. “Everything is Dudelange, Dudelange, Dudelange.” The thousand or so newcomers who built houses on that incline more than a century ago could scarcely have imagined their reminder of the country they left would bring something like this."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57cfc9b45b6cf3336fde23b4c3430282d8306c5d/0_134_3872_2324/master/3872.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=356d65e4399b0cfb7d2770c55b9102b5","title":"john lewis customer service carpet","story":"The stairs in our new house were slippery so we ordered a carpet runner from John Lewis.

So here we go again, another consultation and probably more window dressing without tackling the leasehold scandal head on,” she said. “Freeholders have had the time now to organise, mobilise and fund their fight employing PR companies, economists, barristers, etc. And it’s working – the language from government is softening. This will be a long long fight.”The proposals, which extend to flats and apartments are an extension of the thinking first outlined by the Law Commission in July in regard to leasehold houses. But the commission stepped back from recommending a specific new formula for the price that leaseholders will have to pay to buy out or extend their lease, noting that “sufficient compensation” will have to be paid to the owners of the freeholds.In July, the Law Commission suggested that the ground rent multiplier could be set at 10 times the existing ground rent, a level that would be welcome by many flat and house owners. But in its latest proposals, the Law Commission underlines what it says is the need for freeholders to be properly compensated.“The acquisition of a freehold or lease extension will only be permitted if the level of compensation payable to a landlord is sufficient to justify the interference with the landlord’s property rights … the further away from market value the compensation is, the more difficult it may be to justify the interference.”But the Law Commission said the proposals, now open for consultation until 20 November 2018, would save leaseholders time, stress and money, reducing legal costs and helping to prevent unnecessary disputes.Law commissioner Prof Nick Hopkins said: “The current system is complex, slow and expensive and it’s failing homeowners. Many feel that they are having to pay twice to own their home.“Our proposals would make it easier and cheaper to buy the freehold or extend the lease of their home, ensuring the system works for ordinary homeowners across the country.Changes to the calculation of leasehold extensions have met with fierce resistance from freeholders, with the fortunes of Britain’s wealthiest aristocrats, such as the Duke of Westminster, rooted in lucrative leasehold property estates in central London.A legal challenge to existing leasehold valuations – which estimated that leaseholders were overpaying by hundreds of millions of pounds every year – was rejected by the court of appeal earlier this year.Research by the National Association of Estate Agents’ Propertymark arm earlier this month found that a third of leasehold house owners currently trying to sell their homes are struggling to attract a buyer because they don’t own the freehold."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1dda3955a1c808b01a32300f262d19a22b67e297/818_392_3550_2130/master/3550.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b215fe0a976a2c15b84150aaf1a94b96","title":"im hard left hard remain grassroots bid for labour brexit seachange","story":"Constituency groups could force Jeremy Corbyn to agree to a ‘people’s vote’ at the conferenceFew people in Labour have heard of Michael Chessum, the self-described “hard-left, hard-remain” campaigner, who concedes he is an unusual frontman for a campaign that could transform the Labour party’s Brexit policy.“Last year the faces were Chuka Umunna, Heidi Alexander, I can’t really believe that this year, it’s people like me, it’s weird,” he says in his shared south London office, surrounded by anti-Brexit paraphernalia and protest signs.Chessum’s group, Another Europe is Possible, is just one of a number of grassroots organisations that have forced the party to have a conversation about Brexit that it has long delayed.More than 150 constituency Labour parties have submitted Brexit motions for debate at the party’s conference, which begins in Liverpool on Sunday, with the vast majority calling for a vote on the final deal.It is the result of an intense and unprecedented ground campaign by a coalition of grassroots groups. One Labour official said the number of motions on Brexit was so vast that they could have difficulty devising other motions for debate on other topics.Last year in Brighton, delegates followed Momentum’s direction to save the leadership’s blushes and blocked any potential vote on Brexit. In Liverpool, delegates will arrive with an unprecedented mandate from members to put a second referendum on the table after a campaign led by the pro-Corbyn grassroots.“The numbers are completely crazy. I thought we’d get 50,” one pro-remain MP said.Many campaigners and MPs hope the efforts will resonate beyond the party conference in ways that could have a major and unforeseen effect on the parliamentary arithmetic.“It gives MPs some cover,” another MP said. “Some have resisted voting on anti-Brexit amendments because they will get grief locally for seeming to be disloyal. But if their CLP has put this motion forward, it gives them the freedom to vote with their conscience.”Chessum, a member of Momentum’s first steering committee, said he wanted to transform the pro-remain cause within the party into one that was explicitly leftwing, tribally Labour and pro-Corbyn.“I am a diehard remainer and a diehard member of the hard left,” he said. “There is no bespoke Labour Brexit on the table. There is no time, even with a general election.”Chessum argues he is giving the leadership space to change its position, rather than closing it into a corner. “The Labour right loves ‘Corbyn v the membership’. That’s not what this is.”The group is technically cross-party and has worked with other leftwingers and Greens. For the summer, it has been working in co-ordination and hosting phone banks for another explicitly Labour group run by Mike Buckley, a former aid worker and community organiser, who founded Labour for a People’s Vote this year.“There was nothing to rally behind,” he said. “The people talking publicly about having another referendum, however well intentioned they are, they are not going to gather the majority of Labour party members behind them because they are seen as being anti-Jeremy.”Both groups have regional organisers and have relied on sign-ups and their existing networks, in local parties and Momentum groups, some relics of the 2016 referendum campaign.For all the groups involved, there is no roadmap. The summer’s efforts have involved a painstaking task of identifying pro-European members in more than 600 local parties, through a mix of local contacts, friends of friends, and online signups, and getting them to champion a motion through their CLP.Buckley said that organising local parties has been “surprisingly difficult” and relied on local knowledge. Both groups have links with the main cross-party campaign People’s Vote, but maintain a public separation. Another mainstream group, Best for Britain, the anti-Brexit campaign that has the financial backing of billionaire philanthropist George Soros, has given £70,000 to Another Europe is Possible.Pro-European MPs have aided the groups in the background, helping them make connections, but have deliberately not led the campaigning.Though the groups are mainly run by young activists, it is older Labour members who have been the focus of some of the summer campaigning, because they make up the bulk of new members active in CLPs.The group that has most successfully used this tactic is the energetic pro-remain youth group For Future’s Sake (FFS) – a cross-party campaign which has close links to the official People’s Vote movement.Its young organisers have made provocative videos, deliberately designed to appeal to older members, placing the arguments about Brexit in the context of progressive political movements in British history, including the campaign for women’s suffrage and fighting the poll tax.FFS’s Liron Velleman has been co-ordinating its campaign on the ground to get CLPs to submit motions. “We get young people to sign up and then encourage older people from the CLP to get involved in the fight,” he said. “We tell them, our generation needs yours.”Previously unreleased data showed the average age of Labour party members and supporters who joined after 2015 is 51, and the most common age of this cohort to be 66. The project’s summer 2017 survey of Labour members revealed an average age of 53, with the most common age being 70.Now the local party organisation is over, campaigners from the main groups are turning their attention to the party conference itself. The first hurdle is ensuring Brexit is a topic on the agenda at conference, as one of eight topics chosen by members.Last year, Momentum steered its delegates to vote for other topics, including housing, NHS and the railways. That will not be repeated, its national co-ordinator, Laura Parker, said. “Last year, the context was very different. Now, it’s absolutely inevitable there will be a discussion on conference floor, I can’t conceive there won’t be – we’re 200 days away,” she said. “Without a doubt, there has to be a debate.”Momentum has not backed a new referendum and there is clearly some caution about doing so. Parker’s instincts are pro-Europe, but she is wary of restricting the Labour leadership’s political flexibility.“We are waiting to see what motions come to conference floor,” she said.Once Brexit is confirmed as a topic for debate in the ballot, delegates from those CLPs will meet trade union representatives and Labour’s Brexit secretary Keir Starmer on Sunday night to thrash out a compromise motion that could go to a vote.Amanda Chetwynd-Cowieson, an FFS co-founder, said the groups would be co-ordinating. “The one cast-iron agreement across all the groups is that a people’s vote is the way to solve the crisis,” she said.Some senior Labour sources cautioned that it was now uncertain if delegates would be responsive to either Momentum or any of the other campaign groups.“Delegates are totally unbiddable now,” one said. “Last year, there was some degree of predictability that most delegates would at least do what Momentum instructed, but that is no longer the case.”Key to the success of any motion or compromise is the support of trade unions. Campaigners have been closely watching both the Unite conference and the subsequent Trades Unions Congress, where union leaders accepted or put forward motions that could be a blueprint for the Labour outcome.One of the “big three” unions, GMB, has already officially backed a new referendum, after polling its members. Smaller unions have also been key players, most notably TSSA and its general secretary, Manuel Cortes, and Community, a centrist union with many Brexit-voting members whose industrial membership recently backed a vote on the deal.Unite, Labour’s most generous donor and the UK’s second largest union, left the door open to backing a second referendum at its conference, with a leadership statement saying it was “open to the possibility of a popular vote being held on any deal, depending on political circumstances”.That statement is now the most likely model for a Labour compromise. “The key voice in the room will be Unite,” one senior union source said.The third major union, Unison, the largest in the UK, has remained studiously neutral. “They will be in the room at conference, they might act as honest brokers, but they don’t want to be forced to take a position,” the source said.The final outcome may ultimately be a fudge, the party’s governing national executive committee could offer a policy statement, keeping a referendum on the table without endorsing it. Starmer and the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, have trialled that line in recent months.However, even if the NEC offers a statement, delegates could still push for an additional vote and a more radical motion.In the end, there is little will at the top of the party to prevent a Brexit debate taking place. “We would look ridiculous,” one source close to the shadow cabinet said. “The headlines last year were bad, but this would look terrible to outsiders watching.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/04d08374778fef4602cfb829e1df3b5e6ff2af62/0_150_2833_1700/master/2833.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6f450b67b7961cf6200150b40845e350","title":"macron urges eu leaders to stand firm against theresa may brexit","story":"French president says EU should resist prime minister’s calls for compromise on BrexitEmmanuel Macron has appealed to his fellow European leaders to maintain their tough approach to Brexit in response to Theresa May’s demand for compromise and accusations that the French president wants to make Britain suffer.Macron, who is fighting a rearguard action against the rise of populism in Europe, said blocking any attempt by the UK to pick and choose elements of EU membership had to be the priority in the dying days of the Brexit negotiations.“May spoke last night,” Macron said of the UK prime minister’s presentation to the leaders in Salzburg. “My first wish is to stay united and to have a common approach, the 27. It is essential. The second thing is that we remain coherent. The solution must be found. The third thing is that we need to have a real retirement agreement by November.”A number of fellow EU leaders have conceded that compromise from both sides is needed to reach a deal both on avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland and on the future framework of a trade deal.The nationalist prime minister of Hungary, Viktor Orbán, who has sparred with Macron over migration, told reporters he was getting close to building a majority of member states in opposition to “a camp of prime ministers” who believe the “British must suffer”. “I don’t like that approach at all,” he said.Over coffee at the end of a dinner that finished after midnight, May insisted the UK had moved its position and it was the turn of Brussels to reciprocate.Trying to strike a tough tone the prime minister told her counterparts “that the UK will leave on 29 March next year” and as a result “the onus is now on all of us to get this deal done” by the end of an emergency summit that the EU confirmed would happen in mid-November.May met the Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, over breakfast in the morning, as the two leaders held further talks over how to resolve the Irish border question and what customs arrangements would be necessary after Brexit.Both sides reiterated the need to agree on some form of backstop if it did not prove possible to reach agreement on a future trading relationship, although there remain considerable differences between UK and EU approaches. The meeting between the two leaders is understood to have been amicable.However, there is a consensus among the 27 member states that the central planks of May’s Chequers plan on trade are not workable, but with the encouragement of Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, some have suggested the EU should seek to bridge the gap with fresh proposals.Sebastian Kurz, the Austrian prime minister, said: “You know that, as before, the approaches are very different. But to report something positive, inside the room, away from the hard media statements outside, I think both sides are aware that they will only reach a solution if they move towards each other.”Xavier Bettel, the prime minister of Luxembourg, told reporters as he arrived at a summit that he believed “compromise from both sides, not from one side” was necessary. But when asked why the EU had not budged, he added: “We have some colleagues around the table who think the same about Theresa May.”The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, whose country is an advocate for offering May a counter-proposal in the coming weeks, said that avoiding cherry-picking by the British while keeping them close and avoiding a no-deal scenario was a difficult balancing act.The EU is aware of the domestic dangers facing May as she approaches the Conservative party conference and beyond. The usually outspoken European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, said of May’s brief speech: “It was interesting, it was polite, it was not aggressive. She is doing her job.”Earlier, the Czech prime minister, Andrej Babiš, said he would like to see Britain hold a second referendum on membership of the EU – even though May pointedly told EU leaders that one was not on the table.May specifically ruled out a second vote in her comments at dinner. But Babis told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “We hope that finally we will reach a deal but I am very unhappy that the UK is leaving, so it would be better maybe to make another referendum and maybe the people in the meantime could change their view.“Europe has a lot of problems. We have problems with Mr Trump about tariffs, sanctions with Russia, Brexit, migration and so on. For Europe, it’s quite a difficult time. We were shocked when the referendum was announced that there were so many people practically unhappy. Even the chief of commission didn’t understand.”Babiš said a second referendum would “solve the problem quite quickly”, but he also said there would “hopefully” be a deal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3bdcdeb7a36c280cac4a411f4fd24794cdcee59e/0_16_1430_858/master/1430.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=14f622485c23d082e73477852a865ec9","title":"danny cipriani left out england rugby squad","story":"Danny Cipriani has been left out of the first England training squad since his two convictions for common assault and resisting arrest. Cipriani has since made a flying start to the season with Gloucester but he is the eye-catching omission from Eddie Jones’s 36-man squad which includes Manu Tuilagi and the suspended Chris Ashton.Cipriani is England’s incumbent fly-half, having made a first start in a decade against South Africa in June, but in August he was arrested following a nightclub incident during Gloucester’s pre-season tour of Jersey. He was fined a total of £4,000 and found guilty by the Rugby Football Union of “conduct prejudicial to the interest of the game”.This month Jones revealed he had since visited Cipriani and that he would “make a decision on whether he’s going to add value to the team”. He also added that: “If a guy gets in trouble all the time you’ve got to have second thoughts about it. We will make a decision on whether he’s going to add value to the team.”Jones does not name his squad for England’s autumn internationals until 18 October – this is a three-day training camp in Bristol where the players will, among other things get accustomed to their new defence coach, John Mitchell – but while Cipriani’s hopes of retaining his place are not over, his omission would suggest his chances are damaged.Tuilagi meanwhile, is rewarded for showing some semblance of early-season form – he has started all three of Leicester’s matches and scored a fine try against Newcastle – and is included by Jones for the first time since he was sent home in disgrace after a late-night drinking session last August. He has not played for England since a replacement appearance against Wales during the 2016 Six Nations and not started since the summer of 2014 but Jones’s decision to cast his eye over him makes obvious sense with exactly 12 months to go until the World Cup.“It’s the first time in the three years I’ve been in England that Manu’s been fit,” said Jones. “He’s put together a series of games and we’re looking forward to him continuing on that run. He’s got the opportunity to come in and show us what he’s got.”Ashton’s selection is not surprising in that Jones had hinted at including him a couple of weeks ago but he is currently in the middle of a seven-week selection for a tip tackle during pre-season and will not have played a competitive match at all this season before Jones names his autumn squad. He was included in Jones’s August training squad however, in what constituted an immediate recall following his summer move from Toulon to Sale.Among the other notable inclusions is Michael Rhodes, Saracens’ uncapped South Africa-born flanker who may make his debut against the Springboks in England’s opening autumn fixture on 3 November. Billy Vunipola is in the squad, as is Zach Mercer and Joe Cokanasiga but their Bath teammate Sam Underhill is a surprise omission. As are the Exeter pair of Luke Cowan-Dickie and Sam Simmonds – though the former suffered a rib injury at the weekend and the latter missed out through illness.The Wasps pair of Joe Launchbury and Brad Shields are both included despite carrying injuries while Danny Care, George Kruis and Jack Nowell all return the squad. Dan Cole is still not in the squad though, nor is James Haskell following his summer move to Northampton.Jones added: “It’s a chance to get the players thinking about England and the way we want to play for England and the way we want to beat South Africa. These players have the opportunity to press their chances for selection ahead of the first Test so they will have to be enthusiastic and ready to give their best.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/77b1a7d875ae7ecc398ed217e2ed67dea4a235d1/0_348_4519_2711/master/4519.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=44c8065a4db1404f3f095e388725dad4","title":"the burning tower review council estate play grenfell spid theatre","story":"SPID theatre, LondonHelena Thompson’s passionate and pacy drama is a celebration and defence of social housing‘I’d love to call time on this, the world’s worst play,” says Em, a council estate girl with an activist streak. “But my mate won’t let me hear the end of it.” It’s an audacious line to include in a show which has just been interrupted by a character arriving deliberately late, accompanied by perhaps half the audience who got lost on the way in: SPID theatre is in a community space beneath Kensal House, a council block near Grenfell Tower, in London.But this is not the world’s worst play. Quite the opposite. It is a passionate response to last June’s horrific events at Grenfell. It’s not an attempt to ascribe blame, but rather an act of advocacy. Each corner of the performance space has a small display about life on council estates: a board about Octavia Hill, the social housing pioneer one on the Windrush generation, many of whom have struggled to maintain their tenancies following government policy shifts a board memorialising those who died at Grenfell. The Burning Tower isn’t asking its audience to take to the streets, it’s asking them to celebrate, love and defend precisely the kind of housing estate we’re all sitting within. Precisely the kind that Grenfell was.Em and her friend Sarah are young women on a mission. Em (Alice Franziska, all fizzing energy and determination) wants to remind us that things weren’t always as they are now. Social housing used to be affordable, we’re told by Sarah (Bianca Stephens, profoundly sincere and touching as the play’s moral core). They plan to entertain us with stories from council tenants they’ve interviewed, with raps Em has composed and with cupcakes, which they hand around for no real reason except the open-hearted generosity that informs their performances and the play itself.But they are distracted by the arrival of the magnificent Hayley Carmichael, a nameless older woman, who responds to Em’s irritable suggestion that her outlook is Victorian with the swift retort, “I’m not offended. I like to think of myself as ageless.” She is an anarchic creation, hurling herself off a chair to proclaim it unsafe, always threatening to leave though never quite going. She swipes a hip flask and takes a swig before Em can stop her: “Oi madam, that is a prop.” It’s not good enough for the girls to tell her they love housing estates. She demands to know why. She also wants to know what is preying on Sarah’s spirit, though the woman prefers to call it her ghost. “I’m not here to blame anyone,” Sarah says. “But the truth is, I’m not fine.”Helena Thompson’s pacy, ambitious script keeps us thinking about what it means to live as precariously as Em and Sarah do, delving into specifics to keep things from becoming cliche. Em’s family own their flat, through a right-to-buy scheme. Sarah has none of the stability that provides. But sudden bills for maintenance can mean that neither of them quite has what they first claimed as a virtue of council estates: somewhere to build on, somewhere to feel safe.There are doubtless bigger budget productions being planned in response to Grenfell. There should be: it is a scar on our national conscience. But it’s hard to imagine any of them will offer more passion or sincerity than this one.• At SPID theatre, London, until 6 October.

In the essay, he described himself as a victim of “mass shaming” and said he had endured “enough humiliation for a lifetime”.He wrote: “Even as I feel deep remorse about how I treated some people in my life, I cannot confess to the accusations that are inaccurate. What I do confess is that I was emotionally thoughtless.”The publication of the essay, which was hotly debated within the NYRB’s small team of editors, provoked a storm of debate about the extent to which men who had been the subject of #MeToo accusations of inappropriate or abusive sexual conduct should be allowed to rehabilitate themselves into society. It also raised eyebrows about Buruma’s editorial judgment.Buruma added fuel to the fire when last week he gave an interview to Isaac Chotiner of Slate in which he clumsily sought to justify the decision to publish. Though he praised the #MeToo movement, that has put the spotlight on the sexual misconduct of powerful men, as “a necessary corrective on male behavior”, he said: “Like all well-intentioned and good things, there can be undesirable consequences.”He went on to lament a “general climate of denunciation” and said that in the case of Ghomeshi there had been “undesirable, or at least unresolved, aspects to it”.Asked to comment on the numerous allegations of sexual assault by Ghomeshi – including punching women on the head – Buruma replied: “The exact nature of his behavior – how much consent was involved – I have no idea, nor is it really my concern.”Buruma, 66, has written often for the . He is author of several books including Murder in Amsterdam: the Death of Theo van Gogh and the Limits of Tolerance and is professor of democracy and human rights at Bard College in New York state.A statement from the NYRB, which is published by Rea Hederman, who bought it in 1984, was expected later on Wednesday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7612e636dd90e7059ebfb76b4d45766b7b96ff5e/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fb15334049b788d62cf123633f1da6db","title":"boorish tourists in venice targeted in mooted sitting down ban","story":"Residents’ groups are kicking back against the latest in a long list of banned activitiesAuthorities in Venice have proposed banning people from sitting and lying on the ground as the city pursues its quest to clamp down on what some officials describe as “boorish” tourists.The potential rule was suggested by the mayor, Luigi Brugnaro, and would mean transgressors being fined between €50 and €500 if implemented.Sitting down on the steps of monuments or those of the portico that surround St Mark’s square is already banned.The proposal is expected to reach a vote in the city’s council in October, although it faces opposition from councillors from the Five Star Movement as well as residents’ activist groups.“There is such a long list of things that are forbidden in Venice there is nothing left that you can do,” said Marco Gasparinetti, who leads the residents’ group Gruppo Aprile 25. “They would need to hire an extra 5,000 officers to properly enforce everything.”Authorities are also considering banning music on boats, the principal mode of transport for residents. People can already be barred from the city or fined for drunken behaviour and swimming or dipping their toes in the canals.

If registered as foreign agents, Xinhua and CGTN would have to disclose their budgets and expenditures as well as include disclaimers identifying the outlets as foreign agents on all broadcasts.“Countries should perceive media’s role in promoting international exchange and cooperation in an open and inclusive spirit,” Geng said at a news briefing. “They need to facilitate rather than obstruct media’s normal work, still less politicising their role.”The news comes as relations between the US and China have hit a low over an escalating trade war. Geng’s comments also struck some as ironic, given China’s often restrictive media environment.Last month, the US embassy in Beijing said it was “deeply concerned” when a US journalist for Buzzfeed News, known for her reporting on human rights abuses in Xinjiang, was denied a visa to continue working in China. Other foreign journalists have also been effectively barred.Last year, Russia’s state-run RT Television was ordered to register under Fara after a US intelligence report said RT and the website Sputnik news were part of a misinformation campaign during the 2016 US presidential election.Chinese media operating in the US have not been accused of interference, but critics cite expanding efforts to influence public opinion through Chinese and English-language news from Chinese state outlets.Paid inserts of the government-run China Daily have appeared in major newspapers such as the New York Times and the Washington Post. CGTN has claimed it reaches 30m US households a year. In 2016, Xinhua paid for a mega-screen in New York’s Times Square that played a video promoting “China’s historical role and standing in the South China Sea” on loop.In January, a group of US senators including Marco Rubio and Patrick Leahy wrote to the US asking the Department of Justice to assess whether state-controlled Chinese media should be registered under Fara.They also asked the department to assess whether the dissemination of Chinese state media, including the inserts from the China Daily and the use of social media, complied with the law. Both Xinhua and CGTN have Facebook pages.Citing a report last year from the National Endowment for Democracy, the senators said China was exploiting “glaring asymmetry” by raising barriers to external political and cultural influence at home while simultaneously taking advantage of the openness of democratic systems abroad.”The US Department of Justice has been contacted for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28d5891947777bef0c1a781698681feefe934584/0_97_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=61eeb392dc65f6ce8bf7bfeaef2319b1","title":"dream come true moon jae in korean leaders mountain pilgrimage","story":"South Korean president’s visit to North concludes with highly symbolic trip to Mount PaektuMoon Jae-in, the South Korean president, stepped into the shallow waters of Heaven Lake, regarded as the spiritual home of the Korean people, bent down and scooped up a glassful of water.Kim Jong-un, his North Korean counterpart, watched from a distance. Moon was fulfilling a long-held dream to visit Mount Paektu, which straddles the border between North Korea and China. At the summit the two men held hands and thrust them into the air as they posed for a photo with their wives, the lake in the background.The highly symbolic trip capped a three-day visit by Moon to North Korea, the first by a South Korean leader in 11 years. After two days of talks, Kim pledged to close a missile testing site that was crucial to North Korea’s development of intercontinental ballistic missiles, and offered to shut the country’s only known nuclear complex in exchanged for unspecified “reciprocal measures” from the US.Observers said these measure fell short of expectations in Washington. But inter-Korean relations continue to grow closer, and the trip to Paektu highlighted the close relationship between the two leaders. Moon is an avid hiker and during his first meeting with Kim, in April, he had expressed his desire to visit the mountain, the highest on the Korean peninsula at 2,500 metres (9,000ft).“I have a dream that I have not been able to fulfil for a long time, which is trekking Mount Paektu,” Moon said at the time. “I believe Chairman Kim will make that dream come true for sure.”The trip to the summit on a sunny morning was less of a trek than a photo op. Both Kim and Moon wore black overcoats and black leather dress shoes, and they travelled to the top by cable car. Outings like this have helped build trust between the two men, something Kim still lacks in his relationship with Donald Trump.The mountain is featured heavily in North Korean propaganda, and Kim has made trips to its summit after nuclear tests or major announcements, most recently when he declared the country’s nuclear arsenal complete. North Korea’s two previous leaders, Kim’s grandfather and father, are said to have been born in its shadow. This has been used to bolster the Kim family’s claim to a sacred bloodline, though the account has been disputed by some.Paektu is also a significant symbol in the South, where it is mentioned in the country’s national anthem. Although Moon could have visited the summit sooner from the Chinese side, he had wanted to go by “stepping on our soil”, Kim Eui-kyeom, a South Korean presidential spokesman, said at a briefing.Moon was scheduled to fly back to Seoul on Thursday afternoon and he will meet Trump in New York next week during the UN general assembly. The US has invited North Korea’s foreign minister to meet the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, next week in an attempt to restart talks between Washington and Pyongyang."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad3070511f1d86d20c49c1eb3cd50b0e5b646d04/0_1329_3648_2186/master/3648.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=07ac56feb66cba9e9748226ae9eab167","title":"shinzo abe set to be japans longest serving pm after winning party vote","story":"Reelection as Liberal Democratic leader means Abe is likely to overtake previous record and use mandate to revise pacifist constitutionAbe’s victory – taking 553 votes out of a total of 807 – means he is assured of continuing as prime minister and is expected to use his mandate to push ahead with controversial plans to strengthen the legal status of Japan’s military, known as the self-defence forces.Speaking on the eve of the vote among LDP MPs and party members, Abe said he was determined to “build a new country together”, adding: “I promise to take the lead in handing over a proud and hopeful Japan to younger generations.”Abe, a conservative who has devoted his political career to loosening the postwar shackles on the self-defence forces, easily beat his nearest rival, former defence minister Shigeru Ishiba, who had voiced concern that the country had not been given enough time to debate constitutional reform.Abe’s victory on Thursday effectively extends his term in office by another three years. If he is still in office in November 2019 he will overtake Taro Katsura, who was leader for 2,886 days – spread over three terms – in the early 1900s.Abe, who has survived two cronyism scandals, spent a tumultuous year in office from late 2006, but has not lost an election since he became prime minister for a second time in December 2012.He has quietly dropped plans for a comprehensive revision to the war-renouncing clause in the constitution, insisting he simply wants to confirm the legality of the self-defence forces, which are not recognised by the current document.He has also said he would retain passages that forbid Japan from waging a war of aggression.Article 9 of the current constitution, authored by US occupation forces at the end of the second world war, renounces war and forbids the use of force to settle international disputes.Abe, however, redefined the military’s role three years age with the passage of a law allowing it to take part in collective-self defence. In theory, that means Japanese troops could come to the aid of an ally under attack even if its own territory is not threatened.The constitutional change would require a two-thirds majority in both houses of the Japanese Diet and a simple majority in a national referendum.Any move to strengthen the military’s status could damage Abe’s standing, however, particularly among older voters who have formed an emotional attachment to their country’s postwar pacifism.The change could also test Tokyo’s relationship with South Korea and China, both victims of Japanese militarism in the first half of the 20th century.Analysts pointed out that most voters were more concerned about the economy and population decline.“They simply do not see revision as a top priority for the government and Diet,” said Tobias Harris, a Japan expert at Teneo Intelligence in Washington, adding that constitutional revision was a “costly distraction that could trigger a backlash vote”.Wire agencies contributed to this report."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3635602.1537428701!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"varadkar and may meet amid stark divisions over irish border","story":"Speaking at an EU leaders summit in Salzburg, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said that the Irish Government is preparing for the possibility that the EU and UK fail to agree a Brexit deal. Video: EU Commission\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Theresa May and Leo Varadkar attend a bilateral meeting during the informal summit of European Union leaders in Salzburg, Austria on Thursday. Photograph: Leonhard FoegerReuters A bi-lateral meeting between Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and British prime minister Theresa May has begun in Salzburg this morning.Last night stark isions over Brexit and the future of the Irish Border were evident at an EU summit in Salzburg as Ms May told fellow leaders that a border on the Irish Sea was “simply not acceptable” to her.Mr Varadkar told reporters that no progress had been made on the backstop since March and that the Government was making preparations for a no-deal outcome in the talks on the UK’s departure from the bloc.“I don’t think anyone wants to contemplate a no-deal scenario,” he said. “I don’t believe a no-deal scenario is where we’re heading but certainly Ireland is prepared for it.“We’ve already started the process of hiring hundreds of people to staff our ports and airports. We’ve already started to approve the IT system, the infrastructure that may need to go into place. I want to emphasise that’s in the ports and airports for eastwest trade. We’re not making any preparations for a hard border.”Ahead of the dinner, sources said Ms May would tell her fellow leaders that: “It has been clear from the outset that we can never accept a border on the Irish Sea. . . A customs border would undermine our constitutional position.”She was also expected to say that “the commission is proposing I should assent to legal separation of the UK into two customs territories. That is simply not acceptable”.This was seen as a response to attempts by the chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier to “de-dramatise” the issue of controls on the Irish Sea in the event of Northern Ireland remaining part of the customs union and single market after Brexit.Mr Barnier has insisted in recent weeks that such controls need not take place on the Border or be seen as a border, or have any implications for the constitutional status of Northern Ireland.Ms May was having none of it, with sources saying she remained solidly committed to the British pledge in December to a “backstop” for Northern Ireland, which both sides differ sharply on the shape of.Sources close to the prime minister accepted, however, that London would be bringing forward proposals on the regulatory control dimension of their backstop proposals and did not rule out that some such controls could be carried out in the Irish Sea.On the overall deal Ms May was expected to reiterate her commitment to getting agreement.“We have a shared history, and shared challenges . . . and we have a desire for a shared future,” she said. “The onus is on all of us to get this deal done.”There were no responses at the dinner to Ms May’s speech, which will be discussed by the 27 remaining states at their lunch today after she leaves Salzburg.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Olivier DoulieryEPATo become a “normal country” is the dream of more than one republic. The world is familiar enough with the German case. Having atoned for the war and put Europe first, its next step as a common-or-garden nation is to pursue its narrow interests without embarrassment.Because he is so peculiar, we cannot credit that Donald Trump’s project is the normalisation of his own country. For all their shock value, that is what his foreign policies amount to: the restoration of the US as a selfish state among selfish states, not an overworked governess with the entire free world as her mewling wards.This realpolitik can be self-defeating. It misses the national interests that are served through such nominally high-minded works as the Paris climate accord. But it is still more coherent than its critics. Liberals chafed at American power until its threatened retreat, at which point Nato and the Washington Consensus on trade became sacraments to be saved from populist menaces. As for mainstream Republicans, at least Trump does not go in for mystical hokum about the US as a special nation ordained to uphold freedom.Realism has more going for it, though, than internal coherence. It also fits the external conditions. To lead a world order takes a nation in the full plumage of its powers. That is a better description of the US in 1948 than 2018, much less 2048. Trump’s infidelity to the postwar system is disquieting, but perhaps he is doing through choice what future presidents will have to do through necessity.Pax Americana is not the natural order of things. It is a phase born of the most extreme circumstances. The US accounted for a third of the world’s output when it set up the Bretton Woods institutions, revived Japan and secured Europe. Because its absolute power remained so awesome, we forget that its relative position began to decline soon after. It now accounts for about 20 per cent of global output. It does not have the wherewithal to underwrite the democratic world forever. At some point, a president was going to construe the national interest in narrower terms. The most recent three were elected on a pledge to do so.Whether Trump-as-statesman understands the relative decline he has lived through – he was born in 1946 – Trump-as-politician understands something just as relevant. The taxpayer still awaits the peace idend that was said to be in the mail when the Berlin Wall turned to debris.The US has spent most of the post-cold war era in expensive conflicts in another hemisphere. These “forever wars” rolled on as the home land endured a financial crash and the kind of infrastructure that should be beneath the dignity of the nation that built the Hoover dam.The two trends – relative decline and domestic exhaustion – have created the best atmosphere for realpolitik since the post-Vietnam years. The difference is that this time it should last, as China and other powers trim America’s room for manoeuvre.There is no demand for isolation. There is plenty for a focus on interests over values. Trump’s is the first (and therefore the worst) attempt to service that demand. There was no need to humiliate allies as blameless as Canada or to impose, as his government did this week, new limits on the annual intake of refugees. But the underlying logic of selfishness will outlast him.Realists smell a chance to temper the crudities of America First into a serious, interest-led, foreign policy. The foremost among their academic tribe, John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt, each have books out to encourage their nation’s retirement from “liberal hegemony”.Even if the coming realism turns out to be an over-correction, a correction was due. Not long ago, George W Bush could describe freedom as the “design of nature” and Barack Obama could, with equal nonchalance, say that the arc of history bends towards justice. The arc of history does not bend towards anything.There are things to miss about these presidents – their personal class, their seasoned cabinets – but this teleological gibberish is not one of them. The postwar record suggests that ideals get the US into trouble more often than cold calculation does.Richard Nixon said that a leader can, at most, “give history a nudge”. He or she cannot alter the course of history so much as quicken a trend that is already in train. The structural trends of the world demand a more self-interested US over time.Each of Trump’s broken treaties and tariff rounds can be read as a nudge towards that destiny: a bid to make America normal again. His successors will do it better. But they will do it. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2018"},{"url":null,"title":"mother of three becomes fastest human bike 1839mph","story":"A woman has become the fastest human on a bicycle, reaching a speed of 183.9mph.Denise Mueller-Korenek, 45, shattered a two-decade-old land speed cycling record which was previously held by a man.Her incredible feat, which has yet to be officially verified by Guinness World Records, took place on the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah.She rode a custom-made bike that was attached to the the back of a drag racing car until she hit 100mph.Denise Mueller Korenek obliterated the male record The bike was then released and she pedalled in the slipstream of the vehicle which was driven by Shea Holbrook, a female professional racing driver.Mueller-Korenek eclipsed her own speed record for a female cyclist which had been 147mph, set in 2016.She also shattered the existing male record of 167mph which has stood since 1995 and was set by Dutch cyclist Fred Rompelber.After successfully slowing down and demounting she yelled out: Beat that, Fred!Denise Mueller-Korenek at the salt flats in UtahMueller-Korenek said: I think we broke the limit of what we were supposed to do.

It is an important caveat, but the declaration appeared to break the logjam in nuclear discussions with Washington.President Donald Trump welcomed the move, tweeting that Kim had agreed to allow Nuclear inspections, subject to final negotiations, adding: Very exciting!Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also praised the important commitments, saying he invited his North Korean counterpart to meet next week on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, and representatives of both sides to meet at the earliest opportunity in Vienna, home of the International Atomic Energy Agency.President Moon collects water from Lake Heaven at the bottom of Mount PaektuWashington was ready to engage immediately in negotiations to achieve the North\u0027s denuclearisation by January 2021, Pompeo added - the end of Trump\u0027s first term.The process had stalled after the historic Singapore summit between Trump and Kim in June, when Kim declared his backing for denuclearisation of the peninsula but no details were agreed.Washington and Pyongyang have subsequently sparred over what that means and how it will be achieved, with the Trump administration consistently referring to the denuclearisation of North Korea specifically.For its part, Pyongyang - which wants a formal declaration the 1950-53 Korean War is over - has condemned demands for its unilateral disarmament as gangster-like.Experts remain sceptical, pointing out that closing Tongchang-ri, also known as Sohae, would have no impact on the North\u0027s ability to manufacture rockets. Pyongyang has used several other locations for missile launches and has repeatedly said it has no need for further testing.Many also believe that apart from Yongbyon, the North also has covert nuclear facilities.The North Koreans are offering gestures that mimic disarmament, arms control expert Jeffrey Lewis tweeted. They don\u0027t meaningfully constrain North Korea\u0027s nuclear programme.Their main purpose, he added, was to appease Trump, so that Moon and Kim can keep their engagement alive.This is what an Israel-style deal looks like with North Korea: They pretend to disarm and we pretend to believe it.Moon and Kim have sought to strengthen the North-South relationship at their Pyongyang summit, agreeing that the North Korean leader will visit Seoul at an early date.It would be the first such trip by a North Korean leader since the Korean War ended in an armistice, leaving the peninsula ided by the Demilitarized Zone and technically still in a state of war, and Moon said the historic journey could happen later this year.The two leaders also agreed to open a permanent facility for family reunions, work towards joining up road and rail links, and bid jointly for the 2032 Olympics.At a performance of the North\u0027s spectacular Mass Games propaganda display, Moon made an unprecedented address by a South Korean leader to a Northern crowd, telling them that Koreans had lived together for 5,000 years.I propose we move forward toward the big picture of peace in which the past 70-year-long hostility can be eradicated and we can become one again, he said, prompting rapturous applause.On Thursday, Moon and Kim, accompanied by their wives, visited Mount Paektu on the Chinese border.Beyond the pomp and pageantry, Moon is keeping delicate denuclearisation talks with North Korea on trackThe 2,744-metre (9,003-foot) peak is considered sacred to all Koreans as the birthplace of Dangun, the legendary founder of the first Korean kingdom.According to Pyongyang\u0027s narrative, it is also where Kim Jong-un\u0027s father Kim Jong-il was born, at a secret camp where his own father, the North\u0027s founder Kim Il-sung, was fighting Korea\u0027s Japanese colonial occupiers. However, overseas historians say Kim Jong-il was born in the Soviet Union, where his father was in exile.South Korean tourists flock to see the mountain via China, but only a handful of Southerners have been granted access from the North Korean side, mostly for research purposes.Pictures showed Kim and Moon both in black coats on the crater rim, their clasped hands raised aloft, and the South Korean president expressed his hope that many of his countrymen would follow in his footsteps.Please review our commenting policyShocking moment patrolman rescues dog leashed to moving lorryHead of the prison service sacked amid growing concerns over rise of violence in jailsComment: If May doesn\u0026#39t sack her Project Fear-loving Chancellor, we can only assume she agrees with himShinzo Abe insists on reforming pacifist constitution as he is set to break record for longest serving PMBrexit: EU leaders \u0026#39almost unanimous\u0026#39 in support for second UK referendum - latest newsChris Grayling admits he was \u0026#39wrong\u0026#39 to trust rail bosses over timetable overhaul following damning report by regulatorUK weather: More strong winds to batter Britain with \u0026#39danger to life warning\u0026#39 after Storm Ali kills twoAircraft forced to emergency land on residential Texas streetTom Watson suggests Jeremy Corbyn adviser is peddling \u0026#39fake news\u0026#39 over claim that secret service is trying to block a Labour government Leaked Tory dossier reveals secret plan to replace Theresa May in April and ranks her possible successors Ian Paisley avoids by-election by 400 votes after failing to declare Sri Lankan holidaysComment: May misses what Thatcher understood: people want a home of their ownSNP ministers \u0026#39unlikely\u0026#39 to meet target of superfast broadband for every home by 2021, says auditComment: Big tech\u0026#39s suppression of conservative voices is the greatest threat to free speech we faceComment: It is not just illegal immigrants who should be worried by the Trump administration\u0026#39s get tough policyShrewsbury baby scandal at maternity unit expands to 100 casesBritain is willing to walk away without a deal, Theresa May warns EU leaders in SalzburgSmoking will be \u0026#39eradicated in England by 2030\u0026#39This conference season, don\u0026#39t miss out on Front Bench, The \u0026#39s morning politics newsletterProblem with migrants?

Crucially, prospective students should have access to excellent information, advice and guidance in order to understand what options are available.\u0026nbspThis will help ensure that people from all ages and all backgrounds can make the most of the life-changing opportunities offered by higher education.”UK news in picturesStorm Ali has hit the British Isles bringing winds of up to 100mph.

They now intend to examine the data in greater depth to learn more about the Milky Way’s history.“The discovery was easy the interpretations harder. And the full understanding of its meaning and implications might take several years,” Said Dr Amina Helmi from the University of Groningen, who also contributed to the research.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":null,"title":"subscribe to the daily edition our newspaper for your tablet","story":"For full functionality of this site it is necessary to enable JavaScript...Please follow the instructions in the link below.Please upgrade your browser to improve your experience."},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2014/08/07/11/maroon-5.jpg","title":"super bowl 2019 maroon 5 halftime show performer adam levine who","story":"Created with Sketch.Los Angeles based pop band to perform in AtlantaClick to followThe Independent CultureMaroon 5 formed in Los Angeles in the 1990s.

opportunities.”Lord Kerr also repeated his insistence that the Article 50 notification could, if necessary, be revoked unilaterally to halt the Brexit process – a “cost free” option.Downing Street has been accused of suppressing legal advice that Article 50 can be withdrawn, even without Brussels’\u0026nbspagreement.The report also suggests the preferable question on the ballot paper for a fresh

crack down on people smugglers advertising their services to people in developing countries via Facebook in a bid to stem the flow of undocumented migrants to the UK at its source.The UK has identified 539 social media pages – the vast majority on Facebook – which it says are used by people illegally offering others transit to Europe.“We must now match our pursuit of people smugglers and traffickers with a renewed effort to prevent immigration crime from occurring in the first place,” Theresa May told EU leaders at a migration summit in Salzburg“To achieve this, we must tackle the enabling environment – all those factors that make it far too easy for criminal networks to emerge and grow, putting migrants’ lives at such risk.”Groups are openly advertising illegal transit services on Facebook with “travel agent” style ads, with some even offering discounts for children.The Government has tried to partly blame criminal gangs and “people smugglers” for refugees and migrants travelling to Europe.Many people are however fleeing conflict zones or economic and social turmoil and lack other means to reach Europe to claim asylum.\u0026nbspThe Government is also funding advertising and outreach campaigns in countries like Ethiopia and Sudan to convince would-be migrants that it is a bad idea to come to the UK.\u0026nbspSpeaking at the Salzburg summit the Prime Minister offered to share UK expertise on cyber-policing with other countries, stating that “online platforms have no respect for borders”.\u0026nbsp She said cooperation in this and other areas would be unaffected by Brexit. \u0026nbspThanks in part to populist governments exploiting the issue, migration is still at the top of the agenda at the EU level despite a massive fall in people

Used fur products would be exempt.The council is considering an exemption for products used for religious purposes, such as fur hats worn by Orthodox Jews,\u0026nbspas well as for items made from pelts legally taken under the authority of a California fur-trapping license.Major fashion companies, including Michael Kors, Armani and Gucci, have also moved away from using fur. Earlier this month, Burberry said it would stop selling real fur.\u0026nbspActivists have condemned the fur industry as inhumane, arguing that the animals are subject to brutal conditions and torturous deaths.However, Keith Kaplan, a spokesman for the Fur Information Council of America, said that while full-length coats of sable and mink may not be as popular as they once were, fur is still found in around 70 per cent of the world’s latest autumn fashion collections.“If consumers weren’t buying it, fashion houses wouldn’t be designing it, and manufacturers wouldn’t be making it,” he said.He also disputed as “bogus” claims by animal rights groups that the methods employed by the fur industry are inherently cruel and inhumane.Retail fur sales globally accounted for $35.8bn (£27.2bn), and the fur industry employed more than one\u0026nbspmillion people in 2014, the latest year figures were available from the industry, Mr Kaplan said.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMPs to ban import of animal furResponding to news of the ban, Humane Society International (HSI) called on the British government to work towards making the UK the first country in the world to ban the sale of animal fur.Farming fur was made illegal in the UK in 2000, and EU law bans fur from domestic cats, dogs and hunted seals. However, Britain imports fur from other species including foxes and rabbits.Claire Bass, HSI UK’s executive director, said:\u0026nbsp“A cruel product like fur has no place in the City of Angels, and we applaud the Los Angeles City council for taking a moral stand.“Now it is time for the UK government to show equal compassion and listen to the vast majority of British people who want the UK to become the first country in the world to fully ban the sale of animal fur.“Our government has stated its ambition for the UK\u0026nbspto be ‘a world leader in animal welfare’, blazing a trail as the first country to outlaw the cruel and unnecessary fur trade would show that this ambition will be delivered with actions, not just words. The sale of cat, dog and seal fur is already banned here so now let’s finish the job and ban fur full stop.”Additional reporting by agenciesEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/10/21/un-1.jpg  width= 2048  height= 1536  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/10/21/un-1.jpg","title":"putin erdogan syria idlib sochi russia turkey talks","story":"Created with Sketch.Gathering is second in 10 days for the Turkish and Russian leadersClick to followThe IndependentBattle for Syria\u0027s last major rebel bastion on hold as Putin and Erdogan meet to discuss next movesThe leaders of Turkey and Russia are meeting in Sochi on Monday for hastily arranged talks\u0026nbspover the fate of Syria’s last major rebel stronghold.For now the impending\u0026nbspoffensive on Idlib province, touted for weeks by Damascus and its Russian and Iranian backers, appears to be on hold as a result of Turkish diplomatic agitation and military manoeuvres.Turkey is struggling to prevent an onslaught by pro-Damascus forces on the rebel-held Idlib province, but its moves may have also escalated the potential dangers of the conflict.“We will continue our efforts with Iran and with Russia,” Turkey’s foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said at a press conference in Islamabad late last week. “We will continue our efforts on international platforms as well.”In recent days, Turkey has begun fortifying positions in Idlib ahead of the Russian-backed Syrian government offensive. Turkey\u0026nbsphas amassed armoured vehicles, artillery guns, and tanks along the border with Syria, with some equipment moving across the frontier, according to Turkish news outlets and video footage posted to the internet.It has transferred arms and ammunition to its Free Syria Army (FSA) rebel allies, pro-Ankara newspapers reported, though some experts say the distribution of weapons won’t affect the outcome of any conflict. \u0026nbspIdlib province on 11 September in anticipation for an upcoming government forces offensive (Getty)Turkey has also begun to bolster a dozen outposts it operates in and around Idlib with additional troops and military vehicles. The military positions were set up in cooperation with Russia and Iran as mechanisms worked out during a series of talks that began in the Kazakh capital of Astana to monitor local truce deals.Fears for 3m people in rebel-held Idlib ahead of regime offensiveA Syrian protester waves a flag of the opposition as during a protest against the regime and its ally Russia, in the rebel-held town of Maaret al-Numan in the north of Idlib provinceSyrian rebel fighters from the recently-formed National Liberation Front stand guard over a trench as rebels prepare defensive positions in anticipation for an upcoming government forces offensiveA Syrian rebel fighter looks through an embrasure in a make-shift bunkerA Syrian protester waves a flag of the oppositionA Syrian protester waves a flag of the opposition as during a protest against the regime and its ally Russia, in the rebel-held town of Maaret al-Numan in the north of Idlib provinceSyrian rebel fighters from the recently-formed National Liberation Front stand guard over a trench as rebels prepare defensive positions in anticipation for an upcoming government forces offensiveA Syrian rebel fighter looks through an embrasure in a make-shift bunkerA Syrian protester waves a flag of the opposition“These 12 observation points were equipped with limited military equipment and their main role was to monitor the agreement done in Astana,” said Nawar Oliver, a Syria specialist at the Omran Institute for Strategic Studies, a think tank in Istanbul. “At the moment when the regime started to mobilise its forces around Idlib, Turkey started to send reinforcements to some of these points.”Syrian forces aided by Russian air power could easily overrun the outposts. But Turkey’s moves have upped the geopolitical cost of any attempt to take Idlib by the pro-Assad camp that includes Russia, Iran, and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, as well as Iraqi Shia militias backed by Tehran.Around three\u0026nbspmillion Syrians live in Idlib province, a hilly agricultural region by\u0026nbspthe Turkish border. Many of the displaced have resettled in the province from other parts of the country or were forcibly relocated there from opposition enclaves recaptured by Damascus.Turkey, the primary patron of the Syrian opposition and the host to 3.5 million displaced Syrians, has vehemently opposed the regime offensive to retake Idlib. The US and Europe have urged a political solution over Idlib and warned against the military campaign. US envoy to the UN Nikki Haley repeated warnings that any use of chemical weapons by the regime would trigger a response by Washington.The UK on Saturday warned of an impending humanitarian crisis amid reports of attacks on hospitals and clinics in rebel-held territory. “The UK has been clear that a man-made catastrophe in Idlib is entirely avoidable,” Alistair Burt, Middle East minister, said in a a press release. “We support the urgent diplomatic efforts being made by Turkey and the UN.”Ankara worries in part that another bloody confrontation in Syria could flood Turkey and Europe with hundreds of thousands of fresh refugees.Airstrikes in in Idlib, northwestern SyriaAlready, thousands of displaced Syrians have relocated from the southern edges of Idlib and northern Hama province to the Turkish-controlled Afrin district adjacent to the border, said a source in Afrin. On Friday, Turkey hosted a meeting of French, German\u0026nbspand Russian officials ahead of a possible meeting of those countries’ leaders over Idlib.In addition to a possible confrontation between pro-Assad forces and Turkey, Idlib could be the flashpoint for a conflict with jihadi forces that dominate parts of the province. In recent days, al-Qaeda’s international supporters on social media have also blasted fellow jihadis in Idlib for allowing Turkey to dispatch armoured vehicles and trucks carrying tanks into Syria, as depicted in videos posted on social media.A 13 September statement signed by 15 prominent al-Qaeda supporters questioned Hayat Tahrir\u0026nbspal-Sham (HTS), the jihadi group that is a dominant player in Idlib, for granting Turkey access to the province.Mr Oliver suggested Turkey could be bolstering the observation points for fear of attacks by jihadis as well as to stymie Damascus’s offensive. “The internal problems for Idlib are huge,” he said. “We are talking about an area that has FSA factions, HTS, you have Isis\u0026nbspcells, you have other small entities.”For now Turkey’s moves have complicated plans to retake Idlib. Syrian civilians have begun to mass around the bolstered observation points in hopes that they won’t be struck by government and Russian warplanes. Thousands of Syrians who have fled the attacks of the regime and Russia are settling in the areas where the Turkish army\u0027s military posts are, because they think it is safe, the pro-government Vatan newspaper reported, publishing photos showing people purported to be sheltering near the outposts.On Friday, for the second week in a row, thousands of Syrians in the province took to the streets in peaceful, colourful demonstrations that recalled the first months of the 2011 uprising against the Assad family’s decades-long dictatorship. “For the time being, everything is postponed,” Mr Oliver said. “There is no final agreement and no final disagreement.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/07/15/251230075-files-this-photograph-taken-on-september-12-2017-shows-rohingya-refugees-arriving-by-boat.jpg  width= 2048  height= 1536  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/07/15/251230075-files-this-photograph-taken-on-september-12-2017-shows-rohingya-refugees-arriving-by-boat.jpg","title":"un myanmar rohingya genocide united nations","story":"Created with Sketch.Click to followThe IndependentInternational Criminal Court to investigate Myanmar’s Rohingya deportationsThe International Criminal Court (ICC) has launched a preliminary investigation into the Rohingya crisis to determine whether the mass deportations of Muslims from Myanmar into Bangladesh was a crime against humanity.Chief prosecutor Fatou Bensouda\u0026nbspsaid\u0026nbspif the evidence collected in the initial probe was sufficient, it would pave the way for a full-blown investigation.Myanmar\u0027s military has been accused of a horrifying list of\u0026nbspviolations, including rape, murder, torture and the burning of Rohingya villages, leading about 700,000 people to flee to neighbouring Bangladesh.Ms Bensouda said she will look at reports of “a number of alleged coercive acts having resulted in the forced displacement of the Rohingya people, including deprivation of fundamental rights, killing, sexual violence, enforced disappearance, destruction and looting”.Suu Kyi defends jailing of journalists who covered Rohingya killingsICC rules it can investigate crimes against RohingyaJournalists covering Rohingya crisis jailed for seven years in MyanmarAlthough Myanmar is not a member of the Hague-based court, Bangladesh is.

May demands Corbyn and Labour rule out second Brexit referendum                Raab insists Brexit date will NOT be delayed - even if no dealAny deal had to be concluded in time for an expected special EU summit pencilled in for mid-November, according to officials.This signals the fact that a very, very serious discussion is about to take place, a senior Government official said.Mrs May delivered her ultimatum as she was given the floor at an informal summit in Salzburg to address the other 27 EU leaders about her Chequers plan for a future partnership for the first time.Emphasising that time was running out, she said: We all recognise that time is short but delaying or extending these negotiations is not an option.I know that for many of you Brexit is not something you want but it\u0027s important to be clear there will be on second referendum in the UK.The public has delivered its verdict and I as Prime Minister will deliver upon that - the UK will leave on the 29th of March next year.I believe I have put forward serious and workable proposals. We will of course not agree on every detail but hopefully you will respond in kind.The onus is now on all of us to get this deal done.Theresa May said delaying or extending these negotiations is not an option (Image: \u0026bullREUTERS)Mrs May also signalled her dissatisfaction with proposals floated by EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier for simplifying the so-called Irish backstop mechanism put forward for stop-gap customs arrangements between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic after Brexit.The Brussels diplomat had suggested that digital technology could be deployed to check goods being shipped between the province and the UK mainland to avoid having any new border infrastructure between the two territories.Mrs May told the EU leaders: There are two elements to tackling the unique situation in Northern Ireland.We need a sustainable relationship that enables frictionless trade - that is at the heart of our white paper.But we also remain fully committed to the December joint report including a legally operative protocol for Northern Ireland in the withdrawal agreement.However the commission\u0027s proposal for this protocol that I should assent to a legal separation of the UK into two customs territories is not credible.Mrs May urged the EU to come to a deal to maintain the deep economic ties between us that so many jobs on livelihoods across Europe depend.She said that Europe as a whole will be stronger and better able to cope with the threats we jointly face by keeping the UK close.Theresa May is greeted by Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz at an informal summit of EU leaders  (Image: )                Brexit: Lord Adonis \u0027lives in a world of his own\u0027 says Brexiteer                Theresa May singles out Sadiq Khan in BRUTAL second referendum tiradeMichel Barnier\u0027s team have has suggested a digital solution to the Irish border (Image: EPA)She added: We have a shared history, we have shared challenges, my desire is for a close shared future.As she arrived at the summit yesterday afternoon, the Prime Minister insisted the Brexit plan set out in a Government white paper document and agreed at her Chequers country retreat was the only credible and negotiable plan on the table that delivers no hard border in Northern Ireland and also delivers on the vote of the British people.Dismissing Mr Banier\u0027s proposals, she said: We cannot accept is seeing Northern Ireland carved away effectively from the United Kingdoms customs territory.And she also repeated her insistence that there is no chance of a second referendum being held.I want to be absolutely clear: this government will never accept a second referendum. The British people have voted to leave the European Union and we will be leaving on the 29th of March, 2019, he said.It\u0026rsquos now a matter of trust in British politicians that we should deliver on the will of the people.Theresa May pictured today before she left for the key EU summit in Salzburg (Image: )Mrs May\u0027s broadside at Brussels followed a demand from EU Council President Donald Tusk for the British proposals to be reworked.But he also appeared to offer hope of fresh EU concessions by insisting that Brussels\u0027s negotiating position had to evolve.Warning that there was less and less time to reach a deal before the UK\u0027s March 29 2019 exit date, Mr Tusk confirmed he would propose an emergency EU Brexit summit in November.The Brexit negotiations are entering the decisive phase.Various scenarios are still possible today but I would like to stress that some of Prime Minister May\u0027s proposals from Chequers indicate a positive evolution in the UK\u0027s approach, as well as the will to minimise the negative effects of Brexit.He added: On other issues such as the Irish question or the framework for economic co-operation the UK\u0027s proposals will need to be reworked and further negotiated.Today there is perhaps more hope, but there is surely less and less time.Casting more doubt on the talks, EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker yesterday claimed a Brexit deal was still far away.Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, hosting yesterday\u0027s summit, raised the alarm about the damage a collapse in the Brexit talks could do to the European economy.We are convinced that we need a deal. We must do everything to avoid a hard Brexit. It would not just harm British, but would also cause damage for us in Europe, he said.We are striving to make a compromise possible. Michel Barnier is doing well, he has our full support. He has taken a step towards the British. Now we expect a willingness to compromise from the British hopefully to bring about a deal.We will propose today there is an extraordinary summit in November and if the member states support this, it will happen. Hopefully by then we will reach an agreement with Great Britain.German Chancellor Angela Merkel said: I hope that we have an exit that takes place in a good atmosphere, with great respect for each other and that in certain areas very close cooperation is possible, namely in the areas of security - of domestic and also foreign security.Analysis by Macer HallFittingly, Theresa May last night made her latest pitch for an EU exit deal in a film location used for one of cinema\u0027s great escape scenes.In The Sound Of Music, the children of the Von Trapp family sing So long, farewell, Auf Wiedersehen, good night while discreetly slipping away from Salzburg\u0027s Felsenreitschule theatre.Securing Britain\u0027s goodbye to the EU is proving to be a far more drawn-out process.In her address to EU leaders over a dinner of cream cheese and Wiener Schnitzel in Salzburg last night, she laid bare her frustrations with the glacial progress of the talks.EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier might have begun to hint at some flexibility - but British officials have yet to see any firm proposals.Mr Barnier\u0027s team have doggedly stuck to textbook EU tactics of dragging every round out to the last possible moment, and Mrs May is all too aware that Brussels will do anything possible to delay the departure process.Mrs May also suspects some EU officials are paying too much heed to the witterings about a second referendum from some quarters at Westminster.Macer Hall quizzes Prime Minister Theresa May in Downing Street (Image: Tim Clarke)Yet behind the increasingly curt exchanges about timing, officials are understood to be making progress on details.And while Mr Barnier\u0027s initial proposal is unacceptable to Britain, they are hopeful a more serious plan deploying technology to solve the Irish border conundrum is on the way.Mrs May last night confirmed she will not tolerate a long goodbye and Brussels may be about to be forced to wake up to the realisation that Britain meant what is said when it voted to leave the EU.Behind their posturing is a recognition that time is running out and the EU could face a shattering financial blow as Britain holds back much of the promised \u0026pound39billion fee.EU chiefs are desperately trying to climb down without losing face.

Heres what you need to know.After a marathon session of talks at Chequers on July 6, Theresa May managed to secure a Brexit plan which will be assessed by the EU.Her Brexit plan will see the UK remain closely tied to Brussels.It also includes the creation of a new UK-EU free trade area for goods, with a common rulebook.This rulebook could limit the UKs ability to strike trade deals with countries such as the US, for whom securing market access for American farmers would be a big prize.Mrs May has agreed to an amendment that would stop Britain being tied to Europes customs union after we quit the EU.In dramatic scenes in the House of Commons on July 17 2018, Mrs May managed to see off a damaging attempt, winning by just six votes.Mrs May was then defeated on a separate amendment to her flagship Trade Bill, which will require her to seek continued UK participation in the EUs system for regulation of medicines after Brexit.Now her Cabinet is required to ensure that the UK can continue to participate in the regulatory network operated by the European Medicines Agency.Mrs May hopes to get an agreement hammered out at a series of summits with EU leaders this autumn, and bring it back to Parliament for approval.A deal on the UKs withdrawal agreement was expected to be agreed in time for the summit in October, along with a statement from both sides on the future relationship.However, a number of senior figures have said this deadline may slide into November.Once a deal has been agreed, MPs will be asked to approve it.In a Panorama interview in September 2018 she said MPs had a simple choice between her Chequers plan or no deal.She told the BBC current affairs programme: I think that the alternative to that [the Chequers plan] will be not having a deal.Opposition to the plan in the Conservative Party centres around the European Research Group of Hard Brexit supporting MPs led by Jacob Rees-Mogg.His voice had been among the loudest voicing their objection to the plan and he urged MPs “chuck Chequers”.Up to 80 Tory MPs are prepared to vote against Theresa Mays Chequers plan, Steve Baker, a former Brexit minister and ERG backer has warned.A group of about 50 Tory MPs have met to discuss how and when they could force her out of her job, the BBC reported.Also voicing his opposition to the Chequers deal has been Boris Johnson.He said Theresas Mays had wrapped a suicide vest around the British constitution and handed the detonator to Brussels.The former Foreign Secretary later claimed Mrs Mays disastrous plans for the Irish border would leave Britain at a loss.Boris Johnson said the European Unions fallback position for the Irish border would mean Northern Ireland was annexed by Brussels.Along with former Brexit secretary David Davis, Mr Johnson resigned in protest following the Chequers meeting.Several other MPs also quit their ministerial posts over the issue, including Steve Baker, Maria Caulfield, Ben Bradley and Robert Courts.The party will vote down any Brexit deal brought back from Brussels by Theresa May, according to shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry.The Corbyn ally said the party will oppose it to try to force an election by Christmas.Speaking to the FT she said a deal which meets her party’s tests was “not going to happen”, and therefore the Prime Minister would be forced to quit.Without the support of the opposition party, it would need just a handful of Tory rebels to vote against her to see it defeated.Theresa Mays initial plans brought her on side with those Conservatives who favour a soft Brexit.The Prime Minister has also been seeking grassroots Tory support for the plan.Among those voicing support for the Prime Minister has been Environment Secretary Michael Gove, who was a prominent member of the Leave campaign.He said he was confident that the Prime Minister will go into the Conservative Party conference and beyond, securing a good Brexit deal for Britain and continuing to ensure the country enjoys good economic growth and we take advantage of Brexit.A plan may have been cooked up but it still needs to get past the EU — and the continent’s leaders are

This noise, you couldnt avoid it.Speaking at a pre-screening he described the experience of no one recognising him from his travel shows or Monty Python.They didn’t know what a great star meant and basically to them I was a really old bloke and with their reverence for age the minder would rather delightfully would take my arm and say Are you feeling tired?In the second episode, there is a small sequence, and we were stuck in this airport and just to pass the time, our Director Neil, had brought along some footage of Monty Python and showed one minder the fish slapping dance.And her only comment at the end was, “Was that a live fish?”Palins journey begins by boarding a train from Beijing to Pyongyang - North Koreas capital.Not yet under the microscope of their full-time minders, the change in the landscape is remarkable.A shore dominated by Dandongs high-rises faces greenery and scattered buildings across the Yalu River on the North Korean side.Immediately, everything looks dferent, its as  weve stepped back inside, Palin says.His first taste of North Korean hospitality arrives in the form of a series of border guards, all intent on checking and rechecking his documentation.Palin makes it clear early on he is not going to allow an oppressive totalitarian dictatorship quash his famous sense of humour.I was asked - did I have a bible with me? I would normally say yes, absolutely, Im a good Christian man, but no, thats the wrong answer here.The second taste comes during a lunch taken on the 200-mile train journey comes with a side order of Korean propaganda as the television touts images of nuclear weapons.Off the train he meets his two guides - who turn out to actually number eight.He finds himself in a city missing many staples of the west - there are very few cars, and absolutely no adverts save for party propaganda.State controlled newspapers are covered with news of the historic meeting between north and south which were occurring at the time, and Plain says he sensed a eagerness for more openness among the populace.Palin points out how, until recently, the city would have been a soulless landscape of grey Soviet-style apartment blocks.In a simple and effective solution, Kim Jong-il commanded the whole lot was painted bright colours.Palin provides no shortage of humour titbits, including one point when he finds himself mystied watching the robotic movements of the traffic controllers - all of whom, he notes, are young women.Theres rumour that Kim Jong-un picks them himself, he says.He visits a local school and marvels at the childrens ping pong skills.Its like a factory farm for ping pong players, he says.Viewers can also look forward to the drunken antics of May Day - an annual day off for North Koreans.The celebrations allow a powerful insight into what Palin says are normal people, living in an unusual place."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000394072374.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"tony blair nick clegg and john major meet with european leaders in secret plot to keep britain in the eu","story":"The two former Prime Ministers and former Deputy Prime Minister have meet with senior politicians in Europe in bid to persuade them to stop the UK leaving the European Union.They have also been working with other prominent Remainers including Peter Mandelson.The mission was begun by Mr Clegg independently but he has taken on the role of informal co-ordinator of the group,  reported.In recent weeks Clegg he met Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister and the foreign policy team of the French president, Emmanuel Macron.He has also met senior German politicians including Bundestag president Wolfgang Schäuble and Peter Altmeier, the German economics minister.Last week Blair met senior politicians in Germany and Austria and Italy’s new interior minister, Matteo Salvini as well as the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier.Both have said they would be looking for Article 50 to be extended so a deal can be struck to remain in the EU that addresses concerns about immigration.“The aim of the visits is to persuade EU leaders that British politics has made the option of remaining inside the EU viable,” said Mr Clegg.“It is a question of pressing them to keep open the extension of the article 50 process beyond the March deadline to give UK negotiators more time including to prepare legislation on a people’s vote.“We cannot just turn the clock back to just before the 2016 referendum.“There would have to be some changes of freedom of movement - we cannot just put Humpty Dumpty back together again.”Mr Blair, who met Barnier on 18 July, said the main focus of his meetings was discuss a new common approach to immigration in the UK and EU.“You cannot deal with this Brexit issue unless you deal with the questions of immigration and the anxieties that gave rise to it,” he said.At a meeting on Wednesday night in Salzburg, Austria, Theresa May will have a chance to try to persuade other EU leaders to adopt her Chequers plan to for the future relationship with Brussels."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/dk-graphic-page14may.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"jacob rees mogg column theresa may brexit","story":"The Prime Minister will head to the continent on Thursday to visit Salzburg — like Bath, a world heritage city — to discuss her Brexit or Chequers proposals with other leaders of European governments.To date the EU has been officially dismissive of the main elements of Chequers, the complex customs arrangements and continued use of European Rules to secure access to the single market.Michel Barnier, who led the negotiations for the EU, has been clear that the EU cannot accept this position.The UK must either be in the Single Market with all that goes with it — including free movement — or it may have a free trade deal instead.In a sense, he is the keeper of the Orlamme for the EU.Historically, this was a sacred banner carried into battle for the kings of France when no prisoners were to be taken.The heads of government may be more conciliatory and keener to help a fellow leader, not least as most of them face their own domestic dficulties.It is also the usual form for the EU to make a deal.It protests that it is strictly a rules-based organisation to maximise its negotiating strength but then, like an honest costermonger, makes the necessary trade.At the same time the British Government seems desperate to agree something on almost any terms.Chequers rubbed out the Prime Minister’s red lines to leave the UK “half in, half out” subject to EU regulations in crucial areas of the economy, and to the European Court of Justice.The vassal has been put in chains.This desperation means it will be important to watch carefully what comes out of Salzburg.Any deal will be hailed initially as a triumph because of the hostile comments made not only by Mr Barnier but, in his recent state of the Union speech, by Jean-Claude Juncker.Overcoming these obstacles will be portrayed as a triumph for British diplomacy.Those who hope that Brexit will continue to mean Brexit will need to stay awake.The first item to watch out for is money. There is no legal obligation to pay anything at all.This has been established by the House of Lords and no credible authority has questioned their Lordships.If we pay £40billon we must get something clear in , not just wishy-washy promises.Taxpayers would be outraged  it were otherwise.Any agreement on immigration must be examined with great care.We will doubtless be told that free movement has ended but, as Shakespeare wrote, “what’s in a name? that which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet”.There ought to be no preferential terms for new arrivals from the EU above those offered to other nations and no access to state benefits.There must be a clear dferentiation in their rights after we have left and admission must be subject to a work permit scheme focused on skilled rather than unskilled labour.The solution to the Irish question is a further area where Brexiteers must be alert. Last week the European Research Group, which I chair, produced a paper explaining how it could be answered on the EU’s terms.Obviously the UK could simply say that there will be no physical infrastructure at the border but  instead we examine what the EU does on its other borders, and see  those precedents could be followed, then no reasonable person would think a “hard” border were necessary.So far the inevitable attacks on our reports have been mere rudery. No one has found fault with facts.If Ireland were used to justy the major concessions the Government is giving then we would know the deal is a bad one based on a false premise.It would be better than any other which the EU has so far agreed but Ireland is supposed to make it impossible.The issue has been used by those who are fearful of leaving the EU to keep us bound by its rules and regulations.Inevitably these complex machinations have led to some gossip about the leadership.These stories come from all wings of the Party with pro-Europeans such as Tom Tugendhat and George Freeman suggesting it is time to move to a new generationHowever, it is worth remembering the Prime Minister’s virtues.She is determined, thorough and dutul, and in my view duty is an heroic virtue.This gives her great strength and without a clear Parliamentary majority it is not obvious that anyone else could steer the negations to a conclusion.Pitt the Younger was hailed as the pilot who weathered the storm.

Nobody wants it.But this self-described “bloody dficult woman” believes she alone can ram it through.Either she knows something nobody else does . . . or her fabled “polished turd” is about to hit the fan.On tonight’s BBC’s Panorama, Mrs May spells out the formula she thinks propelled her to the top: “You bide your time and you are bloody dficult when it really matters.”Others fear a dferent characteristic has defined her political career, especially as Home Secretary.“She is mulishly stubborn,” says a former ally.“Once she digs her heels in, nothing can sht her — right or wrong.”They fear she will stick defiantly to her half-baked plan until she runs out of road and is forced to choose between an EU fudge or defeat in the House of Commons.The Chequers deal is flawed by the fantasy we can follow an EU rule book on free trade and regulation while reserving the right to duck and e.Outside Cabinet, Tories on all sides — Brexiteers and Remainers — insist it is unworkable.“It fails to take back control of our laws, borders, money and trade,” writes ex-Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith.“We would be out of Europe yet still run by Europe.”EU negotiator Michel Barnier fears it endangers the whole EU project, which is already threatened by tensions over mass immigration, the Euro and jobless school leavers.Special treatment for the UK would instantly trigger demands from other member states for their own tailor-made deals, unravelling the drive for ever-closer union.Mrs May claims there is no alternative to Chequers.But there has to be — and Britain is already working on it.Despite Chancellor Phil Hammond’s blundering interference, preparations for a clean break are in train, covering everything from free trade to the vexed border with Northern Ireland.It may be pitched as a last-ditch option, only to be deployed in an emergency.But since Chequers is universally seen as a non-starter, free trade automatically becomes the only viable plan on the UK table.New Brexit minister, karate black belt and rising star Dominic Raab, is making this vividly clear in Brussels.He alarmed Downing Street by threatening to withhold the EU’s £40billion ransom  they push us too far.And he has told Barnier to do his own dirty work and impose a border in the Irish Sea  he dares.This is music to the ears of Tory MPs who desperately yearn to see some fighting spirit.They hope against hope Mrs May secretly has a cunning plan, ready to roll out at the right moment as she suggests, calling Barnier’s bluff.But there is another red card on the table, face up and flashing danger to our EU neighbours.Do they want to humiliate the PM to the point where she is defeated in Parliament and pushed into a second catastrophic election?EU leaders can read the polls which put Labour in front.They will also be horried to see ex-Tory vice-chairman Jeffrey Archer unhelpfully saying he would vote for Corbyn  he were a Northerner.And we should all be alarmed by David Cameron’s Goldman Sachs-trained Treasury minister, Jim O’Neill, saying: “I find myself struggling to be that scared by the prospect of a Corbyn government.”The EC has enough on its plate with the growing explosion of anti-Brussels populism across Europe. The last thing it wants any time soon is a hard-left Labour government led by lelong EU-haters Jeremy Corbyn and Marxist Chancellor John McDonnell.It might be the one bargaining chip that makes Michel Barnier blink first.For a Bank of England governor, his forecast of a 35 per cent crash in house prices verged on the hysterical.Project Fear has lost the power to shock, but it won’t stop trying.Aircraft will not fall from the sky, the Channel Tunnel will stay open, NHS patients will not starve or die from lack of NHS drugs.Not only have Carney’s nightmare scenarios of slump and mass unemployment proved false, the reverse has happened.Young workers are flocking to the UK for jobs. Wages are rising. Growth is strong.Now we see French companies such as Chanel stampeding to invest billions here.

And the influx continues.Latest statistics show the number of migrants who settled here in the year to March 2018 was 614,000, equal to a city bigger than Bristol. Net migration was around 270,000.Yet the revolution has been imposed by the ruling elite without any consent. No British citizen was ever asked to vote for this upheaval. No major party ever sought a mandate to open our doors.This helps to explain why the British public has such profound distrust in MPs on the question of immigration, as revealed in a major new opinion survey published this week.In the biggest consultation of its kind, involving 20,000 interviews, just one in six people showed any faith in the Government to tackle migration, while only 13 per cent felt that politicians are “open and honest” about the issue.These findings are not the result of bigotry or prejudice. Britons have been remarkably tolerant in the face of change.Indeed, that shines through the survey, which discovered that 65 per cent of people believe migrants bring valuable skills to the economy and the public sector. Similarly, 59 per cent think that ersity benefits our national culture.But British decency has been exploited by the political class to implement its agenda, with the result that disillusion is now widespread.People are rightly fed up with politicians who indulge in denial and deceit about the reality of mass immigration.A classic example was the phoney claim from the last Labour Government that, when the former communist countries of eastern Europe joined the EU in 2004, just 13,000 of their citizens would come to the UK. In fact, more than a million did.Even worse has been the attempt, particularly by the Left, to suppress open discussion by hurling accusations of racism against critics of mass immigration.A climate of censorship now prevails where public figures are expected to parrot the fashionable orthodoxy, and ordinary citizens are afraid to voice their concerns.Yet the anxieties of the public are all too genuine. Immigration has imposed more strain on our civic infrastructure, reflected in the shortage of affordable housing, the never-ending NHS crisis, the growth in the welfare burden and dficulties for parents in finding school places for kids.The import of cheap foreign labour has meant lower wages and job insecurity. Just as disturbing is the erosion of solidarity because of this upheaval.Social cohesion cannot exist without real integration, as the public recognised in the survey.The majority of respondents, 88 per cent, agreed with the idea that “migrants should learn English” and 85 per cent believe that migrants “should share our values”.But the multicultural ideology, which has long been the creed of the state, works in the opposite direction.It encourages migrants to cling to the practices and languages of their native lands, fuelling ision. As does the institutionalised acceptance of sharia law, which arguably offers more protection to men than women, undermining the traditional concept that we are all equal before the law.The consequences of multi-culturalism are seen at their most corrosive in the failure by the state to tackle serious crimes perpetrated by ethnic minorities, such as the organised abuse of girls by mainly Asian gangs in places like Rotherham and Derby.More concerned to uphold the illusion of cultural ersity’s success than to protect victims of crime, the police and other authorities indulged in a cover-up. It was only exposure of the abuse by journalists that finally forced them to act.That mix of official dishonesty and paralysis only undermines our society. There is a lesson for us from Europe, where the political order is threatened by growing public anger over immigration.In 2010, German Chancellor Angela Merkel declared that “this multi-cultural approach has failed.” But she did nothing to reverse the policy. Instead, she opened the door even wider, especially in 2015 when she allowed in more than a million migrants.The crime that followed has led to public outcry.Britain has always been renowned for its avoidance of extremism. But we will avoid the same fate only  the state adopts a new approach on immigration, including more political honesty, tighter border controls and an emphasis on British values.That is not racist. As the public knows, it is a recipe for greater harmony.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And Downing Street then ­produced its convoluted alternative.Except the EU, in the form of Michel Barnier, now believes in the fantasy island unicorn model too.

Nor should they, since it ides the UK.Funny though, isn’t it, how Brussels move the goalposts when it suits them? They have negotiated in bad faith all along.TOO many politicians are in denial about the soaring cost of the NHS and social care. So we applaud Health Secretary Matt Hancock’s imaginative plan to sort the latter.The new lelong insurance system he is considering, compulsory for all workers unless they take a risk and opt out, looks a practical idea to fund part or all of an OAP’s care costs.It would give them peace of mind that they wouldn’t have to spend their savings or the proceeds from their home.Maybe it will work. Maybe not. Regardless, it is to Mr Hancock’s credit that he is starting a grown-up conversation at last over future funding of health.For too long progress has been stymied by the Left using any change to the NHS as a political weapon.But the structure of a health service designed in 1948 now needs a radical rethink.It is time reality dawned.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The public has delivered its verdict, and as Prime Minister I will deliver on that. The UK will leave of 29th of March next year.”Her remarks came as:EU chiefs’ hopes of delaying or even reversing Brexit have been bolstered by Labour leaders such as London mayor Sadiq Khan giving their backing to a second referendum – dubbed a People’s Vote.Mr Tusk savaged the two most important parts of Chequers – a common rule book on goods and a new customs relationship - with a thinly veiled demand for more big concessions from the PM, and also over the Irish border.But he kept open a thin thread of hope for Mrs May by also praising some other elements of her softer Brexit blueprint.Declaring that the Brexit negotiations were entering “the decisive phase”, Mr Tusk said: “I’d like to stress that some of Prime Minister May’s proposals from Chequers indicate a positive evolution in the UK’s approach as well as a will to minimise the negative effects of Brexit.By this I mean, among other things, the readiness to cooperate closely in the area of security and foreign policy.“On other issues such as the Irish question or the framework for economic cooperation the UK’s proposals will need to be reworked and further negotiated.”The EU boss also issued another dire warning on how time was almost up, with just six months to go until Brexit day on March 29, saying: Today there’s perhaps more hope but there’s surely less and less time.“Therefore every day that is left we must use for talks.”WHY is the EU wasting time pressing for a border between Britain and Northern ­Ireland? It’s a non-starter.No Government could consider it. Especially not one entirely reliant on the votes of those most vehemently opposed to splitting up the UK, the DUP.This cannot be news to Brussels. They cannot believe Theresa May will surrender and collapse her Government.Why persist with it? The answer must be: to run down the clock — until, at the last minute, Mrs May agrees virtually anything to avoid a No Deal.Which is why Donald Tusk also still insists key areas of our wildly over-generous Chequers offer must be “reworked”.Mrs May has gone as far as she can. Two Cabinet figures have quit already. She must insist it’s take it or leave it.Only Britain has made genuine compromises in this negotiation, as despondent Brexiteers know only too well.It’s the EU’s turn.A deal must be cracked by the end of the Autumn, he added, and confirmed a final emergency summit would be held in mid November in the hope of sealing it.And EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker also added to the pressure on Mrs May by saying that the UK and EU “are far away” from a deal still.The long-feared for rejection comes just 10 days before the Tories’ turbulent annual conference begins – plunging Mrs May into a fresh confrontation with her angry party.Hardline Brexiteer MPs and party members hate her Chequers blueprint, and even some of its supporters have insisted she must not concede any more ground to the EU.Hitting back at Mr Tusk, No10 insisted Mrs May would not budge a further inch until she hears concessions from the EU first.The PM’s official spokesman said: “What I heard from Donald Tusk is a welcoming of the evolution of the UK’s position and him setting out his plan for a special summit in November when he is hopeful a deal will be done.“What this shows you is the EU is now ready to sit down and start to have a proper discussion on a future partnership.”“The PM has evolved our position. It is now for the EU to evolve it’s position.Earlier the PM joined Ulster Unionists MPs to throw out a fresh bid by Michel Barnier to set up a new customs border down the Irish Sea.Issuing a new pledge to “improve” the EU’s offer to resolve the Irish border stand off, Brussels’ chief negotiator suggested clever technology could replace hard border post between Britain and Ulster.But on her arrival at a summit of EU leaders at Salzburg, the PM said she still cannot accept any separation of the province from the rest of the UK.The DUP’s Westminster leader Nigel Dodds also angrily shot down the Barnier plan, saying: “It still means a border down the Irish Sea”.But Mr Dodds also dubbed it “progress of sorts” that Brussels is now ready to look at technological solutions, having already dismissed it a solution for the Ireland’s North-South border as “magical thinking”.At the leaders’ dinner last night, Mrs May also warned them that there will be no Brexit deal unless their “unacceptable” Irish Sea border demands are dumped.British diplomats hoped for warmer words from EU leaders over Chequers, at least until after the Tory conference in Birmingham.Earlier yesterday, former Brexit Secretary David Davis warned the PM she would fail to keep Chequers on the table, as EU leaders will pile ever more demands for more concessions from.Instead, Mrs May will be forced to “reset” and “step back to what Donald Tusk offered in March” - a Canada-style free trade agreement, Mr Davis argued.Mr Davis told BBC Radio 4s Today programme: All these things will come back and well see more and more pressure, and she will have a deal she wont be able to bring back to the House of Commons because itll be lumbered with loads of other EU demands.“So shes going to have to have something else.The ex-Cabinet minister, who resigned in protest over the Chequers plan in July, also said he had repeatedly told Mrs May there would be a pressure point late in negotiations.Mr Davis added: It’s always the case with the European Union that they move at the last possible minute - after theyve tested your mettle, after theyve taken you to the clf edge, and thats what will happen.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And they’re right to be.As recently as 1991, a third of those aged 16 to 24 owned their own home.Now, that figure is ten per cent.For those aged 25 to 34, the rate has fallen from 66 per cent to 38 per cent.Home ownership rates in Britain are now the fourth lowest in the EU, and we have the second highest proportion of social housing, i.e., people living in homes provided by the State.Earlier this year, we at the Centre for Policy Studies commissioned polling asking young people how government could make their lives better.The top answer was clear — they want housing to be more affordable.And not via cheaper rents — by a three-to-one margin, they wanted the Government to prioritise home ownership.Strikingly, only three per cent of those aged 18 to 24 told us they never wanted to own their own home.They just can’t see themselves being able to afford it for years — often decades.This is a crisis with many causes.The persistent failure, stretching back decades, to build enough new homes. A dysal planning system.Existing homeowners who don’t want their communities disrupted or their views spoiled.A Labour government that made it much easier for buy-to-let landlords to snap up those homes that were being built, and much harder for first-time buyers to do the same — and a financial crash which made that problem so much worse. Yet it’s also a crisis with many solutions.Making it easier to extend or expand existing properties. Changing Green Belt regulations so we protect our most beautul countryside while building on pig farms, or beside railway stations or motorways or electricity substations or other decidedly non-green and unpleasant bits of land.Finding ways  to turn renters into owners, as Margaret Thatcher did with the Right to Buy for council tenants in the 1980s, with more than a little success.But the sad truth is that while the Government has succeeded in dragging up construction levels, it is still not thinking anywhere near radically enough.“Since my very first day in Downing Street, I have made it my personal mission to fix our broken housing system,” Theresa May told the National Housing Federation yesterday.But that mission is in grave jeopardy.A year ago, the Prime Minister endured a triple whammy of embarrassment in her party conference speech — being handed a P45 by a prankster, developing a crippling cough, then seeing the slogan behind her start to fall off.Mrs May bravely endured these trials. But she could do little about the fact that her promise in the same speech to “make the British dream a reality by igniting home ownership once again” was built around a £10billion expansion of the Help to Buy scheme.A scheme which pretty much every economist, including the Government’s own Office for Budget Responsibility, says is mostly serving to push up house prices and make colossally rich housebuilders even richer.Indeed, even as Mrs May was speaking, their collective share price spiked by £1BILLION.Yesterday, the Prime Minister ed to the subject.In a speech to the National Housing Summit, she promised another £2billion for social housing.But even on its own terms, Mrs May’s proposal isn’t a blunderbuss.It’s a pinprick. Not only is the £2billion spread over a decade but it’s a small fraction of the amount that George Osborne cut from the same budgets.And it fits a wider pattern. For all the Government’s rhetoric, the big ideas to get Britain building just aren’t there.One of the keys to David Cameron’s election victory in 2015 — right there on the first page of the Tory manesto — was a promise to extend the Right to Buy to housing associations and to build 200,000 starter homes.The commitment was to create two million more homeowners within five years.As of May 2018, not a single one of those starter homes had been built — and the expansion of Right to Buy is still lodged in the gullet of the Whitehall machine.It’s the same pattern on planning reform.Sajid Javid’s robust proposals as Communities Secretary to break up the oligopoly of the big housebuilders, free up more land and speed up development — all badly needed — were neutered by Downing Street, because it was paranoid about upsetting traditional Tory voters who don’t like the sight of bulldozers.When the Government’s new planning framework was announced in March, the headlines were about building more and higher-quality homes.But the small print made it so that councils could get away with building fewer houses, not more.I don’t doubt that Mrs May’s heart is in the right place.But  she and her team don’t pluck up their courage on housing — and take far more dramatic steps both to build more houses and create more homeowners — they’ll almost certainly lose the next election. More than that, they’ll deserve to.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A vexed issue. Complain about it and people will call you a racist.That’s a popular way of shutting down debate these days. Just screech “raaacisst” at someone.I’d go so far as to say it’s one of the reasons Leave won the referendum — because ordinary people were sick of being called racist when they simply worried about the millions of people who have arrived here in the past ten years.About seven million, in fact. An astonishing number.The Prime Minister is about to draw up her plans for immigration post-Brexit.She will be taking advice from the Migration Advisory Committee . It has suggested we allow in skilled workers who might be vital to our economy.It has also suggested we clamp down on low-skilled migrants.This seems to me a perfectly sensible argument. We should not entirely close ourselves off from the world. And there are foreign nationals here who do excellent work for our country. And pay good taxes.At the same time, the vast influx of low-skilled workers has had a terrible effect upon our country.Some towns — such as Boston in Lincolnshire — have been effectively taken over.And as the MAC found, the vast reservoir of labour has depressed the wages of British people at the lowest end of the scale. It has hurt the poorest of us.But it doesn’t only hurt us. You’ll have seen the squalid conditions in which a lot of these low-paid foreign workers live. This is exploitation, on a massive scale.How any leftie can support it absolutely befoggles me.Living below the minimum wage, crammed into rotten accommodation — all so companies such as Amazon can make a bigger profit.No wonder the big companies were the first to complain. Listen: Pay your workers a decent, living wage in future and shut up, huh?But this is an overcrowded country. It is ludicrous to suggest that the millions we have allowed in have not had a massive effect on our infrastructure.It’s why we need to pave over more and more of the countryside to build homes, for example. The MAC suggested house prices had risen as a consequence — and our homes already cost too much.There’s pressure on our schools, our hospitals and our transport networks.Well, with any luck this will all come to an end. Perhaps the Government might also abide by its pledge to get yearly immigration levels down to the tens of thousands, rather than the hundreds of thousands as it is at the moment.But at the same time we should look after the EU migrants we have already let in, and ensure they feel secure and safe living in Britain.Do all that and I’ll be a happy man. Even  the lefties still shriek “raaacisst” every few seconds.GIRLS – looking for something to wear for a night out?

Some of our favourite species of birds or mammals are on the brink of extinction.The corn bunting, for example, and the hedgehog.As TV wildle campaigner Chris Packham rightly says, this is because we have paved over the countryside to build ever more homes.And because of the intensive farming methods – which have seen the eradication of farmland birds.Packham has drawn up a “People’s Manesto for Wildle” which includes stuff like twinning city schools with farms, so that kids grow up with an understanding of nature.There’s also a demo at Hyde Park in London on Saturday.

Uber messed with there drivers pay and there all on strike. I waited 2 hours for them to just cancel.The new minimum delivery fee has been reduced, as has the order minimum - which now sits at £3.50.Drivers want the fees and boost policy - where they would get more money in certain areas at certain times - to be revised to the former rates.Dozens refused to log in to work, or deliver any food yesterday, as they claim their earnings got chopped in half.A disgruntled Twitter user, who appears to be a driver, wrote: Uber drivers are striking and not picking up orders.

Making improvements in response to courier feedback is a top priority, such as the sickness, injury, maternity and paternity protections we recently introduced.Our door is always open for inidual couriers to speak to us about any issues theyre having.A McDonalds spokeswoman directed the Sun Online to Uber for comment on the protests, but added nothing on delivery impact had been flagged specically to them through their customer services channels.Couriers went on strike in Scotland earlier this month in protest over the planned wage change.And in 2016 and 2017 drivers and couriers demonstrated against pay cuts."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000284792579.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"high speed hose treat prostate","story":"It shoots a saline solution guided by a robot into the prostate in minutes rather than the patient having to spend a night in hospital.Millions of older men commonly struggle with a condition known as benign prostate hypertrophy — causing problems with urinating.The prostate gland becomes enlarged and presses on the tube that takes urine from the bladder.The speedy new hose treatment could bring relief to many sufferers.Guidance published by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence said: “This procedure uses a specialised system for the targeted heat-free removal of prostate tissue with the patient under general or spinal anaesthesia. “A probe is inserted through the urethra and into the bladder where its position is confirmed using a computer.”It added: “The old procedure normally involved an overnight stay in hospital.”Clinical trials for the “hosepipe” are still on-going and more evidence will be available about the treatment next year.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They are urging you to get yours serviced and to install audible carbon monoxide monitors in your home.It might just save a le.Schoolgirl Katie Overton went to bed excited about her little sister’s birthday party next day — but tragically the family never got to celebrate.The next morning, the 11-year-old was found dead in her bed, having been poisoned by carbon monoxide which had leaked from a faulty boiler at her home.Stepdad Paul recalls: “We’d been busy getting ready for Emma’s fth birthday party. We’d been baking cakes and blowing up balloons.“We went to bed as normal that night. In the morning we all got up and cracked on with the arrangements and we thought Katie was having a lie-in.“The house seemed very quiet. I popped out and when I came home, Katie still wasn’t up.“We were used to her having a lie-in at the weekend, but we felt something was wrong.”Mum Debra, 47, went up to Katie’s bedroom at the family’s rented terraced house in Southsea, Hants.Paul, 53, recalls: “Debs called out to me that she’d been sick in her bed. I ran upstairs and she was lying there, motionless.“I started shaking her, trying to rouse her. She wasn’t responding. Her body was cold.“I told Debs to call 999 and I spoke to paramedics on the phone. They told me to try mouth-to-mouth, but her jaw was locked. I knew then she was dead.“We had no idea why or what had happened. All of us were in a state of shock.”An ambulance rushed Katie to Queen Alexandra Hospital in Portsmouth, but within half an hour a doctor confirmed the family’s worst fears.Paul says: “He said there was nothing they could do for her. There was no obvious cause of death.“All we could think was that she’d been sick in her sleep and choked on it.“Because it was an unexplained death, we had CID come to the house. They asked us all sorts of questions, whether Katie had been having any problems at school.“They took away the mattress as evidence and the four of us were left in the house, with no idea the gas was still leaking.”To make matters even worse, rumours circulated around the area that Paul and Debra had murdered their daughter.Paul says: “A friend of Debra’s told us there were some lies going around. There was a lot of stares and whispering behind our backs.“It was incredibly hard to deal with, as we were grieving for Katie.“We were in a state of shock. She was a perfectly healthy girl and she seemed fine when she went to bed the night before.”Post-mortems do not routinely check for carbon monoxide poisoning, so no cause of death was given to her family.But around ten days later, Debra woke Paul early one morning complaining of a strong smell of fumes.He recalls: “I had a splitting headache and the house stank. I felt dizzy and sick.“I phoned our letting agent and said we thought something was seriously wrong with the boiler. An engineer came out and said he was going to put a carbon monoxide monitor by the boiler and we all had to leave the house. He left it running for ten minutes before going back in to grab it. He ran back out again and said, ‘I can’t believe any of you are alive.’“There was a lethal amount of carbon monoxide in the house. He kept saying he was surprised we were still alive.“I asked him  he thought it might have caused Katie’s death and he said, ‘Possibly’.” Paul phoned the police and even though Katie’s body had been cremated, they still had some blood samples. They later tested positive for carbon monoxide.An investigation revealed that faulty pipework on the boiler had been allowing the toxic gas to escape into Katie’s bedroom. Paul has been campaigning for tighter regulations to prevent deaths from carbon monoxide poisoning ever since Katie’s death in March 2003.She says: “He seemed very poorly. He didn’t have a temperature but he kept falling asleep and he’d vomit.“Then, I’d find him asleep in the dining room in a really strange position. Something just didn’t feel right.”The same morning, the carbon monoxide alarm at her home in Strood, Kent, started beeping. She says: “It wasn’t the continuous warning alarm but it was beeping as  it had run out of batteries.“I guess it just made me think and I had a niggling feeling it might be something to do with carbon monoxide. I rushed Aaden-James to A\u0026ampE. They took a blood sample and within five minutes he was on oxygen. He had to spend a couple of days in hospital.“Fortunately, he is OK and there are no lasting effects.”Tests later revealed the gas was leaking from pipes at the top of the boiler.Kirstein says: “If you don’t have a carbon monoxide alarm, get one now. I had one before, now I have three.”But latest figures show there are still around 50 fatalities a year in the UK.He says: “Fteen years on and the basic laws haven’t changed and people are still dying.“Katie’s death was preventable. We didn’t have a carbon monoxide alarm in the house.“We are all now living with a sadness that will never go away.”Paul adds that the tragedy has been particularly hard on Katie’s sisters, Sian, now 22, and Emma, 21.He says: “We want to make people aware of the dangers of carbon monoxide so no more families lose someone like we have.“Sometimes people will say to me, ‘It’s OK, I haven’t got gas, I’ve got a wood-burning stove.’“But carbon monoxide is produced by all solid fuels that burn. There are more carbon monoxide alarms around now than when Katie died, but in England, the law says they only have to be in properties that burn solid fuel.THE Sun is offering you the chance to win one of five brand new Ariston boilers worth more than £1,000 each.The Ariston Clas Net ONE comes with an industry-leading 12-year warranty.To be in with a chance of winning see thesun/aristoncompetition and answer two simple questions.“In Scotland, they have to be in all properties. The law in England needs changing — everyone should have one.“What about older properties? They often don’t have alarms. And what about your neighbour? We lived in a terraced house — the people next door may well have been poisoned as well.“Carbon monoxide goes straight through the brickwork. Please make sure you install an audible alarm in your home. If we’d had one, we would have been alerted to the gas and our beautul Katie would still be with us.”Paul also warns that gas safety ­certicates are not a substitute for ­having appliances regularly serviced.He says: “You can get a certicate without having a service. Of course, a lot of people choose this asSue, 45, had moved into a new-build home in Sale, Grt Manchester, with son Josh and now ex-husband Paul in 2003.She says: “I worked at home running a building firm. I’d get headaches and be queasy, dizzy and fatigued. I put it down to stress. I was forgetful, but thought I was getting dementia. Josh was six. He’d get stomach and head pains.Three years later, Sue was admitted to hospital TWICE with chest pain – and once collapsed – but each time doctors misdiagnosed cocaine abuse, let her rest then discharged her.“No one mentioned carbon monoxide and I wasn’t tested,” she says. But the warranty on her boiler then expired and Paul called an engineer, who found the leaky flue under the lounge floor.Sue still suffers memory, migraine and rheumatic trouble while Josh has poor concentration, and she thinks her family only survived because Paul would open windows a lot. She warns: “With smoke you get a warning but with CO there is no taste or smell. It is a silent killer.”“But what it means is that all these years after Katie’s death, an engineer can walk into a house, have a look at the flame and say, ‘Yes it’s burning a nice blue and it is safe.’“It gives you a false confidence. All gas appliances need to be serviced as per the manufacturers’ guidelines.“And get it done now, don’t wait until November when engineers are busy.

The electorate has clearly spoken.I would like to thank my true friends, family, the electorate who have stood by me with unwavering support.

He should demonstrate some humility.Mr Paisleys Commons ban has left Theresa May shorn of one of her 10 DUP MP confidence and supply allies during a period that could witness several crucial Brexit votes.An investigation by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards found the cost of the hospitality afforded Mr Paisley and his family may have been signicantly more than his £50,000 estimate.It found the Sri Lankan holidays included business-class air travel, accommodation at first-class hotels, helicopter trips and visits to tourist attractions for the North Antrim MP and his wider family.The trips also included meeting with Sri Lankan governmental figures.Mr Paisleys threshold for registering such hospitality in 2013 was around £660."},{"url":null,"title":"longjawed orbweavers spider web greece come to uk","story":"One major sub-species, the Tetragnatha, is also known as the stretch spider because of its creepy long legs.

I don’t like that approach at all. What we need is a fair Brexit and good cooperation between UK and EU in future.Jean Claude Juncker appeared to be on the fence, telling reporters that Mrs Mays 10-minute speech at dinner was polite, it was not aggressive, she was doing her job.This morning Mrs May had meetings with other leaders - including Angela Merkel and a series of other leaders.Mr Tusk this morning posted a sassy snap on his Instagram of him offering the PM a bit of cake, with the caption: A piece of cake, perhaps? Sorry, no cherries.Ahead of Theresa Mays crunch summit in Salzburg, the PMs of Malta and the Czech Republic took the unusual step of calling for a fresh referendum on leaving the EU.Ignoring the clear will of the 17million Brits who opted to break free of the bloc in 2016, Andrej Babiš, the eurosceptic Czech prime minister, told the BBC he was “very unhappy that the UK is leaving and maybe it would be better to make another referendum”.And Joseph Muscat, the Maltese PM, said most of the other EU leaders agreed, and wanted to make the almost impossible happen.I think most of us would welcome a situation where there is the possibility of the British people, putting things into perspective, and then deciding once and for all, he added.But last night the PM told EU leaders there was not going to be another vote.The Brexit talks are deadlocked over the issue of the Irish border.Brussels wants an operational backstop in place to prevent a so-called hard border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland after Brexit.But that would effectively keep Northern Ireland in the EUs single market and customs union.Theresa May simply wont accept this because it will effectively break up the UK and put a virtual border in the Irish sea.And it will infuriate her coalition partners, the DUP, too, who she relies on to win votes in the House of Commons.A new plan by Mr Barnier – revealed by The Sun on Saturday – to police the new customs border between Britain and Northern Ireland with invisible technology has also been thrown out by No10.Britain wants an agreement to not be needed, by agreeing a close partnership with the EU which would make the backstop void.Last night Mrs May told leaders last night that her Chequers plan was the only credible one that could work for both sides, but called on them to evolve their position and compromise like she has done.And she slapped down calls for a second referendum, saying she must deliver on the vote for the British people.I want to be absolutely clear - this Government will never accept a second referendum, she said.Her remarks came as:Later today the leaders will discuss security matters - and Mrs May will update leaders on the Salisbury poisoning investigation.Then she will leave them to have lunch and discuss in detail her Chequers plan without her.Yesterday Mr Tusk dealt her a blow by saying she would have to rework it in some way for it to be accepted by the bloc.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

To some extent the summit has morphed into a key Brexit staging post.There won\u0027t be any formal conclusions or formal changes to the position of the EU - this is an informal summit and the rigidity of EU processes mean they cannot suddenly change course.But there could be subtle indicators of positions being moulded.:: Any key moments to look out for?Yes - at the leaders dinner Theresa May had 10 minutes to state the UK position.It\u0027s the first time that the leaders have all met as one since Britain\u0027s Chequers proposal  was revealed back in July. She eyeballed her colleagues with a detailed explanation of what that means.She is understood to have told them that neither side can demand the unacceptable of the other and she told them that there would be no second referendum in the UK and no delay to the UK\u0027s departure. Towards the end of the summit the 27 remaining members of the EU will meet without Mrs May to discuss Brexit.After that President Tusk and Mrs May will have a 10 minute meeting.There she will hear, in private, what the 27 think, collectively, of her position. Immediately afterwards she will give a news conference.:: Are the two sides really worried about there being a \u0027no-deal\u0027 clf-edge withdrawal?Yes. President Tusk made that very clear in his letter to EU leaders: \"Unfortunately, a no deal scenario is still quite possible. But  we all act responsibly, we can avoid a catastrophe.\"In my sideline chats, EU and UK diplomats are even more blunt. A \"no-deal\" by accident is unnecessarily possible - each blames the other\u0027s intransigence.At the main summit - the remaining 27 EU leaders will meet without Mrs May but with EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier to discuss what they call the \"state of play\" of the negotiations.,targeting:\" data-targeting-strnativekey=\"\" data-targeting-platform=\"\" data-tag=\"\" data-component-name=\"sdc-site-mpu\" aria-label=\"Advertisement\" id=\"mpu-inline-mobile\" data-tolerance=\"2\"It prompted the resignation of then Brexit secretary David Davis and foreign secretary Boris Johnson, both of whom thought the proposal did not deliver the Brexit people voted for.And the EU side has consistently said Chequers isn\u0027t workable because it ides the integrity of the EU\u0027s single market by \"cherry picking\" the favourable parts of it.:: What\u0027s holding things up?There are two singular and distinct problems holding up the Brexit process.The first is part of the orce deal - the actual process of Brexit - and it\u0027s the \"Irish backstop\" problem.Britain has committed to leaving the single market and the customs union.By definition that means checks need to take place at hard borders between the UK and the EU unless or until some sort of mutual trade deal can be established. It is known as the \"backstop\" because it is a fallback position that the EU insists must be \"legally operable\" in case no better arrangement in the form of a trade deal  materialises.But it is a problem on the island of Ireland where no one wants to see the a  of hard borders between the north and the south.The EU\u0027s answer is for Northern Ireland to remain in the EU customs union. They say that checks can take place as goods pass between the British mainland and Northern Ireland and point out some agricultural checks already take place.The UK says that is not possible because putting Northern Ireland in a separate customs zone breaks up the constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom. The second problem relates to the framework for the future relationship. This needs to be ironed out and put in a formal text - a political declaration - as part of the Brexit process.However the British Chequers proposal for the future relationship does not fly with the EU side.They think it represents a partial customs union on goods but no customs union on services and no freedom of movement.That, for Brussels, is cherry picking and undermines the integrity of the EU - other countries will want the same they fear and the whole single market/customs union project falls apart.It is quite easy to find compromise on the political declaration or to fudge it and deal with it later, post-Brexit day. It\u0027s much harder with the Irish backstop which is more binary and immediate.:: How\u0027s the relationship between the two sides?Not great. The British perception that the EU side isn\u0027t budging despite signicant compromises on their part is a source of huge frustration.The EU is angered by suggestions in the UK, by the Brexit secretary and prime minister no less, that they won\u0027t pay the \"exit bill\"   there is no deal.The EU was alarmed by Michael Gove\u0027s suggestion that whatever deal is done on the future framework, it can always be unravelled after Brexit day. ."},{"url":null,"title":"never miss update things you","story":"NewsNever miss an update on the things you care about - sign up for newsletters from the MirrorGet updates straight to your inbox - whether you like Politics, football, showbiz gossip, travel or want to know the latest breaking newsShare\u0026nbspByNicola OakleyHead of Audience16:17, 22 AUG 2018Updated14:44, 7 SEP 2018NewsOn the go?

EU chief Donald Tusk slapped down the Prime Minister’s blueprint as leaders arrived for a crunch showdown in Salzburg. But, over dinner in the Austrian city, Mrs May indicated the UK would walk away  EU bosses fail to support her Chequers proposal by mid-November. She said: “We all recognise that time is short but delaying or extending these negotiations is not an option. “I know that for many of you Brexit is not something you want but it’s important to be clear that there will be no second referendum in the UK.  “The public has delivered its verdict and I as Prime Minister will deliver upon that. “The UK will leave on March 29 next year.” The PM also warned EU leaders not to split the UK as a solution to customs arrangements on Northern Ireland\u0027s border with the Republic, which forms the UK\u0027s only land frontier with the EU. She said: “The Commission\u0027s proposal for this protocol – that I should assent to a legal separation of the United Kingdom into two customs territories - is not credible.” Brexiteers and Remainers have blasted her proposal, known as the Chequers plan because it was agreed at the PM’s country retreat. But, speaking over a slap-up meal of cream cheese with a tomato and courgette salad, followed by Viennese schnitzel with parsley potatoes, she insisted: “I believe I have put forward serious and workable proposals. “We will of course not agree on every detail but I hope that you will respond in kind. “The onus is now on all of us to get this deal done.”  Earlier, EU Council President Donald Tusk dealt the latest hammer blow to the PM’s favoured withdrawal plan. Hours before her RAF jet even landed in the Austrian Alps, where the Sound of Music was set, he welcomed a “positive evolution” in Britain’s position, “as well as the will to minimise the negative effects of Brexit”. But he added: “On other issues, such as the Irish question or the framework for economic cooperation, the UK’s proposals will need to be reworked and further negotiated.” Revealing plans for an emergency EU Brexit summit in November, Mr Tusk warned: “Today there is perhaps more hope but there is surely less less and time.” EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker claimed the EU and Uk were “far away”.

The government today launched the biggest review of the railways since privatisation after a scathing watchdog verdict on disruption on Thameslink and Northern Rail. But asked by the BBC  he would consider his position Mr Grayling said: My job, my position, is to get this sorted. Instead he blamed fragmented decision making and said: I’m not going to point the finger at iniduals. It\u0027s a system problem, it\u0027s the way the whole industry works, that\u0027s what the review says. Mr Grayling has spent six years in the Cabinet, one of the longest-serving current ministers round the table, despite being infamous for his failed policies.   He held the Justice Secretary job for less than three years yet his prisoner book ban, court fees and a training deal with Saudi Arabia have all been ditched.   A \u0026pound23m prisoner tracking scheme he unveiled was also axed, while the Court of Appeal slammed another legal aid cut that forced domestic violence victims to show evidence to get a lawyer.  The Office of Rail and Road  today published its report into what went wrong with the biggest rail timetable change in a generation, which was introduced in May. It blamed rail industry “failures” for the chaos which caused misery for passengers, but also said Mr Grayling\u0027s Department for Transport  was aware of the risks and its slow response aggravated the challenge of rewriting the timetable. The report added: Had the final decision by DfT to phase the introduction of services been aligned with the schedule for developing the timetable in August 2017, the unpredicted consequences for the Thameslink timetable may have been avoided and the consequential risks of a timetabling failure on the scale experienced would have been greatly reduced.  Mr Grayling also refused today to heed Labour\u0027s calls for rail nationalisation. He claimed that since privatisation the railways have enjoyed unprecedented growth and success and we’re now a victim of that success. The Tory minister told Sky News: I’m very much a believer in public-private partnership… it’s not that state ownership is a panacea. However, he added: I think now the structure that was created 25 years ago in which you have fragmentation of track and train in dferent parts of the industry is no longer delivering for passengers. Train operators, Network Rail and the Department for Transport and even ORR itself were all criticised for making mistakes in the hard-hitting report, which came nearly two months after Transport Secretary Chris Grayling told MPs: ”I don’t run the railways.” The hapless cabinet minister dubbed ‘failing’ Grayling shunted blame for the rail timetable chaos into the sidings when he appeared before the all-party Commons Transport Select Committtee. Today - in the wake of the report - Mr Grayling announced a wide-ranging review into the running of the railways, which came under fire from Labour and rail union leaders. It will be led by Keith Williams - deputy chairman of John Lewis and former chief executive of British Airways - who will be supported by an external panel. But Andy McDonald, Labour’s Shadow Transport Secretary, said: “Rail passengers don’t need another review from the Tories to tell them that rail is broken. Another review is meaningless in a year of rocketing fares, failing franchises and timetabling chaos. “Another review lets Chris Grayling off the hook. The railways need a Labour government which will deliver public ownership of rail.” And Mick Cash, general secretary of the RMT union, said: ”The announcement of yet another so-called ‘independent’ review of a system that is broken beyond repair is a total distraction.  “The railways should be publicly owned, safe, secure and accessible for all and not a vehicle simply for private greed.” He branded the ORR report a “whitewash” that ignored the “dire consequences of nearly twenty five years of privatisation, fragmentation and exploitation on Britain’s railways.” In the timetable chaos passengers on Northern and Thameslink networks were particularly badly hit, leaving tens of thousands stranded by reduced or cancelled services. The ORR report says that during the planning stages the industry placed engineering and planning concerns ahead of serving its passengers, and that was made worse by the poor information train operators provided when disruption happened. It states that a key issue was an apparent gap in industry responsibility and accountability for managing systemic risks, and adds”that needs to change.” Professor Stephen Glaister, inquiry chairman, said:“The May 2018 timetable was meant to offer more services and reliability, but in reality it led to major disruption for passengers. “Central to the issues were that good intentions and over-optimism within the rail industry about its ability to recover missed deadlines left no time to uncover and fix problems.

The party also plans to ban the use of credit cards to place bets which will slash billions of pounds of transactions a year. The pledges come as part of a radical crackdown on the gambling industry designed to tackle an “epidemic” of addiction. Branding problem gambling “a public health emergency”, Deputy Labour Leader Tom Watson said that Labour’s next manesto will also boost NHS resources for research into and treatment of gambling addiction, funded in part from a compulsory 1% levy on operators’ gross gambling yield. Labour will also bring in new rules enabling addicts to tell their banks to block online gambling transactions.  He also repeated Labour’s call for Premier League football clubs to end sponsorship deals with gambling firms, and pledged legislation  they do not act voluntarily. In-play betting has become an increasingly prominent part of the gambling scene in recent years, with TV ads in the run-up to games and during half-time urging punters to place wagers on the next goalscorer or the final result. Labour’s review uncovered concerns that, with instant online betting now widely available via smartphones, the ads may present a risk to gambling addicts, young people and those with mental health problems. Research by Goldsmiths University’s Professor Rachel Cassidy estimated that gambling advertising increased six-fold between 2007 and 2013. And recent analysis found that 17% of all adverts during the football World Cup in Russia were for gambling. Mr Watson said: “Problem gambling is Britain’s hidden epidemic and we must treat it as a public health emergency.

Mike Penning, who helped run Mrs May\u0027s Tory leadership campaign, branded her plan drawn up at Chequers as dead as a dodo and demanded she drop it. The comments by the former minister are a blow to the Prime Minister just as she attempts to persuade 27 EU leaders to sign up to her plan at a summit in Salzburg. Mrs May hopes that by mid-November she will have a final deal to bring back to the UK Parliament for a vote by MPs. But Labour could vote against the plan, as could hardline Tory Brexiteers in the European Research Group - who Sir Mike has now joined.  He told the : I’ve come to the conclusion that this ‘put up, shut up’ attitude of the prime minister’s — it’s Chequers or nothing, you do as you’re told or else — is a massive insult, not only to my colleagues but also to the voters. “She is playing a game of Russian roulette with the country.” He added Downing Street is “deluded” to think parliament will back the plan. Hemel Hempstead MP Sir Mike was a minister for seven years, most recently Armed Forces minister, before being dropped by Theresa May in her reshuffle last year.  His comments came as the  reported a dossier was circulating among Tory MPs that contains withering verdicts on a successor to Mrs May. Descriptions reportedly include branding Philip Hammond not a hope and Trade Secretary Liam Fox as fading. Tory MP Nadine Dorries complained: “This is a hoax not a scoop. It has not been written by an MP. If I’m wrong, it’s an MP who came in in ‘17, doesn’t know how a leadership challenge works, isn’t very bright and doesn’t know how to spell the names of ministers. Last night Mrs May shot down calls to renegotiate her Brexit offer, telling EU leaders over dinner: Delaying or extending these negotiations is not an option.  “I know that for many of you Brexit is not something you want but it’s important to be clear that there will be no second referendum in the UK. But EU leaders - some of whom called for a second referendum anyway - suggested the UK needs to budge more, putting forward a situation that would leave an unacceptable border down the Irish Sea. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker described Theresa May\u0027s presentation to EU leaders in Salzburg as interesting. It was polite, it was not aggressive, she was doing her job, he told reporters as he arrived for a second day of talks. The UK\u0027s current Brexit plan is based on a deal Theresa May drew up at Chequers, her country retreat, in July 2018. At the time it was seen as a major sht to soft Brexit - prompting hard-Leaver Cabinet ministers David Davis and Boris Johnson to resign. The \u0027Facilitated Customs Arrangement\u0027 is a bid to solve the biggest problem of Brexit - how to stop a hard border between Northern Ireland and either the EU, or the rest of the UK. It would keep the UK closely aligned with the EU in a new free trade area for goods. Under this plan, the UK would share a common rulebook with Brussels for goods, including agricultural and food products. Britain would also collect some, but not all, customs tarfs on the EU\u0027s behalf. Parliament would technically keep the right to block future rules. But Tory Brexiteers said this olive branch would useless in practice. They forced Theresa May to amend the plan to say the EU should collects tarfs on the UK\u0027s behalf. Mrs May insisted this didn\u0027t scupper her plan. But EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier disagreed, and has continued to suggest there will be a border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. Remainers and Labour have also opposed the Chequers plan, saying it leaves Britain half-in-half-out of the EU in the worst of all worlds.

In a keynote speech today, Theresa May boasted that tackling Britain’s housing crisis is her “personal mission” in a keynote speech. The PM also claimed that her government has committed billions of pounds to getting more homes built. But shocking statistics buried in an official Government report reveal how the Tories have dramatically cut the amount of new cheaper housing rented out to poverty-stricken Brits. Independent housing experts said our findings exposed a “huge drop” in available social housing.  Labour Shadow Housing Secretary John Healey said the figures proved the Tories have made the housing crisis “worse” not better. When the Tories came to power in 2010, there were 270,000 new homes a year rented out by councils or housing associations to Brits on lower incomes. The following year, in 2011/12, this was cut by 3,000. In 2012/13 the 2010/11 total new homes was slashed by 36,000. Every year since 2010 there have been further cuts to the number of social houses let, according to the report by the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government. By 2016/17, there were 70,000 fewer new social rent homes available compared to 2010. In total, there have been 213,501 fewer cheaper houses since the Tories came to power.

Malta\u0027s Joseph Muscat and Czech PM Andrej Babis threw their weight behind the campaign for another poll - and said nearly all 27 EU leaders agree with them. The comments came shortly before Mrs May gave a 10-minute address to the 27 leaders at a dinner in Salzburg - whose grand setting was compared to a gathering of Bond villains. In her address the PM made clear there would be no extension to the date of Brexit - and no second referendum. But speaking to the BBC just before the dinner, Mr Muscat said: “There is a unanimous – or almost unanimous, I would say – point of view around the table that we would like the almost impossible to happen, that the UK has another referendum.  “That being said, I don\u0027t know what the result would be, whether it would be any dferent from the first result. “I think most of us would welcome a situation where there is the possibility of the British people putting things into perspective, seeing what has been negotiated, seeing the options and then deciding once and for all.” Mr Babis claimed a fresh vote would “solve the problem” of Brexit. He told the BBC: “I\u0027m very unhappy that UK is leaving so it might be better maybe to make another referendum and maybe the people could change their view.” The comments were seized on today by campaigners who want a public referendum on Theresa May\u0027s deal with Brussels - a so-called \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027.  Despite Brexit formally happening in fewer than 200 days, Eloise Todd, chief executive of the anti-Brexit group Best for Britain, said: There is still time for the UK to check with the people  Brexit is what they still want. Even EU leaders are now saying they would accommodate that  we wanted. It comes as EU leaders met last night and today to thrash out their response to Theresa May\u0027s Brexit plan, drawn up at her country retreat Chequers. Mrs May was meeting Irish leader Leo Varadkar this morning before talks with EU Council President Donald Tusk to wrap up the informal summit in Salzburg. She was then due to hold a press conference in the Austrian city this afternoon. The summit in Salzburg is the first of three crucial meetings with the other 27 EU leaders. If they reach agreement on a Brexit deal, it will then have to pass a vote in the UK House of Commons - where Labour and scores of Tories are threatening to reject it.

Mum-of-four Nikki O\u0027Neill, 46, from Bournemouth, says she became addicted to the low-fat snacks - which were previously \u0027free\u0027 to eat on the diet plan - as they satisfied her sweet tooth. She munches her way through six or eight yogurts daily, but says on a bad day she can consume three or four multipacks. Slimming World announced on Monday that Muller Lights now have to be counted as 1 \u0027Syn\u0027 each, within a member\u0027s daily allowance of between five and 15.  If Nikki continued to eat her way through multipacks, she would now far exceed her maximum Syn allowance before counting any other treats. A plain vanilla Muller Light contains 99 calories per pot, meaning 24 would add up to an intake of 2376 calories in yogurts alone. Despite her addiction, Nikki, who works in a school as a kitchen assistant, has managed to lose a huge amount of weight on the plan.  She told : I\u0027m devastated by the news. I\u0027ve been doing Slimming World for five and a half months and I\u0027ve lost almost three stone. I never liked yogurts until I joined. I have a sweet tooth so I soon realised that this would be a great replacement for sugary snacks. Most people on Slimming World might have one or two low fat yogurts a day, but Nikki\u0027s intake is much higher.  On a bad day I could easily get through three or four six-packs, she said. That adds up to between 18 and 24 yogurts in as many hours.  Nikki explained: I would usually have two for breakfast mixed in with oats, then a couple for lunch and dinner. The rest are in between meals - probably every half an hour when I am home in between my jobs. I have the fruit flavours in the morning and during the day. Then in the evening I love the orange or caramel ones with added chocolate bits. I\u0027m gutted, though, as they have just brought out banoffee flavour and I would have lived off these!  Nikki estimates she spends upwards of \u0026pound30 per week on the light desserts - and she panics  she doesn\u0027t have any in the fridge. Every night, pretty much, my husband will ask  we need anything from the shops and yogurts are always on the list, she said. The school worker is mum to Luke, nine, Holly, 10, Jack, 13 and 28-year-old Liam and says she is renowned for her addiction among her friends and family - who think it\u0027s hilarious. I was gutted when I heard they were to have Syns but I also found it so funny that friends and family tagged me in posts about it, she said.  I genuinely worry what I will have as my go-to sweet snack now. It\u0027s going to be a really hard habit to break, that\u0027s for sure. I will have to savour each one instead of having four or five in a row! When asked  she\u0027s tempted to carry on eating the yogurts excessively, given how much weight she\u0027s lost, Nikki had a logical answer. To be honest,  I cut down to, say, six a day, that will probably make a big dference to my weight loss. A Slimming World spokesperson said: “We routinely review our guidance for all food products to ensure it includes the most up to date information and advice, and incorporates feedback from our members and Consultants.

The team left behind at the business - who declined to be named in a Facebook post on the company\u0027s page - said they are \u0027trying to pick up the pieces of an absolute s**t storm\u0027 and claim they have lost a lot of money themselves.  They say they managed to hand back 50 dresses to brides on Tuesday but say they have had hundreds of calls and messages and they are \u0027trying to sort every single one\u0027 out. In their statement they claim: We are not Lynette\u0027s family. Unfortunately we have been left to deal with this. We knew NOTHING about what was going on and only found out on Friday night. As a family we have being trying to pick up the pieces of an absolute s**t storm. We have had to take days of work, leave our children with relatives, bring our children into the shop and try and sort at least some kind of order.  We have had to give some awful news to people that... 1. We haven’t got your dress. 2. It hasn’t been ordered. 3. You will not be getting your money back. Accessories will not be in the shop as they have not been ordered/are not here. This is at no fault of us who are helping at the shop at present. We understand that it is a high-stress situation and are trying to help the best that we can. They said they are contacting all the makers of the dresses and will make that information available on the firm\u0027s Facebook page. But the statement added: Please be aware that the shop will be liquidised and the dresses will not be available to collect. We have a number of dresses - worn and new - with no names and will need proof of purchase  for us to release them to you. We are wanting to do this but we can only do so much. There are a lot of rumours that are true and not true. If you ask us yourselves then we will gladly be open and honest about what has really happened.

Emma, 38, says she wants her son to enjoy days of \u0027fun and freedom\u0027 and \u0027playing in the wild\u0027, Hull Live reports . Stanley is a June baby and so is one of the youngest in the school year. He does not have any additional needs, but his parents believe it is in his best interests to start school next year, once he is five and at compulsory school age .  In her blog, Dirt, Diggers and Dinosaurs , his mum explains her reasons for holding him back by applying to defer his admission to school for a year. She starts by saying: We’ve done something that many of our friends and family will view as controversial. We have decided not to send Stanley to school this year. Instead, he will be starting next September when he is five. For the extra year he will be attending preschool part time, playing, bonding with his brothers, playing, exploring, enjoying days out, playing, growing and developing at his own pace. She then answers some of the questions she says she\u0027s been asked.  No, Stanley does not have any special educational needs. No, we haven’t ‘held him back’ because he was struggling at preschool. No, it’s not that we can’t bear to let him go, and I want to keep him a baby. No, we aren’t doing it for ourselves and not thinking about what’s best for him. No, we’ve not thrown our dummy out because he didn’t a place at our first choice of school this year... he did. No, we’ve not done what’s easiest for us.   As you can probably tell from the answers above, I’ve had a bit of an ear bashing by some which I hope is mostly fuelled by misinformation and misunderstanding, she says. Explaining her decision, she said: The plain fact is, he’s four. We’ve simply chosen not to send him to school early, we are sending him at school age which  you go back a generation was the absolute norm. I personally believe that in the UK all children start school too early and that we’d be better off following our European neighbours whose children start school at aged seven when they are emotionally and physically ready.  We were recently informed at a preschool parents evening that Stanley  would soon cope with starting school, as he’s really bright. This really hit home for me, a four year old shouldn’t have to cope with anything. Emma, from Hull, Yorkshire, who is expecting another baby, says she decided to write the blog to let other parents know it is possible to prevent your child from starting school at the age of four, as she believes it\u0027s not widely known. This year three set of parents have successfully applied to Hull City Council to defer their child\u0027s entry to school. Emma said: I’ve had two relative strangers - who I only know through ious kids clubs - tell me that they think it’s amazing, and one who asked me to email her the info so she could then look into it for her daughter. She had no idea that the option was available, which I think is a massive issue. Thanks to a change in DfE legislation, we not only have the choice whether to start his school journey prior to CSA or at CSA but also have the right to request admission into Reception class at CSA rather than Year One, ensuring that he will not lose a vital whole year of early education. I think an extra year of being a child with no responsibility or pressure can only be a good thing. When I read articles about phonics tests in Year one ages five and six and SATS at ages six and seven it makes me so sad. When did being a child become so target driven? Aren’t we told by midwives and health visitors that ‘they all learn at their own pace?\u0027 Why does this suddenly change when they enter the school system? The extra year at home will be an extra year of developing emotionally and at his own pace. An extra year of learning through play, exploration and love.  A controversial decision which is a big \u0027gamble\u0027 Emma said she 100 per cent believes she has made the right decision for Stanley, but admits there is a big gamble involved. She said: The BIG gamble in all of this and the only thing that regularly niggles at me is whether we will get offered our first choice school again in the next round of admissions. If we don’t, then will our offered school be happy to support a CSA Reception start, or will they be championing Year 1? The LEA and school would have to provide evidence that missing a whole year of education would be in his best interests. I guess we’ll just have to face any obstacles, and fight the battles as we get to them. However Emma signs the blog post off by saying as she sits there writing the post and watching Stanley performing a puppet show for his brother using three toy dinosaurs, she knows with all certainty that this is the best thing for her child.

Jurors were shown footage of Mohammed Abdul, 21, allegedly driving his Suzuki Vitara past bouncers and into revellers. CCTV footage appears to show the vehicle coursing down an alleyway packed with clubbers before later ploughing into the venue itself. From a camera inside Blake\u0027s in Gravesend, Kent, the vehicle\u0027s front lights can be seen getting closer and closer as dancers mingle, unaware the Suzuki is hurtling towards them.  One man can then be seen spread-eagled on the bonnet, swept off his feet as the Suzuki rams into him from behind. Others are seen fleeing to safety as security guards appear in hot pursuit of the car, shortly before midnight on March 17 this year. The car can be seen reversing, its registration plate hanging off at an angle, as patrons stagger to get to their feet. Some clubbers can be seen appearing to swarm the vehicle and showering it with a volley of thumps, while others look visibly distressed in the corner of the nightclub.  Abdul is on trial at Maidstone Crown Court for attempted murder over the incident which left eight people injured. The court heard he had been ejected from the venue at around 11.40pm for being too drunk. His trial was told that while in a rage and acting aggressively, he threatened bouncers, telling doorman Peter Muro: If I can\u0027t come in I\u0027m going to come back and shut this place down and kill you guys. Abdul ed in his vehicle around 10 minutes later and drove at speed down a narrow alleyway by the side of the club, with door staff and clubbers jumping or being pulled out of the way, prosecutor Simon Taylor said.  The alleyway housed a marquee attached to the club with a dance floor and DJ booth, and it was filled with revellers there to see grime rapper Giggs. Abdul, of Deptford, south-east London, accepts he was the driver of the vehicle and has admitted causing serious injury by dangerous driving, jurors heard. But he denies two counts of attempting to murder persons in the vicinity of the club and an alternative charge of attempting to cause grievous bodily harm with intent.

Two young boys with backpacks on are shown just feet from the puddle, while one boy can be seen on the grass verge directly in front. The Ford van driver can be heard speeding up his vehicle before driving right through the puddle. A young boy who appears to be around 15-years-old and wearing all black and carrying a backpack is shown trying to shield himself as the water sprays completely over him.  The driver is then heard bursting out laughing before the clip cuts out. It is believed the clip was filmed in the Edinburgh area. It is not known who was driving but the man behind the wheel appears to break the law on two counts - using their phone while driving and deliberately splashing a pedestrian. The clip was uploaded to @pammy_caton yesterday afternoon where it has since attracted more than 189,000 views.

Be it a new Apple Watch that can take an ECG reading , a virtual reality headset or a drone, you can buy all sorts of quirky technology.   One modern advancement, is the video doorbell , which allows people to see who is approaching their front door, from the safety of their own home.  Gone are the days of opening up to cold callers, you can now screen who you do and don\u0027t answer the door to. But it appears there are a few faults with the device - as one dad found when his locked him out of his own house.   A Twitter user, named B.J. May shared his amusing story of the tech fail on Twitter.  A Javascript developer, the dad is no stranger to coding and played around with some of the features of his Nest doorbell app to suit his needs. He programmed the device to automatically lock the door  the camera detected an unfamiliar face. But he soon found there was a major flaw in his plan.     On Tuesday the father attempted to get inside the house after checking on his son who was playing in front of the house.  However the doorbell locked the door and wouldn\u0027t let him in. So he decided to check the app and see what the problem was - but he wasn\u0027t prepared for what he saw.  Instead of his face, the camera had picked up an image of an angry looking Batman from his t-shirt and locked the doors thinking it was a stranger approaching.

Jake Parr, 30, was exploring an underground bunker in Stockport, Greater Manchester, and was taking photographs of his experience.  However, looking back at the photographs, Jake was shocked to find the pictures appeared haunted .  Alongside seeing the face of \u0027Uncle Fester\u0027 in one of the bunker\u0027s doors, Jake also claims he could see the face of a little girl at the bottom of the stairs.  Despite being scared by the experience, Jake plans to  to the underground bunker to see what other paranormal experiences he can encounter. Jake, from Stockport, said: When I was down there, it felt really creepy and almost as though someone was following us. But it wasn\u0027t until I looked back at the photographs that I realised how creepy it really was. I was shocked when I looked at the photographs of the ghost in the door, it looked like Uncle Fester, it was definitely an old bald man.  Then I was even more surprised when I looked through the rest of the photographs and saw the ghost of the little girl on the stairs. It now all makes sense as to why it felt so creepy down there, it has to be haunted. Despite having explored a number of supposedly haunted venues, Jake claims that this was one of the creepiest he had visited to date.

The crisis risks killing an entire generation of the country\u0027s children who face threats from bombs, who suffer from preventable diseases and whose families can\u0027t afford to take them to hospital, a charity has warned.  According to Save The Children , the total number of children in Yemen at risk of famine has reached 5.2 million.  And as the port of Hodeidah experiences renewed fighting, there is a risk it could be damaged or temporarily closed, reducing the supply of available of food and fuel as well as driving up prices even further. Hodeidah is a leline for goods and aid for 80 percent of Yemen’s population, and disruption to this port could put the lives of hundreds of thousands of children in immediate danger while pushing millions more into famine. The United Nations has warned that failure to keep food, fuel and aid flowing into Yemen, particularly through Hodeidah, could result in one of the \u0027worst hunger crises in living history\u0027.  The nutrition crisis in Yemen has serious implications, said Helle Thorning-Schmidt, CEO of Save the Children International. Millions of children don’t know when or  their next meal will come. In one hospital I visited in north Yemen, the babies were too weak to cry, their bodies exhausted by hunger. This could be any hospital in Yemen.  The CEO added: This war risks killing an entire generation of Yemen’s children who face multiple threats, from bombs to hunger to preventable diseases like cholera. All parties must agree a political solution to this conflict and give children hope of a brighter future. Let the immense suffering of children in Yemen end.   Severely malnourished children are 12 times more likely to die from preventable diseases like pneumonia, measles , cholera or diphtheria, Save the Children says.  Children who are stunted suffer physical and often irreversible long-term cognitive damage, and it\u0027s essential that children get the food they need to survive and thrive. And  the price of fuel is forced to increase – and as a result transport costs become higher – families won\u0027t be able to afford to take their sick children to hospital.

CCTV, released by police, shows the deeply distressing last few moments 25-year-old Inna Petrova has with her tiny child, clutching her tightly, before she hands her over. The unemployed painter at one point can be seen turning her back on Natalia Zhdanova who has flown 1,970 miles from St Petersburg to Omsk collect the baby. But then Inna kisses her little one for the last time and hands over the child, who is cocooned in a bright pink wrap. Natalia then used a faked birth certicate - which listed the baby as hers - to show airport security before flying back to her home city with the child, police say.  Inna - who later said she was “hysterical” at giving away her child - is seen wiping tears from her eyes on the video, released by the Investigative Committee, which probes serious crimes in Russia. She now admits she was wrong and says she wishes she could wind back the clock. Ahead of the child\u0027s birth, Natalia had sent Inna a payment of 3,000 roubles - just \u0026pound34. Natalia, a 43-year-old teacher, is said to have empty nest syndrome now her after her adult son left home, and wanted one last baby. She already bringing up another adopted daughter. Now both women have been formally detained as a criminal probe is launched under Russia’s child trafficking laws. They could each face up to ten years in jail.  Investigators say that Natalia posted an online advertisement saying: “Hi everyone! My husband and I would very much like to get a baby aged 0 to 3 months. All the documents for adoption are ready. Please send a private message for details. Girls, darlings, please help.” Inna - at the time pregnant after a short relationship with a man she met at a local cafe - replied: “Hello, I would like my daughter to be adopted. Please do so, I am not able to raise her, no chance”. She told police she lived with her mother and sister in a cramped apartment and they were furious when she became pregnant. They were adamant she should not keep the baby. Omsk prosecutor Vasily Gumenyuk said: “During our interrogation, the biological mother of the baby explained that she lived in a rented apartment with her mother and sister. “Both were strongly against the baby and put strong psychological pressure on the future mother.  “The young woman failed to get a job, and she was not married to the father of her baby. “He knew about her pregnancy but did not plan to support her. “She decided to give away the baby to the teacher from St Petersburg.” The baby deal would have remained secret but for Inna and her mother telling their landlady - who immediately informed police. Officers knocked on Natalie’s door in St Petersburg one week after the airport exchange. Inna said: “All the way through my pregnancy, my mother and sister were attacking me. “They wanted me to have an abortion. “My mother threatened me, saying ‘If you give birth, just don’t come back home, I won’t let you in!’” She said: “They told me a baby is not a toy.” “I posted in my social network that I needed help and Natalia Zhdanova replied.” She admitted she could have given the child up at her maternity hospital but chose not to and instead to hand the baby to Natalia who she had not previously met.  She was paid 3,000 roubles - sent in advance allegedly to cover the cost of nappies - but claimed Natalia also promised to help her and her family find jobs in St Petersburg. Asked about the moment she handed over the child, she said: “Of course it was hard. “I was in hysterics in the airport when it happened. “But Natalia’s  flight has already been announced, I had to give her my daughter so  could catch their plane. “My daughter was nine days old. I would have given her away earlier but we stayed in the hospital for a week, and then we lived at home for several days, but it was just impossible to be there because of constant scandals.” She said: “When the story became known, a friend of my mother said that she would have helped us.

Craig said inspiration for his mix of domestic and wildle came when he spotted the tiny trolley in a shop.“I found the trolley and it just went from there,” he said.Dundee is thought to be the only city in Scotland with a population of native red squirrels.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"calum woodger csaba laszlo is handling dundee uniteds current situation as well as can be expected","story":"\t\t\t\t\tIn what are trying – but not necessarily desperate – times for Dundee United, manager Csaba Laszlo appears to be handling their current situation as well as can be expected.Whether or not the blame for the position United currently find themselves in, namely being stuck in the Championship for a third season on the bounce, lies at Csaba’s door is up for debate.However, what cannot be denied is – since last season’s promotion play-off failure – the Hungarian has, largely, stuck to his word.He promised to remain committed to the club and be around for the squad overhaul he carried out over the summer.That facelt, along with a change in the Tangerines’ style of play, came and has been shown to work on the whole.Yet, as with most clubs up and down the country, other factors have got in the way of the master-plan and caused the Terrors to get off to a somewhat sticky start to the season.Injuries to key men from last season – Fraser Fyvie, Sam Stanton, Billy King and Stewart Murdoch – haven’t helped.New signing Nicky Clark, the man charged with putting the finishing touches on what is undeniably now Csaba’s team, has also had an Achilles problem.Csaba has combated these issues by tinkering with personnel, altering formations and, at times, being forced to field players out of position.Following Saturday’s 1-1 home draw with Morton, he said: “I know how painful it is to lose two points because you want to be at the top of the league but we are still just three points behind first and there are a lot of games to go.“I think we have a good team and we can dominate every game, we just need to be more clinical.“I want to keep clean sheets but, unfortunately, in every game we have conceded goals. We have been forced to change the defence with Murdoch out with a knee injury.“In the first 20 minutes, with Rachid Bouhenna starting, maybe not everyone was comfortable.“Afterwards we grew into the game and I don’t think that we made any mistakes.”Excuses, perhaps, but valid ones? Probably. Further to his points, when King, Paul McMullan and Fyvie, in particular, came on United kicked into gear.Ahead of Saturday’s trip to Falkirk, for the first time in a few weeks, Csaba will have options to consider from a squad he has, for all his critics, united behind one cause.Stanton is expected back in training while the trio aforementioned will have played themselves into the gaffer’s thoughts.Arabs heading through on Saturday will be looking for three points after draws against Alloa and Morton in their last two league matches.And rightly so, to push themselves back into promotion contention they will have to pick up three points with more regularity.However, Csaba has defended their record so far which sees them lie in fth position – just three points behind leaders Inverness Caley Thistle, saying: “We have had four games in a row without losing – two wins and two draws – so psychologically the team are showing spirit which is good.“They  have stuck with us for three years, this is the third year in the Scottish Championship and I think, not just the fans, but everybody is hoping we can go up.“This is a normal reaction, I understand them but they also must understand that we are also human and are trying to do the best for the club.“The fans have to appreciate the work that has been put in, the season is just beginning and it is only five games.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b7bd9b8dfe43.jpg ","title":"csaba laszlo says fraser fyvie has all the right stuff","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United manager Csaba Laszlo was delighted to welcome club captain Fraser Fyvie back to the fold on Saturday and believes he is just what they need to push on.The midfield man came off the bench on 73 minutes after recovering from a long-term knee injury and made a huge impact for the Terrors.With practically the last kick of the game Fyvie netted a terric half-volley to equalise after Morton had taken the lead through a Michael Tidser penalty on 11 minutes.It was not just the goal, but his overall play, which pleased Csaba.“I am happy to have him back, not just because he scored the goal, but he is a player who can create chances and shoot,” he said.“In the last 20 minutes he showed his experience and he knows what you have to do.“He comes on and in just 20 minutes he shoots three times. Two were very dangerous and the third was the goal.“Fraser is definitely a leader but we must be careful with him because he had two cruciate ligament problems so it has not been easy for him to handle this psychologically.”Ahead of Saturday’s trip to face bottom side Falkirk, Csaba has decisions to make in his midfield.After his dominant 20-minute display at Tannadice, Fyvie will be in contention to start and Csaba also revealed Sam Stanton is close.“It is good that he is making competition. Him and Sam Stanton must come back, hopefully, very quick. Maybe this week he will begin training,” he added.“He is also a creative midfielder who can score goals from the middle.“He scored a fantastic goal against Queen of the South.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/12/School-desks-stock.jpg ","title":"dundee street to become canvas for youths to express their artistic vision","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA city centre street is set to undergo a dramatic transformation during a weekend-long community art project.The pedestrianised section of Reform Street will become a canvas for youths to express their artistic vision during the Re-formation event on September 29 and 30.Organised by the Corner Dundee, a health and information service for young people, the event will feature the designs of 10 community groups to promote the Year of Young People 2018.Youngsters across the city chose several themes to be represented in the artwork, with a focus on LGBTI and Immigration, positive feelings and challenging stereotypes and reputations surrounding young people.Ambition, respect, inclusion and Dundee itself will also be explored.They had between four to six weeks to create their design and each should take about a day to complete.Reform Street will be ided into equal rectangular sections for the groups to display their work and there will be a section for the public to get involved in.Depending on the weather and funding,  plans go ahead there will be more than 100 youngsters taking part from dferent community groups across the city.Laura Cooney from The Corner who are leading the project said: “Re-formation will bring a positive and exciting city-wide focus on issues relevant to all young people.“This display of inspirational designs and images will be thought-provoking and influence hearts and minds, benefiting all.”Also taking place in Dundee on September 29 is the city’s first Creation Fest Scotland, bringing together art, music and faith in City Square.Festival co-ordinator Sarah Yardley said: “We are so excited to be coming to Dundee this year.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee united gaffer csaba laszlo blasts referee after spot kick call","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United manager Csaba Laszlo has hit out at referee Colin Steven after he gave a controversial penalty against his side on Saturday.Steven pointed to the spot on 11 minutes when debutant Rachid Bouhenna was adjudged to have fouled Morton defender Gregor Buchanan in the box from a corner.Michael Tidser stepped up to give the ’Ton the lead in a Championship game which finished 1-1 thanks to substitute Fraser Fyvie’s last-minute equaliser.Although Csaba was pleased with the fight they showed to win a point, he was frustrated at the referee’s performance.“I am really proud of the boys because it was a really dficult game,” he said.“You get a penalty against you, and I don’t want to talk about the performance of the referee because it’s not my job, but I thought it was a foul for us at first.“I didn’t hear the whistle, then the referee shows for the penalty but I think, to be honest,  he gives this penalty then he has the chance to give 10 others for both sides.“It’s just my opinion and it is not all about the penalty. I don’t want to criticise the referee but, according to me, it was a very soft penalty.“I asked my players  there was contact there but they didn’t think it was one which you have to give.”Of United’s display, Csaba added: “I think for 90 minutes plus added time we played one-way football.“The boys tried hard and it’s not easy when the clock is ticking down and you still can’t score.“In the first-half we had two very good chances where we should score and in the second half we were pressing Morton.“They were, more or less, 11 behind the ball playing very deep and they tried to counter attack.“Sometimes you have these games where you have to suffer but we have to be more clinical, must be more clinical.“We can talk about the many mistakes but we have to play faster, more with the ball into feet and up front but I think on Saturday everybody showed spirit.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/5ba21fcf21f2e.jpg ","title":"mindless vandals wreck polytunnel in dundee used to help addicts recover","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA drugs charity boss has blasted “mindless” vandals who have wrecked a polytunnel used to aid the recovery of addicts.Dave Barrie, service manager with Addaction, said the gardening equipment was likely to be thrown out because of the damage caused.The charity is a direct access service providing support to people in Dundee affected by drug or alcohol use, and is based in the Signpost Centre in Whitfield.Mr Barrie said: “We were given funding by the NHS to develop our Garden of Hope.“The poly- tunnel we installed has been trashed. We are hoping with a bit of publicity we might be able to catch those involved.”Mr Barrie said he thought the damage may be linked to other recent anti-social behaviour in the city.“Obviously there was the fire at Braeview,” he said.“There have been other issues in and around Whitfield and elsewhere so we are wondering  this is connected in some way.“It appears it may be just mindless vandalism and it is possibly a group of children.“It’s really sad as this is the first summer we have had the polytunnel up and running. We’ve grown tomatoes, peppers, lettuce, leeks and aubergines.“We have a meal group that volunteer here once a week and a lot of the produce was being used for that, so there’s another disappointment.“It’s been a really good asset and we are gutted, to be honest.“It’s really disappointing as we were looking forward to our first year of using what we’ve grown.“We had some grand plans but now they won’t happen.“Judging by the damage, it looks like we’ll have to take the whole thing down.“The polytunnel was used to help people in their recovery from addiction.“Some people were up two times a week using it.

Funds from the event will go to children’s charity Help for Kids.Today, Claire Hutchison speaks to another one of the couples taking part.All eyes will soon be on an engaged Dundee couple, as they take centre stage in Strictly Come Prancing.Iain McLeod, 32, and Jemma Ward, 29, from St Mary’s, decided to put their names forward for the event to support Help For Kids.Jemma is an early educator of families and also works with children who have additional support needs.The charity is something which is close to both of their hearts.Bus driver Iain said: “We’ve got two kids, so we know the importance of helping children, especially as Christmas approaches.”Jemma added: “Kids in Dundee get a lot of assistance from Help For Kids – especially through the ADHD support group.“A lot of families are having a hard time in the city, through no fault of their own, and it’s nice knowing there is a good cause to help them.”It is going to be a particularly special day for the family, as Jemma’s mother, Jackie, is celebrating her birthday on the night of the event.Jemma said: “She’s getting a ticket and she’s looking forward to us messing up a bit.”The couple are taking part for a bit of fun and don’t expect to win.Iain said: “I’m absolutely quaking it. I didn’t realise the magnitude of it.“I think I’ll be OK but it’s a new challenge – the rehearsal was quite overwhelming.”Jemma has previous experience of dancing from her school days and says it doesn’t come naturally to Iain.She added: “He’s not really good at dancing at all.“He’s got no rhythm and two left feet but he’s a character who is up for a laugh.”Iain describes them both as relaxed people and said they are going to have a bit of fun. He said, despite her dancing past, Jemma is quite nervous about taking part.Iain added: “She finds it quite daunting but she will take it in her stride.”The couple agreed that the main thing they will take from the challenge is supporting a good cause.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"                          Swindon\u0027 own Maisie Sly has topped off her trip to Hollywood in style, after the film she starred in, The Silent Child, was announced as the winner Best Live Action Short Film at the 90th\u0026nbspAcademy Awards."},{"url":null,"title":"wetherspoons-bans-dogs-from-all-pubs","story":"                          POPULAR pub chain Wetherspoons has banned dogs from all of its branches."},{"url":null,"title":"owen-mcintosh-celtic-fans-horrified-as-coach-driver-pulls-bus-over-and-batters-fellow-motorist","story":"                          A BUS driver faces being sacked by Glasgow City Council after pulling over a coach load of Celtic fans to attack a rival motorist."},{"url":null,"title":"derelict-east-end-school-could-be-turned-into-residential-development","story":"                          A PROPOSAL to transform a derelict East End school into a residential development has been put forward."},{"url":null,"title":"global-superstar-shania-twain-visits-glasgow-bar-ahead-of-hydro-show","story":"                          One of the world\u0027s biggest country music stars has given a Glasgow restaurant chicken restaurant the thumbs up."},{"url":null,"title":"kris-boyd-kyle-laffertys-ready-to-up-his-game-for-the-ibrox-club","story":"                          KRIS Boyd passed up a gilt-edged chance to both secure a famous European victory for Rangers and book a place in the Champions League quarter-finals the last time the Ibrox club visited the El Madrigal."},{"url":null,"title":"universal-credit-benefit-system-rolls-out-in-govan","story":"                          THE controversial Universal Credit benefit system rolls out in Govan today."},{"url":null,"title":"mobile-providers-charging-customers-for-phones-already-paid-off","story":"                          AN estimated four million UK mobile phone users have been charged \u0026pound490 million for handsets they already own, a charity has warned."},{"url":null,"title":"strathclyde-leek-and-onion-society-show-to-take-place-this-weekend","story":"                          GARDENERS will be out to show they know their onions when they put their giant vegetables on display this weekend."},{"url":null,"title":"coffee-with-a-twist-belvedere-vodka-teams-up-with-the-citizen","story":"                          BELVEDERE Vodka has teamed up with The Citizen in celebration of the restaurant\u0027s first birthday."},{"url":null,"title":"watch-storm-ali-arrive-at-largs-seafront-in-spectacular-footage","story":"                          THIS is spectacular video footage of Storm Ali as it strikes\u0026nbspLargs\u0026nbspon Wednesday morning."},{"url":null,"title":"watch-roof-lands-on-car-amidst-high-winds-from-storm-ali","story":"                          As chaos continues across the city with trees blocking several roads and train services severely disrupted, a video has emerged revealing a car buried under a fallen roof.\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"storm-ali-skipinnish-set-sail-to-save-september-shows","story":"                          A SCOTTISH trad band hit the high seas to make sure the show goes on amidst the Storm Ali chaos."},{"url":null,"title":"most-hilarious-tweets-related-to-storm-ali-as-country-is-battered-by-100-mph-gusts","story":"                          Storm Ali has caused absolute chaos across the country for the majority of the day."},{"url":null,"title":"nir-bitton-back-next-month-and-brendan-rodgers-backs-scott-sinclair-to-come-good-for-celtic-again","story":"                          Brendan Rodgers has backed Scott Sinclair to rediscover the form that he showed in his inaugural season at Celtic."},{"url":null,"title":"storm-ali-scotrail-services-suspended-until-noon-as-rail-network-takes-battering","story":"                          HIGH winds and heavy rain have had a severe impact on Scotland\u0027 railway infrastructure, particularly in the Central Belt."},{"url":null,"title":"country-legend-shania-twain-kicks-off-tour-in-glasgow-and-talks-storm-ali","story":"                          GLASGOW witnessed the spectacle of a letime with the arrival of country legend Shania Twain\u0027 highly-anticipated tour."},{"url":null,"title":"beverley-lyons-looks-like-shania-twain-made-it-after-visit-to-glasgow-bar","story":"                          SHANIA TWAIN might have had dinner at Buck\u0027 chicken restaurant but she admitted to me that she didn\u0026rsquot eat any birds on the night -

first","story":"\u0026nbspA DOCTOR and a former detective have joined forces to launch Scotland\u0027 first absinthe blanche using ingredients hand-picked from around their 500-year-old ancestral home by the shores of Loch Ness.The couple, Lorien and Kevin Cameron-Ross, creators of the award-winning Loch Ness Gin, developed the recipe for Loch Ness Absinthe, both distilled at their home on the banks of the loch, following a trip to the birthplace of the spirit, Val-de-Travers in Switzerland.It was there Lorien learned to fine-tune the craft of making absinthe which was first used as a medicinal remedy by a French doctor living in the country, Pierre Ordinaire around the 1790s.Although best known as absinthe verte, the notorious \"green drink\", popular in the late 19th and early 20th century among artists and writers in Paris, with Vincent Van Gogh and Ernest Hemmingway among its devotees, the couple decided to create their own Scottish blanche recipe.Blanche absinthe dates back to 1910 following the ban of green absinthe in ious countries \u0026ndash although not in the UK \u0026ndash due to unproven fears it had hallucinogenic properties resulting from the use of thujone, a component of wormwood.This led to the illegal production of clear absinthe in Switzerland, making it harder for the authorities to identy.Lorien said: \"We are really proud of our latest product, Loch Ness Absinthe, boasting our very own homegrown botanicals including wormwood mixed with nearby fresh water which flows into the famous loch.\"We felt there was gap in the market for an absinthe blanche in Scotland, a drink I really enjoy, so decided to put the wheels in motion last year and began to research its history and fully understand the craft of creating and distilling it.\"Loch Ness Absinthe, with a ABV of 53 per cent, is less potent that absinthe verte, which is usually around 72 per cent.The couple, who are firm believers in mindful drinking where you drink less and enjoy yourself more, recommend that Loch Ness Absinthe should be enjoyed slowly as an aperit, ideally in a mix of one-part absinthe to three parts iced water, poured over a sugar cube on the glass\u0027 rim.Lorien continued: \"I\u0026rsquove worked really hard to get the recipe for our latest product, Loch Ness Absinthe exactly the way I wanted and in the process perfected the art of distilling it to get the exact results I was looking for.\"With the help and support of Kevin, I\u0026rsquove created a drink that I\u0026rsquom really pleased with, which has already received fantastic feedback, leading to us driving our plans forward to launch even more products in the near future that will continue to be inspired by the loch and the land around us.\"Thursday 20 Sep 2018

march","story":"\u0026nbspA GAY pride march in Inverness could get the green light as early as this week.The planned Proud Ness parade, which is expected to take place in Inverness on October 6, has been overshadowed by a row between religious objectors and counter petitions.The row erupted last week, shortly after Donald Morrison, a home mission worker with the Free Church of Scotland , submitted a petition of around 600 to 700 names opposing what he deemed the \"unsavoury event\".The move sparked a furious response from other sections of the community, with three separate petitions launched supporting the Gay Pride march. They have since gathered more than 14,500 signatures.And the march looks set to go ahead as planned after Highland Council revealed that the objections made in the original petition \"are not sufficient reason\" to refuse it. The local authority said objections on moral grounds were not a material matter when its licensing department decides whether to approve the temporary traffic restrictions that allow marches to proceed.It added that the petition against the march is \"being considered separately\" through its regular petitions procedures by its legal service team.A Highland Council spokeswoman said: \"Highland Council, Licensing has received a request for a parade on October 6 in Inverness.\"This is currently being considered under consultation with Police Scotland and the council\u0027 roads team.\"A decision on the parade will be made [this] week and a Temporary Traffic Restriction Order would be required for the march.\" They added: \"The matters raised in the petition are not sufficient reason for the council to refuse permission for the parade, and the petition is being considered separately.\"Meanwhile, Mr Morrison has accused Highland Council of \u0026lsquomoving the goalposts\u0026rsquo after claiming it had shted a deadline for views on the march to be submitted.He said his petition was submitted on September 7 \u0026ndash which he argued was the last date for comments \u0026ndash and that he had since heard the deadline had moved back to September 21.\"One cannot help but wonder whether the circulation of two online petitions, in favour of the Proud Ness march, both created within 24 hours on and around 11 September, prompted Highland Council to review and then quickly change their date, so as to accommodate the cravings of these petitioners,\" he said.\"Everyone can clearly see that the subtle and suspicious date change is most conspicuous, just as it is deeply alarming.\"Surely it is wholly inappropriate for... Highland Council to act in a manner, that very much appears to be deceptive and gives the impression of being supportive of these counter online petitions.\"Following the council\u0027 insistence that the petition\u0027 objection is not a material licensing matter, it is not clear what dference a later deadline would have made over any decision. It is also not uncommon for councils to push consultation dates back in order for extra views to be aired.Meanwhile, the creator of one of the petitions in favour of the march has spoken of her delight at the amount of support they have received.Alice Masheter said the response had been \"fantastic\" and that, even though she is not a member of the LGBT+ community, she had felt compelled to set a petition up in solidarity to show that everyone is \"accepted and welcomed up here\".She said the pro-march petitions show that the LGBT+ community \"do have a huge amount of support\" and anti-march views are \"in the minority\".Thursday 20 Sep 2018 11:35 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116850.jpg","title":"New social enterprise cafe set for grand opening","story":"\u0026nbspA QUIRKY caf\u0026eacute that could be run by former prisoners in an attempt to reduce re-offending rates is opening in Inverness this week.The venue at 86 Church Street called Ar n-\u0026Agraveite, which translates to Our Place, will be officially opened by Inverness MP Drew Hendry at noon on Thursday.It aims to \u0026lsquorebuild\u0026rsquo people\u0027 lives after jail, giving them work and a chance to be a part of society.More than 50 volunteers are needed in the first year to run the venture and make it financially viable.Andrew Fowler, from the charity Signpost, which is spearheading the caf\u0026eacute scheme, said: \"We genuinely believe that we will be preparing people for work.

McKenna’s ascent has been rapid as the defender has started every game he has been fit for.Aston Villa and Celtic’s rejected bids were the latest in a number of moves for the centre-back.Hull City had three bids, with the final in excess of £1m, knocked back in January and Swansea City also made an approach for McKenna during the summer.McInnes said: “Scott deals with everything in his stride.“We are not dealing with someone who is a standard footballer.“He is something a bit special.“All he thought about was getting himself ready for the St Johnstone game.“They don’t make them like Scott too often these days.“He is a brilliant boy.“With all the experience I have in the game I can say to Scott with so much confidence that his time will come. Scott backs himself and trusts me.”McInnes recently claimed that McKenna, contracted to the Dons until 2023, will eventually leave Pittodrie on a “big ticket” move to the English Premier League.That could be as early as January  a club come in with a bid that meets the Reds’ valuation, early enough to find a replacement in that window.McKenna’s  from injury was a welcome boost at a time when eight players were ruled out for the trip to St Johnstone by injury or suspension.McInnes said: “Scott’s level of performance has been outstanding since he got into the team.“Defensively we have not been too bad and it has not been our biggest area of concern.“However, Scott’s  gives everyone a boost.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"aberdeen woman sentenced for nuisance calls to emergency services","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAn Aberdeen woman has been given unpaid work and a supervision order after making nuisance calls to emergency services.Elizabeth Ewan or Slessor, 59, appeared in the dock for sentencing having previously pled guilty to making repeated calls to police and the Scottish Ambulance Service on August 27 or 28 last year when no emergency existed.Sentence had previously been deferred for a psychiatric report.Defence agent Michael Burnett said: “The issue is drink.”Sherf Sukhwinder Gill told Slessor, of Great Western Road, Aberdeen: “When you’re phoning the emergency services you’re preventing genuine callers from getting through and you must know that.”She ordered her to be supervised for 12 months and carry out 100 hours of unpaid work in six months.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/09/5ba0973c62722-705x564.jpg ","title":"daily lives explored as aberdeen photographer goes face to face for year long portrait project","story":"\t\t\t\t\tHundreds of portraits of north-east residents have formed part of a year-long photography project.Chris Henderson, a wedding and portrait photographer, has been photographing a person a day for the past year as part of a fun Instagram project.Every picture taken for Aberdeen photographer\u0026#8217s Instagram portrait project\" src=\"https:www.eveningexpress/fp/news/local/every-picture-taken-for-aberdeen-photographers-instagram-portrait-project/embed/#?secret=ej47imVawl\" data-secret=\"ej47imVawl\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" title=\"\u0026#8220Every picture taken for Aberdeen photographer\u0026#8217s Instagram portrait project\u0026#8221 \u0026#8212 Evening Express\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"The rules were simple – to shoot, edit and upload a portrait photo every day, to find a new subject every day with no repeats and no self-portraits being allowed.Uploaded on his Instagram account chrshndrsn, portraits involve a range of male and female subjects, and include a caption with information about how he met the person and some details about them or the conversation they had at the time.He began the project on September 13 2017, posting an image of fellow wedding photographer Calum Riddell. Chris, 33, of the city centre, who will finish the project this week, said: “Part of it was because of the nature of my work, it’s quite easy for me to spend an entire day without leaving the building.“It was partly because I wanted an excuse to leave the house and speak to another human being every day.“Beyond that, I didn’t really have any objectives.”Most of the people he met were in Aberdeen, and two thirds of the people who were photographed had volunteered to take part. He said: “There were a couple of times I had to chase people down the street saying ‘excuse me’.“I started off with friends and family and former colleagues, but people started coming to me.“The vast majority have been people who have approached me.“There’s no way I would have been able to do it myself just having to approach people in the street.“It ended up being a snowball effect.“The idea of doing a picture a day is not something I dreamed up, it’s something a lot of photographers do.” Working as a wedding photographer, Chris often has to work with a backdrop that is outwith his control, so the project allowed him to look at dferent technical aspects while fuelling his love for portrait photography.He said: “It ties in with my interests. I like taking pictures of people.“Taking a picture of a dferent person every day meant I couldn’t fall back on the same people every day. I’ve allowed myself a bit of flexibility as well.”Although two thirds of his portraits ended up being volunteers, it wasn’t always easy to get people to take part.Chris likened the process to the famine and the feast, and said there were times he struggled to get back to people in time and others when he had only six hours left to find someone.With the end of the project nearing, he will be relaxing for a bit, but hopes to continue on the project in the future.He added: “I definitely want to keep doing something.

The boys have been winning but you want to be involved.“It’s doubly frustrating, in a sense, because you’re well looked after at the club and there are people trying to help you and asking you how you are and you want to tell them you’re fit.“But it takes time and thankfully now I’ve got better in the last couple of weeks.“So hopefully I’ll get my opportunity soon and I can show what I’m about.”Boyle has seen fellow defender Mick Dunlop  from injury in the last couple of weeks and hopes he can follow in his footsteps back into the Peterhead team, although he knows he may have to wait for an opportunity to  when others have been performing well in his absence.Boyle added: “Mick Dunlop has managed to get back and he came off the bench and then started on Saturday.“There’s no saying that’s the path I’ll take but hopefully  we’re winning the game on Saturday then the manager will be able to put me on.“He might think there are other, better subs to make but I want to get on the park and play as soon as possible.“The team has been winning and it’s easier to get into a losing team but I want to get into a winning team because it’s better to play in a team like that.“I might have to wait for my chance but when I get it I hope to take it.”Peterhead are second in League Two with 13 points from six games ahead of Saturday’s clash with Berwick. Boyle is happy with their start and believes they can kick on due to the increased competition in the Blue Toon squad.The  of Dunlop and Boyle, as well as the signing of Ryan Dow, means there are plenty of people vying for a starting spot in Jim McInally’s team. Boyle believes having competition within the Balmoor squad will help the team push on in the coming weeks.He said: “We’ve done well in the league, it has been a bit of a mish-mash at times because of injuries.“But we have got results and performances have improved as the weeks have gone on and now we’ve gone from having two or three options on the bench to Saturday against Cowdenbeath where we had six or seven.“With everyone fit there is going to be competition and hopefully that can take us to the next level in terms of performance.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"readers think matters us give us piece mind","story":"\t\t\t\t\tMaking assumptions about what our readers want is a risky way to make business decisions.

The competition is free to enter and all shops who enter will also be promoted to consumers through an online Indie Retail Directory.Shopkeepers can nominate their businesses until Sunday September 9 via bestsmallshops. A shortlist of 25 of the most impressive applications will be shortlisted by a panel made up of established representatives from the independent retail industry.The judges will be looking for evidence of a small shops\u0026#8217 entrepreneurial spirit, ways that they have been innovative in their business and what they have done to have a lasting positive impact on their community.The shortlisted small shops will be invited to a parliamentary reception on November 13 to meet their Member of Parliament and find out who will be crowned Best Small Shop 2018.Argyll and Bute has an amazing array of small shops which help support our rural economy and I would love to see them recognised.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,Since when is it okay for a man to stand in a layby and urinate in broad daylight?It has become more noticeable in recent years and is never a pleasant sight. It strikes me this sort of selfish attitude is something that may also be contributing to the growing problem of drivers throwing rubbish out their windows on Argyll\u0026#8217s road network.If you can\u0026#8217t find a public toilet, at least find a tree to hide behind when you\u0026#8217re caught short \u0026#8211 and a bin to chuck your rubbish in.Name and address supplied.Sir,At Royal Mail we never forget that we form an essential part of the UK’s social fabric.We know our postmen and postwomen are valued members of the local community as they deliver letters and parcels six days a week \u0026#8211 in all weathers.

The wealth of experience and knowledge of the staff cannot be replaced.I would certainly support a trust taking over the service, but firstly I would ask VisitScotland and Scottish Government to reconsider their closure plans.Councillor Robin Currie, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,I am extremely disappointed over the proposed closure of the VisitScotland iCentre in Tarbert.Michael Russel MSP, Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust and myself have had frequent discussions regarding the issue and I am hopeful that the interested parties will be able to offer a proposal that ensures continuity in the service, although perhaps in a dferent form.Councillor Anne Horn, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,Deputy First Minister John Swinney is now requiring local authorities to devolve powers and budgets to local schools. If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of ersity to suit inidual communities. Local authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very signicant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system. Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is, of course, partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We now have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew\u0026#8217s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will now play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch, Longniddry, East LothianSir,Through your newspaper I would like to thank the staff Alex, Mark and Alex  from the George Hotel in Inveraray.Two guests staying at my holiday cottage in Cairnbaan lost their car keys while on a day trip to Inveraray.

I also met with the Islay Book Festival team and heard from my constituents from across Islay, Jura and Colonsay about numerous local issues, all of which will addressed.A huge thank you to all the hard-working volunteers who helped make this year\u0026#8217s show possible.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 33","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 19/08/18, 2:04 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There has been talk of a new rugby pitch for a while, but plans presented to community councillors on Monday go further than that.We hope everyone involved is as enthusiastic as Mid Argyll Rugby Club and more power to their elbow.This year\u0026#8217s has to go down as one of the best Mid Argyll Shows in recent times.The weather helped bring out the crowds in big numbers, but the real credit must go to the volunteers who organise the show.

Whoever they invite and whatever they serve, people are highly encouraged to host a Macmillan Coffee Morning in a way that suits them.If people can’t bake, that doesn’t have to stop them.

The 2008 team has been to Mossend, Oban, Ardencaple, Campbeltown, Helensburgh, Finnart and Airdrieonians and have also been taking part in the Oban Primary League.The 2009s, 2010s and 2011s have been on trips to Oban, Campbeltown and Helensburgh. The kids played four and five aside as well as being committed to regular additional training sessions. The future looks good for when they step up to seven aside.Finally the girls team took part in both Oban and Campbeltown festivals.

Jemma won the two-lap race in 25.7 seconds and placed highly in another three events. Beth won the high jump clearing 1.14m and the long jump and Kirstie had an outstanding run to win the four-lap race in 55.5 seconds. The other event winner in this contest was Jemma’s twin sister Jorja who won the javelin throwing 14 metres.Local girl Neve Bowden was the under 9 champion thanks to wins in the four-lap race and long jump. Scarlett Speirs from Inveraray was runner-up winning the high jump and two-lap race. Carla Renton from Campbeltown won the javelin in this age group.Violet Campbell from Glenbarr dominated in the under 13’s contest winning all five events including a 6.49 metres throw in the shot putt. Emma Plumber from Tayvallich was runner up with Kyra Robertson from Ardrishaig in third place.Karis Kidd from Ardrishaig was the under 15 champion, winning the two running events and the long jump and finished 1.5 points ahead of Amy Gibson from Bunessan on Mull who won the high jump with a 1.40 metres clearance. Caryn Kerr from Campbeltown was third on overall points and won the shot putt with a 6.67 metres throw. The previous week Caryn won the junior shot putt at Oban Highland Games.Three girls tied on points in the under 7’s competition and the final placings were decided on the most inidual wins which resulted in Cara Green from Ardrishaig the winner ahead of Zara Whyte and Chloe Hill.Ruairidh Charnock from Lochgilphead was the boys under 7 champion just one point ahead of Olly MacVicar from Tighnabruaich. Ruairidh won the two-lap race and long jump while Olly won the four-laprace and javelin throwing nine metres.Local boy George Balkeen dominated in the under 9’s with a clean sweep of wins which included impressive performances in the two-lap race recording 27.9 seconds, four-lap in 61.6 and a 10.50 metres javelin throw. Luke MacVicar from Tighnabruaich was second overall and Ciaran Johnstone from Oban was third.Roan MacVicar from Tighnabruaich was the under 11 champion thanks to wins in the two running events and finished four points ahead of Sam Gillespie from Lochgilphead who won the high jump and javelin throwing an impressive 14.25m. Third placed Robert Kerr from Campbeltown won the long jump in this section.Two Kintyre boys excelled in the under 13’s with Lewis Gilchrist from Tayinloan champion thanks to wins in the two-lap race in 22.9 and four-lap race in 48.2 seconds. Runner-up Ruaridh Campbell from Glenbarr won the shot putt throwing 9.76 metres and third placed Murray MacDonald also impressed winning the high jump with 1.31 metres and long jump.The entry was disappointing in the two older age groups where Finlay MacLean from Oban won the under 15’s ahead of Ewan Ferguson from Lochgilphead. Finlay won four events and Ewan won the high jump.Jake Gillespie from Lochgilphead was the under 17 winner ahead of Shaun Doy from Kilmichael Glassary. Shaun won the long jump and high jump clearing 1.55 metres. Jake recorded 22.1 seconds in the two-lap and threw an impressive 10.33 metres in the shot putt. Jake had a very successful summer season competing at the local Highland Games in Argyll and ended the circuit at Oban Games the previous week winning the overall Argyll junior championship.The two annual trophies in memory of the late Hugh MacArthur, founder member of the local club in 1984 who died in June 2015, were contested in the under 9 boys and under 9 girls.

What’s more, even  they don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,  released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in 2003, a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid 1990s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now, 23 years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per cell  and the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"some close shaves in the strc","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 10/09/18, 9:00 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThere were only two Mid Argyll crews competing in the Scottish Tarmac Rally Championship  Pendragon stages at Warcop training camp in Cumbria on Sunday August 26.They were Donald Bowness and navigator Paul Gribben in their Vauxhall Nova and Jamie Miller and Ian McCulloch in their Citroen C2R2Max. Both crews compete in the 1600 class.This was Jamie\u0026#8217s second outing in the car. In what was a wet and slippery day, only the first stage was completed in slightly drier conditions which made tyre choice dficult.Stage two was better, after a change of tyres. There were several incidents on stages throughout the day which caused delays. Jamie and Ian stopped to help on stage three when a car rolled. This caused them to lose a lot of time but priority was to ensure the other competitors were safe.By stage seven, the \u0026#8216red mist\u0026#8217 had set in on Jamie and he had a battle with a mk 2 Escort.Jamie said: \u0026#8216This is a good event, but the class in front have a phenomenal pace to compete against, although I still enjoyed it.\u0026#8217Jamie\u0026#8217s next event is Leuchars, Fe, in November which will be the final round of the STRC. He is also looking at doing the MSN circuit event in December at Knockhill.Donald and Paul also had a few close calls. On stage two they went through a fence in slippery conditions costing them around 35 seconds.Back to service, it was a change of tyres. The new tyre choice proved to be working well back on stage and they began climbing their position and setting impressive times.On stage seven, their car stopped within inches of a concrete block.At the end of a long day rallying, Jamie and Ian finished 46th overall and 14th in class, while Donald and Paul finished 7th overall with 1st in class and 1st FWD car setting a fourth fastest stage time.Donald said these were his best results so far since he started his hobby.

As pupils had brought a iety of instruments, including saxophones, flutes, guitars, accordion, trombone and, of course, tuned percussion, they were surprised that the day started with just rhythmic clapping.Alison and Felix both demonstrated playing techniques on their specialist instruments. For Alison, with a few flautists in the group, this was very informative. Scary soundtracks with special string techniques was Felix’s forte.We were split into two groups with each group composing three short melodies in the style of Steve Reich. These were developed using minimalist techniques such as addition, subtraction, stretching, interlocking, shting and phasing with each melody sounding very dferent depending on the instruments within the group. We performed and gave positive feedback on each other’s work.After lunch we got together to compose a third section in the style of John Adams with input from everybody. Techniques used here included gradual transformation and even sparkles.By the end of the day we were able to put our melodies together and we performed our unnamed minimalist composition. The event involved us interacting with each other, meeting new people and learning interesting skills that will be beneficial for our exam next year. We are all thoroughly delighted to have been a part of what was a great experience. We are now looking forward to the SCO American Minimalism concert in Helensburgh on Wednesday September 19.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"red star exit cup after disappointing performance","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 15/09/18, 11:10 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Red Star crashed out of the Scottish Cup on Saturday after an error-strewn replay performance was punished by a clinical Southside team.As in the original tie, Red Star got off to a terrible start, finding themselves two goals down inside 20 minutes after sloppy errors. To make things worse, defender Luke Naisby was forced off with a hamstring injury.Star tried to play their way into the game but their passing was rushed and it was Southside who added to their tally before the break after a long ball over the top resulted in a breakdown of communication at the back and the striker had the simple task of rounding Kalache and placing the ball into the net.Star pulled a goal back in the second half thanks to an excellent inidual effort from Cammy MacDonald. Chances followed for Star, but Aaron Moore\u0026#8217s shot was blocked by the Southside keeper and Gregor Peacock shot just wide of the far post.The scoring was completed by the visitors in the 85th minute when Star failed to clear a corner and the striker shot past Kalache from close range to seal a 1-4 victory.Star will look to bounce back in another tough tie on Saturday September 15 when they take on Uddingston at home in the first round of the West of Scotland Cup.

I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,  you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers\u0026#8217 attention to the Facebook page \u0026#8216Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging\u0026#8217?The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The 600 jobs in aquaculture will not last long  mass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a 25-year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start again  an alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued? It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September 7, it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The 2018 parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause \u0026#8216irrecoverable damage\u0026#8217.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities.

The Shanghai visitors were enthralled by the salmon cutting, curing and smoking process, every step seemingly captured on film \u0026#8211 except, of course, the mixing of the company\u0026#8217s secret salmon curing recipe. \u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s based on salt and sugar\u0026#8217 was as much as Richard would reveal.There was a little puzzlement at the oyster sheds when it was explained that the iety cultivated are from the Pacic, but the sheer scale and emphasis on quality impressed them hugely. And the method of knocking oyster shells together to check for freshness is one that is certain to be deployed in the Shanghai fish markets.Lestyle guru Ya Shu said: \u0026#8216The system here is incredible. I have never seen anything like it.\u0026#8217It was back across to the restaurant to sample a mouth-watering selection of seafood dishes prepared by a team led by Calum Hall, Loch Fyne Oysters\u0026#8217 head chef.Before any food could be sampled, it had to be photographed. And filmed by mobile phone. And photographed some more.Plate after plate of food was served \u0026#8211 from langoustines to chilli and cheddar oysters, and from scallops to whisky-infused smoked salmon.The visitors thoroughly enjoyed it. \u0026#8216The food is very dferent from what we are used to,\u0026#8217 said Qui Qui. \u0026#8216But it is very good.\u0026#8217Ya Shu went from oyster sceptic in Shanghai to Loch Fyne Oyster lover. \u0026#8216I had a plate full of oysters, which I never liked before coming here, he said.\u0026#8216I also liked very much the smoked salmon, langoustines and scallops.\u0026#8217Well fed and watered, the group left Cairndow bound for Edinburgh while as the next leg of their 10-day UK tour, six of which were spent in Scotland and the rest in London.Chinese followers of fashion clearly like what Qui Qui does. A following of 566,000 people testies to her popularity. And with his words of wisdom on areas such as food, drink  and world travel, Ya Shu attracts no fewer than three quarters of a million followers to his blog.If just a fraction of these 1.3 million blog fans are intrigued enough to visit the UK, it will be money well spent for Visit Britain.These Chinese visitors fell in love with Scotland \u0026#8211 and not a blue-painted Australian in sight.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"scottish authors past and present celebrated at tarbert book festival","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 20/09/18, 6:15 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThere are still tickets available to attend the ious workshops of the long-awaited Tarbert Book Festival.In its sixth round, the annual programme of literary and poetic expression will run from Friday October 26 to Sunday October 28 and host writers from all over Argyll.On Saturday October 27, Robert Louis Stevenson is the subject of the opening sessions of this year’s weekend with Liz Shaw bringing her historical novel, ‘No Safe Anchorage’, followed by Bella Bathurst talking about ‘The Lighthouse Stevensons’, and Joseph Farrell concentrating on a new account of the final years the Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde author spent in the South Pacic, with his book ‘Robert Louis Stevenson in Samoa’.Closing the Saturday programme is an appearance by Bella Bathurst when she will discuss ‘Sound: A Story of Hearing Lost and Found’, which is her acclaimed account of the experience of going deaf in adulthood and how she eventually recovered.Tarbert Academy will host visits from Scottish poet, Stuart Paterson, and from the creator of the Sandy Seal books, Helen Cormack.Friday evening sees the awarding of the annual writing competition prizes in Loch Fyne Gallery.

Karen Wylie, 39, is hoping to raise \u0026pound80,000 to fly son Saul - who suffers from Spastic Diplegia Cerebral Palsy - to America for surgery which will allow him to stand independently and potentially walk. The Post reported earlier this year on the family’s campaign to help Saul whose condition causes muscle stfness in his legs and arms, meaning he cannot stand or walk unaided. The family, from Tarbolton, are fundraising so they can travel the 4000 miles to Missouri for a spinal operation which would dramatically reduce Saul’s spasticity. They hope to take Saul to St Louis Children’s Hospital to see Dr TS Park, a pioneer in Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy  surgery. Karen said: “Our objective is to get Saul to the best possible stage to allow us to apply to St Louis Children’s Hospital for him to be evaluated for this le-changing surgery. This will involve intense physiotherapy blocks, the purchase of specialised equipment and working closely with ious professional therapists to get him strong enough. This will take some time but no dream will ever be too big for our boy, it might just take a little longer to get there.” Saul was born with twin brother Clay 12 weeks’ premature. Clay weighed 3lbs and Saul just 1lb. Clay was treated at Crosshouse Hospital near Kilmarnock for three months to allow his lungs to develop and learn to feed and has now made a full recovery. However, Saul was kept in Yorkhill Hospital for six months and spent most of his first year in hospital as he was so fragile. At 18 months old, he was diagnosed with Spastic Diplegia Cerebral Palsy. When Karen was pregnant with the twins, she and her husband Stuart were given the devastating news that Clay had a better chance of survival  Saul were to be terminated, something that was never option for them. Karen said: “We were told on several occasions that Saul was too tiny to survive but he continues to defy the experts and he is our little fighter.” Not a keen runner, Karen – who gave up work when the twins were born and cares for Saul on a full-time basis – is taking on the 10k with a group of 25 friends and her 66-year-old mum in order to raise the \u0026pound80,000 needed to take Saul to America. Karen said: “I am not a runner, but have been training three times a week for the event and can now manage to run 4.5 miles. My mum has never done anything like this before so is extremely nervous but very determined to complete the race for her grandson. “Our fundraising total is set at \u0026pound80,000 to cover my son’s surgery, specialised equipment, intense physio and a two- year rehabilitation programme. We have been campaigning for 18 weeks and have raised an incredible \u0026pound41,000 so far. “We have been overwhelmed by the kindness of friends and family who are willing to help raise funds for Saul’s journey, their generosity is very much appreciated and our family are exceedingly grateful to everyone who’s helped us on this journey. “We were extremely proud when Saul started school with his twin Clay and older brother Mylo, eight, this year. He attends Tarbolton Primary School and has several classroom assistants who support him depending on what activities are being done each day. “Like every parent we long for endless opportunities for our son. We are exceedingly grateful to everyone who has supported us on Saul’s journey to help make his dream come true – to walk like his brothers.” The run is on Sunday, September 30.

capable of catering for up to 100 three-, four- and eligible two-year-old children.\nBut experts from the Care Inspectorate found the centre, which is part of the new \u0026pound10 million Langlee Primary School, is struggling to cope.\nInspectors weren\u0027t happy with the lay-out of the new nursery and highlighted the \u0027high number of accidents\u0027 that had happened as well as a shortage of staff.\nA spokeswoman for the Care Inspectorate said: \"Providing lunch for a large number of children provided a signicant organisational challenge and resulted in a poor experience for children.\n\"Staff tried hard to make lunch positive and did ensure children had something to eat and drink but opportunities for independence and children\u0027s choices were limited.\n\"On the day of our visit it was apparent that the space allocated to the nursery was not working well.\n\"The quality, layout and aesthetic appeal of play activities for children over three needed to be signicantly improved.\n\"There had been a high number of accidents in the nursery and we asked senior staff to audit these to see  there was a pattern to time, event or children involved.\"\nLanglee Nursery is made up of two classrooms and a central atrium area.\nAnd most children have access to an outdoor play area as well.\nParents praised staff in their responses to questionnaires sent out by the inspectors.\nBut the inspectors also found problems with the turnover of staff and the need for bank workers to fill in.\nThe spokeswoman added: \"There were acknowledged challenges in the staff team.\n\"The nursery had increased in the number of children quite signicantly in the last year and the staffing had lacked continuity.\n\"Additional staff needed to be employed to ensure the children\u0027s needs could be met and this was being addressed.\"\nWhile previous inspections of Langlee Nursery by the Care Inspectorate led to gradings of either \u0027very good\u0027 or \u0027good\u0027 the latest inspection found the quality of environment, of staffing, and of management as only \u0027adequate\u0027 with only the level of care and support still deemed \u0027good\u0027.\nA spokesperson for Scottish Borders Council said: \"The council has already taken signicant steps following the care inspectorate visit and has addressed a number of the matters raised, for example improving lunch routines.\n\"SBC takes very seriously any recommendations made during these inspections and regularly monitors progress.\n\"We are confident that the matters raised in the report are being addressed and additional support will be provided to ensure good progress is achieved quickly.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"wallace-or-scott-selkirk-to-decide-on-new-signs","story":"PLANS are being drawn up for new tourism signage at Selkirk\u0026rsquos four main entrances \u0026ndash

urgent call was made at the beginning of July to collect the money in just two months.\nAnd on Thursday, August 30, thanks to the efforts of hundreds of people, companies in Tweeddale and many other local organisations, the ambitious target was reached.\nThe fundraising effort has now triggered the release of a European Leader grant of \u0026pound150,000, along with a combination of other grants, which means that the theatre now has the budget to transform its auditorium.\nThe revamp forms phase one of the \u0027Building on success\u0027 strategy to develop the building and make it more customer friendly and fit to meet increasing demand.\nIf the plans go to schedule, by the end of summer 2019 the auditorium will be developed to designs by Simpson \u0026amp Brown Architects.\nA raft of improvements will be made, including existing retractable seating replaced with new, better padded seats and increased legroom, plus aisle seats fitted with hand grabs, to help customers move up and down the steps more easily.\nThe current balcony seats that provide a restricted view of the stage will be replaced by around 24 new seats on diagonally stepped platforms.\nThey will offer a full view of the stage when two sections of solid balcony are replaced with steel rail and glass panels.\nAlso, new swivel stools, in the section of the balconies closest to the stage, will allow the theatre to offer some seats at a reduced ticket price.\nLow level safety lighting will be introduced into the new side balconies, and new heating ducts will be installed to deliver hot air at floor level.\nSir David Younger, chair of the Eastgate board of directors said: \u0026ldquoThe Board would like to thank most sincerely the Eastgate staff, the Friends of the Eastgate and all donors who rose magnicently to the challenge of raising a sizeable sum of money in a very short space of time.\n\u0026ldquoThe theatre was first developed in 2004 by the efforts of the local community and it is heartening for all of us to realise that all these years later it is still so valued.\n\u0026ldquoBy levering the European Leader grant the local fundraising has made a huge impact locally.\n\u0026ldquoThis, combined with the success of general manager Caroline Adam in attracting other signicant capital grants will help to ensure that the people of Tweeddale and much further afield have an arts venue well equipped to meet future needs.\nDonations to the appeal came in all shapes and sizes ranging from a little boy who put 50p of his pocket money into the donations box in the foyer to an American couple who transferred a four-figure sum. A bullock donated by local farmer Robert Barr now has Muchacoo  on his passport after dozens of visitors to the Peebles Agricultural show each paid \u0026pound5 to name him.\nAll of the money raised will go towards the development of the Eastgate Theatre building.\nDiscussions are already underway about progressing to phase two which will improve and reconfigure the foyer/caf\u0026eacute areas.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"sheriff-orders-gala-woman-to-hand-over-car-keys","story":"A GALASHIELS woman has been ordered to give up her car keys after being accused of two drink driving offences in the space of two months.\nJune McKain has been told she cannot drive a vehicle until the outcome of her trial in November.\nThe 58-year-old of Ladhope Crescent, appeared from custody at Selkirk Sherf Court where she pleaded not guilty to a charge of driving with a breath/alcohol count of 42 microgrammes -

We are all focused on working to ensure children are healthier, happier and stronger.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"more-than-4000-rams-go-under-hammer-at-kelso-sales","story":"KELSO Ram Sales lived up to its international reputation yet again on Friday as turnover came within a whisker of matching last year\u0027s record.\nBuyers and sellers from across the UK and further afield converged on the Borders Union Showground for Europe\u0027s biggest one-day sheep sale.\nAnd from the 10am bell, this year rung by veteran breeder Jimmy Jeffrey, the 15 rings were a constant hive of activity throughout the day.\nTexels yet again proved to be the most lucrative with a top price of \u0026pound29,000 being reached for a Shearling from North Grangour in Lanarkshire.\nThe highest price paid for a Bluefaced Leicester Shearling was \u0026pound8,000 by the McClymont family of Tinnis above Selkirk.\nBy the end of the day\u0027s sale, a total of 3979 Shearlings and 411 Lambs had gone under the hammer.\nAllan Campbell\u0027s Texel topped the Lambs price lists after going for \u0026pound5,000, closely followed by another Texel from North Dorlaithers, which went for \u0026pound4,600.\nA total of seven dferent auctioneering companies managed to keep up with the demand from buyers.\nFollowing the day\u0027s business a total of \u0026pound2,991,860 had changed hands - just five percent down on 2017\u0027s record-breaking year when \u0026pound3million was reached for the first time.\nAnd the average price of \u0026pound681.52 was only \u0026pound28.22 down on last year, but up on previous years.\nMags Clark from the Border Union Agricultural Society was at the helm for the first time this year.\nShe said: \"The quality of the animals on sale at Kelso Ram Sales is always second to none and that\u0027s why we welcome buyers and sellers from across the UK and Ireland for this signicant event in the country\u0026rsquos agricultural calendar.\n\"We are extremely grateful to all our sponsors, trade stands, supporters and off course the buyers and sellers for their support of the 2018 Sale.\n\"We look forward to seeing you on the September 13, 2019.\"\nTop prices paid for Shearling breeds were: Beltex \u0026pound4,000, Berrichon \u0026pound450, Blue Texel \u0026pound700, Bluefaced Leicester \u0026pound8,000, Border Leicester \u0026pound1,300, Charmoise \u0026pound300, Charollais \u0026pound1,800, Dassenkop \u0026pound460, Dutch Texel \u0026pound1,800.

The cake was made by food artist and cake sculptor Michelle Wibowo and was featured on Channel 4\u0027s tea-time programme Extreme Cake Makers.  The cake was 3ft4in\u0026nbspwide, and 8in\u0026nbsphigh, and is an exact replica of the building near Tranent High Street.  Using vanilla sponge sandwiched with buttercream, former architect Michelle carved the cake into shape before covering it in a sugar paste fondant.  She then printed the exterior of the shop onto edible paper, placing it onto the skeleton on the building.  For the finer details, Michelle used a sugar paste which she sculpted by hand.  The cake itself was crafted in Hayward\u0027s Heath, West Sussex, and then driven to Brighton, where Tranent-born George works.  \"He wanted to help revive the centre of town, so he\u0027s taken on a derelict building, and he\u0027s totally restoring it,\" said Sharon.  George bought the building on the corner of High Street in late 2015, and planned to renovate it into a mixture of shops, cafes\u0026nbspand a Post Office.  Upon seeing Michelle\u0027s creation, Sharon exclaimed: \"It\u0027s exactly what I wanted. It\u0027s got total wow factor. I think it\u0027s absolutely incredible. It just doesn\u0027t look like cake.\"  George, when he was finally let in on the surprise, agreed: \"When I first came in, I actually thought the cake was just a cardboard model. Then I realised it was actually a cake, and to see the level of detail and quality in doing something like that, it\u0027s quite fantastic.  \"I could take it home, put it in the building, and people would actually think it\u0027s an architect\u0027s model.\"  Sharon confirmed: \"George was absolutely blown away by the cake. He didn\u0027t want to cut it and was desperately trying to find a way to get it back to Scotland. We pointed out it wasn\u0027t possible because we wanted to eat it.  \"Michelle totally delivered on the cake, so she\u0027s probably the first person in George\u0027s le that has actually managed to do something to surprise him.\"  The show is available on Channel 4\u0027s streaming service All 4.

Each family member will don a special t-shirt as they do their bit for the Cystic Fibrosis Trust and The Butterfly Trust.  Amelia\u0026rsquos mum Kathryn Tait is one of those who will be climbing the 86 steps inside the lighthouse before slowing making a 121ft descent back to solid ground on Saturday, September 22.  She said: \u0026ldquoIt was Amelia\u0026rsquos gran, Shirley Dinning, who had the idea.  \u0026ldquoShe wanted to do the abseil from the Forth Bridge but they already had their charities and so she could not do it for the cystic fibrosis charities. That is why she decided to do it at the lighthouse.  \u0026ldquoI have never done anything like this.  \u0026ldquoI would not say I am looking forward to it but I am looking forward to raising money for the charities.  \u0026ldquoAmelia is going to need help the rest of her le and it is nice to give something back.  The youngster, who turned one last month, was born three weeks early at the Birth Centre in the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh .  It was three weeks later, following a routine heel prick, that it was discovered she had cystic fibrosis.  The genetic condition affects more than 10,400 people in the UK.  People with cystic fibrosis experience a build-up of thick, sticky mucus in the lungs, digestive system and other organs, causing a wide range of challenging symptoms affecting the entire body.  Kathryn said: \u0026ldquoShe had her heel prick test at five days old and then everything was fine.  \u0026ldquoThen, when she was three weeks old, we got a call from the Edinburgh Sick Kids Hospital to say we needed to go up because they had to discuss her results with us.  \u0026ldquoI phoned Amelia\u0026rsquos dad, Darren, at his work and said we needed to go there.  \u0026ldquoThey said she had cystic fibrosis and explained all about it \u0026ndash all about the genes, why she had it and that sort of stuff obviously it was a lot to take in.  Kathryn, who previously worked at Leuchie House, near North Berwick, as a care assistant, told the Courier she had heard of the condition but did not know a lot about it until speaking to the doctors.  Since the diagnosis, Amelia, who Kathryn described as \u0026ldquoalways smiling and [who] loves attention, has had regular trips to the Sick Kids to be checked over by doctors, nurses, physiotherapists and dieticians.  Kathryn, 23, of Dovecot Way, Haddington, said: \u0026ldquoAmelia has twice daily physio which she does not enjoy.  \u0026ldquoLuckily her pancreas is sufficient and she does not have to take enzymes to help her digest food.  \u0026ldquoWhen she does have an infection, it is quite an intensive course of antibiotics, three or four times a day.  \u0026ldquoIt is just the little things we have to watch for, like spraying deodorant because, obviously, you do not want her breathing that in and dust and things.  Now friends and family members, including Amelia\u0026rsquos older sisters Laura and Abby, are getting ready to give back to the two charities.  The Butterfly Trust, based in Edinburgh, offers support to families and people affected by the condition, while the Cystic Fibrosis Trust is heavily involved in research.

The girl and the boy were trapped in the locked vehicle and were only rescued after passers-by heard the traumatised girl screaming \u0026ldquohelp, save us.  The concerned passer-by contacted the police and managed to calm the distraught children down by waiting by the vehicle while it was parked in a lay-by near to Prestonpans last year.  Yorkston, who was in charge of the children\u0026rsquos welfare, eventually appeared about 30 minutes later claiming he had \u0026ldquoonly been five minutes and had been relieving himself.  The 28-year-old then jumped into his car and drove away from the lay-by, leaving the police to launch a hunt for him and the two children.  Yorkston had previously admitted abandoning the children in the car last August when he appeared at Edinburgh Sherf Court earlier this year and he was due back in the dock last Wednesday.  Solicitor Cameron Tait, defending, said that his client had not attended court but asked Sherf Adrian Cottam to deal with the case in his absence.  Mr Tait added that the care of the children was now under supervision of the local social work department.  Sherf Cottam agreed and decided to admonish Yorkston on the charge of abandoning the children.  Previously, the court heard that the two children were spotted within the locked vehicle parked at a lay-by on the B1361 at about 5.30pm on August 16 last year.  Fiscal depute Mark Keane said: \u0026ldquoWitnesses were out for a walk and they observed a stationary car in the lay-by and saw two children within the car who very distressed.  \u0026ldquoThe girl was shouting \u0026lsquohelp, save us\u0026rsquo.  When asked where the person looking after her was, the girl pointed to an opening in the trees.  The fiscal added that \u0026ldquothe car was locked and the windows were fully up and it was \u0026ldquoa hot day.  \u0026ldquoThe witnesses became concerned about the children\u0026rsquos welfare and decided to phone the police and stay with the car for about 25 minutes, the fiscal added.  Solicitor Lesley Cunningham, defending, told the court that Yorkston had stopped for a toilet break as he took the children to a McDonald\u0026rsquos restaurant.  Ms Cunningham said that her client had \u0026ldquoan underlying drug problem at the time of the incident which was \u0026ldquonow resolved.  She added: \u0026ldquoMr Yorkston was taking the children to a McDonald\u0026rsquos and stopped by the side of the road for the toilet. He admits now this was foolish in the extreme. Fortunately there was no harm done to the children.  Yorkston admitted to being responsible for two children and wilfully abandoning them by leaving them alone within a locked vehicle while windows were fully closed in hot weather conditions at a lay-by on the B1361 near to Prestonpans on August 16 last year."},{"url":null,"title":"popular-former-musselburgh-church-minister-is-remembered","story":"  The American-born clergyman served Musselburgh Congregational Church, on Links Street, for 41 years after being inducted as its minister in 1968.

He was inducted into the Ministry of Genoa Congregational Church in Nebraska, where he served for six years.  With practical experience under his belt, he went on to complete a post-graduate degree at New College Edinburgh before arriving in Musselburgh, where he took an avid interest in community le.

Claire said: \u0026ldquoI think a lot of people don\u0026rsquot know that CAB is a volunteer-based charity, so we do rely on volunteers to be on reception, to become general advisers and also some of them do administrative work as well.

Claire, who also handles financial capability issues at the CAB, started out as a volunteer adviser.

I had stumbled upon it during a short walk from the village. I always explore when I get the chance, never knowing what I might find. It seemed neglected and strangely positioned, away from the village and no evidence of a kirk nearby. I assumed it to be connected to nearby Elphinstone Tower.  Yet soon afterwards I discovered that on the north-west of the graveyard there had indeed been a kirk a medieval pre-reformation chapel no less.

However, that is just one layer of this graveyard\u0026rsquos history, for it is described as overlying a prehistoric site of \u0026ldquonational importance by Ancient Monuments UK.

According to this story the elf was a servant of an Elphinstone witch called Meg.  One day the witch travelled in her carriage to a nearby burn and there had eaten food, refusing to share it with her elves. While she was having a post-scoff snooze, an elf snuck into her carriage and took the leftovers. The angry witch incarcerated the elf within the stone as a punishment.  The primary school have a version of this story painted in the playground and the children there are best to tell that tale! It\u0026rsquos a story which suggests a reason for the village name: \u0026lsquoElf in Stone\u0026rsquo!  But as is often the case, there is also an older folk tale about the stone, mentioned well over 100 years ago by P M\u0026rsquoNeill in his fascinating book of the traditions of the area. In this tale Meg is also the main character. Here is my re-telling of this old story:  The stone which now stands in Elphinstone village once stood by the smiddy. It was owned by a well-kent witch of the village called Meg. She was not the only witch in the area, for she had many friends who were also witches. They were all married women, with heavy domestic duties to perform and little time for themselves during the day.  However, as night fell and their \u0026ldquoauld gude men lay soond asleep at hame, this happy group of witches would meet up at Harry\u0026rsquos Burn, a short distance from the village but far enough away to be out of earshot of a sleeping husband.  Here the sisterhood would have witchy fun and play games. Meg would bring the bullet stone for a game of chuck , a game in which four stones are laid on a surface while one is thrown in the air. The player must pick up all the four stones, then catch the thrown stone as it falls back to the ground.  Perhaps this huge stone was actually the one thrown into the air. After all, they were witches and so a normal game of chuckie would have been a bit mundane. I do not know exactly how heavy it is but it would defeat anyone trying to lt it without magic or machinery.  In fact it would have been a fair challenge to carry from the village to the burn, even for a witch. And that is why Meg didn\u0026rsquot carry it to her liaisons. She used magic, of course. As her husband snored in the house she would creep out to the stone and turn it into a horse. I can visualise her mounting this confused beast in the light of the moon, then riding speedily with joyful laughter towards Harry\u0026rsquos Burn to meet her friends and enjoy the short time of freedom from domestic duties.  There at Harry\u0026rsquos Burn she would dismount and greet her friends. No doubt they all had dferent and novel methods of travel to get to their location: a flying sieve, riding a wolf, even a husband changed into a horse are all possibilities according to the beliefs of the time!  Upon her arrival Meg would lead the horse to the burn to drink. As soon as it had quenched its thirst, Meg changed it back to a stone. And so the heavy stone was successfully transported so the witches could play their game.  Then, when the fun was over, Meg turned the stone back into a horse for the  journey, carefully dismounting at the end of her journey on the same spot by the smiddy, and then transforming the poor creature back into stone.  And so the bullet stone remains in the village after Meg\u0026rsquos final journey. It can be found opposite the primary school and is called Meg\u0026rsquos Chuck. As far as I know it hasn\u0026rsquot been a horse since the last time Meg changed it into one, so it will be desperate for some exercise by now.  There is no reason not to believe that Meg also trapped an elf within the stone, as the later tale suggests. She was, after all, a witch with powerful magic.  So  you sit on it, be careful about the words you mutter. You might just accidentally say the spell that transforms it into a horse, and then you\u0026rsquoll be off on a terryingly wild ride to Harry\u0026rsquos Burn, possibly in the company of a hyperactive and by now very hungry elf.  Or maybe that would be fun! I wonder what the spell was. Maybe the children in the school have an idea?"},{"url":null,"title":"youtube-and-wikipedia-edit-a-thon-event-for-preston-tower","story":"  Dig It!

One of the two reactors at the power station, to the east of the town, is being taken offline.  The programme means hundreds of extra workers will join the 750-strong regular workforce for the maintenance period, known as a \u0026ldquostatutory outage.  Robert Gunn, station director, said: \u0026ldquoIt is Torness Power Station\u0026rsquos 30th birthday this year and this is the 22nd statutory outage we have carried out at the station.  \u0026ldquoWe are very well practised at them and over the years we have built great relationships with the extra workers who come and support us during the outages.  \u0026ldquoThese workers will be staying in local hotels and B\u0026ampBs, eating in the area\u0026rsquos restaurants and using taxi firms.  \u0026ldquoIt is great that our investment in the power station can also benefit our local community just as the peak tourist season is coming to an end.  \u0026ldquoWe carry out maintenance and inspections on the units that generate the electricity all-year-round but a statutory outage gives us the chance to carry out pieces of work that are not possible when the reactor is operating.  Philip Mellor, chairman of Dunbar Trades\u0026rsquo Association  and owner of the Dunmuir Hotel, was delighted with the news.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is very positive news.  \u0026ldquoI am delighted to welcome people to Dunbar and certainly as we move into the quieter season, as the holidaymakers have left, it is the ideal time for EDF to run this type of project.  \u0026ldquoIt will massively benefit the community as a whole.  EDF Energy carries out a statutory outage on each of its reactors once every three years.  These are planned in advance with the National Grid to ensure that there is no impact on the national electricity supply.  The other reactor at Torness is due to continue operating normally throughout the period.  During the outage workers will carry out more than 12,000 separate pieces of work \u0026ndash each carefully planned during the last two years of preparation.  The biggest projects include fitting of additional reactor gas temperature instrumentation, exchange of the turbine intermediate and low-pressure rotors, and replacement of auxiliary cooling water pipework systems.  Torness Power Station\u0026rsquos two nuclear reactors generate enough electricity to power more than two million homes and started operating in 1988.  The station employs more than 500 full-time staff and about 250 full-time contract partners.  Since it opened, Torness has produced enough low-carbon electricity to save the equivalent of 84.8 million tonnes of CO2e  during its 30 years of operation, the same as taking all of the passenger cars off the UK\u0026rsquos roads for more than a year."},{"url":null,"title":"tranent-womans-key-part-in-new-bbc-one-game-show-chase-the-case","story":"  The former Ross High School pupil plays a \u0026ldquofurious security guard in new strategy game Chase the Case, hosted by BBC Breakfast presenter Dan Walker.

His determination to clear his name of allegations of sexual impropriety has the potential to tear the Scottish Government and the SNP apart. The two most important politicians in the modern history of Scottish nationalism have been pitted against each other at the very moment the party needs to unite over the future of independence.  We\u0027ve had the extraordinary spectacle of the former First Minister, and SNP leader, conducting a war of legal words over social media with the current First Minister, and SNP leader. In y posts, Nicola Sturgeon defended the anti-sexual harassment procedures she introduced in January, and insisted on fairness for the complainants. Alex Salmond has condemned that due process as an unfair kangaroo court. Worse, he\u0027s accused the Scottish Government of leaking salacious details of the allegations to undermine him. Mr Salmond has even raised an action against the Scottish Government in the Court of Session.  For their part, Scottish Labour say that Nicola Sturgeon should already have suspended her predecessor from the party. That she has failed to follow the precedent set by the expulsion of the former Children\u0026rsquos Minister, Mark Macdonald. No formal complaint been lodged, however, with the SNP that could trigger such a disciplinary procedure. But to the dismay of many members, Ms Sturgeon has pointedly failed to rule out Mr Salmond\u0027s future defenestration. She can\u0027t.  The FM faces an acute dilemma. Under the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos procedures, complaints against former ministers are assessed by the civil service. If the result is problematic it is handed to the First Minister, \u0026ldquoin their capacity as party leader, so that the FM \u0026ldquocan take action to secure the highest standards of behaviour in the current administration. It\u0027s not clear what actions should be taken here, but you can be pretty sure critics will insist that suspension from the party is one of them. The allegations have been serious enough to be handed to the police.  However, the usual resignation argument that a minister cannot do their job properly until they\u0027ve \u0026ldquocleared their name does not apply. Alex Salmond sits in no parliament, holds no senior position in the party and is merely a sometime television presenter.  Labour\u0027s Rhoda Grant called for Mr Salmond to be suspended in order to create \u0026ldquoa safe space for his accusers \u0026ndash the two women who have made complaints. But it\u0027s not at all clear what kind of threat he is supposed to present to these women, or how removing Mr Salmond\u0027s membership card would make the space they occupy any more safe. The implication that Alex Salmond is some kind of crazed sex criminal, who cannot be allowed to walk free, is appalling. He\u0027s been found guilty of no improper conduct whatever.  Of course, the real damage was done by whoever leaked the confidential details of the allegations that he sexually assaulted two women. This vastly increased pressure on the First Minister to suspend Mr Salmond for the duration. He strenuously rejects the allegations and says he\u0027s been denied the right to see the evidence. That\u0027s assuming there is any concrete evidence.  Police and government agencies tend to work nowadays on the supposed Macpherson Principle that \u0026ldquovictims should always be believed, which is sometimes taken to mean that actual evidence is superfluous. Following a succession of miscarriages of justice, the politan Police has now abandoned this inversion of the presumption of innocence, and changed its guidance to say that accusers should be \u0026ldquolistened to rather than their allegations automatically accepted as fact. But it may be too late for Alex Salmond. In politics, you are now guilty until proven innocent. All the parties have tended to suspend politicians when allegations become public.  Many in the SNP are dismayed that Ms Sturgeon did not, at the very least, give her former mentor some kind of positive character reference last week, and then refuse to comment further. The First Minister placed herself at the forefront of the controversy, declaring that she was \u0026ldquo100% behind the Permanent Secretary, Leslie Evans, whom Mr Salmond\u0027s supporters believe has acted as judge and jury. Her remark that the complaints couldn\u0027t be \u0026ldquoswept under the carpet sounded damning.  The unalloyed glee among opposition politicians at what they see as the final humiliation of their greatest former foe is matched in the SNP by a kind of existential despair. It is hard to convey just how important Alex Salmond is to the independence movement. Political journalists and Women for Independence may regard the former leader as a hangover from alpha male politics, but for many ordinary nationalists he has hero status, comparable to that of Charles Stewart Parnell, the 19th century Irish Nationalist with whom Salmond used to compare himself. Unfortunately, that career ended with a sex scandal, too, over Parnell\u0027s adultery.  Irish nationalists always believed that Parnell was brought down by Establishment dirty tricks. There is an unshakeable conviction among many in the SNP that today\u0027s scandal must be,  not the work of M15, then a move by the deep state to silence an influential voice on the eve of a possible announcement of a second independence referendum. Salmond promised in his so-called Morningside Declaration in May to  to front line politics as soon as indyref2 is announced.  But  this is an establishment plot, then the unfortunate reality for Nationalists is that Nicola Sturgeon finds herself at the apex of it. As the new parliamentary term begins she\u0027ll come under intense pressure to suspend Mr Salmond from the party, or be accused of favouritism and hypocrisy. But  Alex Salmond were expelled on the eve of the most crucial SNP conference in years, the consequences would be unimaginable. The SNP has not just been rocked by this development it has been traumatised \u0026ndash and it may never be quite the same again."},{"url":null,"title":"relieve-the-gsa-of-responsibility-for-mackintosh-building-art-experts-suggestion-to-msps","story":"  Currently burnt-out, the Mackintosh Building is still at the heart, and perhaps is the soul, of the art school.  However, should the building, disastrously ruined by fire twice in four years, still be run by the educational institution?  That is the provocative question that will be posed to Members of the Scottish Parliament tomorrow by one of Scotland\u0027s leading Mackintosh experts, the writer and gallerist Roger Billclfe.  Mr Billclfe, a vocal critic of the GSA\u0027s responsibility for, and handling of, the building\u0027s first fire in 2014, has suggested in a submission to MSPs that the GSA should be \"relieved of the responsibility\" of the \u0027Mack\u0027.  He says that by the time the building is rebuilt - which GSA chair Muriel Gray said could take up to six years - it will have not been used as a place of teaching for more than a dozen years.  Billclfe believes that the building should be treated as a \"world class work of art\" and could be used as artist accommodation and for exhibitions.  : The Mackintosh Building will be rebuilt says chair  In the conclusion to his submission he says that, because of the unanswered questions around the 2014 fire, the GSA is \"unfit\" to be a custodian of the building.  Mr Billclfe said: \"Temporary accommodation put in force after the 2014 fire will likely have had to be replaced by more permanent arrangements.  \"This seems to be a suitable time to consider relieving the School of its responsibility for the Mackintosh building - something it is believed to have considered in the 1990s when it offered the building to a government agency - and removing the inherent dangers associated with its occupation by a large body of students.  \"This would remove from the School the apparent burden of running a major \u0026lsquomuseum\u0026rsquo and also satisfy the growing demand for access, particularly after the injection of \u0026pound30m of public, private and charitable donations to restore the building following the 2014 fire.\"  Mr Billclfe, whose latest book is \u0027Charles Rennie Mackintosh and the Art of the Four\u0027, believes the Mackintosh Building, consumed in a blaze for which no cause has yet been established, should be rebuilt from the architect\u0027s plans.  : How the Mack will be remade: Muriel Gray interview  The Committee\u0026nbspis also hearing evidence from Eileen Reid, the former head of widening participation at the school, the architect Malcolm Fraser, and Stuart Robertson, director of the Charles Rennie Mackintosh Society.  The prospect of the GSA giving up their right to the building appears unlikely.  However, there was much anger expressed after the June fire, and how two blazes could have occurred in four years.  The first fire, in 2014, was sparked by an projector igniting some expanded foam being used by a student for a degree show.  Until the police and fire service investigation into the new blaze is complete and published, observers, the public and alumni are in want of reply to questions over cause and responsibility.  : The new Mack will be paid for by insurance and fund raising  A spokesman for the GSA said: \"The Mackintosh Building was commissioned and designed as an art school and GSA is fully committed to it ing as a working art school.\"  In the Herald on Sunday, the chair of the GSA board, Muriel Gray, was adamant the GSA will restore the Mackintosh Building.  Ms Gray said: \"This time it will be built with such knowledge and expertise that we have learned since 2014.  \"We are resolved that the Mackintosh comes back as a working art school, as a major player, a cultural leader for the city and the Scottish economy.\"  She added: \"Imagine the thrill of saying, \u0027We have an architect for this project: who is it? Charles Rennie Mackintosh.\u0027\"  \"The roads lead back to Mackintosh, absolutely and non-negotiably.  \"As far as we are concerned that decision we made in 2014 has just been interrupted.\"  It has been estimated that the cost could be more than \u0026pound100m, but Ms Gray said she hoped this would be met by insurance and a private funding raising initiative, rather than rely on public funds.  : Mackintosh expert on the rebuild at book festival  The building was insured through an Owner Controlled Insurance Programme .  This was held in the name of the GSA and Kier Construction Scotland Limited, which was in charge of the works at the building.  The restoration of the school following the 2014 fire was due to cost \u0026pound49m in total.  A paper for the Committee says that the GSA have \"communicated with donors regarding the 2018 fire and no donor has requested a  of their donation.\""},{"url":null,"title":"analysis-potent-questions-linger-around-the-mack-and-the-gsa","story":"  However, after two fires in four years, not only Mr Billclfe, who suggests the change in his submission to the Culture Committee of the Scottish Parliament, has expressed frustration and anger at the GSA.  In his submission, he says the Mack is a world class work of art - and should be henceforth treated as such.  He writes: \u0026ldquoIt would be unthinkable to restore a work of art from the National Galleries, say, and then offer access to it to the person who damaged it in the first place. But this is the scenario  the building is still to be retained by the School of Art on its current basis.  He also calls for a full investigation into the school\u0026rsquos administration at the time of the 2014 fire and subsequent refurbishment.  Billclfe, as others do, believes that the causes and circumstances of the original fire still pose many questions.  There is often anger when there are no quick or ready answers to potent and emotional questions. The world is waiting for the police and fire officers to investigate the ruins of the Mack, to find out what caused or accelerated the blaze this summer. I understand that the current theory is that the fire began in the roof of the east gable of the building, and then spread west and down to the ABC venue.

It followed a leak of papers from Brussels negotiators that the EU was edging towards a deal with the UK over Northern Ireland that would use technology to create a frictionless border.  The arrangement would maintain close alignment with the single market.  A newspaper report said the leak stated the solution was \u0026ldquospecically phrased for Northern Ireland so that it is not applicable for Scotland. A UK concern.  However Nicola Sturgeon has argued Scotland should be able to enjoy the same relationship as Ulster.  She tweeted in December \u0026ldquoIf one part of UK can retain regulatory alignment with EU and effectively stay in the single market, which is the right solution for Northern Ireland, there is surely no good practical reason why others can\u0026rsquot.  Speaking on BBC Radio Scotland yesterday, Mr Russell said: \u0026ldquoIf this is true then this is duplicity of a very serious degree by the UK government.  \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government has made it clear, both publicly and privately, over a long period of time, that whilst we entirely support a borderless Ireland...  there are advantages for Northern Ireland then Scotland could not stand idly by, and quite obviously so.  \"We voted, like Northern Ireland, not to Leave. Our economies are closely intertwined.  Asked whether there was a case for Northern Ireland having a unique arrangement given its history and its land border with another EU country, he said: \u0026ldquoWe would then border an EU country in those circumstances because the border would be in the Irish Sea.  \u0026ldquoBut it\u0026rsquos not an EU proposal. What the Times has reported is that the UK would be making it a condition that it [the deal] was written in such a way that Scotland could not take advantage of it.  \u0026ldquoIf they wanted to do that, they should have said to us - because there are open negotiations, the Joint Ministerial Committee is meeting - by the way, this is what we\u0026rsquore saying as part of the Northern Irish deal. They\u0026rsquove not done so.  \u0026ldquoNow that is neither fair nor welcome, and that is something we will be raising as a very serious issue.  He said he accepted there should be no border between Northern Ireland the republic, but he also said Scotland had voted heavily to Remain in the EU, and had long argued that a separate system for Scotland known as \u0026ldquodferentiation was possible.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe have shown how that is possible, and we have published material on it. So  there\u0026rsquos an attempt to tie us to the UK, to drag us out against our will then we are absolutely right to object to that, particularly  it\u0026rsquos being done in secret.  Asked  the SNP would support a second vote on Brexit, Mr Russell said he would be \u0026ldquohappy to sit down with the LibDems and other proponents of a People\u0026rsquos Vote.

They, claimed the Lib Dem chief, had turned from \u0026ldquobroad churches into intolerant cults.  Which, of course, has left the fourth force in Westminster politics with a golden opportunity.  Yet despite the fact that loyal lieutenants were stressing how the party had doubled its appeal, from 7.4 per cent at the last election to 11 per cent-plus now - actually, a recent poll put the Lib Dems on just six per cent - the yellow peril is not picking up support anywhere near where it should be.  Sir Nick Clegg branded Jeremy Corbyn and Labour \u0026ldquopants, while he dismissed Theresa May and the Tories as \u0026ldquorubbish. Yet,  this is true, then the Lib Dem surge should be happening. But it isn\u0026rsquot.  This is undoubtedly why Vince wants change but saying you want to create a \u0026ldquomovement of the moderates hardly gets the political pulse racing. Many Lib Dems insisted they were not moderates but radicals. And then there is the plan to open up a future leadership contest to non-MPs.  A ripple of expectation rose among the yellow T-shirts when the campaigning businesswoman Gina Miller gave a conference speech but swtly burst the bubble of expectation about her own ambitions when she told delegates that she was not their leader-in-waiting.  In his keynote address, Sir Vince urged Labour and Tory rebels to have the courage to leave and, by implication, join the Lib Dems. No names were mentioned but that of Labour\u0026rsquos Chukka Umunna has been on the lips of some delegates in a positive and a negative way.  And he sought to pile pressure on Jeremy Corbyn over the People\u0026rsquos Vote issue by telling the Labour comrades that  their leader does not back the second poll, then they should dump him.  But  the Lib Dems are to capitalise on the anti-Brexit sentiment, then they need an energetic, charismatic leader, who doesn\u0026rsquot fluff his lines, to lead the charge to keep Britain in the EU as soon as possible.

Mrs May is likely also to talk to other leaders in the margins of the summit in an effort to win backing for a plan which has met fierce resistance from within the ranks of her own Conservative Party.  Her message will be stark:  the EU does not show flexibility and the only deal she can take back to Westminster in November is an unsellable fudge, then MPs will vote it down and there will be a damaging no-deal.

The former Holyrood Presiding Officer\u0026rsquos remarks came as campaigners for a second EU referendum set out a roadmap to obtain a \"People\u0027s Vote\" giving the public the final say on the outcome of Brexit negotiations.  The People\u0027s Vote report, written by Scottish peer Lord Kerr of Kinlochard, who authored Article 50, suggested the PM could be forced to concede a second referendum by a vote of MPs in Parliament or that she could even decide to call one herself.  And it insisted that the option of staying in the EU \"must be on the ballot paper\".  But Mrs May brushed aside the calls for a second referendum, saying voters had already made their decision.  \"When the referendum took place, we gave people the opportunity to make a choice. They made that choice,\" she declared.  \"This was probably the biggest exercise in democracy in our country\u0027s history. If we were to go back on that vote, it would destroy trust in politicians.  \"My answer to the People\u0027s Vote is that we\u0027ve had the people\u0027s vote - it was the referendum - and now we should deliver on it,\" she added.  The report argues that the March 29 2019 deadline for Brexit could easily be delayed to make time for a vote to be held.  And it warned that politicians would be judged harshly  they denied calls for a People\u0027s Vote on the grounds that it would be too dficult to arrange in the short time remaining.  \"More than two years since the 2016 referendum, a political, economic and possibly constitutional crisis is gathering across the United Kingdom,\" said Lord Kerr, a former head of the diplomatic service.  \"Our view is that the most viable and democratic way of resolving it is to allow the public to have their say on Brexit. To deny them a voice challenges the basic principle of informed consent.\"  And the crossbench peer warned: \"History will not, in our opinion, be kind to any politician who hides behind purely logistical arguments, legalese or arcane parliamentary procedure in order to deny people a vote on the outcome of these Brexit negotiations at such a fragile and crucial moment for our country.\"  With opinion polls regularly finding a majority of voters now think the UK made the wrong decision to leave in 2016, the People\u0027s Vote report said it was not too late to \"think again\" about Brexit.  There was \"no insurmountable political or procedural obstacle\" to putting the two-year Article 50 process on hold to provide time for the necessary legislation and practical arrangements to be put in place for a vote, it argued.  And the report said a decision to dump Brexit now would be \"cost-free\" as the UK could retain its existing EU membership terms, including its budget rebate and exemption from joining the euro - while rejoining years later would require them to be renegotiated from scratch.  Drawn up by a cross-party committee including pro-EU MPs, peers and MEPs from Conservatives, Labour, Liberal Democrats and Greens, the roadmap outlined six possible routes to a fresh referendum but said others may emerge as events develop.  The report explained that  Mrs May secured a deal with Brussels this autumn, MPs could use parliamentary amendments to force a referendum either when voting on the deal itself or on later legislation to implement the withdrawal agreement.  If her deal were rejected by the Commons, it would be up to Speaker John Bercow to decide whether or not to permit MPs to vote on a fresh referendum when the PM faced Parliament to explain her next steps.  Although Mrs May has consistently said that she would not allow a second referendum, the report suggested she might decide that a public vote was the best way to win a mandate for her deal or to escape the \"constitutional crisis\" of no deal.  \"Facing the very real possibility of overseeing a deeply unpopular and potentially disastrous no-deal Brexit, she may decide that the only way to avert this outcome is to put her deal to the public through a People\u0027s Vote,\" suggested the report.  The sixth option of a vote following victory for a pro-referendum party in a snap general election within the next few months was judged \"very unlikely but not inconceivable\".  The roadmap made no recommendation on the question to be asked in any poll, something that would ultimately be a matter for the independent Electoral Commission.  But it said that, for reasons of \"simplicity, speed and clarity\", it was likely that a two-way choice - either \"the Government\u0027s deal versus stay\" or \"no deal versus stay\" - would be preferred over a multiple choice question.  Any vote should not be delayed by arguments over whether to extend the franchise to include 16 and 17-year-olds and expats or tighten social media rules.  But the report said social media companies should be warned they would face tougher regulation in future  they failed to take all actions within their power to prevent abuse of their platforms by campaigns.  David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary, asked how likely a second referendum would be  Parliament willed it, replied: \"Pretty unlikely because most people understand to announce a second referendum would be to invite the European Union to give us the worst deal possible in order to persuade us to stay in.  \"That\u0027s the consequence of a second referendum and is why it\u0027s a very bad idea it\u0027s completely against the national interest.\""},{"url":null,"title":"labour-ends-funding-for-kezia-dugdales-defence-in-wings-over-scotland-defamation-case","story":"  The move, which exposes Kezia Dugdale to potentially signicant costs, has been seen by some of her fellow MSPs as a \u0026ldquobetrayal and \u0026ldquofactionalism by her pro-Corbyn enemies.  Mr Campbell, 50, who runs the nationalist Wings Over Scotland website from his home in Bath, is suing Ms Dugdale for \u0026pound25,000 in a defamation action started last November.  It followed the Lothians MSP accusing him in her Daily Record column of making a homophobic remark about gay Scottish Secretary David Mundell.  Mr Campbell had said Mr Mundell\u0026rsquos son, the Tory MSP Oliver Mundell, was \u0026ldquothe sort of public speaker that makes you wish his dad had embraced his homosexuality sooner\".  In her column, Ms Dugdale said she was \u0026ldquoshocked and appalled to see a pro-independence blogger\u0027s homophobic tweets - Mr Campbell vigorously denies homophobia.  Until now, the UK labour party in London has bankrolled all of Ms Dugdale\u0026rsquos legal support, paying for a QC and an advocate to conduct her defence at Edinburgh Sherf Court.  The costs so far are understand to be close to \u0026pound100,000.  However, to the shock of Ms Dugdale and many other Labour MSPs, the UK party has now ended the arrangement, leaving Ms Dugdale to fend for herself.  Although the party will bear all of Ms Dugdale\u0026rsquos costs to date, it will not pay for any more legal counsel or any damages and costs  she loses.  It is understood UK Labour, which raised \u0026pound56m last year, did not tell Ms Dugdale directly of its decision, but informed her lawyers that it was no longer standing behind her case.  Ms Dugdale, 37, who was Scottish Labour leader from 2015 to 2017, opposed Jeremy Corby becoming UK leader, earning the lasting resentment of his supporters, who now dominate the party apparatus.  As the publisher of Ms Dugdale\u0026rsquos column, it is understood the Daily Record may now supply Ms Dugdale with legal support for the rest of the case.  However any help would not extend to damages and costs  Mr Campbell won his case.  Earlier this month, Sherf Kenneth McGowan refused Ms Dugdale\u0026rsquos request to have the action thrown out and agreed to proceed to an evidential hearing.  Ms Dugdale had been on the point of appealing that decision when UK Labour withdrew its support, forcing her to scramble to lodge the appeal.  Ms Dugdale\u0026rsquos spokesman said: \u0026ldquoGiven the principles on which it was founded - equality, fairness and justice - the UK Labour Party wholeheartedly committed to paying all legal costs associated with this case from start to finish.  \u0026ldquoIt is very much hoped that all promises will be kept.  UK Labour said: \u0026ldquoIt would be inappropriate to comment on a live, ongoing legal case.  Mr Campbell declined to comment."},{"url":null,"title":"carwyn-jones-general-election-needed-if-edinburgh-and-cardiff-vote-against-mays-brexit-plan","story":"  And the Labour leader made clear that a rejection of a Brexit deal by either the Scottish Parliament or Welsh Assembly could also eventually trigger a second referendum on the UK\u0027s relationship with the EU.  Wales voted to leave the bloc by a margin of 52.5 to 47.5 per cent in the 2016 referendum, although recent polls have suggested a swing towards remain. In Scotland, there was a strong majority \u0026ndash 62 to 38 per cent \u0026ndash to remain.  Setting out what he believes should happen  the Prime Minister secured a withdrawal agreement with Brussels, Mr Jones said: \"The next step is to see whether a deal can be supported by, for me, parliaments plural: Westminster, Edinburgh and Cardf.  \"If that doesn\u0027t happen, then I don\u0027t see any alternative other than a general election where Brexit would be the main issue.  \"If there\u0027s an inconclusive result as a result of that general election, well, how then do you resolve the issue without going back to the very same people who took the decision in the first place? At that point you are talking about the potential for a second referendum,\" added the AM for Bridgend.  His remarks came as battle-lines were being drawn ahead of this evening\u0026rsquos informal EU summit in Salzburg when Mrs May will seek to convince her fellow leaders of her Chequers Plan.  But ahead of it, Whitehall sources suggested that she had already rejected the \u0026ldquoimproved offer on the Irish border mooted by Michel Barnier, the EU\u0026rsquos chief negotiator.  One insider explained that Mr Barnier had still not dropped his view that Northern Ireland should be treated as a separate customs jurisdiction from the rest of the UK.  \u0026ldquoAny backstop will have to respect our red line that there is not a customs border in the Irish Sea. Mr Barnier has not said anything to suggest that his position has changed on that, said the source.  Nigel Dodds of the Democratic Unionist Party, which props up Mrs May\u0027s minority administration in Parliament, gave Mr Barnier\u0027s proposals short shrt.  \"It still means a border down the Irish Sea although with dferent kinds of checks,\" said the party\u0027s deputy leader, adding: \u0026ldquoThe fact is that both Theresa May and the Labour Party have said no British prime minister could accept such a concept. It is not just Unionists who object.\"  Meanwhile, Donald Tusk made clear the UK\u0026rsquos Brexit plans needed to be \"reworked\".  Those positive areas included foreign and security policy co-operation, he explained.  But in a blow to Mrs May\u0027s approach, Mr Tusk noted: \"On other issues such as the Irish question or the framework for economic co-operation the UK\u0027s proposals will need to be reworked and further negotiated.  He added that perhaps there was now \u0026ldquomore hope but there is surely less and less time\".  According to extracts released ahead of Mr Davis\u0027s speech, the former Cabinet minister will say: \"We have been told that the Chequers proposal fulfils what the British people voted for. Well, I am afraid I simply do not buy that.  \"Fty-two per cent of British voters oppose the proposals. Only 18 per cent approve. It is quite remarkable for a government policy to be that unpopular. And, for me, the Chequers plan was always a non-starter.  He noted how in her speeches at Lancaster House and at the Mansion House, the PM had promised to  control over the country\u0026rsquos laws, money and borders. These promises, he stressed, were in the Tory manesto too, yet the Chequers Plan crossed all of those red lines.  \"The EU is often correctly described as having a democratic deficit. But Chequers is devoid of democracy altogether.  \"This is why many of us will shortly be presenting an alternative plan which will outline a more ambitious vision.\"  Mr Davis will go on to say that German companies should not fear a more competitive UK outside the EU but, rather, should \"embrace the opportunity that it will create for German workers, families and businesses large and small\".  \"In the long run, the friendly economic competition between neighbours is massively beneficial.  \"Beneficial for the German companies whose supply chains will be provided with improved components from British factories, beneficial for the consumers of tomorrow, who will enjoy the fruits of a more competitive global economy, and beneficial for the students and entrepreneurs of all Europe,\" the Yorkshire MP will add."},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-government-loses-vote-on-p1-assessments","story":"  Holyrood voted 63 to 61 to pause and review tests for P1 pupils, after complaints from teachers about them being of little value, and parents reporting\u0026nbspchildren in tears.  The SNP government has promoted the standardised national assessments as a key tool to gather information about P1 children\u0026rsquos abilities and to fine tune their teaching.  The vote is not binding on the government, but was a blow to Mr Swinney\u0026rsquos reputation as Education Secretary, and a sign the opposition could embed it in law at a later date.  The decision saw the Greens, Labour and LibDems line up with the Tories while only the SNP voted for a continuation of the computer-based literacy and numeracy tests.  The government defeat came just three months after Mr Swinney was forced to shelve his flagship Education Bill because teachers and other parties would not support the reforms.  The Tory-led manoeuvre followed an often bad-tempered debate in which Mr Swinney and other SNP MSPs accused the Conservatives of rank hypocrisy and political opportunism.  Ruth Davidson\u0026rsquos party had previously advocated standardised tests at P1 and endorsed the government\u0026rsquos use of them in its 2016 Holyrood manesto.  Tory education spokeswoman said her party had been wrong in the past.  \u0026ldquoWe made a mistake about P1, she said, adding her party remained in favour of assessments at P4, P7 and S3.  She told the Education Secretary: \u0026ldquoI think the time has come, because of the evidence that has been piling up over the last two years, to call a halt, reconsider the evidence that is very much before us and evaluate what is the best way of progressing P1 pupils.\"  Mr Swinney said he was \u0026ldquoappalled by the Conservative Party and accused it of \u0026ldquodeceit.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe Conservatives are playing politics with the education of our children and we will not play along \u0026nbspwith them.  He defended the assessments as an essential part of a good education system, an integral part of effective teaching and learning, and part of \u0026ldquonormal classwork that took little time.  After the vote, other parties demanded the SNP respect the will of parliament, something ministers have repeatedly told Westminster to do on constitutional issues.  Ms Smith said: \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Parliament has voted decisively on this matter, and now the SNP government must act on that. The nationalists have ignored the evidence on this for quite some time, but they can\u0026rsquot afford to any longer.  \u0026ldquoThese tests need to be halted, and the evidence re-examined. The SNP is always talking about how important the Scottish Parliament is and how its will must be respected.  \u0026ldquoThis is the perfect chance for the SNP to do just that.  Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard used a point of order immediately after the vote to demand the government respect the outcome.  He said: \u0026ldquoTeachers told this government that these tests were useless, ministers ignored them. Parents told this government that they do not trust these tests, ministers ignored them.  \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Parliament has now voted to scrap these tests and SNP ministers must not now ignore the will of Parliament. The Government must therefore bring forward immediate plans for how it will respond to this evening\u0026rsquos vote as a matter of urgency.  Green education spokesman Ross Greer said: \u0026ldquoWhat\u0026rsquos truly shocking about the introduction of these standardised tests is that all the issues highlighted by Greens and others were already well known when the SNP decided to press ahead.  \u0026ldquoMembers of the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos own International Council of Education Experts have been at the forefront of these criticisms and ministers still cannot explain why they would ignore their own experts, never mind the voices of a majority of Scotland\u0026rsquos teachers.  \u0026ldquoNow a majority in the Scottish Parliament have joined the calls to scrap these tests for four and five year olds and in a fit of arrogance, the government seems set to ignore our decision.  \u0026ldquoThe concerns that Greens have raised are not limited to the P1 tests. The whole concept of standardised testing does more harm than good to our young people. John Swinney should follow the evidence, accept the will of parliament and scrap the tests immediately.  But SNP MSP Gordon MacDonald said all the opposition parties were \u0026ldquoguilty of the most appalling hypocrisy for siding with the Tories to score political points.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government introduced p1 assessments because they are a tool we need to track kids\u0026rsquo progress and help drive up standards in our schools.  \u0026ldquoThe Tories put standardised P1 assessments in their manesto the majority of Tory-run councils across Scotland already assessed kids from P1 so did Labour and the Lib Dems.  \u0026ldquoLabour and the Lib Dems have sided with the Tories in their political gamesmanship, and sought to prey on the anxieties of parents, just to grab a headline.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos depressing that they all stood willing to do so at the expense of kids\u0026rsquo education.  \u0026ldquoWhen it comes to educating our young people, we should be united in an ambition to drive up standards \u0026ndash not exploiting these issues for political gain.  Sue Palmer, chair of the educational charity Upstart, which promoted a boycott of the assessments, said: \u0026ldquoThe opposition parties made many cogent arguments against the P1 testing and it\u0026rsquos very disappointing that the Scottish government isn\u0026rsquot prepared to listen to them.  \u0026ldquoWe at Upstart Scotland are particularly pleased that one of the closing speeches against the tests mentioned the long-term implications of beginning testing at such an early age in terms of children\u0026rsquos social and emotional development. \u0026nbsp  \u0026ldquoThere is growing evidence that the decline of self-directed play  coupled with an early focus on teaching specic academic skills is helping to fuel mental health problems among children and young people.    \u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"new-details-of-45m-loan-to-firm-owned-by-fms-adviser","story":"  The Herald has learned the first \u0026pound15m tranche was given to Ferguson Marine Engineering Ltd, the last commercial shipyard on the Clyde, because it was\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoexperiencing cash flow challenges.  The problem was caused by cost overruns on a \u0026pound97m government contract for two CalMac ferries which have been beset by delays.  Despite the money trouble, records seen by the Herald say the loan was \u0026ldquounsecured, meaning not backed by assets, so  the firm goes broke taxpayers are at the end of the queue.  Ferguson\u0026rsquos is part of the Clyde Blowers empire owned by Monaco-based Jim McColl, who sits on the First Minister\u0026rsquos Council of Economic Advisers.  Finance Secretary Derek Mackay learned of the cash flow issue in July 2017 and the loan was made last September, but he did not tell Holyrood\u0026rsquos finance committee until seven months later, when he sent a confidential letter referring to the trouble.  Until last week, there was no public record of the loan due to \u0026ldquocommercial confidentiality.  In June, Mr Mackay announced a further \u0026pound30m loan to Ferguson\u0026rsquos to help it \u0026ldquoersy. However records seen by the Herald cast doubt on whether this will ever be repaid.  They show Ferguson\u0026rsquos could convert the loan into shares, which may not hold their value. In addition, the loan would not be repaid in a crisis until Ferguson\u0026rsquos insurance company, HCCI, was paid what it was owed first, as it is the first-ranked creditor.  Tory MSP Jamie Greene said: \u0026ldquoThe SNP have been anything but transparent. It took Derek Mackay over seven months to alert the Finance Committee about the first loan, and there are still huge question marks over the details.  \u0026ldquoHe then changed his story on what the money was for, saying that instead of ersication as first claimed, it was to plug a hole in the ferry contracts.  \u0026ldquoThis deal has been shrouded in secrecy. It\u0026rsquos not good enough for MSPs to go months in the dark - the SNP need to come clean and finally provide all the information surrounding these loans.

Opposition parties argue Mr Swinney must obey the will of parliament, but voting figures of 63 to 61 show how close the decision was.  It was exactly this ergence of opinion that Mr Swinney faced when he addressed an audience of educational professionals at the Scottish Learning Festival in Glasgow on the morning of the vote.  As Storm Ali began to make itself heard around the auditorium of the SEC Centre, the minister would have expected a buffeting on testing as the audience of teachers, heads and other educational professionals were invited to ask questions.  It did not start well. A teacher from a primary school in Galashiels, in the Scottish Borders, said her experience of P1 testing was that they were not working.  \u0026ldquoThey are actually a huge waste of time and money in the way they are being enforced in primary schools, she said.  \u0026ldquoIt is not that I have an objection in principle to the idea of standardised assessments, but what I am seeing in practice is that they don\u0026rsquot work, they are not suitable and my colleagues around me feel exactly the same way.  \u0026ldquoThere is a widespread feeling in Scottish primary schools that they are not fit for purpose.  As Mr Swinney scribbled hastily into his notebook in preparation for a dficult answer, a headteacher from another primary school came to his rescue.  \u0026ldquoWe did not find any level of stress at all and the primary one children actually quite enjoyed taking part, she said.  \u0026ldquoIn terms of the feedback we found them to be extremely helpful. We had a small group of boys that I think we had the wrong measure of when it came down to teacher judgement and it changed how we looked at the support they needed. I think we had underestimated them.  \u0026ldquoThe depth of feedback and the quality of feedback the assessments gave us really helped those children.  Mr Swinney said the contrasting remarks illustrated the ergence of opinion on the benefits of the assessments for five-year-olds.  But what he was at pains to stress to the audience was his belief in the quality of feedback they could provide.  He said: \u0026ldquoWhat literally drew an intake of breath from a group of teachers who went through the assessments with me was when they saw the diagnostic information and the way it was presented.  \u0026ldquoIt marshalled some of the strengths and the challenges that young people face and the purpose of standardised assessments is to make sure we are able to learn from what the experience of young people has been, what their challenges are and then to do something about it.  \u0026ldquoThe attainment gap exists when young people come into formal education and the challenge is to try and narrow that as quickly as we possibly can which is why I take the view that P1 assessments are helpful in that respect.  Lurking in the audience to hijack the Education Secretary further on assessments was Larry Flanagan, general secretary of the Educational Institute of Scotland teaching union.  Mr Flanagan, whose union has backed a campaign to encourage parents to opt out of P1 testing, raised the issue of councils who blanket test pupils, rather than allowing inidual teachers to decide - a phenomenon blamed for greater levels of pupil stress.  Mr Flanagan said: \u0026ldquoA set of guidelines was produced, one of which was that teachers would control when these assessments were done.  \u0026ldquoWe know that 25 out of 32 local authorities breached that guideline and instructed teachers when to carry out the assessments.  With a nod to his past as a secondary school English teacher, Mr Flanagan then drew on the words of Hamlet to ask: \u0026ldquoSo in terms of empowerment, there\u0026rsquos the rub. How do we turn rhetoric around professional autonomy into a reality?  Mr Swinney conceded that he did not agree with Mr Flanagan on many things, and also expressed mock surprise the union leader had not taken the opportunity to raise the ongoing issue of pay.  But Mr Flanagan did get a concession from the minister on the need to ensure the guidance was being followed.  Mr Swinney said: \u0026ldquoI don\u0026rsquot always say this, but I agree with Larry Flanagan. The guidance is clear that teachers should choose at what point it is appropriate to undertake the assessments and that should be respected and I will pursue that in my discussion with local authorities."},{"url":null,"title":"theresa-may-tells-eu-leaders-in-salzburg-chequers-is-only-credible-plan-on-the-table","story":"  As the Prime Minister promoted her compromise proposals over dinner with fellow European leaders at an informal summit in Salzburg, Carwyn Jones, the Welsh First Minister, intervened, arguing that  Holyrood and Cardf were to oppose the final Brexit deal, then there should be a general election, which could eventually lead to another EU referendum.  \"The next step is to see whether a deal can be supported by, for me, parliaments plural: Westminster Edinburgh and Cardf.

Before the Salzburg dinner began at the Felsenreitschule - the theatre made famous by the von Trapp family in the film The Sound of Music \u0026ndash Mrs May insisted her Brexit blueprint was \"the only credible and negotiable plan on the table that delivers no hard border in Northern Ireland and also delivers on the vote of the British people\".  She stressed: \"If we are going to achieve a successful conclusion then, just as the UK has evolved its position, the EU will need to evolve its position too.\"  But ahead of the dinner Donald Tusk, the European Council President, made clear the UK\u0026rsquos Brexit plans needed to be \"reworked\".  Announcing a special EU summit in mid-November \u0026ndash which will set the scene for signing any Brexit agreement \u0026ndash Mr Tusk said that while there was \u0026ldquomore hope a deal would be done, there was \u0026ldquoless time in which to do it.

But Whitehall sources made clear that the private suggestions about Brussels\u0027s new proposals were unacceptable as they still did not drop the view that Northern Ireland could be treated as a separate customs jurisdiction from the rest of the UK.  Mrs May stressed: \u0026ldquoWhat we cannot accept is seeing Northern Ireland carved away from the UK customs territory because, regardless of where the checks would be, what that would mean would be that it would be a challenge to our constitutional and economic integrity.\"  She also decried \u0026ldquoprominent Labour members like the Mayor of London, who were now trying to take Britain \u0026ldquoback to square one with support for a People\u0026rsquos Vote on Brexit.  \"I want to be absolutely clear, this government will never accept a second referendum, declared the PM, adding: \"We held a People\u0027s Vote it was the referendum in 2016.  \u0026ldquoPeople voted to leave the European Union, it is now a matter of trust in politicians that we should deliver on the vote of the British people,\" she added.

But the Government declined to do so, declaring: \u0026ldquoGovernments should not be in the business of owning banks nor should they intervene in the commercial, operational or management decisions of business.  Such decisions, it argued, were rightly the responsibility of boards and management teams, who were \u0026ldquobest placed to set strategy and commercial direction and to make day-to-day management decisions.  Last December, RBS announced it would shut a total of 62 branches north of the border but later ten of them were given a stay of execution until at least the end of this year, pending a review.  Committee member Danielle Rowley, the Scottish Labour MP for Midlothian, said the Government\u0026rsquos response was disappointing and showed it continued to \u0026ldquowash its hands of branch closures.  \u0026ldquoBut  it continues with its stated aim to  RBS to private ownership without making a strategic intervention to solve this problem, taxpayers will rightly ask what good their investment did beyond the initial emergency bailout, she said.  Ms Rowley accused the Government of being \"wedded to their dogma that the state has no role in the commercial banking sector, and claimed the Tories were missing a golden opportunity to make a positive dference and support communities across Scotland.  Noting how in her own constituency Bonnyrigg had lost the last bank on the high street and was now facing the prospect of losing its Post Office too, the backbencher added: \u0026ldquoThe evidence gathered by the committee was clear and our recommendations were reasonable. It is unfortunate that the Government has chosen to bury its head in the sand.\"  In 2008 following the financial crash, the taxpayer bailed out RBS to the tune of \u0026pound45 billion.  In June when the Government sold off another tranche of shares \u0026ndash at a loss of \u0026pound2.1bn \u0026ndash the public stake in the bank fell from 70.1 per cent to 62.4. The sale raised \u0026pound2.5bn.  The Government has said it intends to sell \u0026pound15bn-worth of RBS shares by 2023. The overall loss to the taxpayer is set to be around \u0026pound26bn.  In February, the bank reported an annual profit of \u0026pound752 million its first for a decade and a sharp turnaround from the \u0026pound6.95bn loss seen the previous year."},{"url":null,"title":"hogmanay-sends-a-forget-me-not-love-letter-to-the-eu-and-the-world","story":"  The famous quote did come to mind when I spoke to Charlie Wood and Ed Bartlam this week about their European-themed Hogmanay celebrations.

Mr Wood noted, accurately, of course, that the British islands are in Europe, geographically and culturally, whether anyone likes it or not. He says the focus is purely a apolitical one.  Well. Whether you believe that or not  this notably yearning Hogmanay theme - which involves noted writers in a series of commissions, musicians, and others - however, cannot be seen separately from our context, the prospect of the UK leaving the EU. Why else send a \u0026lsquoforget me not\u0026rsquo love letter?  It is fair to say that much of the cultural world is viewing Brexit with, as with the majority of Scots, alarm, consternation and dismay.  Mr Wood and Mr Bartlam, who are successful venue operators at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, know this.

Mrs May has been adamant that there will be no second referendum on Brexit nor any extension to Article 50 ie Britain will leave the EU on March 29 next year.

Local resident and self-professed \u0026ldquoTrinkie lover Bryan Newlands welcomed the group\u0026rsquos formation, underlining that the pool harboured a lot of memories. \u0026ldquoI used to go there a lot... Even though I lived on the other side of town, every summer myself and a friend would go \u0026ndash even when it was raining, he said. \u0026ldquoIt was a great place as the town didn\u0026rsquot have an indoor swimming pool until 1994. Many people learned to swim at the Trinkie.While a slideshow showed images of how the pool used to look and how much Wickers got from it, other more contemporary images show a dilapidated ruin \u0026ndash a far cry from the hustle, bustle and smiles of yesteryear.The new group was formed with a mission to \u0026ldquobring the pool back to le and a number of office-bearers were proposed and elected.James Bremner was elected chairman with other roles going to William Macdonald , Catherine Patterson  and Garance Warburton .Seven committee members were also elected: Fiona Bremner, Trudi Mcalpine, Davina Lyall, Fiona McPhee, Leslie Grant, Roddy Mackay and Councillor Willie Mackay.Ms Patterson underlined that it was going to be no easy fix as \u0026ldquothere are holes in the wall at the deep end, which also has cracks that go right down to the ground.\u0026ldquoThe previous group... had the holes patched up, but they kept reappearing, she said. \u0026ldquoThe wall itself is also crumbling and the bridge that ides the deep and shallow ends has had its fixtures corroded. Also the south access road that leads the public to the pool is in poor nick.She stressed that volunteers to patch things up and general goodwill is always welcome, \u0026ldquobut [often] their help only scratches the surface of what needs to be done.She added: \u0026ldquoMajor investment is needed along with a report from a structural engineer to see how much damage there is, what can and cannot be done, and to get an estimate of how much the restoration will cost.Mr Newlands \u0026ndash committee member Ms Lyall\u0026rsquos son \u0026ndash stressed that the Trinkie added tremendous character to Wick.\u0026ldquoPut it this way, with the summer we\u0026rsquove had, that pool would have been full had it been in use, he said.Other memories came from Wick Society chairman Iain Leith. \u0026ldquoGoing there was a popular pastime in its day with adults and kids from all over Pulteneytown flocking to it, he said.\u0026ldquoRestoring it could be a big boost to the town\u0026rsquos economy by making it a tourist attraction as well as giving back the town a much-loved landmark.Ms Patterson emphasised that the Trinkie had the potential to be an asset to both locals and tourists.\u0026ldquoBut we need investment because  nothing gets done the pool is on its way out.Thursday 20 Sep 2018 11:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117364.jpg","title":"New service gives job hunters a Fair Start","story":"\u0026nbspScottish Government ViewpointFAIR Start Scotland is the country\u0027s new devolved employment support service.It is focused on supporting unemployed people who have challenges in accessing the labour market for whom work is a realistic prospect.Launched in April, earlier this year, it is an example of one of the first uses of newly devolved powers under the 2016 Scotland Act.The service will run until 2023 and aims to provide tailored, flexible and person-centred support to at least 38,000 people across Scotland who want help to find work, and stay in work.Fair Start Scotland is distinctive in that participation is purely voluntary.This means that people have everything to gain and nothing to lose \u0026ndash choosing to participate will not affect existing benefits or be driven by fear of benefit sanctions.The service is delivered locally, meaning that no participants are left without the support they need.Delivery is over nine geographic areas including the Highlands and reflects local area economies, meeting the needs of employers, disabled people and those at risk of long-term unemployment.Jamie Hepburn, Minister for Business, Fair Work and Skills, said: \"What\u0027s crucial about Fair Start Scotland is that it treats people with fairness, dignity and respect and that it is focused on the needs of the inidual.\"We are dedicated to delivering a high quality employment support service that will lead to real and sustained job outcomes and help people to achieve their full potential.\"As well as meeting the needs of unemployed people, Fair Start Scotland also seeks to help businesses find the skilled and committed employees they need to thrive.\"One of the many now benefitting is Highlander Alan Cairns .He has not worked for over a year and his biggest barriers to work have been low confidence and computer skills but now he has secured 16 hours of work per week.Alan started on the Fair Start Scotland service in the middle of May and has been attending the service for the past 12 weeks.

Like that earlier work, The Katanes Saga is told in an unpretentious, engaging, sometimes blokey style. From the drunken arguments to the devious plots to the mutilations and killings, Cassells tells it like it is.\u0026ldquoThe Raven Banner was basically a guide to Norse Caithness with a little bit about each area and what I thought were the main things that happened in Norse times, he explains. \u0026ldquoThe Katanes Saga is far more in-depth.\u0026ldquoThey were people like you and me. They had the same faults. You could meet three Vikings in the pub any night.\u0026ldquoOne word I would use to describe the Norse is pragmatic. They were really pragmatic people. If that\u0026rsquos the way it works, that\u0026rsquos the way it works \u0026ndash  it doesn\u0026rsquot, I\u0026rsquoll do it my way.\u0026ldquoI do mention that of all the Norse earls of Orkney only a handful actually died in their beds. Most suffered violent deaths. One was killed with contact poison from his own auntie and mother on a shirt.Cassells  is a retired Royal Mail manager who previously worked as a lighthouse keeper on Muckle Flugga and Stroma. Those experiences inspired two other books, No More Paraffin-Oilers and A Light Walk.The Katanes Saga sees him ing to a theme that first sparked his interest at an early age. Born in Barrow, he moved to Thurso in late 1950s when his father came to work at the Admiralty test establishment.\u0026ldquoI always liked Greek and Roman mythology and I started reading about Norse mythology as well, he recalls. \u0026ldquoAs a young boy I lived in Sweyn Road in Thurso and I wondered who Sweyn was. A pal of mine said, \u0026lsquoAch, that\u0026rsquoll be Sweyn the pirate.\u0026rsquo So for about a year I had this happy vision of a Pugwash-type character that the street was named after. I then discovered Sweyn Aslearson.Swyen , iously described \u0026ldquothe last of the Vikings and \u0026ldquothe greatest troublemaker in the westernlands, had an estate at Duncansby and was renowned for raiding, plundering and pillaging. One of the many who suffered at his hands was Frakokk, who had featured in the poisoned-shirt incident: she was burned to death in her farmhouse at Helmsdale, along with other members of her faction, in a revenge attack led by Swyen.It\u0026rsquos an example of the way in which many of the strands are intertwined, as Cassells points out.\u0026ldquoI read the sagas and I started taking a look at place names, he says. \u0026ldquoFor a long time I lived at Scrabster \u0026ndash Skarabolstadr, the \u0026lsquohomestead of the sea-mews\u0026rsquo.\u0026ldquoAnd the stories were interesting to read. They were intriguing.\u0026ldquoYou try and unravel it and it\u0026rsquos just more or less two families feuding all the way through it. That goes right to the very last act of the local earl being kned in a beer cellar in Thurso.One of the most shocking events is the burning to death of Bishop Adam by a mob in Halkirk in a dispute over a butter tax.\u0026ldquoHe got a bit greedy, Cassells says. \u0026ldquoThey complained to the earl at the time who more or less said, \u0026lsquoDamn the bishop, you can burn him as you please,\u0026rsquo so they took him at his word.\u0026ldquoBishops crop up a couple of times. There was lot of enmity between the local Norse earldom and the Scottish king over bishops. A bishop got his eyes put out in Scrabster.\u0026ldquoAfter the bishop was murdered at Halkirk, the Scottish king came up here and carried out what was, for want of a better description, pure genocide of the people from the Halkirk area. I believe they were all massacred round about where the Pennyland estate is now in Thurso. Hundreds of people were killed there.\u0026ldquoIn those days you just didn\u0026rsquot go burning bishops \u0026ndash they\u0026rsquore going to come down heavy on you.\u0026ldquoRavenshill Road used to be known as the Gallows Hill, before the atomic houses were built there, so that has been a place for judicial executions for quite a long time.From the machinations of the \u0026ldquofemme fatale Ragnhild at Murkle to the murder of Earl Rognvald at Forsie to the Battle of Clairdon Hill outside Thurso, the power struggles and manoeuvrings come thick and fast. It\u0026rsquos a rapid-fire history lesson, but more than anything Cassells simply wants people to enjoy the stories.\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a thing I never learned in school here. It was never mentioned, he says. \u0026ldquoThis is our own local history, and I just hope people think it\u0026rsquos a good read.The Katanes Saga  is self-published and is on sale in Caithness Horizons, newsagents in Thurso, and Wick Heritage Museum.Thursday 20 Sep 2018 11:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117588.jpg","title":"Preloved pet trade blasted","story":"\u0026nbspA CAITHNESS-based animal rights campaigner is calling for a change in the law to stop \"heartless\" pet owners from selling unwanted animals online.Natalie Oag, who is backing a proposal by the Scottish Government for the introduction of a special licence for dog owners, says animals listed on sites such as Preloved are the victims of a \"throwaway society\".\"Pets shouldn\u0027t be viewed the same as inanimate objects when no longer wanted,\" said Ms Oag, the Highland representative for the Peta Foundation .Pets listed on Preloved include a 9ft python available for \u0026pound1000 and, until a few days ago, a heavily muscled eight-month-old \"untrained\" micro pocket American bulldog for \u0026pound2000 \u0026ndash listed as it did not get along with another dog.Other listings include a sheepdog which \"adores humans\" but is not interested in sheep, while on Gumtree \u0026ndash which has recently imposed a \u0026pound2.99 fee to deter \"casual\" trading \u0026ndash pets for sale include an 18-month-old cat looking for a \"stable\" household, a pair of two-year-old \"very tame\" rabbits and a one-year-old cat whose owner claims to have developed a skin allergy.It is not illegal to post adverts and sell pets online.

While this may not achieve the same speeds as some other options, it may at least offer the benefit of a solution in the nearer future.“I welcome the fact that BT has agreed to investigate the practicalities of installing radio links and hope that this can play a part in helping deliver the improved broadband services that communities across Orkney desperately need to see.\u0026#8221\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

They worried that the business case for the cinema and hub was not sufficient and risked adding to the number of empty buildings in Cromarty.Others argued that the project would be out of keeping with Cromarty\u0026rsquos historic architecture.A report which went before this week\u0026rsquos committee said that Cromarty Community Council had taken a neutral stance over the proposals, but that a consultation it held with the public found that, out of 63 residents who responded, 37 supported the plans and 26 were opposed.Recommending approval council planners said existing paths through the site would be maintained and added that the location within an area that is already fenced off meant there was a \"perceptible distinction\" between the yard site and wider Links area.They added that the film society had looked at other existing venues for a possible cinema and found none were suitable, and added that Cromarty Estate had argued there was \"a demand from local groups and businesses for office space\".Voting unanimously in favour of the plans, a number of councillors on the committee said it was an exciting project but also acknowledged some of the local reservations over the business case.Dingwall and Seaforth councillor Margaret Paterson said that while some in the community had doubts over the cinema\u0026rsquos financial viability, she stressed that \"the film society is active and forward-thinking and they will get the people\".Wick and East Caithness councillor Raymond Bremner also acknowledged local fears that the community might be left with \"dficult buildings\"  the development didn\u0026rsquot \"quite work\" but praised the application and gave his support to it.And Dingwall and Seaforth councillor Angela Maclean said she believed the hub and cinema was \"a venue that can be used by lots of dferent groups in the community\" and would boost the neighbouring Slaughterhouse Cafe.\"This is an exciting development for Cromarty \u0026ndash it\u0026rsquos a cosmopolitan and very artistic community,\" she added.Thursday 20 Sep 2018 11:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The findings from these will be fed into the on-going options investigation study, which is expected to report in the autumn of 2018 on ways to improve the junctions to help reduce the risk of accidents.\"Road safety is a priority for the Scottish Government and we understand the concerns of the community. We have undertaken to update stakeholders on progress and would like to take this opportunity to reassure the community that the A9 at Tain remains a trunk road safety priority.\"In 2015 Transport Scotland\u0026rsquos operating company for the region, Bear, carried out a number of works on the A9 at the Tain north junction, including new signing, extended central hatching and high friction surfacing on the local road approach to the A9.Have you been involved in an accident or near miss in the area?

A farm trailer chassis was found at Avoch. And at Nigg, an abandoned kayak, plastic pieces and a large rusting boat were found.For more details about the project visit www.scrapbook.org.ukThursday 20 Sep 2018 11:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Brian Ferguson meets the team behind Long Shadows \u0026#8211 including the latest Rebus \u0026#8211 ahead of its Scottish run                It has been more than 30 years since Inspector Rebus cracked his first case.            Now Ian Rankin is preparing for the prospect of seeing his creation in the flesh for the first time.            Fans of the grizzled Edinburgh detective will be able to see him in a whole new light from this week when the character finally makes his stage debut.Long Shadows, the first Rebus story to be penned with another writer, has seen Rankin collaborate with Rona Munro, the Aberdeen-born playwright best known for her epic historical trilogy The James Plays. The show, which will premiere at Birmingham Rep tonight before a King’s Theatre run on Rebus’s home turf next month, is not only a brand new Rebus story. Devotees of the retired detective will also get the chance to see him lock horns on stage with his long-time nemesis, Maurice “Big Ger” Cafferty.The characters will be brought to le by Coronation Street veteran Charlie Lawson, the Northern Irish actor known to millions of viewers as Jim McDonald, and Scottish Game of Thrones star John Stahl, with award-winning actress Cathy Tyson, who shot to fame in film debut Mona Lisa, playing Rebus’s long-time sidekick Siobhan Clarke.Long Shadows is Rankin’s second venture into the world of theatre after writing Dark Road, which Rebus was noticeably absent from, for the Royal Lyceum Theatre in Edinburgh five years ago with then artistic director, Mark Thomson.             Rankin and Munro, who had never previously met, began working together on a story after the author was approached by London-based producer Daniel Schumann with the idea of a Rebus stage play.Rankin says: “I felt it would be an awful lot of work and didn’t feel confident writing for the stage on my own, but told him I would be happy doing it with someone else.“He mentioned Rona Munro to me. I was a huge fan of her work like The James Plays, but didn’t know her at all. We met up a few times and got on like a house on fire. “She was a fan of the books, which helped, but we decided early on that we didn’t want to adapt any of them.             “You can tie yourself up in knots trying to adapt something that wasn’t specically written for the stage. The Rebus novels usually have 30-odd characters, three or four twisty sub-plots and are hundreds of pages long.“I came up with the outline of a story and we would go for cups of tea and lunches and just brainstorm it. Once we had what we thought was the right plot she went away and did the dialogue.”Munro, whose previous stage plays include The Last Witch, about the last woman to be executed in Britain, and has written Doctor Who stories for TV, jumped at the chance to work with Rankin. She says: “My mother was a monster Ian Rankin fan. I resisted reading them for such a long time. I always felt I was such a disappointment in comparison!“Crime is a genre that I enjoy reading, but I’m picky. The ones I like I absolutely love, but there is an awful lot of rubbish out there.            “But Ian writes proper novels and Rebus is such a complicated character. If you read the books you get the opportunity to follow him over all those years and I think that’s part of the attraction. I actually went back and re-read all the novels which featured Cafferty in preparation for working on the play.“I’ve never done anything like this, which is writing in another writer’s style with another writer’s characters.“The writing of it was over a year ago, but it felt quite easy at the time, I think because I had someone else’s plot to lean on. I can do dialogue and character any day of the week, but having a tight plot is something I struggle with. It was a bit of a dream in that sense.”Long Shadows, which is described by Rankin as a “psychodrama,” sees Rebus and Cafferty thrust together again after the daughter of a murder victim turns up on the doorstep of the retired detective, who has been investigating cold cases for several years.Rankin explains: “I really like the idea of a crime that has happened in the past suddenly rearing its head again in the present.“There’s some unfinished business between Rebus and Cafferty over an old case and an investigation Siobhan is working brings it to light again, which leads to Rebus and Cafferty locking horns.“It is really a psychological game, with these two heavyweights kind of dancing around each other.“I love the idea of being able to see Rebus in the flesh and actually be physically in the same room as him, especially to see him slugging it out with Cafferty. “They are two big meaty roles – two men who are at a certain point in their lives where they are starting to ask big questions about what is left for them and their place in the world.”Lawson adds: “Rebus and Cafferty’s ‘friendship’ has been built up over 25 years. They’re very much like Holmes and Moriarty. You can see there is grudging respect for each other, but by the same token they are also battling like two bulls in a ring.”Lawson freely admits he has come to the role without reading any of Rankin’s novels and knowing nothing about the character.But the 59-year-old is more than familiar with Rebus’s home city – and his favourite watering hole – since his first visit early 40 years ago.“I have actually known the Oxford Bar since 1979.“My cousin Sandy, who was actually my best mate as well, lived on Heriot Row and used to drink in all these haunts like the Ox, the Hebrides and the West End Hotel. I remember Willie Ross, the landlord of the Ox, didn’t allow any women in the bar and would quite easily fling people out at the drop of a hat.“I met loads of retired police officers there. It was full of very smart alcoholics who did The Scotsman crossword.“I appeared at the Assembly Rooms during the Edinburgh Festival in 1981 in a show called Diary of a Hunger Strike and have been to Edinburgh many, many times, since then – it’s honestly my favourite city in the world.”Lawson concedes that all he knew about the character of Rebus when he was offered the part in the play, without the need for an audition, was that he had been played by John Hannah and Ken Stott in the TV incarnations of some of Rankin’s early novels.He adds: “It was one of those things that was a ‘yes’ straight away. You don’t turn something like this down. You need to really challenge yourself now and again as an actor.“I’m quite glad I was unfamiliar with the character. You don’t want to bring baggage like that with you to a role. I approached it with a blank sheet of paper from day one. I’m right in the thick of it now.“The complexities of Rebus are obvious. We’re not doing some existential piece. His faults are all there, warts and all, from page one.”Rankin is at pains to point out to his fans that the new play is set in a “parallel world” to the one created in his novels.He adds: “There are basically going to be two audiences – people who know and love Rebus and people who just want a good night out at the theatre and might never have read any of the books.“It slots into the Rebus universe. You get a bit more of Cafferty’s back story and a bit more of Rebus’s working relationship with Siobhan Clarke.“It’s a really great cast and \u2028it will hopefully bring in people who know them but might \u2028not know me. I might get a few new fans out of it, you never know.”A LIFE OF CRIME: REBUS IN PRINT AND ON SCREENInspector John Rebus made his debut in Ian Rankin’s second novel, Knots and Crosses, which was published in March 1987.The Fe-born author had begun writing novels while he was supposed to be working towards a PhD in Scottish literature at Edinburgh University.Rankin was said to have been surprised that the first Rebus thriller was classied as crime fiction when he had set out to write a modern-day version of Robert Louis Stevenson’s Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.Rankin has admitted Rebus was actually killed off in the first draft of Knots and Crosses and he was persuaded by his publisher to revive the character in another novel.The character has appeared in a further 20 novels since then, despite an apparent swan song more than a decade ago in Exit Music, which signalled his official retirement from the force.However, after a five-year hiatus, Rankin has gone on to revive the character in another four novels, which have seen Rebus help serving detectives to investigate unresolved “cold cases.”As well as the new stage play, Rankin is about to publish a brand new Rebus novel, In a House of Lies.More than 30 million Rebus novels are believed to have been sold around the world, while the books have been translated into 36 dferent languages to date.The most recent Rebus novel, Rather be the Devil, topped the best-seller charts for hardback fiction when it was released in November 2016. New Rebus novels are said to sell as many as half a million copies within just a few months of printing.Rankin, his publisher Orion and the Edinburgh International Book Festival marked the 30th anniversary of the detective last year by staging a three-day festival in the character’s home city.The first “RebusFest” included masterclasses, workshops, tours, live music and film events, and an exhibition of rarely-seen archive material.Rankin’s novels have previously been adapted for television by STV Productions, with John Hannah and then Ken Stott playing the leading role.However production was brought to a halt in 2008 amid reports Stott had decided he did not want to continue in the role.It was announced last year that Gregory Burke, the writer of the hit plays Gagarin Way and Black Watch, was working on a new “contemporary adaptation” of Rebus for TV. Speaking at the Edinburgh International Book Festival this year, Rankin revealed that a much younger actor than Stott was likely to play the role when Rebus s to the nation’s TV screens. The character was said to be 50 when he first appeared in Knots and Crosses.Other actors to play Rebus include Ron Donachie, who starred as the detective in Radio 4’s dramatisations of some of the novels, while James MacPherson, who is best-known for his long-running role in Taggart, has narrated audiobook versions of the novels.Rankin, who was awarded the OBE in 2002 for services to literature, has been the recipient of honorary degrees from the universities of Abertay, St Andrews, Hull and Edinburgh.Rebus: Long Shadows opens at Birmingham Rep tonight, and will be at the King’s Theatre, Edinburgh from 8-13 October www.capitaltheatres and His Majesty’s Theatre in Aberdeen from 12-17 November www.aberdeenperformingarts.        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4802813.1537437079!/image/image.jpg","title":"massive tapestry depicting games of thrones goes on display in glasgow","story":"        A huge Game of Thrones embroidery commissioned by the producers of the series has gone on display at a university in Glasgow.

The Scottish Government set out plans almost two years ago outlining how, short of remaining in the EU, the best option for Scotland and the whole of the UK would be to remain in the single market and customs union.            “And for two years, the Prime Minister has been promising that there would be a detailed, jointly-agreed position on the future relationship with the EU long before the UK was scheduled to leave.

The museum’s Scottish Design Galleries celebrate the influence of design at home and abroad, from Beano artwork to Hunter wellies and the Fair Isle jumper.The jewel in the crown is Mackintosh’s Oak Room – the painstakingly reconstructed interior of part of Miss Cranston’s Ingram Street Tea Rooms – which has been unseen for 50 years.Mr Long, who came to the V\u0026ampA Dundee from the National Galleries of Scotland, admits that laying his eyes on the exhibit for the first time was an emotional moment.He said: “It’s one of his great, but lost to view, interiors that is now complete and in the museum.“It brings back to public view after nearly 50 years – in fact it’s 70 years since it was used as a tea room – one of this great architect and designer’s works.            “I can tell you, it is a thrilling, quite emotional thing to walk in and see after all of these years.”The interior is on long-term loan following discussions with Glasgow Museums several years ago.Mr Long said: “The thing I’m especially proud of is the conservation and restoration of this original Mackintosh room.“Mackintosh is, after all, one of the world’s greatest architects and designers and happens to be part of Scotland’s design heritage.            “When we set about developing the Scottish Design Galleries, one of the things we needed to ensure was to represent Mackintosh as part of the work we were doing.”Museum bosses anticipate high volumes of visitors and entry over the opening weekend is reserved for those who have prebooked tickets.Access is otherwise free and non-ticketed, with the exception of big touring exhibitions. The first, Ocean Liners: Speed and Style, looks at the design and cultural impact of cruise ships and travel.Mr Long said: “There have been lots of challenges along the way and I’m very pleased and proud that we’ve seen our way through those.“The biggest challenge has been the magnitude of the project overall.            “V\u0026ampA Dundee is not an outstation of the V\u0026ampA in London. As one of the founding partners, V\u0026ampA is a core part, but we here in Dundee are a new team that has come together to develop this project and lead it long into the future.”The question has been asked why the V\u0026ampA chose Dundee to set up home, but Mr Long suggests it was the city that chose the V\u0026ampA. Representatives from the University of Dundee got the ball rolling in 2007, suggesting to the museum that it might like to be part of the waterfront regeneration.Mr Long said: “Dundee really gets the importance of cultural facilities and activities as part of the le of its citizens. That’s been clear over the last 20 years through the investment in new organisations like Dundee Contemporary Arts, or whether it’s the ongoing success of places like Dundee Rep Theatre or the Science Centre or the redevelopment of the McManus.“All of these things demonstrated to the leadership here that investment in culture is the right thing to do. All of that helped set the scene.”        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006. Construction began in 2016 and is expected to be completed on schedule in late summer.\nLocated at Seafield the new centre is just a short distance from the long-standing Eric Gray Centre. Once opened the centre will provide specialist assistance for adults with complex care needs and learning disabilities.\nThe building has been designed by Richard Gibson Architects and construction is being led by DITT. The drone footage was shot by Nick McCaffrey.\nThe centre does indeed look good and is on schedule well done DITT , the clients and staff are all looking forward to being in the building. It has taken many years to reach this point  and is much needed.\nI wonder what,  any, proof you have that clients and staff are looking forward to being in the building? If you do have some proof to justy your claim, are they looking forward to being in before or after completion?\nGeorge Dickson\nI have along with other parents of clients that currently use the Eric Gray Centre worked hard, and against many obstacles to finally see the realisation  of a much needed new building where all clients who are at this moment in dferent buildings due to there being not enough space in the old building and facilities that have run there course in time. It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep it  for the new building. The building will provide not only better facilities and space but will also give staff the help in coordination and equipment to do there job under one roof with less strain and expense to all.\nI also claim nothing but most people that have lived in Shetland for the last 10 years will be aware of the problems associated with the Eric Gray building, whether directly involved or not although the thinking and planning of a new building goes farther back than that.\nSome parents and staff have had a look through the new building at dferent stages of build, and everyone to my knowledge was impressed. I like many other parents and carers look forward to the day its complete and our daughters and sons can enjoy the help and encouragement from staff to live their lives to the best of their ability.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"\n\nMarc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August. It is part of the Year of Young People activities.\nThe youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.\nYear of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to 26 years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, \u0026#8216What do you enjoy about Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What makes you proud of Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What is Shetland famous for?\u0026#8217.\u0026#8221\n Send any ideas, before Friday 6th July 2018, to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call  744490 or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.\nThe SIC\u0026#8217s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.\n\u0026#8220This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People 2018.”\n\n\nAre they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be done\nI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.\nOver the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called \u0026#8216 limited edition rubbish \u0026#8216.\nI would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.\nNo doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230..despite the fact everybody else looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.\nLove the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder  the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary  to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder  takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary  to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain  credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on  it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself  doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate   and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! .\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists  when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.

I’ll lend you a trowel to apply the “paint” provided that you are prepared to produce it \u0026#8230\u0026#8230.. on stage at Mareel perhaps. After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and  you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 22 ","story":"After being tasked with compiling a feature to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the senior football inter-county, it was a pleasure to speak to several of those with first-hand knowledge of the history of the Milne Cup competition.\nGeordie Hunter goes the furthest back, having made his debut in the 1953 game. On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely dferent.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the  and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit  ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great inidual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois  Benjamin Pad , Raphaël Varane , Diego Godín , Ivan Strinic  Ivan Perisic , Luka Modric , Jordan Henderson , Eden Hazard  Cristiano Ronaldo , Edinson Cavani .\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the ing Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe  Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt  anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed,  anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.\nIt is rare enough for a local game to end 0-0, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.\nAstonishingly, Delting’s 4-1 triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.\nThe final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.\nDelting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.\nDevonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.\nThis is the 14th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back 36 years for Southend’s solitary success.\nApologies to older readers  I’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in 1982, but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.\nThe quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw 2-2 with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay 4-1 away from home.\nThe semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds  dficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.\nIn answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"spurs lose tight highland amateur cup final ","story":"Lerwick Spurs have narrowly lost the Highland Amateur Cup final after taking the tie to extra-time with a late equaliser.\nThe isles side had gone a goal down to Pentland United \u0026#8211 the competition\u0026#8217s most successful team \u0026#8211 in the 18th minute.\nPentland looked set to secure their eight Highland Amateur Cup trophy until a stoppage time equaliser from Spurs brought the game to extra-time.\nThe Lerwick side found themselves 2-1 down in the 6th minute of extra-time and were unfortunately unable to bag an equaliser.\nSpurs won five games on their way to the final including a quarter-final success against 2017 champions Avoch.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"big turnout to welcome the eighth serene to whalsay ","story":"The latest Serene arrives at the pier at Symbister.

A phone call from Brydon Thomason to Alastair Wilson, the Scottish Natural Heritage warden, alerted folk to them heading north off Westing, which triggered a mega sprint across to the coast where they were able to look down on about four animals including a male.\nTo be able to see them close to is a memorable experience, but to be able to look down on them underwater even more amazing. Such oppor­tunities don’t come often. They were also seen to catch a seal in the bay at Lund, and photographed by several folk during their progress north, and so hopefully can be identied by the team that are still up here researching the distribution and abundance of killer whales around Scotland.\nFrom photographs, it has been established that an orca seen off Cullivoe, north Yell, on the evening of the 12th July, is a big male known as 014 or “Bigga”.  Next day, the same inidual was identied at 0800hrs heading north through Yell Sound.\nSome of our showiest plants are in flower just now. “I know a bank whereon the wild thyme blows …” wrote William Shakespeare in “A Midsummer Night’s Dream”. And indeed I do. There’s a fantastic bank near me where the pale mauve flowers of thyme are pushing through between the bell heather, itself with some plants paler than others.\nCommon heather is not so bold in its colouration, but works in mass production, and will soon be colouring the hills with subtle shades. The third in the trio of obvious heathers is cross-leaved heath, whose compact flowerheads drooping from a single stem are pinker in colour.\nChanging colour, two striking plants are now in full bloom – angelica and meadowsweet. Although names for meadowsweet in dferent coun­tries all translate as “queen of the meadow”, it seems that its name actually comes from its use in flavouring the drink mead. Also in the days when hygiene was not quite so good as now, the plant with its rather nauseating scent was spread out on the floors of houses to counteract unpleasant odours. A Shetland name is “blackenin-girse”, from its use for dyeing wool.\nFrom the showy to the opposite – demure and unnoticed is a little plant with a big name that is very common about gardens, steps and roadsides: procumbent pearlwort. This low, hairless, tufted perennial has its base as a non-flowering rosette. However, the name pearlwort is said to come from the tiny, pearl-like white, long-stalked flowers whose sepals are actually longer than the usually four petals. In folklore it is said to have special powers of protection. So next time you go to pull out this so-called weed, just give it a closer look first. Maybe its powers of protection will rub off on you!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"div","story":"A DIVE vessel with 14 women on board was escorted into port after she began taking in water off Shetland on Sunday.\n issued a mayday call in bad weather soon after midday when she was approximately eight miles east of Sumburgh Head.

Opinion was also sought online. There is potential for the amended boundary to generate more planning applications. Parts of Grantown including The Square were designated as a conservation area in 1975. This is the first formal review since that designation.\nThe proposal is to extend the designated area along South High Street and into peripheral areas of the conservation zone. Mr Puls stressed it was not the purpose of a conservation area to prevent development but \"rather to control development to ensure it is appropriately sited and designed\".\nHe said this was aptly demonstrated by a number of new developments consented in recent years. Strong views were expressed \u0026ndash for and against \u0026ndash on the inclusion of the belt of trees to the north and west of Inverallan Church.\nThe trees contribute to the setting of the conservation area, forming a backdrop to the B-listed church \"and provide a natural separation with the later development to the north west\", according to the officer\u0027s report to members.\nThose against the proposed extension cited the project to convert the church for \"community use, part funded by developing housing either side of the church\".\nThere was a sense that including the location within the conservation area would be \"a barrier to this development\".\nConversely, there was support for including the trees because they would be better protected from speculative development.\nThe draft proposals will go to the council\u0027s south planning committee for approval. If adopted, all properties within the conservation area will be notied by letter.\nThursday 20 Sep 2018 11:38 AM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117295.jpg","title":"Lack of 999 cover for busy Harley weekend","story":"Gavin Musgrove\n\u0026nbsp\nAVIEMORE was covered by only a single-manned ambulance for most of the Harley Davidson Thunder in the Glens rally, it has emerged.\nIt means that a casualty could be attended to but not taken to Raigmore Hospital in Inverness in the event of an emergency until a second ambulance crew had arrived at the scene.\nIt is understood the village only had an ambulance with single crew rather than double crew available last Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Saturday and Sunday until 5pm.\nThere were an estimated 3000 motorcyclists in the area for the UK\u0027s biggest Harley rally.\nGMB Scotland also said Kingussie only had a single manned crew in operation from just after midnight on Thursday until Sunday morning.\nThe union said the situation is simply not acceptable and poses a real danger.\nAlong with the Strathy, the GMB has been calling for the Scottish Ambulance Service to get rid of the current on-call system and to replace it with 24/7 shts to bring the Aviemore base into line with most other stations in Scotland.\nJohn Marr, GMB branch secretary, said: \"Only a first responder service would have been able to be provided by an ambulance with single crew.\n\"This would have involved looking after the casualty at the location until back up arrived.\n\"We think it is dangerous and we are stepping up our calls on the government to provide the Scottish Ambulance Service with the funds required to give Badenoch and Strathspey the service the area deserves.\n\"At the moment we are going round in circles asking why there is no 24/7 cover despite Aviemore being one of the busiest tourism spots in the whole of Scotland.\n\"We have repeatedly informed the Scottish Ambulance Service that this is a dangerous situation but nothing is happening.\"\nHighland Council convener and local councillor Bill Lobban, said: \"The current level of ambulance cover is clearly completely unacceptable.\n\"Given our population added to the huge number of visitors we see on a daily basis the Scottish Ambulance Service needs to make sure we have sufficient staff on duty to provide a safe and effective service.

10.\n\n\nINADEQUATE\n\n\nBoth MLA\u0027s as well as TUV leader Jim Allister have said will be signing the petition.\nExpressing disappointment, Mr Swann said three petition centres was totally inadequate for a constituency the size of North Antrim, and by restricting the opening hours, the EONI has shown little regard to people in daytime employment,\n\nSUBVERTED\n\n\nMr McGuigan agreed that the EONI decision on venues was extremely disappointing, and simply not good enough.\nHe continued that people\u0027s ability to reject the disgraceful behaviour of Ian Paisley was greatly reduced by this decision after he had accepted lavish family holidays from the Sri Lankan government and lobbyied against a UN resolution about\u0026#160 human rights abuses by the Sri Lankan authorities.\nHe said the UUP would not register as campaigner during the recall petition, but would encourage any North Antrim electors who think what Ian Paisley did was wrong to sign the petition\n

brother\u0027s bone marrow have spoken publicly for the first time.\nA year after seven-year-old Caden Moore received a transplant at Bristol Royal Hospital for Children from his 11-year-old brother Ben their proud mother Sabrina has agreed to share their inspiring story.\nSabrina and her husband Bryan are hoping their unforgettable experiences will encourage others to give blood and sign the Stem Cell and Bone Marrow Register.\nSpeaking exclusively to The Chronicle, teacher Sabrina said: It\u0027s been the toughest year of our lives but what a dference the past 12 months have made no words can ever express how we all felt this time last year.\n\u0026#8220To have two children going through such le-changing procedures in the same hospital, on the same day, is something we could never have imagined. Caden is improving every day and Ben has never looked back. We can\u0027t forget their big sister Kaia who has kept us all smiling.\nThe family\u0027s agony began on June 8 last year when Caden, a pupil at St Brigid\u0027s Primary School, was diagnosed with aplastic anemia, a rare blood disease where bone marrow fails to produce sufficient blood cells.\nSabrina, who has taken time off from her job at Limavady Grammar School to care for Caden, recalled: Bruises started appearing all over his body and Caden was tired, so we knew something wasn\u0027t right.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n         your_name.focus       false     else         your_email.focus       false     else         friends_name.focus       false     else         friends_email.focus       false     else     ]]\n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \"\n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            .src = \u0027/securimage/securimage_show.php?\u0027 + Math.random  false\"\n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVery Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field -

\n            \n\nLord Mayor, Cllr Julie Flaherty attended the launch adding: “The partnership with STA is a fantastic opportunity, and we are very excited to offer a fresh and innovative swim programme incorporating advanced swimming and Junior Leguard courses, as well as increasing grass roots level classes including baby, pre-school and beginner sessions,”\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nThe programme will have very little impact on children currently in lessons. The main area of change will be the names of the lessons from Stanley right through to Shark. \n\nA Progression Chart will be displayed throughout the sites. The change will embrace all areas ensuring a standardised programme is delivered to learners.\n\nLeanne Dougliss, STA’s Interim Sales and Marketing Director added: “We are happy to launch STA’s Swim programme with Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council. Swimming is a vital le skill that all children should be given the opportunity to learn. They have embraced this opportunity to enhance their swim scheme and we are delighted to be able to offer a current, cost-effective, quality programme that is appealing to learners of all ages and abilities. Together we can save lives through the teaching of swimming, first aid and lesaving. I look forward to working with the team to ensure their customers receive the highest quality lessons.”\n\nFor information on the getactiveabc Swim Academy, visit getactiveabc\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8633378.1536767392!/image/image.jpg","title":"international sheepdog trial was a tail wagging success","story":"\nThousands of local, national and international visitors descended on Dromore\u0026#8217s Gill Hall Estate for the International Sheepdog Trial 2018\n\n                \nMore than 600 dogs and 300 top handlers from the UK and Ireland went through their paces to secure a place for the competitive three-day event.

many women are being left traumatised by these implants","story":"\nA Banbridge woman who suffered 12 years of pain after having a vaginal mesh implant fitted is leading the fight for a moratorium on the use of the devices in Northern Ireland.\n\n                \nDrawing on her own painful experience, Jackie Harvey has set up an online support group to offer help and advice to local women about mesh implants, and raise awareness about the complications associated with them.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nJackie Harvey.\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe implants are used by surgeons in an operation to treat pelvic organ prolapse and urinary incontinence, which can be common after childbirth. But following reports of many women being left in agonising pain, there have been calls for the procedure to be banned, or at least suspended until the long-term safety of the implants can be evaluated.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAt the age of 36, a gynaecologist recommended that Jackie have a vaginal mesh implant fitted as a way of alleviating the urinary incontinence problem she’d been left with after having her second child.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nIn March 2005 she underwent surgery and it worked well. She recovered quickly, but unfortunately the plastic implant soon started to cause her problems.\n\n“After a year or two I noticed the tops of my legs were getting really painful and stf and I just thought I must be getting old, though I was only 38 at the time,” she explained.\n\n“I went to doctors ious times about the pain in my legs and got x-rays, but they didn’t really show anything. In 2009 I stopped doing any sort of impact exercise. I couldn’t run. I couldn’t really walk very far without getting pain in my legs, my feet and hips. I kept going back to the doctor and nothing was showing. In 2013 I was really struggling and I went to rheumatologist who told me that I didn’t have arthritis. I went to an orthopaedic consultant who told me he couldn’t see anything wrong with me. And then by 2015 I had seen an article online where a woman called Kath Sansom had started a campaign group called ‘Sling The Mesh’ and she was suffering from very similar complications to me, and it was just like a lightbulb going off in my head - this was 10 years after I’d had it put in.”\n\nJackie, who claims she wasn’t told about the risks so couldn’t make an informed decision about getting the implant, says the pain she suffered as a result of the device ruined 12 years of her le.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“It had a really detrimental impact on my le. I was struggling to walk and I was in pain and exhausted every single day of my le. I felt about 90. I was stf, sore and I just felt ill. For me to go to a doctor and my issues not to be recognised or accepted was just horrendous.” \n\nJackie was referred to a gynaecologist who told her the implant wasn’t causing her problems, but she refused to accept that was the case. She decided she had no other option but to challenge the doctor’s findings, and eventually had to pay for specialist treatment in England.\n\nThe 49-year-old office worker had a scan in London which showed that her implant was in the wrong place and was causing her pain. She finally underwent surgery at a hospital in Oxford in March this year to have her mesh removed.\n\n“As soon as I woke up the dference was amazing,” she said. “I’m still not perfect, but I’m an awful lot better than I was.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThrough the UK-wide ‘Sling The Mesh’ group, Jackie heard many stories of women from Northern Ireland who are suffering similar problems to those she experienced. So, in a bid to help them, she decided to set up her own local support group on Facebook, and it already has around 200 members.\n\n“This is a repeated story across the UK, not just in Northern Ireland,” she continued. “These ladies are going to their surgeons and they are being told ‘It’s not the mesh that’s causing your problems’, or ‘It’s all in your head’. It’s almost like they’re reading off a script.\n\n“These women are in pain, some of them are constantly getting infections, others are on antibiotics every day.\n\n“Their lives are a misery, they have no sex lives, their marriages have broken down, some have lost their jobs, they can’t enjoy their le, it’s just horrendous. That’s what spurred me on to push for some sort of recognition that there is an issue in Northern Ireland and something has to be done.”\n\nWhile the NHS says “the majority of women treated with mesh respond well to the treatment”, it acknowledges that “the Medicines \u0026amp Healthcare products Regulatory Agency  has received reports of complications associated with vaginal meshes - mostly regarding persistent pain, sexual problems, mesh exposure through vaginal tissues and occasionally injury to nearby organs, such as the bladder or bowel.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nJackie, who was the first woman to report her implant to the Northern Ireland Adverse Incident Centre at Stormont, is campaigning for the use of vaginal mesh implants to be suspended.\n\n“In Scotland there was a moratorium put on the use of mesh in 2014, by the Scottish government, and it doesn’t make sense that in the rest of the UK women aren’t afforded the same protection,” she said.\n\n“We want the use of mesh suspended whilst there is a review ongoing. We want the same protection that they have in Scotland. We also want a national register to register how many mesh complications there actually are.\n\n“So many women are being left traumatised by this. They are going to doctors for help and are just basically being fobbed off. It’s appalling. I hear the same story day in, day out from women looking for help and there’s nobody there to help them. Where do these women go for help?

Despite the Troubles shutting down parts of the city, he is determined to play his headline slot in the Harp Bar even  it means playing to an audience of one. It’s here that Terri meets his we Ruth, played by West End star Niamh Perry, and the two try to build their le together, as Terri becomes distracted – all too easily – by trying to passionately promote the latest band to come on the punk scene as he turns promoter for Rudi and The Outcasts.\nIf anyone during Sunday’s afternoon matinee was expecting a leisurely retrospective they were in for a rude awakening as this is a gloriously full-on production of music and song with all-star cast in full, fine voice, all playing instruments and giving it the heap.\nEvery audience member is with our protagonist as he goes across the water, copious copies of seven-inch vinyl under his arm as he tries, most of the time in vain, to try and get snooty English music executives to listen to a band from Derry called The Undertones and their debut song Teenage Kicks – a song so iconic that John Peel did the unthinkable and played it twice on Radio One.\nWith every high comes the inevitable low and we witness how Terri releases the band from the Good Vibrations label for “£500 and a signed copy of a Shangri-Las record”.\nWith a marriage falling apart, mounting debts at the record shop and next to no revenue, a fundraising concert at the Ulster Hall sets the scene for the rousing finale and our lead’s poignant rendition of Sonny Bono’s Laugh At Me.\nA standing ovation gave way to the ‘national anthem’ as the raw opening bars of Teenage Kicks started up and the audience sang every line back to the cast.\nGood Vibrations is a must-see – simple as that. The amount of energy fizzing off the stage is infectious and the cast of ten are exceptional. A transfer to the West End must surely follow.\n\n\nGood Vibrations runs at the Lyric Theatre until Saturday, October 6.

He is genuine in his belief that nobody should be isolated or victimised because of their sexual orientation.\n\n\"While I share his sympathetic outlook, I simply don\u0027t agree that iding people into categories does anyone any good. True equality doesn\u0027t care about labels.\"\n\nThe motion, proposed by Alliance councillors Gavin Walker and Andrew Muir at a corporate affairs committee meeting, passed by six votes to five, and now needs to be ratied at a full council meeting next Wednesday. \n\nMr Graham said that while he too wanted to see \"a unied borough where everyone was respected\", he didn\u0027t believe identity politics was the way to achieve it.\n\nHe also slammed the timing of the vote, which comes less than three months after Arlene Foster attended a Pink News event in Stormont. \n\n\"This is an attempt to drive a wedge between people after Arlene reached out to the LGBT+ community,\" he claimed. \n\nHe said the Alliance Party of today was far removed from its \"past desire\" to bring people together. \n\n\"The party used to be about uniting the community and removing isions but now they are committed to exploiting dferences and bringing about some kind of apartheid based on sexuality,\" he said. \n\nIt is not the first time that Mr Smith has broken ranks with his party on the issue. In 2017 he expressed support for PSNI officers participating in the Belfast Pride parade for the first time. \n\nPosting on Twitter, he also disclosed he had gay friends who had not disclosed their sexuality out of fear of the \"persecution and abuse\" they will face. \n\nThe DUP\u0027s Robert Gibson, who missed the committee due to a family commitment, refused to indicate which way he intended voting. \"I was not at the meeting or part of the debate, so I am not willing to comment,\" he said. Mr Smith could not be reached for comment, and the DUP did not respond to questions.\n\nUlster Unionist Mark Brooks, a gay councillor in Ards and North Down, voted in favour of the proposal.\n\nHe said: \"Councillor Smith is one of two \u0027ersity champions\u0027 on the council and it would have been a surprise  he had voted against the motion given his previous work in that area.\n\n\"DUP leader Arlene Foster made comments about embracing ersity and reaching out, and that\u0027s something I\u0027ve known councillor Smith to do.\n\n\"I can\u0027t comment on the other DUP members who voted against.

He was informed of the result by text message.\n\nThe petition of recall process opened after Mr Paisley was given a 30-sitting day ban from the Commons - the longest on record for any MP.\n\nA parliamentary watchdog found in August that a year after receiving luxury holidays, Mr Paisley lobbied then prime minister David Cameron not to support a UN probe into alleged Sri Lankan human rights abuses.\n\nAs well as not declaring the holidays, the MP was found to have broke Commons lobbying rules.\n\nThree centres were opened in North Antrim for the last six weeks to give voters the opportunity to sign the petition. Constituents were also able to put their name to the petition by post.\n\nChief Electoral Officer Virginia McVea declared the results on Thursday morning just after 1am.\n\nMs McVea communicated the outcome to Speaker John Bercow\u0027s office before announcing it at the electoral office\u0027s Belfast headquarters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\" title=\"The recall petition was triggered by Ian Paisley’s suspension from the House of Commons \" width=\"620\" height=\"413\" /\n\n\" title=\"The recall petition was triggered by Ian Paisley’s suspension from the House of Commons \" width=\"620\" height=\"413\" /\n\n\n\n\nThe recall petition was triggered by Ian Paisley’s suspension from the House of Commons \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The petition has not been successful,\" she said.\n\nIn a statement to the Press Association, Mr Paisley said the “electorate had spoken”.\n\n“In July I apologised for a mistake made almost six years ago.”\n\n“The electorate was asked to pass judgment. 90.6% have accepted my apology.\n\n“The electorate has clearly spoken.\n\n“I would like to thank my true friends, family, the electorate who have stood by me with unwavering support.

By Tue, however, we should see some settled weather arrive across the UK as we move onto the southern side of the jet stream \n#jetstream\n \npic.twitter/47IvAK7bek\n\n— Met Office  \nSeptember 19, 2018\n\n\n\n\nUp to 100mm of rain is forecast to fall across high ground in Wales and Cumbria.\n\nMet Office meterologist Laura Paterson said: “Through Thursday another area of low pressure will develop and approach the UK from the south west, bringing rain and a second spell of strong winds later.”\n\nThe unsettled weather is due to last the rest of the week and is caused by a jet stream from Canada, the Met Office said.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"10 pretty awesome portraits made","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

The group is calling for cast iron solutions at the Autumn summit.\n\nFounder Tanya McCamphill said: “Two years after the referendum on exiting the European Union there still is no agreed solution to prevent borders on the island of Ireland or down the Irish Sea.\n\n“It is widely recognised that a hard border in Ireland or down the Irish Sea would cause signicant social, economic and political challenges, yet still there is no agreed solution. \n\n“Our campaign reflects a growing anxiety that our way of le is under threat. For us, the issue of Brexit borders is much greater than trade or economics. It\u0027s about the lives of ordinary people - people who live day to day with the realities which politics imposes.\n\n\"We are in London asking for help to wake up those with power to the realities of the human cost of Brexit borders.\"\n\nThe group is opposed to any borders on the island of Ireland or down the Irish Sea and represents a cross-section of the community in the city who are becoming increasingly anxious that the voices of people from Northern Ireland are not being heard at the Brexit negotiating table.\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot = googletag.defineSlot                .defineSizeMapping                                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                                    .addService            googletag.display            googletag.pubads.refresh            \n\n\n\nThey will call on political leaders to ensure that the fears and concerns of all peoples are heard, and that an agreement at the EU Autumn Summit will ensure no hard borders are imposed after Brexit takes effect.\n\nMs McCamphill added: “We hear a lot of rhetoric and promises that there will be no hard border. In spite of that we have been given no cast iron solutions. We cannot be expected to just allow people to put their lives on hold and wait worrying about their futures.\n\n“For a long time we have been able to move freely from Derry to Donegal, Armagh to Louth, Belfast to Edinburgh, London to Dublin and so on. A hard border in the Irish Sea or in Ireland will impact on everyone’s freedom and the increasingly good relations that we have been fostering across these islands.\n\n“Derry Girls Against Borders want to empower the people who will be affected and we are not prepared to sit back in the hope that a solution will be reached. The impact of Brexit borders on our lives is much bigger than trade and economics. It’s about the emotional, psychological impact also and the signicant challenges any change will pose to our way of le. Where we come from things are complex, they are delicate and they require thoughtfulness. That thoughtfulness requires engagement and it requires listening to those who will be affected. \n\n“The freedoms and flexibilities we currently have protect our way of le, they protect the shared sense of belonging people right across our communities have. We do not believe that those concerns are part of the debate yet and they must be in order to achieve a satisfactory solution.\n\n“All we are asking is to be heard - and for those right across these islands to help us be heard. You don’t have to be from Derry - or be a girl - you just have to care. Help us, make them listen and stop Brexit borders.”\n\nTo sign the Derry Girls Against Borders petition on change.org, click here: \nhttps:www.change.org/p/dublin-london-belfast-and-brussels-hear-our-voices-and-stop-brexit-borders\n\nTo follow the campaign on social media: Twitter: @DerryGirlsAB Facebook: \nwww.facebook/DerryGirls\n Instagram: @derrygirlsagainstborders\n\n\nPictured above: A cross section of those who have shared their stories with Derry Girls Against Borders on how a Brexit border here will adversely affect their lives.\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"derry public urged stay safe high winds heavy showers continue","story":"\nA local councillor has urged people to take all necessary precautions as the stormy weather continues.\n\nSinn Féin Councillor Kevin Campbell  has advised the Derry public to heed the current amber weather warning issued by the Met Office.\n\nIt comes after trees and hoardings and roof tiles have blown down across the city.\n\n\"I would urge caution as driving conditions will be dangerous at times and rail, air and ferry services may be affected.  There is also the possibility of longer journey times and cancellations are possible,\" he said.\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot = googletag.defineSlot                .defineSizeMapping                                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                                    .addService            googletag.display            googletag.pubads.refresh            \n\n\n\n“All road users should take extra care of loose debris and be mindful that tree falls and some structural damage are possible.\n\n“Power cuts may occur, and I would advise members of the public to report any damage to poles or electricity lines immediately and to stay clear.\n\n“People should keep informed about the weather and act to protect yourself and your home from the effects of flooding and high winds, and importantly to heed safety warnings.”\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"love island star touch derry beauty event foyleside shopping centre later month","story":"\nOn Saturday 29th September, Love Island 2018 favourite, Alexandra Cane will visit the North West’s premier shopping destination, Foyleside Shopping Centre, as the popular retail mecca hosts its fashion and beauty extravaganza of the year.

However that didn\u0026rsquot faze him as he lined up in front of the live ITV4 cameras.\n\nHe stormed past championship leader Zamparelli on the opening lap to grab fourth place, before posting the fastest lap of the race sas he began to close in on the podium battle and pile the pressure on George Gamble ahead.\n\nSome robust defending from Gamble saw Harper forced onto the grass on a couple of occasions, but he was able to find his way past heading into Copse corner on the penultimate lap to take third position, which he held through to the finish.\n\nA time penalty for the driver ahead though ensured the Dromore High School student ended the weekend with a second place finish as part of a superb one-two-three finish for the JTR team, with the result putting Harper just one point shy of fourth in the championship standings.\n\nHarper said afterwards: \u0026ldquoI feel I\u0026rsquom really in my groove in the series now and I\u0026rsquom going to be giving it everything to try and continue our great pace and end the year in style at Brands Hatch GP, a circuit I love.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch woman’s invite to join charity Twilight Walk  ","story":"\t\t\t\nBALLYNAHINCH woman Rosalind Steenson is urging people to join her on the forthcoming Marie Curie Twilight Walk to raise funds for the leading cancer charity.\n\nThe event \u0026mdash which takes place on Friday, September 28 at 7.30pm \u0026mdash will be held in the beautul grounds of Barnett Demesne in South Belfast to raise funds for an organisation which provides care to people with a terminal illness in their own homes or in one of its nine hospices.\u0026nbsp\n\nThe charity is also a leader in research into the best ways of caring for people with a terminal illness and all the\u0026nbsp\n\nservices it provides are free of charge, with around 70% of its income coming via donations with the balance of funds provided by the NHS.\n\nThose taking part in the forthcoming Twilight Walk can expect much more than just a walk as there will be a festival atmosphere with music, entertainment and a spectacular firework display to finish off.\n\nPeople take part in the walk for all sorts of reasons, with a large proportion walking in memory of someone they have lost.\u0026nbsp\n\nRosalind will be remembering her best friend of over 30 years, Michelle Watterson, who died in the Marie Curie Hospice in Belfast in July.\n\n\u0026ldquoMichelle was diagnosed with cancer for the second time three years ago and, unfortunately, it spread to other parts of her body and became terminal, she explained.\n\n\u0026ldquoShe spent her final ten days at the hospice where she received exceptional care.

Even  you start out walking by yourself, you are never alone along the Camino.\n\nThe Camino Portugues, or the Portuguese Way, spans from Lisbon to Santiago de Compostela, the final destination being St James\u0026rsquo Church, where the body of St James is said to lay.\n\nIt travels through the province of Galicia in northern Spain, going through the cities of Porto and Pontevedra and along the coastline of Sanxenxo, the Cies Islands, and Baiona.\n\nWhile this Camino way was shorter that the more arduous Camino Del Norte throughout the northern Basque area of Spain, Edmund said that there were other challenges.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoThe biggest challenge was walking in extreme heat, said Edmund. \u0026ldquoIt was 38 degrees on one day but for the rest of the days it was around 28 degrees. Staying hydrated was also a challenge.\n\nEdmund also enjoys the feeling of having to travel from one hostel to another with just the bare basics, as he says it gives him an understanding of what le is like for those with transitory lestyles.\n\nHowever, he adds: \u0026ldquoThere\u0026rsquos a great togetherness and camaraderie as everyone is doing it together.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"First look inside new £16m Down Leisure Centre with ‘wow factor’  ","story":"\t\t\t\nTHE new \u0026pound16m Down Leisure Centre, which opens its doors to the public in November, has the wow factor those closely involved in its design always promised it would have.\n\nWhile very much a community facility, the ultra-modern and futuristic three-storey building boasts a stunning range of facilities which would rival any of those more commonly found in leisure complexes attached to five star hotels.\n\nWhile the finishing touches are being put to the 6,500 square metre, three-storey Market Street building, the Down Recorder was last week given a sneak preview of the stunning new centre that has been a long time coming.\u0026nbsp\n\nPlans for the new complex were first discussed well over a decade ago and despite raised eyebrows about building the centre in front of the ageing facility it will replace, everything has gone smoothly with council officials delighted they now have a leisure complex that will be the envy of many.\u0026nbsp\n\nThey are confident that once the centre opens its doors to the public, people will recognise the long wait for a new leisure complex has been worth it, with the new vitality suite on the top floor which boasts a sauna, steam room and small pool with its own mini fountain, particularly stunning.\n\nThe spacious and airy entrance foyer opens up to reveal two swimming pools, one of which has a moveable floor. There is a reception, lobby area and ground floor studio with Newry, Mourne and Down Council\u0026rsquos corporate colours a recurring theme throughout the building.\n\nThere are dedicated changing facilities on the ground floor with the pools designed for use by people of all abilities. The smaller of the two pools measures eight metres by 13, while the main 25-metre pool boats six lanes and electronic touch pads to time races.\n\nThroughout the building, every effort has been made to flood it with as much natural light as possible which helps provide the centre with its imposing look. A boccia court designed for use by disabled bowlers is also located on the ground floor, with this particular area also doubling up as a dance studio and multipurpose hall.\n\nCouncil officials have also revealed the new centre\u0026rsquos ground floor level is higher than the main road outside to protect the building from future flooding that may occur in this part of the town and which was a signicant problem a number of years ago.\n\nModern sound proofing techniques have been deployed throughout the building, particularly in the swimming pool and main hall areas. When the natural light fades,\u0026nbsp subtle, state-of-the-art LED lighting illuminates the building, adding to its unique character.\n\nMains gas was connected to the building which also boasts a combined heat and power source which helps minimise its carbon footprint with photovoltaic cells on the roof helping heat the water in the pools and shower systems across a number of changing room areas. In addition, air source heat pumps sucks in cold air from the outside and turns into warm air.\n\nSo-called ocalux glass allows natural light to stream into the building on the ground floor, also reducing glare and preventing people from outside looking in.\n\nThere are miles of pipework and electric cables with the plant room \u0026mdash the new leisure complex\u0026rsquos nerve centre \u0026mdash resembling something akin to the interior of a futuristic space ship.\n\nThe impressive four court hall on the first floor can be used for a iety of sports, including badminton, basketball and five-a-side football. One of the walls has also been specially marked at the request of the Down Handball Club.\u0026nbsp\n\nAs with the ground floor swimming pools, there is also a dedicated viewing area over the main hall, while nearby there is a dedicated area for racquet ball and handball.\n\nA spin studio and multi-purpose area are also located on the second floor, with all music and sound systems built in and controlled from the main reception area.\n\nThe third floor boasts spectacular views across to Down Cathedral, the Dromara Hills, the Mournes and across Dunleath Park towards the Vianstown area.\n\nWhen not admiring the views, users can immerse themselves in getting fit or pampering themselves in the vitality suite. The third floor boasts an 85-station fitness suite and fitness room that can be hired by sports clubs to use. Council officials say the use of the top floor will evolve over time and has the capacity to respond to need.\n\nEach of the eight beams which hold the top floor in place weigh 35 tonnes and had to be put in place overnight as part of a military-style operation which involved heavy lting gear and went without a hitch.\n\nThe vitality area extenuates the wow factor, featuring a relaxation pool alongside steam and sauna rooms, with the careful attention to detail in the design process accentuating this particular area where people can relax and unwind. There is also a dedicated lt to take people from the swimming pool area directly to the top floor.\n\nCouncil director Michael Lipsett said the new leisure centre was top of his in-tray when he joined the local authority eight years ago.\n\nSince then, he has attended countless meetings to propel the scheme forward and is delighted ratepayers will soon have an opportunity to use a centre which the district can be justiably be very proud of.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe long wait has been worth it and this is a fantastic building which I have no doubt people will appreciate and enjoy. It will also be a pleasure for our leisure staff to move to a modern building.\n\nMr Lipsett added: \u0026ldquoI have watched the building grow from the drawing board and to finally see it nearly complete is really something else. Everyone associated with the building, from the designers to the builders and the councillors who supported it financially deserve credit.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoTheir collective efforts have produced a magnicent building that would not be out of place in the private sector. That\u0026rsquos how good this building is.\n\nOnce staff move in and the old leisure complex has been decommissioned, it will be bulldozed to provide a major new car park at the rear. Ahead of the opening, council officials plan to organise a series of visits to provide the public with a glimpse of the spectacular new 21st century leisure centre.\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C September 19%2C 1978  ","story":"\t\t\t\nDOWNPATRICK \u0026mdash Downpatrick\u0026rsquos old town hall is to be turned into a training centre for out of work teenagers in an exciting \u0026pound500,000 initiative to combat the district\u0026rsquos growing youth unemployment problem.\n\nWork has already begun on clearing the hall and the centre is to expected to be fully operational by January next year with room for up to 30 trainees. Organised by a newly named community group \u0026mdash Lecale Training Workshops Ltd \u0026mdash the scheme will cater for young people between the ages of 16 and 19.\n\nLatest unemployment figures put the total number out of work in that age group in Down district at almost 500. The aim\u0026nbsp\n\nbehind the new centre is to give them work experience and provide them with basic skills in a iety of jobs.\n\nThe idea for the new community group is the brainchild of Mr Bill Hampton, of Down District Trades Union Council. Lending a hand is Downpatrick man Mr Malachi Curran, who is head of the Department of Manpower Services in Northern Ireland.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe whole idea has ben introduced to help young people who have been unemployed to prepare for work, Mr Curran said. \u0026ldquoIt isn\u0026rsquot an apprenticeship, but rather is aimed at teaching them basic skills and perhaps helping them choose the type of career they want to follow.\n\nMr Curran said that they hoped to be able to put anything up to 250 young people through the course inside five years.\n\nCLOUGH \u0026mdash The death toll on a road outside Clough climbed to five in three years when a young motorcyclist was killed on Sunday. He was 19 year-old Andrew Stephen Martin, of Ascot Park in Belfast.\n\nMr Martin was involved in a head-on collision with a car at a spot known as the Rectory on the Ballykinlar-Clough Road. The accident happened at approximately 2pm and Mr Martin died about two hours later in Downe Hospital.\n\nThe driver of the car, who was a soldier based at Ballykinlar camp, was taken to the Downe, but was later transferred to the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast suffering from severe facial injuries.\n\nMr Frank Greeves, a local lorry driver, told the Recorder that it one of the most dangerous bends he had ever seen. He asked: \u0026ldquoHow many more lives have to be lost before something is done?\n\nA DoE spokesman said there were no plans to carry out work on the road.\n\nSTRANGFORD \u0026mdash A party of 130 mentally and physically handicapped children and young adults went cruising on Strangford Lough free of charge on Tuesday \u0026mdash courtesy of the Downpatrick Division of the DoE Roads Service.\n\nThe group\u0026rsquo aged between 12 and 25, came from the Downpatrick area and were accompanied by parents and volunteers. They left Strangford in the morning on the MV Portaferry to explore wildle and points of interest on the lough.\n\nThe idea of the cruise originated with the staff of the Downpatrick Roads Division who realised that the ferry \u0026mdash often used for educational and pleasure cruises by many groups \u0026mdash was also ideally suited for use by handicapped people because of its ramps and high sides.\n\nThe crew for the outing worked their rest day without payment and the other overheads for running the boat were written off by the DoE as normal test running. Ready Mix concrete stepped in to provide refreshments.\n\nMr Ray Carter, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State and Minister with responsibility for the DoE, was there to see the children off on their cruise.\n\n\u0026ldquoThis a fine and warming gesture by the crews of the ferries to give up their free time. I know to look at the happy faces around me that their kindness is very well received.\n\nKILLYLEAGH \u0026mdash A scheme to turn Killyleagh harbour into a boat and leisure centre has proved to be the straw which broke the back of a group of local residents. Already 104 residents have signed a petition against the scheme which has received outline planning permission.\n\nPut forward by Mr Robert Morrow, a local coal merchant and businessman, it sets out his hopes to construct pontoon jetties, a clubhouse, toilet block, bar, restaurant, chandlery, workshop and car parking spaces.\n\nThe residents, while believing that there is an urgent need for the harbour to be brought up to an acceptable standard, feel that the scheme falls short of that is required and that it is likely to have a \u0026ldquomost undesirable impact on the residential area surrounding the site.\n\nRATHMULLAN \u0026mdash The Rathmullan Mound is to stay \u0026mdash or at least the best part of it is. After four months of intensive archaeological digging, experts have ruled that the Mound is too valuable to be removed, though they have taken away the top section.\n\nBut although the Department of the environment has put a protection order on the site it will not be taking the Mound into public ownership in the way it has done with other ancient monuments.\n\nThat decision is expected to anger local historians and Down councillors, who have been battling to save the monument from demolition and who have called for it to be taken into public charge.\n\nThe Mound is a rath dating back to early Christian times, with evidence of five dferent settlements from 700 AD to the 16th century. The top section, which is Norman, has been removed, though all of the archaeologist\u0026rsquos findings have been carefully preserved.\n\nOne of the most exciting discoveries was a large souterrain, or underground passage. This 1,000 year-old chamber was used by early inhabitants of the area and is still as perfect in parts as it was when it was first built.\n\nBALLYGOWAN \u0026mdash Female wrestling comes to Ballygowan in a big way tonight when Blackfoot Sue takes the ring at The Squire\u0026rsquos Inn.\n\nThe shapely wrestler from the USA gets to grips with another lady grappler, Manchester\u0026rsquos Miss Lena. The bout is sure to be the star attraction at this initial venture by the Ballygowan night spot.\n\nBut several other star bouts are on the programme, including world middleweight champion Adrian Street, Prince Jitsu and Bruce McDonald.\n\nARDGLASS \u0026mdash Hugh Duggan, the newly appointed progressional at Ardglass Golf Club, took up his position at the seaside club on Monday. Twenty four year-old Hugh, formerly attached to Kirkistown Castle Golf Club, becomes only the second professional golfer appointed to the club in its 84-year history.\n\nHis appointment, combined with many other improvements both on and off the course, has made Ardglass one of the most progressive clubs in Co Down.\n\nBALLYNAHINCH \u0026mdash Ballynahinch piper Ian Jess took second place in the All-Ireland solo piping championships at Banbridge Technical College on Saturday.\n\nIan was placed second in the march section and third in the reel and strathspey section, but had to be content to finish runner-up behind Tom Anderson, from Dublin.\n\nIan is tutored by Joe McAdam, the pipe major at Ballynahinch, and is now regarded as one of the best pipers in the country.\n\nKILMORE \u0026mdash A former pupil of Down High School has obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Lancaster. He is John James McIlhone, from Kilmore, Crossgar, who graduated with a second class honours BA ision one in history.\n\nIn the junior section Richard Parkes, of Field Marshal Montgomery, came out on top.\n\nSAINTFIELD \u0026mdash A woman was taken to hospital on Saturday night after two cars were involved in an accident on the Crossgar Road, Saintfield.

This was the product of gathering together his late father\u0026rsquos copious notes on the history of the town.\n\nThe society\u0026rsquos other founding members included Mr Robert Brown, an agent for Dunleath Estates who was treasurer, Down County Council official Mr Robert Maxwell, who was secretary, and the Rev John Radclfe, who was chairman.\n\nOther society members included other local clergy, headmasters, representatives of professions and local businesses and iniduals who were interested in local history.\n\nThe first meeting took place in Denvir\u0026rsquos Hotel where it continued to meet every month for several decades. At this meeting the objects of the Society were outlined \u0026ndash to encourage and foster interest in the history and traditions of Downpatrick and County Down, music, arts and sciences and the architecture of buildings and monuments of historic or artistic value in the area.\n\nThe following day\u0026rsquos Down Recorder reported that Mr Parkinson gave the first lecture of The Downe Society, fittingly on the subject, The Story of Downpatrick, in which he spoke about man reaching Ireland some seven thousand years ago, through to the ravages of the Norsemen, De Courcy and the Normans, the Fitzgeralds, Cromwells, Southwells and into the eighteen century.\u0026nbsp\n\nHis closing words were on the urban administration of the day with a sense of the historic past and the hope of future well-being.\u0026nbsp\n\nIn 1948, the formation of the Society was a signicant attempt to bring together people from all sections of the community, particularly across the religious ide. Both The Downe Society, and its later partner, the Lecale Historical Society, maintained a proud non-sectarian record.\u0026nbsp\n\nOver the years, the society hosted many outstanding speakers including a Lord Chief Justice, local author Lynn C.

His greeting at a youth Mass in Galway where he declared \u0026lsquoyoung people of Ireland, I love you\u0026rsquo became a stand out moment, replayed on television on countless occasions since. My own childhood involved attending Mass at the Graan and serving as an altar boy in St Michael\u0026rsquos Church in Enniskillen with many of my primary school classmates. We were lucky too that for much of my childhood our pastoral leadership was led by Father Brian D\u0026rsquoArcy who preached a message of tolerance, ersity in the church, compassion for the complexities of le and the experiences that shape them. Even when a stream of disturbing disclosures arose that challenged the Church and its response to clerical abuse and coverup, Father Brian\u0026rsquos consistently strong and unequivocal demand for accountability, truth, justice and recovery for victims offered a pathway for the institutional church to remain connected with its members.\n  My own le journey took me to Dublin in 1999 and what I discovered very quickly was that the message of compassion, openness and truth that I had faithfully followed and listened to every Sunday did not reflect the views and actions of the hierarchy either in Ireland or in the Vatican. Like many people of faith I found this not just challenging but chilling.\u0026nbsp\n  As I embarked on a legal career in human rights law I spent many days hearing story after story of adults recalling their experiences of abuse and brutal actions at the hands of clergy and lay people at the Residential Institutions Redress Board.\u0026nbsp\n  Those stories will never leave me. Sine then, the full impact of church and state abuse has come through my office door clerical sexual abuse, church authority cover ups, Magdalene laundries, the cruel operation of mother and baby homes, where many single mothers lost their babies to a regime of illegal adoptions and told they had committed a mortal sin. We have been witness to church intolerance towards lone parents, women, advocates of shared education, access to certain healthcare services, separated couples and the LGBT community.\n  And so when I was given a ticket to the Pope\u0026rsquos Mass last weekend I thought long and hard about attending. I could see that for many people of faith this was an opportunity to gather as a church community and celebrate their faith, their God and their Christianity.\u0026nbsp\n  On the other hand I could see that for many victims of the Church the Pope\u0026rsquos visit resurrected those deep seated and enduring feelings of hurt, trauma and damage that has never been properly addressed with actions.\u0026nbsp\n  So many victims have said to me that the abuse itself is not nearly as bad as the culture of cover up, the systemic efforts to sideline and disbelieve victims, to hide evidence and wrongdoers from a process that would lead to truth, justice and love for the victim and their families.\u0026nbsp\n  So I ended up last Sunday foregoing the papal Mass and standing for truth with nearly 10,000 other citizens in Dublin City Centre. It was a personal choice. I am glad now I made that choice. I am sad that the Vatican and the leadership of the Church still don\u0026rsquot get it. Still don\u0026rsquot acknowledge that abuse wasn\u0026rsquot simply perpetrated on children by inidual wrongdoers but that their many violations were facilitated, covered up and enabled by Bishops, Archbishops and Cardinals all the way to the Vatican.\n  Ireland has changed utterly since 1979. It is reflected in all the societal changes that have taken place in the last thirty nine years. It is reflected in the fact that the people of Dublin were much more interested and welcoming of the Queen than the Pope.\u0026nbsp\n  It turns out that Pope John Paul was wrong when he said back in 1979 that he loved the young people of Ireland. The Church showed anything but love to all those they have hurt and damaged.\u0026nbsp\n  They have even now showed a lamentable lack of capacity to lead, to acknowledge, to take ownership of their failings and to take actions rather than deliver honeyed words. This visit was a massive opportunity to reverse the damage caused. The opportunity has been missed.\n                                    \n                \n                \n                \n                    \nThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisation\u0027s Editors\u0027 Code of Practice.

This year the RUAS are delighted to welcome Paul Trapp, who is travelling from Wisconsin, USA, to judge. The event is also a great chance to interact with 200 dairy related trade exhibitors on the most relevant technological advances, dficulties and solutions in the industry. \u0026nbsp\n  Rhonda Geary, Operations Director, RUAS said: \u0026ldquo2015 saw the move of Winter Fair to our new purpose built exhibition venue, Eikon Exhibition Centre at Balmoral Park. The move has worked brilliantly and attracted one of the largest attendances to date. In preparation for the 31st Winter Fair we have increased the livestock accommodation and now have stalling, washing and milking facilities for 200 cattle. There is 4750m2 of exhibition space and a full house of 200 trade stands. \u0026nbsp\n  During the Winter Fair there is a busy Seminar Suite with talks presented every half hour from 11am until 3.30pm.\n  Dr. John Bailey from AFBI will speak about better phosphorous management, Bobby Irwin of United Feeds presents a paper on getting the lactation to the right start and Roberta Simmons of the YFCU and Barclay Bell, President of the UFU will speak about succession on farms.\n  CAFRE\u0026rsquos Martin Mulholland will be advising on feed efficiency this winter, making optimum use of grass silage \u0026nbspwhile Christopher Osborne form the UFU will speak about dairy commodity markets and the prospects for 2017.\n  Dr. Sam Strain and Sharon Verner from the Animal Health and Welfare Northern Ireland will look at improved biosecurity and BVD while Jessica Sloss from Red Tractor, speaks about the farm assurance scheme.\n  The live calf rearing demonstration will be making a  for the 2016 Show. \u0026nbspGorteade Cow Care owned by Barry O\u0026rsquoLoughlin will be displaying a fully ing calf igloo with veranda and Heatwave ad lib calf feeder.\u0026nbsp\n  One of the innovative technological features at next week\u0026rsquos Winter Fair will be the Northern Ireland launch of the CalfApp and Calf Cloud by Volac which won gold at Eurotier in Hannover. It gives information about changes in drinking pattern and fluid intakes and monitors calf health.\n  The launch of the Winter Fair was held at Draynes Farm, near Lisburn, where Michael Drayne led a tour of agricultural journalists and industry representatives around his farm and milk bottling plant. The milk botting plant began when his father began with a horse and cart. Now the business has a fleet of vans distributing milk and dairy produces to customers in four counties. However their products are supplied to customers across Ireland through the Henderson Food Service and other companies.\n  The borehole gives Draynes Farm a constant supply of water which is also useful to soften the mains water for washing.\n  A 50KVA solar panel plant has been installed on the roofs of some of the buildings.\n  Draynes Farm processes 5m litres of milk per year and operates Monday to Friday with their own supply of 1.2 million litres of farm milk held over the weekend until the beginning of a new week. A total of 35 staff are employed in all departments.\n  The Draynes Farm dairy herd uses three Lely Astronaut A4 milking robots. The cows visit the robots on average 3.1 times per day averaging 33 litres per day with some exceeding 50litres. Cows grazed outdoors using a Lely Grazeway \u0026nbsp\n                                    \n                \n                \n                \n                    \nThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisation\u0027s Editors\u0027 Code of Practice.
